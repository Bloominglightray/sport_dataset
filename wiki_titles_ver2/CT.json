        "text": "Robert Walker (born June 26, 1972) is a former American football running back for the West Virginia Mountaineers. Walker is most remembered for his game-winning run against Miami in 1993.\nCollegiate career.\nWalker came to West Virginia in 1992 as a freshman. Walker sat as third-string running back most of that season, behind star Adrian Murrell and backup Jon Jones.\nHis best season came in 1993, his sophomore year. With Murrell graduated and moved on to the pros, Walker assumed the starting role. Walker assumed the role better than anyone expected, as the Mountaineers went undefeated for the second time in school history. Their streak was almost broken on the second to last game of the season, against #4 Miami. The Hurricanes had the lead, 14-10, late in the fourth quarter. In front of a school-record 70,222 fans at home, Robert Walker scored on a run to the sideline to win the game for the Mountaineers and preserve the undefeated season. West Virginia did not make it to the national championship, instead the Sugar Bowl against Florida. The Mountaineers lost to the Gators, 41-7. Walker rushed for 1,250 yards and 11 touchdowns on the season, with a 5.8 average yardage per carry total.\nThe Mountaineers went 7-6 in Walker's junior season of 1994, with Walker's statistics slowly declining. He rushed for 749 yards, but only one touchdown on the season.\nIn Walker's final season as a Mountaineer, 1995, his totals began to decrease even more. He did have four touchdowns on the season, but only 508 yards on the year.\nHe was on the New York Giants practise squad in 1996 and was signed as an emergency free agent late in the season to cover injuries to the first string running backs. He played in one NFL game, but had no carries."

        "text": "This is a list of Kent County Cricket Club List A cricket records; that is, record team and individual performances in List A cricket for Kent County Cricket Club. List A cricket is a limited overs form of cricket usually played over one day.\nKent played their first List A match in the 1963 domestic season against Sussex in the 1963 Gillette Cup at the Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells. The county have competed in List A competitions in every season since 1963 and, as of February 2018, have played just over 1,000 List A matches, including against representative and touring international sides. In January and February 2017 they competed in the 2016–17 Regional Super50, the List A competition of the West Indies domestic season. This was the first time that any English county had competed in an overseas domestic competition. Kent competed again in the competition in 2018.\nThe county have won 11 domestic List A competitions, most recently the 2022 Royal London One-Day Cup. Long serving spin bowler Derek Underwood holds the record for most List A appearances for Kent with 377 matches played for the county between 1963 and 1987.\nTeam records.\n\"All records last updated 1 August 2023\"\nHighest partnerships.\nThe highest partnership for Kent was 241 runs for the 2nd wicket between Trevor Ward and Aravinda de Silva made against Surrey at Canterbury in 1995 in a 40 over match.\nIndividual batting records.\nOver 100 players have scored a century for Kent in List A cricket since the county began competing in this form of cricket in 1963. The first century for Kent was made by Colin Cowdrey against Suffolk in the 1966 Gillette Cup. Chris Tavaré, Robert Key, Martin van Jaarsveld and Joe Denly have all scored eight centuries in their Kent careers.\nThe highest individual score for Kent is 206 not out made by Ollie Robinson in the 2022 Royal London One-Day Cup against Worcestershire in August 2022 at New Road, Worcester. This is the only double century to be scored by a Kent player in List A matches and surpassed the previous highest score of 150 not out made by Joe Denly in the 2018 Royal London One-Day Cup against Glamorgan in May 2018 at Canterbury. Denly in turn had surpassed the innings of 147 made by Darren Stevens in the previous year's competition and Andrew Symonds' score of 146 in the 2004 National League.\nIndividual bowling records.\nLong serving spin bowler Derek Underwood dominates Kent bowling records in List A cricket, leading the county in wickets taken and, with 530 wickets, is the only player with more than 400 wickets for Kent. Underwood also has the best bowling figures in Kent List A history, with Alan Dixon taking the second best figures for the county, and took five wickets in an innings eight times. Three players have taken hat-tricks for Kent in List A cricket, Richard Ellison, Martin McCague and, most recently in 2015, Matt Coles."

For example, in just his second year in the minors, he walked 138 batters in only 131 innings of work. Used mostly as a starter in the minors, he posted ERAs over 6 in two seasons, and he walked over 100 batters four times. Clark's best season in the minors came in 1979, in which he went 14–5 with a 2.64 ERA in 23 starts. However, he still walked 112 batters in 167 innings of work.\nAlthough his minor league statistics were not too impressive, Clark still managed to make his major league debut on April 11, 1981, at the age of 24 against the California Angels. Although he was technically a pitcher, he was used in a rather unorthodox way in his debut - the Mariners (who purchased him from the Pirates in 1978) used him as a pinch runner.\nClark spent the rest of his career trying to find his niche. He was used both as a starter and reliever throughout his career, with his best season being , when he went 5–2 with a 2.75 ERA in 37 games (five starts). This season included his only complete game shutout, on September 25, 1982, against the Blue Jays. In the game, Clark gave up six hits, walked one, and struck out two.\nOn December 8, , Clark was traded from the Mariners to the Blue Jays for Barry Bonnell. His control issues were demonstrated on August 19, 1983, against the Cleveland Indians. In just innings of work, Clark managed to walk seven batters while allowing three earned runs. He earned a no-decision in Toronto's 6–5 loss. Clark finished his only season as a Blue Jay with a 1–2 record and a 5.91 ERA in 20 games (three starts).\nClark played his final game on May 30, 1990, with the Mariners, who had reacquired him in December 1989.\nFor his career, Clark posted a 20–23 record with a 4.15 ERA in 516.1 innings of work, walking 261 and striking out 259. He was sixth in the American League in wild pitches in 1981 with seven, and fourth in the league in wild pitches in 1983 with 10.\nClark played winter ball with the Tiburones de La Guaira and Navegantes del Magallanes clubs of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during seven seasons spanning 1980–1989, pitching also for La Guaira in the Caribbean Series in the 1983 and 1985 tournaments."

The race came to a close on 7 June with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Eighteen teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Marco Pantani of the team. Second and third were the Russian rider Pavel Tonkov and Italian Giuseppe Guerini.\nIn the race's other classifications, overall winner Marco Pantani also won the mountains classification, Mariano Piccoli of the Brescialat-Liquigas team won the points classification, and rider Gian Matteo Fagnini won the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the eighteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by .\nTeams.\nA total of 18 teams were invited to participate in the 1998 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 162 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on the Apollon Concert Hall. Out of the 162 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 94 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 18 teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nSeveral riders were considered to be potential contenders for the victory before the race began. These included the winners of the previous two editions, Ivan Gotti () and Pavel Tonkov (). Alex Zülle (), who had won the Vuelta a España in both 1996 and 1997, was also considered a strong challenger. Marco Pantani () had come back to the Giro the previous year from injury, only to retire after a crash which occurred when a cat ran into the \"peloton\". He went on to win two stages of the 1997 Tour de France and was therefore also a challenger at the 1998 Giro.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1998 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 22 November 1997 in Milan. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were eleven stages containing high mountains, of which four had summit finishes: stage 11, to San Marino; stage 14, to Piancavallo; stage 18, to Passo di Pampeago; and stage 19, to Plan di Montecampione. The organizers chose to include no rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained the one less rest day, as well as one more individual time trial. After a five-year absence, RAI broadcast the event, replacing Reti Televisive Italiane (RTI) who had shown the race since 1993.\nThere were a total of seven stages that started outside Italy. The 1998 Giro d'Italia began with a prologue around the French city of Nice, which also served as the start for the race's first stage. Stage 11 finished in San Marino and the twelfth stage began there as well. The Giro's twentieth stage ended in Mendrisio. Stage 21 began in Mendrisio ended in Lugano, which also served as the start for stage 22.\nRace overview.\nThe race started in the French city of Nice with a prologue time trial, which was won by Zülle, who established an early lead over his general classification rivals. Pantani was aggressive from the early stages on, including an attack at the Capo Berta climb during stage 2. However, the first road stages saw race victories by sprinters, before Zülle took another victory on stage 7, at the ski resort of Laceno.\nOn stage 14 to Piancavallo, Pantani was victorious, but only took out 13 seconds on Zülle and Tonkov. On the next day, a long time trial in Trieste, Zülle caught Pantani on the road and finished 3:26 minutes faster, gaining a stronger grip on the race leader's jersey.\nPantani however still remained convinced that he could win the race, considering that three stages in high mountains lay ahead, a terrain that favoured him. On stage 17 into Sëlva, Pantani attacked with Giuseppe Guerini () on the climb of the Marmolada. Zülle cracked and lost four minutes, while Pantani, who gave the stage win to Guerini, took the leader's pink jersey. Tonkov hit back by winning the following stage at Alpe di Pampeago and now was just 27 seconds behind Pantani. Stage 19 to Montecampione saw Pantani and Tonkov engage in a fight for the victory on the final climb, while Zülle lost more than thirty minutes on both riders. Pantani was eventually able to leave Tonkov behind, winning the stage and exceeding his advantage to 1:27 minutes. The race had to be decided during the final time trial from Mendrisio to Lugano. Originally considered the weaker time trialist, Pantani managed to pull out another five seconds on Tonkov and sealed his victory in the Giro d'Italia. Serhiy Honchar won the stage, thirty seconds ahead of Pantani in third. Two months later, he also won the Tour de France, becoming only the seventh rider to win both races in the same year.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1998 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Sella and was first climbed by the Italian Marco Pantani. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

Listed at , , Lee batted and threw right handed. He was nicknamed ″Moose″, ″Horse″ and ″Big Bob″.\nBorn in Ottumwa, Iowa on November 26, 1937, Lee graduated from Bellflower High School in Bellflower, California. He was originally signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates organization as an amateur free agent in 1956 and also pitched eight years in the Minor leagues.\nLee entered the majors in 1964 with the Angels, pitching one inning of scoreless relief with two strikeouts in a 6–4 loss to the Washington Senators at D.C. Stadium.\nHe finished his rookie season with a 6–5 record and a 1.51 earned run average in 64 games, setting a personal record with 111 strikeouts. In 1965 he went 9–7 with a 1.92 ERA in 69 games, following with a 5–4 record and a 2.74 ERA in 61 appearances in the 1966 season. During this period he amassed 58 saves, to rank among the top 10 American League relievers in saves, pitching appearances (194) and games finished (128).\nIn addition, Lee posted a franchise record with 21 scoreless innings pitched between 1964 and 1965, which stood for 48 years until Jered Weaver set a new mark in July 2013. Lee also was selected to the 1965 American League All Star Team, even though he did not pitch in the game held at Metropolitan Stadium.\nBefore the 1967 season, he was sent to the Dodgers in the same transaction that brought Nick Willhite to California. He pitched in only four games for Los Angeles before being purchased by Cincinnati in the midseason. Nevertheless, Lee never matched the success of his first three seasons, as he went 3–3 with a 4.44 ERA in 27 games for the Reds the rest of the year. He followed with a 2–4 record and a 5.15 ERA in 44 games in 1968, during what turned out to be his Major League's final season.\nIn between, Lee had a 59–58 record and a 3.83 ERA over parts of eight minor league seasons spanning 1956–1963. He also pitched for the Tiburones de La Guaira and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan Winter League between 1963 and 1969.\nIn 2011 the Angels had a former player throw out the ceremonial first pitch of each of the team's 81 home games. Lee threw out the first pitch of the April 10, 2011 game.\nLee died on March 25, 2020, at his home in Lake Havasu City, Arizona."

        "text": "Australia's Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde defeated Great Britain's Neil Broad and Tim Henman in the final, 6–4, 6–4, 6–2 to win the gold medal in Men's Doubles tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics. It was the fourth of five components the Woodies needed for the career Golden Slam; they would later win the French Open to complete the achievement. It was Australia's first official medal in the event, though Australian player Edwin Flack was a member of a mixed team that won bronze in the 1896 event. Great Britain earned its first medal in the men's doubles since 1924. In the bronze-medal match, Germany's Marc-Kevin Goellner and David Prinosil defeated the Netherlands' Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis, 6–2, 7–5. It was Germany's second consecutive medal in the event.\nThe tournament was held from 25 July to 2 August at the Stone Mountain Tennis Center, in Atlanta, Georgia of the United States of America. There were 31 pairs from 31 nations, with each nation limited to one pair (two players),though the pair from Uzbekistan did not start.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of men's doubles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. A demonstration event was held in 1968.\nThis was the first Olympics at which Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde played together. Woodbridge had played with John Fitzgerald in 1992. Since pairing with Woodforde, the Australians had won four consecutive Wimbledone titles. They were heavy favorites in the Olympic tournament. 1992 silver medalist Wayne Ferreira of South Africa returned, this time paired with (unrelated) Ellis Ferreira rather than Piet Norval. Bronze medalist Javier Frana of Argentina also returned with a new partner, Luis Lobo.\nChinese Taipei, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, the Ivory Coast, Slovakia, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its eighth appearance in the event, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament. A bronze-medal match was reintroduced after not being held in 1988 or 1992. All matches except the final were best-of-three sets, down from best-of-five in previous Games; the final remained best-of-five. Tiebreaks were used for any set before the final set that reached 6–6."

Because there was no requirement previous to the GVB, anyone could play on a public course. This led to situations which were hazardous or undesirable to other players. In the 1980s the GVB was introduced (in Belgium in 1988) to remedy this problem. The GVB is basically a pre-handicap. It guarantees a certain level of ability and knowledge of the rules and etiquette. The GVB is required for entrance into a golfing association or to play on an official golfing association course although most clubs have their own admittance policy.\nSome clubs and courses (like in a lot of other countries) demand a handicap certificate or certifiable level of play (i.e. handicap 24) for guests.\nLevel of play.\nIn the Netherlands there are three types of level of play:\nMany club players skip the GVB part and go straight to the handicap exam.\nThe GVB test.\nThe test comprises a written portion and a practical portion. The written portion is twenty questions; five about etiquette, the other fifteen about the rules. The practical portion consists of playing four holes. The player's best three holes are counted; the player must score below 21 to pass the test.\nPlayers are free to choose a course to take their test. Some clubs or courses offer a package deal where one attains a GVB after a weekend of workshops, learning and training.\nIt is not necessary for a player to be a member of a club or course in the Netherlands to have a GVB or a handicap. The player can register with the Stichting Golfsport for a fee and the GVB or handicap will be maintained (even if it is not a Dutch GVB or handicap)."

        "title": "Basketball in Australia",
        "text": "Basketball is a sport played both indoors and outdoors in Australia. Basketball is the number two sport globally with over 200 countries participating and over 450 million players. According to research by Sweeney Sports, one in three Australians has an interest in basketball. Furthermore, basketball is played by approximately one million men, women, boys, and girls throughout Australia. According to Basketball Australia, as of March 2014, basketball is the second highest team participation sport in Australia.\nBasketball in Australia experienced a golden age in the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, during which the National Basketball League saw its halcyon days. However, its popularity, media attention, attendance, and corporate support deteriorated during the 2000s. From the mid-2010s, the sport saw renewed interest following a record number of Australians playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe first press reference to a game of basketball in Australia is from \"The Adelaide Advertiser\". The paper reported on Wednesday 17 February 1897 that the following Tuesday at the opening of Our Boys Institute, said to be the largest gymnasium in the colonies, OBI would play YMCA in the first exhibition of basketball in South Australia. There is no evidence of any game being played earlier elsewhere, thus the first game of basketball was played in Australia on Tuesday 23 February 1897. The game occurred six years after the invention of the sport on 21 December 1891 by Canadian James Naismith, a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) in Springfield, Massachusetts. OBI and the YMCA continued to be at the forefront of the development of Adelaide basketball. More than 120 years later, basketball is one of the most popular participation sports in the country.\nNational League.\nThe National Basketball League (NBL), which began in 1979, is the top-level men's basketball competition in Australia. The sport experienced rapid growth in the 1980s with the influx of American players. National competition became popular in the major cities. By the late 1990s, basketball in Australia went into sharp decline. According to Adelaide 36ers championship coach Phil Smyth, Australian basketball administrators rested on their laurels during the 1990s. \"They let the brand get damaged,\" Smyth said. \"It's that old saying 'if you keep doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result, you're a fool — and basketball was foolish.\" During the 2000s, interest in the NBL dwindled, with many teams folding, audience attendance fluctuating, and the league's TV presence inconsistent.\nIn 2015, a record number of Australians playing in the NBA led to a renewed popularity in the sport and showed Australians still loved basketball but were unsure about the national version. However, by the late 2010s and early 2020s, renewed interest in the league saw all-time attendance records be broken.\nNational teams.\nThe Boomers are the men's basketball team which represents Australia in international competitions. As of 2022, the Boomers have won 19 FIBA Oceania Championships (no longer contested), one FIBA Asia Cup, one Commonwealth Games Gold Medal in 2006 and one Bronze Medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Until winning the Bronze in Tokyo, their best finish being fourth place at the Olympics in 1988, 1996, 2000 and 2016, and fourth at the 2019 World Cup.\nThe women's national team is the Opals. They have won Olympic silver in 2000, 2004 and 2008, Olympic bronze in 1996 and 2012, as well as gold at the 2006 FIBA World Championship and bronze at the 1998, 2002 and 2014 World Cups.\nAustralians in the NBA.\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States has a number of Australian players. The NBA also has a large following in Australia.\nThe majority of players on the roster for the Australia men's national basketball team (nicknamed the \"Boomers\") currently play in the NBA."

        "text": "Field hockey is a moderately popular sport in Australia. It's usually referred to as simply \"hockey\" and is played in winter, with a season typically starting in March and April. The national governing body, Hockey Australia has 162,176 registered players as of 2020, with a 48% to 52% split of male to female players. Australia is home to two of the best national hockey teams in the world, with both the men and the women having won the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and World Cup one or more times.\nHistory.\nThe beginnings of Australian hockey.\nThe British navy are often credited as being the first to bring hockey into Australia. In the late 1800s, Australia didn't have a navy and relied on the British to defend their coastlines, this meant that many british games were brought in by the military personnel who were stationed there, one of them being hockey.\nThe AWHA.\nThe foundation of the Australian Women's Hockey Association (AWHA) in 1910, led to the rapid growth of women's hockey all over Australia. It was linked closely to the All England Women's Hockey Accosiation, with whom the first Australian women's national team played their first match against in 1914, in addition to their first overseas test in 1930. In 1927, the AWHA became a founding member of the International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations, alongside Denmark, England, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa, the United States and Wales, which in 1982 merged with the International Hockey Federation.\nThe AHA.\nIn 1925, the Australian Hockey Association (AHA) was founded.\nHockey One.\nSince 2019, the national level of competition is Hockey One. Prior to this, it was the Australian Hockey League, which was made from the former Men's and Women's National Hockey League in 1991.\nHockey One is a small league, with only a single men's team and a single women's team from each of the eight states and territories, but it produces excellent results, when measured by the performance of the national squad.\nKookaburras.\nThe Kookaburras, the men's national team have won 1 gold, 4 silver and 5 bronze at the Olympics, as well as 10 World Hockey Cup medals, 6 Commonwealth Games gold medals, 30 Hockey Champions Trophy medals, and one Men's FIH Pro League championship.\nHockeyroos.\nThe Hockeyroos, the women's national team, have won 3 gold Olympic medals in 2000, 1996 and 1988; as well as 4 world cup medals, 2 gold at the Commonwealth games, and 11 champions trophy medals."

The club's jersey is red and blue.\nHistory.\nOld Collegians first played in 1937 as Prince Alfred Old Collegians Rugby Club.\nDuring World War II, the competition ceased from 1941 and the club was reformed on the renewal of the competition in the state in 1945. The club was then named Old Collegians Rugby Club.\nOC's first home ground was in the centre of Victoria Park racecourse; the club later moved to the dairy cow-grazed pastures of the south parklands and in 1953 moved again to its current location at Tregenza Oval.\nIn the early 1980s the club ran an U/18 team for three years and then formed the Junior Collegians in 1985. OC now competes in each junior age bracket.\nOC is one of the two founding clubs (the other being Adelaide University) of the women's South Australian rugby competition and the only club to compete continuously from the first games in 1995 until 2018.\nMany OC players have captained or represented the state at senior and junior levels over the years and have taken out SARU individual player awards. The greatest achievement so far has gone to Rod Hauser, who was selected for the Wallabies while playing for OC. In 2013 D'arcy Sadler was contracted to the Australian women's sevens squad while continuing to play for OC between tournaments.\nThe Club Guernsey has changed colours from the initial maroon and blue jumper with a PAC crest, to broad maroon and navy hoops in 1955, to its current light red and blue hoops in the mid-1970s.\nThe club's 75th year in 2012 was celebrated with a gala dinner attended by over 550 people.\nControversy.\nDespite a history of 24 years at the club and winning the state women's premiership in 2018, the vast majority of the women's team left the club when their complaints of bullying, mistreatment and misogyny were not responded to by the club. The women's team raised concerns about their alleged unequal treatment at the club, which were not adequately addressed. Subsequently, approximately 20 players transferred to Adelaide University to go on and win the 2019 premiership there.\nAmong other concerns, the 2018 women's team had not been allowed to climb the club rafters to celebrate their win. Traditionally, victorious premiership players had climbed into the clubroom rafters on the Grand Final evening to celebrate their win. Due to safety concerns, this practice was officially banned by the committee prior to the (male) 2016 premiership teams repeating the practice without apparent recourse or penalty.\nA sexual harassment complaint was also made to the club about the treatment of one female player by a male coach.\nEven though the club was unable to field a women's team in 2019, they were awarded a $500,000 Federal taxpayer-funded grant the following year, for \"construction of female change rooms and facilities\" as part of the 2020 \"sports rorts\" controversy. The club asserted it to be a proper use of funds on the basis that the club had a women's team continuously for the 24 years prior to, and at the time of application (September 2018), and their junior membership contained a significant number of girls. If the merit based process of application assessment conducted by Sport Australia had been followed, the cut-off score would have been 74 out of a possible 100. Old Collegians’ application had been given a score of 60.5.\nNotable past players.\nBrock James represented Australia as an under 16, 19 and 21. He played for both the Queensland Reds and the Western Force in Super Rugby before going on to be the top points scorer in the Top 14 in France with Clermont Auvergne, appearing in numerous grand finals and the Heineken Cup.\nLiam Gill (rugby) played for the Queensland Reds, RC Toulonnais, Australian National Rugby Union Team, the Australia national rugby sevens team and currently Lyon OU in the Top 14\nD'arcy Sadler played for the Australia women's national rugby sevens team.\nMackenzie Sadler was in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics playing rugby sevens for Australia. She also plays for the University of Queensland in the Aon University 7s competition and made the team of the tournament.\nNotable current players.\nAlex Rokobaro is a former professional rugby player who played for the Fijian national rugby team, the Stade Français Paris, the Melbourne Rebels and Rugby Calvisano."

He is currently the head coach for the Guildford Flames of the Elite Ice Hockey League, the top-tier of hockey in the United Kingdom.\nPlaying career.\nAfter working his way through the Durham Wasps youth system, Dixon made his first appearance for the senior side in the 1989/90 season. After the 1990/91 season, Dixon moved to the Hull-based Humberside Seahawks where he helped them gain promotion to the Heineken League Premier Division Dixon then played a season with the Sheffield Steelers where he and the team achieved the same feat. He moved back home to play for the Durham Wasps for 3 years until they were sold and moved to Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1996, where he spent another 3 years playing for the Newcastle-based team, now known as Newcastle Vipers.\nIn the summer of 1999 Dixon made the move south to Surrey-based outfit the Guildford Flames where he remains as player/head coach. From the start of his Flames career Dixon was given the alternate captain position. After being awarded the Alan Weeks Trophy in 2001, he was made captain of the side, a position he held until taking over as head coach in 2007, thus making him the longest serving Flames captain. During his time with the Flames, Dixon was selected to the British National League first all-star team on three occasions (2001, 2004 &amp; 2005) and the second team once (2003), as well as the English Premier Ice Hockey League first all-star team in 2006 &amp; 2007. and second all-star team in 2008 and 2009.

        "text": "Gymkhana () is an equestrian event consisting of speed pattern racing and timed games for riders on horses. These events often emphasize children's participation and may be organized by a recognized Pony Club or a 4-H club. In parts of the western United States, this type of competition is usually called an \"O-Mok-See\" (also spelled \"omoksee\" or without hyphenation as \"o mok see\") competition, a term derived from a Native American phrase said to mean \"games on horseback\". Very small events with little or no prize money, designed for beginners or riders at a local level, are sometimes called playdays. \"Gymkhana\" is the word used in most of the rest of the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom and both the East Coast and the West Coast of the United States.\nTypes of events.\nGymkhana and o-mok-see classes are a collection of timed speed events such as; barrel racing, pole bending, keyhole race, keg race (also known as \"down and back\"), flag racing, a hybrid pattern like mountain cow horse, and stake race. Some organizations include ride and run, musical mats, egg stomp, $1 bill race or \"ride a buck\", and sack race. Sometimes a goat tying event is included, where the rider will ride up to a goat tied to a stake, jump off, and hog tie the goat. \nMost of these events are designed to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as flying lead changes, sliding stops and more. Most clubs offer a variety of classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable.\nO-Mok-See.\nO-Mok-See or omoksee is a term sometimes used in the Western United States for events in the sport of pattern horse racing. Most events are run with contestants simultaneously running in 4 separate lanes (3 for small arenas), with each contestant riding in a 30 foot wide lane. Other pattern races more commonly held are pole bending &amp; barrel racing.\nThe origin of the term \"O-Mok-See\" is thought to specifically originate with the Blackfeet people where they described a particular style of riding as \"oh-mak-see pass-kan\" meaning \"riding big dance\". This event was thought to be a war ceremony; before setting out on a mounted expedition against the enemy, the warriors of the camp performed this dance as a part of the prelude of stirring up courage and enthusiasm for battle. The warriors put on their finest dress attire, decorated and painted their best horses, carrying their war bundles, shields, lances and bonnets. They mounted and gathered at some distance out of sight of the camp. They turned and rode together at full speed into the great camp circle, circled around it once and then rode to the center of the camp. In the center were a number of old men and women who sang special songs and beat drums for the horsemen. The horsemen then rode their trained horses to the rhythm of the singers and drummers. From time to time the riders dismounted and danced about on foot beside their horses, shooting in the air and shouting to one another to be brave when the battle came. If anyone fell from his horse during the ceremony it was considered an omen of bad luck.\nNational Saddle Clubs Association.\nThe National Saddle Clubs Association (NSCA) was established in January 1965 as the first national organization of saddle clubs. The NSCA held its first national championship show in 1966. The NSCA has adopted and promotes the sport of \"pattern horse racing\" under the term O-Mok-See. They encourage and allow families to compete together. The NSCA has adopted a set of pattern horse racing events for national competition . some of the events that they run are pole bending, California stake race, polo, key, international flags, Idaho figure-eight and two barrel Flags. There are also 10 or so more events in their rule book. Through standardized rules and regulations for pattern horse racing events, the NSCA's prime purpose and objectives are to promote and cultivate cooperation and friendly relationships between saddle clubs throughout the United States."

        "title": "Launceston Rugby Club",
        "text": "Launceston Rugby Club (also known as the Cornish All Blacks, the name of the 1st team) is a Cornish rugby club which play at Polson Bridge, Launceston, Cornwall. They are currently in Regional 1 South West, at the fifth tier of the English rugby union system following their promotion from Tribute South West 1 West via a play-off in 2019. At present the club fields two senior men's teams, colts (under-18), mini/junior sides (ages 7 to 16), as well as several girls teams (ranging from under-13 to under-18).\nHistory.\nFoundation and early years.\nThe club was founded in 1948 after an inaugural meeting chaired by the then Headmaster of Launceston College, Mr Spencer Toy, with Gordon Reeve, Eric Smith and Arthur Venning (who up until his death in February 2017 was still a club member). Mr Toy had introduced rugby union at the college in 1931, but no town team had been formed until after the war despite efforts being made during the mid-1930s. On 30 October 1948 Launceston Rugby Club played its first ever game away to Launceston College, winning 13-3 (3 tries to 1), with Reeve, Smith and Venning all featuring for the new team; Reeve himself scoring the final try, along with 2 conversions. By Spring 1949, the club had its own ground at Hurdon Road, rented from the council (now a factory site of its main sponsor DS Smith Plc), with scaffolding poles for goal posts and ex-army huts for changing rooms and a clubhouse. During the 1960s the club moved to another site when the Town Council sold the land, but again moved on in 1969 when the club had the vision to refuse becoming part of the proposed Sports Centre at Pennygillam, which they would have shared with Launceston Football Club. The ground at Polson Bridge was purchased in 1969, with developments such as floodlights, enlarged clubhouse, present changing rooms and finally the grandstand being added over the years. The first match at Polson was played on Boxing Day 1969 against a Derek Prout International XV - Derek being the club's first ever full international.\nRise up the leagues.\nIn 1981 they then went on to win the Cornwall Senior Cup for the first of many since wins and started their remarkable climb to be one of the top 40 sides in England (from a town with a population of just over 7,000). LRFC gained promotion to National League Division 3 South (level 4) in 2000 and were runner-up in their first season, losing in the play-off away to National 3 North side Sedgley Park. The following season, 2001–02, LRFC were 2nd again, but this time won the play-off against Dudley Kingswinford, and were promoted to Division Two (level 3). They were unfortunate to be relegated after a most unusual series of results on the last day of the season. However, in 2003–04 Launceston bounced right back by again finishing second but winning the play-off away to Halifax. LRFC finished in 5th position in National League Division 2 (level 3) in 2004–05 and by the end of the 2006–07 season they had been promoted to English National Division 1 (level 2). On 26 April 2008, Launceston suffered a final day relegation to Division 2 (level 3) as an unexpected sequence of final day results saw relegation threatened Birmingham &amp; Solihull and Sedgley Park pull off dramatic wins against Bedford and Rotherham respectively. The Cornish All Blacks were relegated when they had actually won more games than either of their two rivals. In truth the damage had been done earlier in the season when losses against Newbury (away), Nottingham (away), Sedgley Park (away), Birmingham &amp; Solihull (away), Esher (home) came back to haunt the coaching staff and players.\nAdministration and decline.\nDuring the summer of 2010 Launceston Rugby Football Club Ltd went into administration, with a new company, Launceston Rugby Club Ltd being formed in its place. As a punishment the RFU gave the club a 20-point deduction going into the new season. This gave the club too much to do, and despite a brave attempt they were relegated from National League 1 at the end of the 2010-11 season. The club would spend a number of seasons in National League 2 South until the 2015-16 season. Despite having a promising team that made up the bulk of the Cornwall side that won the 2015 Bill Beaumont Cup, the relegation of nearby Plymouth Albion from the RFU Championship the previous season, would lead to almost the entire Launceston first team leaving to join the Devon club, where incidentally, Graham Dawe (the Cornwall head coach), was director of rugby. This, coupled with Launceston being on their third head coach in a little over a year, contributed to the worst season in the club's league history as they were relegated without winning a game. Despite improved performances the following season in National League 3 South West (including a win against rivals, Camborne) the club suffered their second successive relegation, dropping to Tribute South West 1 West.\nNew hope.\nBy the end of the 2018-19 season, Launceston had come on leaps and bounds, finishing runners up in the league behind local rivals, Okehampton, missing out on the title by just 3 points. Despite this defeat the club's league performances were good enough to book home advantage in the promotion play-off against South West 1 East runners up, Old Centralians. The play-off game was held on 27 April 2019 at Polson Bridge in front of the biggest crowd seen in a number of seasons, with 1,200 in attendance. It started badly for the home side as Old Cents dominated the first half, which ended 0-19 to the visitors. However, the second half turned to be the complete opposite, as the Cornish All Blacks rallied, scoring five unanswered tries to win the game 33-22 and clinch promotion back to tier 5.\nGround.\nPolson Bridge is situated on the Cornish side of the River Tamar, next to the bridge that gives the ground its name, about 1.5 miles east of the town of Launceston. The ground consists of a main pitch with flood-lights, with the stand on one side of the pitch and a long covered standing terrace on the other, two club-houses with bars including the executive suite, a gym, changing rooms and three additional pitches for 2nd XV and junior rugby. The ground also has a couple of car parks, although parking can be an issue at bigger games such as local derbies.\nThe original capacity of Polson Bridge, according to press reports, was thought to be around 6,000 but in the current ground this would be unsafe. A more realistic estimate of capacity around the main pitch would be 3,000, including 194 seats in the main stand and the rest standing. The club came close to achieving this capacity figure on 1 September 2007 when 2,995 supporters watched the club play a league game against the Cornish Pirates during the 2007–08 season. In recent times the club has enjoyed derby games against Redruth which have regularly attracted 1,000+ crowds."

Volleyballs are spherical in shape and typically comprise eighteen nearly rectangular panels made from synthetic or genuine leather. These panels are organized into six identical sections, each consisting of three panels. They are carefully wrapped around a bladder to form the complete volleyball. A valve permits the internal air pressure to be adjusted. In a break from the traditional construction, in 2008, the FIVB adopted as its official indoor ball a new Mikasa with dimples and only eight panels for a softer touch and truer flight.\nVolleyball characteristics.\n\"Indoor volleyballs\" are specifically designed for the indoor version of the sport, while beach volleyballs are tailored for the beach game.\nIndoor volleyballs come in either a solid white color or the brightest shade of yellow. They are produced in two variations: a youth version, slightly smaller and lighter than adult volleyballs, and a heavier \"medicine ball\" type designed for setters to enhance finger strength.\nBeach volleyballs are slightly larger than standard indoor balls, featuring a coarser external texture and lower internal pressure. They come in vibrant colors or a solid white option. The earliest volleyballs were crafted using leather panels over a rubber carcass.\nMajor brands.\nThere are several brands of competitive volleyballs in use, including, but not limited to:\nMost of these brands also make cheaper variations for recreational (non-competitive) use.\nHistory.\nIn 1895, the initial development of the Volleyball ball was made of a basket bladder according to William G.

In his first at bat on September 15, facing Sheldon Jones, he flied out to center fielder Willie Mays of the New York Giants, but overall he collected eight hits (including two doubles) in 27 at bats during his Major League audition.

He was a member of the British field hockey team, which won the silver medal. He played all five matches as forward.\nGriffiths was President of Abergavenny Hockey Club from 1967 to 2007, for 40 of the club's 110 years existence. He was about 14 years of age when he started to play hockey. He was to represent Great Britain on 8 occasions and was the holder of an Olympic silver medal that he won at the 1948 London Olympic Games when Great Britain came second to gold medallists India in the final. He played in all the matches of that campaign. His GB caps were awarded against Switzerland, the United States, Pakistan, India, Holland (twice), France, and Afghanistan.\nWhilst a student at Cambridge University Griffiths was awarded a hockey blue. When World War II came he joined the Royal Air Force and was posted to South Africa where he continued to play hockey and became a PT instructor. On returning to Wales and to Cardiff University to complete his medical studies he played hockey for Newport Athletic and joined Abergavenny in 1950.\nBy then Griffiths had already accumulated 10 Welsh international caps, the first of which was in 1947 against Ireland. In total he played 32 times for Wales and ended his international career in 1956 when he travelled to Amsterdam to play Holland. Two of those 32 international games were played at Abergavenny Cricket Club – against England in 1949 and Ireland in 1954.\nGriffiths was a forward thinking player in his heyday. At the 1948 Olympic Games all teams except India played with broad English head sticks. India used short rounded head sticks similar to those that we use today. Griffiths tried to convince players that the Indian head was the only way forward but to no avail. The English head was still being used in the 1952 Olympics.\nGriffith's specialty was the reverse stick cross from the left wing, which was reasonably easy to achieve with an Indian head stick but difficult with the cumbersome English head.\nThe club celebrated Bill's 40 years of Presidency on 21 November 2007 and the incoming President, Trevor Scott thanked Bill for his unfailing interest and support during all of that time: \"We have been very, very fortunate to have had such a distinguished sportsman and gentleman to be our President. It will be a hard act to follow\".\nChairman Paul Harrington, President Trevor Scott and current player Michael Potts made the presentation of an engraved sundial to Griffiths. Potts is Bill's Grandson, following the family tradition."

        "text": "John Morris Peake (26 August 1924 – 30 March 2022) was a British and English international field hockey player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics.\nEarly life.\nPeake was born on 26 August 1924 and attended St Faith's School in Cambridge, and was a student there from 1931 to 1938. Following this he won a scholarship to Repton School, after which he went on to read mechanical engineering at Clare College, Cambridge where he met his future wife.\nPeake was a reserve for England at squash. Peake also made it through two rounds of qualifying to get into Wimbledon, however he lost when he needed one more set to get in. During the Second World War Peake joined the Royal Navy.\n1948 London Olympics.\nIn June 1946 London was awarded the 1948 Olympics, the 1944 Games had originally been intended to be hosted by London but was cancelled due to the Second World War. Peake was selected for the Olympic team early in 1948 and had very little time to train with the team, he later said “The hockey season ended at Easter with the great gathering at Folkestone. And of course [the Olympics] was going to be in the summer. We hardly met each other. It wasn’t until six weeks before leaving that we had a gathering. We got together with some local people and played, and this is the first time we saw the people from Scotland and Wales. We were all pretty fit; we were playing tennis or squash or something. Nevertheless, we had nothing like the long build-up that they have now.\"\nPeake was a member of the British field hockey team for the 1948 Olympic Games in London. Peake played in all five matches as forward, the first of which was a goalless draw against Switzerland on 31 July 1948. That result was followed up on 5 August by beating USA 11–0, two days later repeating that result against Afghanistan. Peake and the rest of his team qualified for the semifinal's top group and played Pakistan on 9 August who they beat 2–0. The final was played against the newly independent India on 12 August at Wembley Stadium, the Indians won 4–0 with two goals being scored by the legendary Indian hockey player Balbir Singh Sr. Peake and the British team won the silver medal, Peake did play a few more times internationally but this was the last major tournament Peake competed in and was the penultimate medal that the British hockey team won at the Olympics until 1984.\nAfter the Olympics.\nAfter leaving professional hockey at the age of 28 Peake later became chairman of Baker Perkins, an engineering company focusing on food processing equipment, and was appointed a CBE in the 1986 Birthday Honours.\nPeake was one of the torchbearers for the Peterborough leg of the 2012 Olympic torch relay. At the age of 87, Peake was one of the oldest torchbearers, he later donated the torch to St Faith’s School as a thanks to the teachers who he said ‘nurtured his love of sport in the early years.’\nIn 2013 Peake spoke about what he thought of the changes in the rules to hockey saying 'some of the rules that have changed are for the better. We used to have a roll in from the side and that used to be a rather tangled thing, and long corners weren't very special. We used to have a 'sticks' rule (lifting the stick above the shoulder). That's gone and I think that's a pity.' As of January 2021, Peake, 96, lived in a retirement home in Wimbledon, London. He died on 30 March 2022, at the age of 97."

Bates played for the Boston Beaneaters, Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, and Chicago Cubs in the National League, and finished his career with the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League. Bates hit for the cycle in 1907.\nEarly life.\nBates was born in Steubenville, Ohio. He entered professional baseball with the 1905 Sharon Steels, a new team in the Ohio-Pennsylvania League.\nCareer.\nBates made his major league debut in April 1906 with the Boston Beaneaters. He hit a home run in that first major league game, one of only six home runs he hit that season and one of 25 major league home runs in his career. He became a regular outfielder for Boston right away, playing 140 games that first season.\nOn April 26, 1907, Bates hit for the cycle at Washington Park in Brooklyn. He was the Boston leadoff hitter, but until that game he had gotten only 8 hits in 48 at bats in the 1907 season. He hit a triple in the first at bat of the game, an infield single in the third inning, a double in the fifth inning, and a home run in the seventh inning. Boston beat Brooklyn 4-2. Bates was the third player in franchise history to hit for the cycle.\nIn July 1909, Bates was hitting .288, much higher than his previous season batting averages, when Boston traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies in a multiplayer deal. He then hit .293 for the Phillies that year.\nBates was involved in another multiplayer trade after 1910 season, this time to the Cincinnati Reds. He had one of his best seasons with the 1911 Reds. He hit .292 that year and, largely because his walk total ballooned to 103, he had an on base percentage of .415. His last major league season was 1914, which he split between the Reds, the Chicago Cubs, and the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League. In 1154 games, Bates recorded 1087 hits, 25 home runs and 417 RBI with a .278 batting average.\nFrom 1915 to 1918, Bates returned to the minor leagues, playing mostly in the International League.\nLater life.\nBates was a glassworker after retiring from baseball, and then he became a deputy sheriff for Jefferson County, Ohio. His stepson, Robert Dobbie Bates, was the county sheriff there in the late 1930s and 1940s. In 1949, Bates had a heart attack while he was shoveling snow, and he died ten days later in his native Steubenville.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

He hit .364 in the '27 Series against what some consider the greatest Major League team of all time, the '27 Yankees.\nIn 1930 he hit .324, setting career highs in hits (179), RBIs (99), and runs scored (120).\nIn 1,444 career games over 13 seasons, Grantham posted a .302 batting average (1,508-for-4,989) with 912 runs, 292 doubles, 93 triples, 105 home runs, 712 RBI, 132 stolen bases, .392 on-base percentage and .461 slugging percentage.

        "text": "Jackie Robinson (born May 20, 1955) is an American former professional basketball player.\nCareer.\nA 6'6\" forward from UNLV, Robinson played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1979 to 1981 as a member of the Seattle SuperSonics, Detroit Pistons, and Chicago Bulls. He averaged 3.8 points per game in his NBA career and won an NBA Championship with Seattle in 1979.\nRetirement.\nAfterward, Robinson played five years in Europe, and upon retirement held executive positions in several Las Vegas companies that worked in retail, real estate, construction, credit, and the food and beverage industries. He was a one-time owner of the Las Vegas Silver Bandits of the defunct International Basketball League, and the Las Vegas Slam of the American Basketball Association.\nBy 2008, Robinson and real estate veteran Michael Bellon had teamed up to develop a multibillion-dollar project on Bulloch and Gaffin's property called Elysium. It called for condos and hotel rooms, a dome-covered ocean-beach swimming complex, and more. It was to be located on the southeast of the Las Vegas Strip.\nRobinson is currently working to build in Las Vegas the All Net Resort and Arena, a $4 billion hotel, shopping, and arena complex that could attract an NBA expansion team to Nevada. The project was approved August of 2014, though it wouldn't be until March of 2017 that excavation of the site would begin. In 2017, the construction of an additional 63-story tower had been approved for the site. At which time Robinson said that his financing was “signed, done, sealed, delivered.” He also indicated construction would go vertical around late spring 2018. In July 2017, lawyers for Robinson’s group contradicted Robinson's statement that funding was secure, saying in court papers that “difficulties in funding” the project had sparked construction delays and shortly thereafter construction came to a complete halt. Since construction stopped some contractors have claimed in court filings that they are owed money. In late 2018 Robinson said a loan agreement had been made with The Bank of Qatar after the expansion plan was approved but this source of funding could not be confirmed at the time by journalists. The Las Vegas Review Journal said at the time, \"Robinson, who initially planned to open his project in 2016, now expects to finish in 2021.\" with a quote from Robinson saying, \"The project will get completed — 100 percent”. As of 2023 construction remains stalled. "

        "title": "1998 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 1998 Daytona 500, the 40th running of the event, was held on February 15 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida as the first race of the 1998 NASCAR Winston Cup season. It was Dale Earnhardt's only Daytona 500 victory after 19 previous attempts. It was Earnhardt's 20th 500 start and CBS's 20th consecutive live broadcast of the Daytona 500. Also, his Daytona 500 win ended a 59-race winless streak dating back to Atlanta Motor Speedway in March 1996.\nThe race had three cautions - all of which were for minor incidents, and there were no accident-related retirements. The race was run under the green flag for the first 125 laps. This resulted in it being the second-fastest Daytona 500 ever, behind the 1980 Daytona 500 won by Buddy Baker, and the fastest of the restrictor plate era.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nQualifying.\nBobby Labonte won the pole position for the Daytona 500 with a time of 46.776 seconds, and his brother Terry qualified on the outside pole position next to him. Sterling Marlin qualified third winning the first Gatorade Twin 125 and Dale Earnhardt qualified fourth winning the second Twin 125.\nRace summary.\nPre-race buildup.\nThe race began with an emphasis on NASCAR's 50th Anniversary Celebration. The pre-race show on CBS featured some of the greatest Daytona 500 finishes in recent memory. It also detailed the famous Daytona Beach Road Course and it featured Russ Truelove, Buck Baker, Tim Flock, Red Farmer and Junior Johnson on the Daytona Beach with one of Tim Flock's old \"Full Jeweled\" #300 Chryslers.\nThe Rev. Hal Marchman gave the traditional invocation, and country/bluegrass music singer Kathy Mattea sang the US National Anthem, but neither was aired on CBS. Kansas Governor Bill Graves and the fans in the stands all gave the command for drivers to start their engines and Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino waved the green flag to start the race.\nCaution #1.\nIn the mid-stage of the event, green flag pit stops were still in progress with Jeff Gordon leading and were on pace of breaking the average speed of 198. Ward Burton cut down a tire, leaving debris on the track. This would bring out the first caution.\nCaution #2.\nLate in the race with a possibility of a second round of green-flag stops, John Andretti and Robert Pressley made contact in turn 2 and both spun out, which brought out the second caution. During pit spots, Dale Earnhardt came out first, Michael Waltrip had a penalty after running over a hose while pitting, thus held back at the rear of the pack.\nCaution #3 (Lap 198) and finish.\nDale Earnhardt led Bobby Labonte and Jeremy Mayfield heading into turn 2. Lake Speed and John Andretti got together and both cars spun, setting up a scenario where Earnhardt, Labonte, and Mayfield were all in contention for the win. While racing back to the caution flag, the three came up on the lapped car of Rick Mast. Earnhardt easily passed Mast on the outside. Labonte lost Earnhardt's draft while Mayfield sped to the inside of Mast. Earnhardt led Labonte and Mayfield, who were side by side. Earnhardt took the white and yellow flags in first while Labonte edged Mayfield for second by a fender. The race would end under the caution flag. Earnhardt dedicated his win to his late colleague, Neil Bonnett, who died 4 years earlier whilst practicing for the 1994 race."

        "title": "Belgian Cricket Federation",
        "text": "The Belgian Cricket Federation (BCF), currently branded as Cricket Belgium, is the governing body of the sport of cricket in Belgium. Founded in 1990, the organisation has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1991, and is also a member of the ICC Europe and the Belgian Olympic Committee. Its headquarters are in Edegem, a municipality in the province of Antwerp. A previous national governing body had been established in the early 20th century, but fell away during the Second World War.\nHistory.\nIn one of those curious twists of history, this actually pre-dates Belgium itself by some 16 years. British Guards officers performed the honours, playing a match shortly before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Matches have been played to mark the 150th, 175th and 200th anniversaries of this occasion. The first record of organized cricket, however, can be found in a painting (left) dated 1870 which now hangs in the Pavilion at Lord”s.\nRegistered under Belgian law as a non-profit organization and operating as Cricket Belgium, it is the second Belgian Cricket Federation. The first was formed in the early 1900s and disappeared on the death of its long-term official Comte Joseph d’Oultremont in October 1942. No records have been found. Formed again in 1990, Belgium gained the status of an affiliate member of the ICC in 1991. The present Belgian Cricket Federation was a founding member of the European Cricket Council (ECC) (now succeeded by ICC Europe) and is now an Associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Belgian Olympic and Inter-federal Committee (BOIC).\nAlthough cricket is thought to have originated in what is now Belgium in about the 14th century, the first recorded match was played at Enghien six days before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\nClub cricket in Belgium.\nMore and more clubs were formed in the 1950s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Today, 18 clubs and one school are members of either the Belgian Cricket Federation or its regional Flemish organisation Cricket Vlaanderen. In addition, there are a number of teams representing businesses and other organizations playing in a mid-week T20 competition and other non-League events.\nInternational Cricket Matches.\nOn the European stage, Belgium has been a committed supporter of the ECC and ICC-Europe for many years with senior national teams taking part in championships and, since 2001, sending junior national sides to European Championships as well. Belgium is the current holder of the ICC-Europe Under-19 Division 2 title and has previously held Under-13 and Under-17 titles.\nIn 2011 the senior focus will shift towards T20 cricket in preparation for the new ICC-Europe Championship format.\nBelgium hosted 12 countries for the ICC-Europe T20 Championships Division 2 in June 2013 and 5 nation European Cricket One-day U19 Tournament in August 2015.\nA women’s cricket competition is held at Royal Brussels CC each year with a team selected to play home and away matches against Thoiry (Paris)."

Opened in 1961, it has two regulation-length nine-hole courses and an executive-length (par 30) course located along the Tualatin River in suburban Portland, Oregon. The Reserve Vineyards &amp; Golf Club is situated just across the river to the east.\nHistory.\nMeriwether opened in the spring of 1961 with nine-holes, with an additional nine-holes finished in 1962. When it opened the course was among the longest in the Northwest. Bob Rosburg served as the course’s first golf pro, and was at Meriwether from 1961 to 1964. In 1994, the club expanded by adding nine holes to the course and building a new clubhouse at a cost of $4.7 million. The new clubhouse cost $2 million and is .\nRegional flooding in the winter of 1996 closed the course for two months. In 1997, the course hosted the Portland Rose Festival’s Kiwanis for Kids Golf Tournament. By 2004 most of the damage from the 1996 flooding had been repaired and additional improvements were made that year. That year Meriwether hosted the 2004 Oregon Golf Association’s Public Links Championship. In 2006, the course played host to the Oregon Junior Stroke Play Championships, and in 2008 hosts part of the college level Pacific Invitational.\nFacilities.\nThe golf club includes a covered driving range, putting greens, and chipping greens. The course clubhouse includes a restaurant and golf pro shop. Meriwether has two regulation length courses with water hazards, trees, and bunkers.\nCourses.\nThe nine-hole Executive course measures 1,789 yards and is a par 30. It was designed in 1961 by Dave Powers. Also at the club is the nine-hole, par 36 North course. Designed by Fred Federspiel and opened in 1961, it is 3,373 yards from the back tees. The Executive course challenges golfers of all abilities with contoured greens making up for the lack of distance. \nBoth the West and South (south course was closed in 2015) courses are nine holes and par 36s. The West was designed by Powers and measures 3,346 yards, and opened in 1961. The South opened in 1994 and measures 3,406 yards. The West and North courses comprise the usual 18-hole rotation with the South course handling 9-hole play. \nThe putting course was removed about 2002 or 2003."

        "text": "Harry Taylor Howell (November 14, 1876 – May 22, 1956) was an American professional baseball player who played as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms/Brooklyn Superbas (1898 and 1900), Baltimore Orioles (1899), Baltimore Orioles/New York Highlanders (1901–03), and St. Louis Browns (1904–10).\nCareer.\nHowell helped the Superbas win the 1900 National League pennant. He led the National League in games finished (non-starts) in 1900 (10) and the American League in 1903 (10) and led the American League in Complete Games (35) in 1905. Howell currently ranks 82nd on the MLB All-Time ERA List (2.74), 87th on the All-Time Complete Games List (244) and 68th on the Hit Batsmen List (97). He is also the Baltimore Orioles career leader in ERA (2.06).\nIn 13 seasons, he had a 131–146 Win–loss record, 340 Games (282 Started), 244 Complete Games, 20 Shutouts, 53 Games Finished, 6 Saves, Innings Pitched, 2,435 Hits Allowed, 1,158 Runs Allowed, 781 Earned Runs Allowed, 27 Home Runs Allowed, 677 Walks, 986 Strikeouts, 97 Hit Batsmen, 53 Wild Pitches, 7,244 Batters Faced, 1 Balk, 2.74 ERA and a 1.212 WHIP.\nAfter his playing career ended, he was an umpire for 85 games in the Federal League in 1915.\n1910 Chalmers Award Scandal.\nHowell, along with the Jack O'Connor, the Browns player-manager, was involved in the scandal surrounding efforts to help Cleveland's Nap Lajoie win the batting title and the associated 1910 Chalmers Award over Ty Cobb in the last two games of the season, a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. Cobb was leading Lajoie .385 to .376 in the batting race going into that last day. O'Connor ordered rookie third baseman Red Corriden to station himself in shallow left field to allow what otherwise would be routine infield ground outs to be base hits. Lajoie bunted five straight times down the third base line and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie reached base on a fielding error, officially giving him a hitless at-bat and lowering his average. O'Connor and Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit, offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by less than one point over Lajoie, .385069 to .384095. The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president Ban Johnson, who declared Cobb the rightful winner of the batting title (though Chalmers awarded cars to both players). At his insistence, Browns' owner Robert Hedges fired both O'Connor and Howell, and released them as players; both men were informally banned from baseball for life.\nIn 1981, however, research revealed that one game was counted twice for Cobb when he went 2-for-3. As a result, his 1910 batting statistics should have been shown as 194-for-506 and .383399, less than .0007 behind Lajoie at 227-for-591.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "In cycling at the 1972 Summer Olympics, the men's individual road race was held on 7 September. There were 163 starters from 48 nations. The maximum per NOC was four. A total of 76 cyclists finished the race. The event was won by Hennie Kuiper of the Netherlands, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race and first medal in the event since 1948. Clyde Sefton earned Australia's first medal in the event with his silver. Jaime Huélamo of Spain finished third, but was disqualified after failing a drug test; the medal was not reassigned. Italy missed the podium, breaking a four-Games streak of gold and silver medals.\nIrish protesters.\nSeven members of the National Cycling Association (NCA) were arrested for disrupting the event. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised separate national federations on either side of the Irish political border. The NCA was an Irish Republican all-Ireland body not affiliated to the ICU. Three NCA members delayed the start by distributing leaflets, and the other four joined mid-race to ambush Irish competitor Noel Teggart, causing a minor pile-up.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). Freddy Maertens of Belgium was favored; he had finished second to Régis Ovion (also racing in Munich) at the 1971 world championships and won 50 races in 1971 and 1972.\nCameroon, Jamaica, Malawi, and Togo each made their debut in the men's individual road race; East Germany competed separately for the first time. Great Britain made its ninth appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 200 kilometre course. It was a \"relatively easy and flat\" course.\nResults.\nThe field was relatively tight until lap 6, when a pack of 35 cyclists broke away to form a lead group. Kuiper made his move in the last lap, gaining significant separation from the pack.\nNote:"

He was born in Nagpur, India, and did his schooling at the prestigious Oak Grove School, Mussoorie and later at St. Joseph's College, Nainital.\nIn the 1928 Summer Olympics, he played five matches as goalkeeper, and no goals were scored against him. Four years later, he played one match against the United States as goalkeeper. The American team scored one goal against him, while he was off the field signing autographs (the final score was 24–1 in India's favour, a world record at that time). In the 1936 Summer Olympics he played four matches as goalkeeper. One goal was scored against him. This tally of conceding only two goals over three Olympic Games remains an Olympic record to this day."

He currently works as a scout for the Chunichi Dragons.\nCareer.\nMartínez was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays in 1984, and spent several years in the minors before making his major league debut in 1992. He played in seven games that year, and eight games in 1993, before being traded to the Chicago White Sox. However, he did not play in the major leagues again, and was eventually signed by the Seibu Lions in 1997.\nHe was expected to become the team's cleanup batter, replacing Kazuhiro Kiyohara, who had signed with the Yomiuri Giants. He went on to play the entire season as the team's designated hitter, batting .305 with 31 home runs and 108 RBIs. He was recognized for his standout hitting with a Best Nine award in 1997, and his round appearance made him a popular figure among fans, who gave him the nickname \"Maruchan\". He continued his success the following year, hitting 30 homers and driving in 95 runs, but was not re-signed following the 1998 season. The Lions would miss Martínez's presence in the lineup in 1999, as the poor performances of his foreign replacements in Greg Blosser and Alan Zinter, and the team's overall lack of power, were significant factors in the Lions not winning their third straight Pacific League title.\nMartínez spent the beginning of 1999 playing in the Mexican League, but was called back to Japan by the Yomiuri Giants, who signed him in June. Martínez was ineffective as a pinch-hitter, but contributed greatly after becoming the regular left fielder. He continued his hitting prowess by batting .324 with 16 homers and 56 RBIs, but his poor fielding often required a defensive substitution late in games. He also filled in at first base, his natural position, over the course of his three seasons with the Giants when Kazuhiro Kiyohara was injured. \nHe hit well again for the Giants in 2000, putting together a .288 average with 17 home runs and 64 RBIs. Injuries and weight problems relegated Martinez to a bench role in 2001, and he batted just .237 with 10 homers and 27 RBIs. Martinez retired after his contract expired at the end of 2001, and he later joined the Central League's Chunichi Dragons as a scout in 2006."

        "text": "The following is a list of annual leaders in saves in Major League Baseball (MLB), with separate lists for the American League and the National League. The list includes several professional leagues and associations that were never part of MLB.\nIn baseball, a save is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under prescribed circumstances. Most commonly a relief pitcher (\"reliever\") earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead. The statistic was created by Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to \"measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers\" and was adopted as an MLB official statistic in 1969. The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date.\nMLB recognizes the player or players in each league with the most saves each season. In retrospect, the five saves by Jack Manning meant he led the National League in its inaugural year, while Bill Hoffer was the American League's first saves champion with three. Mordecai Brown was the first pitcher to record at least 10 saves in a season. Dan Quisenberry, Bruce Sutter, Firpo Marberry, and Ed Walsh are the only pitchers to lead the league in saves five times (though Marberry and Walsh did so before 1969). Sutter is also tied with Harry Wright, Dan Quisenberry and Craig Kimbrel for the most consecutive seasons leading the league in saves with four. "

        "text": "Mark Andrew Reynolds (born August 3, 1983) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, Milwaukee Brewers, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and two stints with the Colorado Rockies. A right-hander both when batting and throwing, Reynolds was known for his frequent and long home runs, high strikeout totals, and defensive versatility, having been primarily a third baseman before transitioning to first base while playing for the Orioles.\nThe Diamondbacks drafted Reynolds in the 16th round of the 2004 MLB draft from the Cavaliers of the University of Virginia, with whom he played mainly shortstop. In the minor leagues, he played second base, third base, shortstop, and left field. He broke out in 2006 with Lancaster and Tennessee, batting .318 with 31 home runs and 98 runs batted in (RBIs) in 106 games. With the Diamondbacks in 2009, he established career highs in home runs (44), RBIs (102), stolen bases (24), and runs scored (98). \nBetween 2009 and 2011, he finished with top ten home run totals and at bats per home run rates. In 2009, he set the all-time record for most strikeouts among batters in a season (223). He also holds two other of the ten highest single-season strikeout totals (211 and 204), and led the league in strikeouts in four consecutive seasons. As of 2018, he led all active major league ballplayers in career strikeouts, with 1,870.\nEarly life.\nMark Andrew Reynolds was born on August 3, 1983, in Pikeville, Kentucky. Reynolds later moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 1994 he played for the Virginia Blasters Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) baseball program, where one of his teammates was B. J. Upton. Both would eventually join B. J.'s younger brother Justin, David Wright and Ryan Zimmerman on a Hampton Roads-based autumn showcase team called the Mets in 2000. The five players, who were all shortstops at the time, rotated among the three positions on the left side and middle of the infield. While with the Mets, Reynolds was nicknamed \"Skeletor\" due to his lanky build and \"Forrest Gump\" because of his awkward running style.\nReynolds was a four-year letterman in baseball, basketball and golf at First Colonial High School, where he graduated in 2001.\nCollege career.\nIn his three years at the University of Virginia, he was the starting shortstop on the Cavaliers baseball team. During his sophomore and junior campaigns, he played alongside Zimmerman, who had been shifted to third base. Reynolds led the team in home runs (15) in 2002, runs batted in (46) in 2003 and triples (5) in 2004. His 60 runs scored in 2004 matched a school record which has since been broken. His 35 career home runs at Virginia is tied for second all-time in Cavaliers history. Through August 2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with former Cavaliers Michael Schwimer, Javier López, and Zimmerman.\nIn 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, and returned to the league in 2003 to play for the Harwich Mariners.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks selected Reynolds in the 16th round (476th overall) of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. During the 2004 season, he played 64 games with the Yakima Bears of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League and four games each with the South Bend Silver Hawks of the Class A Midwest League and the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League, with an overall batting average for the season of .253 with 12 home runs and 42 runs batted in (RBIs).\nHe spent all of 2005 with South Bend, again hitting .253, with 19 home runs and 76 RBIs. He played 76 games for Lancaster in 2006, batting .337. hitting 23 home runs, and driving in 77 runs, and was promoted to play for the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern League, appearing in 30 games for the Smokies and batting .272 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs. He began 2007 with the Diamondbacks′ new Class AA affiliate, the Mobile BayBears of the Southern League, and hit .306 for them in 37 games, with six home runs and 22 RBIs.\nArizona Diamondbacks (2007–2010).\n2007 season.\nReynolds made his major league debut on May 16, 2007, against the Colorado Rockies. He had been called up from Double-A Mobile when Chad Tracy was placed on the disabled list. Reynolds made an instant impact with the Diamondbacks, driving in 14 runs in his first 15 MLB games.\nReynolds was the latest of a number of players from the Tidewater region of Virginia to make it to the major leagues in recent years, a list that includes David Wright, Ryan Zimmerman, B.J. Upton, Justin Upton, and Michael Cuddyer.\nReynolds ended the season third among National League rookies in strikeouts (129), fourth in runs (62), tied for fourth in triples (4), and tied for sixth in home runs (17). He also drove in 62 runs and had a .279 batting average.\nOn October 3, 2007, when Arizona faced the Chicago Cubs in the first game of the 2007 National League Division Series, Reynolds' seventh-inning home run off of Cubs reliever Carlos Mármol led the Diamondbacks to a 3–1 victory and a three-game sweep of the division series. Reynolds also hit a home run in Game 3 of the 2007 National League Championship Series against the Colorado Rockies. The Diamondbacks eventually lost the league championship series to the Rockies in just four games.\n2008 season.\nOn September 25, Reynolds set a major league record by striking out for the 200th time in one season when he failed to check his swing against St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Joel Piñeiro. He broke the record of 199 set in 2007 by Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Reynolds ultimately finished the season striking out 204 times. He also led the majors in strikeout percentage, with 33.3%.\nReynolds made the most errors (34) and had the lowest fielding percentage (.904) of all major league third basemen.\nHe did have a good offensive year, leading the team in home runs (28) and RBIs (97) to go along with 11 stolen bases and 87 runs scored. His batting average saw a significant dip from his rookie campaign, however, ending with a .239 clip.\n2009 season.\nIn 2009. Reynolds was named one of the five finalists for the National League Final Vote for the All-Star Game, finishing third behind Shane Victorino and Pablo Sandoval.\nOn July 28, Reynolds hit a two-run home run off of Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge landing at 481 feet, making it the longest home run of the 2009 season, and the second-longest home run in the history of Chase Field. He quickly became recognized for hitting towering home runs (25 of his 44 home runs being over 400 feet), averaging his home runs at 430 feet (longest in baseball).\nIn the Diamondbacks' four-game series against the Mets on July 29 – August 3, Reynolds managed to hit the longest home run in the short history of Citi Field, at 461 feet, as well as capped off the series finale with home runs in consecutive innings (first and second). His four home runs at Citi Field rank second all-time in home runs hit at the park by a visiting player.\nOn August 10, 2009, Reynolds was named the NL Player of the Week for the week ending August 9, beating out teammate Ryan Roberts (who finished second) in voting for the honor. Reynolds finished the week hitting .448 with 6 home runs, 32 total bases, 10 RBIs, 1 stolen base, a .515 on-base percentage, and a slugging percentage of 1.103. This was Reynolds's second NL Player of the Week award (the other being earlier this season for the week ending June 14). As tradition with the Player of the Week award, Reynolds received two wrist watches (one for each week), one of which he gave to his father, and the other of which he gave to his grandfather.\nReynolds played at first base for 26 games, where he had a .974 fielding percentage, the second-highest in the league of players with 125 or more innings at first base, and an 8.21 range factor, the best in the league. Reynolds helped improve his defensive skills by working with former Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams, during spring training; work that has raised his fielding percentage by over 50 points from the previous season. He has also made headlines for several notable catches including July 21 in Colorado, July 24 in Arizona, and August 1 in New York.\nHe shattered his own 1-year-old major league record for strikeouts in a season in 2009 with 223. He also hit .260 (batting average), hit 44 home runs, had 102 RBIs, and scored 98 runs, along with 24 stolen bases. He also led the National League in power-speed number (31.1).\nHe led the major leagues in the Three True Outcomes (the total of the three main outcomes not involving defense) with 343.\n2010 season.\nAfter signing a three-year, $14.5 million contract extension on March 18, 2010, Reynolds began the season with two home runs in the first four games of the season. On May 20, Reynolds hit his 100th career home run off of the Giants' Tim Lincecum. Though he finished the season with 32 home runs, the sixth-highest total in the National League, along with 85 RBIs and a career-high 83 walks in 145 games, Reynolds again led the league in strikeouts with 211 and, having reached the mark three times, remained the only player in major league history to have at least 200 strikeouts in a season. Most notably, his .198 batting average established him as the first full-time position player in Major League history to finish the season with a lower batting average (x 1000) than strikeout total.\nBaltimore Orioles (2011–2012).\nReynolds and a player to be named later (John Hester on April 30, 2011) were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for David Hernandez and Kam Mickolio on December 6, 2010. From the Diamondbacks' standpoint, the transaction, which was executed by new general manager Kevin Towers, was to improve the bullpen and reduce the record-breaking strikeout total by the team's batters (1,529 in 2010). The Orioles, on the other hand, needed a starting third baseman and a power hitter.\n2011 season.\nIn 2011, Reynolds led all major leaguers in errors, with 31, as his .897 fielding percentage was the lowest of all major league third basemen, and led the American League in strikeouts, with 196. He batted .221, and was fourth in the league in home runs, with 37.\nOn August 7, facing Ricky Romero of the Toronto Blue Jays, Reynolds became the first player in the history of Oriole Park at Camden Yards (which was 19 years old at the time) to hit a home run into the 2nd Deck (Club Level) in Left Field. ESPN's Home Run Tracker measured the \"True Distance\" of the blast at 463 feet.\n2012 season.\nReynolds was homerless until May 4 when he hit a home run against the Boston Red Sox. On the next day, May 5, he hit a three-run home run, his second of 2012. On May 29, he became the fastest position player to reach 1,000 strikeouts in major-league history, having done so in only 747 career games.\nReynolds started off the 2012 season at third base, but was moved over to play first base, with first baseman Chris Davis moving to third, early in the season. He excelled at first base, playing in 108 games there in 2012 and committing only five errors. He had a fielding percentage of .995, which was tied for fourth-best among first basemen in the major leagues.\nOn August 17, during a game between the Orioles and the Detroit Tigers, third baseman Manny Machado fielded a ground ball off the bat of Jhonny Peralta. Machado threw off line to Reynolds, who had to lay all the way out to catch the ball, and was unable to keep his foot on the bag long enough to record the out. Peralta and Tigers manager Jim Leyland argued to first base umpire Jeff Kellogg, who conferred with home plate umpire Tim Timmons. Kellogg's call was reversed, giving Peralta first base. Reynolds angrily threw his glove to the ground, causing him to be ejected by second base umpire Vic Carapazza. Orioles manager Buck Showalter angrily argued that Reynolds could not be ejected for throwing his glove, but he too was tossed, by third base umpire Marty Foster. Reynolds initially walked back onto the field, as if the umpires reversed the ejection call, only to return to the dugout moments later.\nOn September 6, Reynolds hit two home runs against the New York Yankees in a 10–6 Orioles win. It was only the second time since 1918 that a player had three multi-homer games against the Yankees in a single season, and it was Reynolds′ eighth home run in six games.\nIn 2012, Reynolds batted .221 for the second straight year, with 23 home runs and 69 RBIs. On October 31, the Orioles declined Reynolds's 2013 option. He was non-tendered on November 30, making him a free agent for the first time.\nA tongue-in-cheek article appeared in \"Baseball Prospectus\" in January 2013 that purported to lay out evidence \"proving\" that Reynolds is blind.\nCleveland Indians (2013).\nOn December 9, 2012, Reynolds agreed to a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. On April 13, in a game against the Chicago White Sox, he hit his second career grand slam off of Chris Sale. He had eight home runs with a batting average of .301 in the month of April. However, he batted only .187 from May on. The Indians designated Reynolds for assignment on August 8. When he was designated for assignment, he was leading the team with 15 home runs but his batting average was only .215. The Indians released him on August 12.\nNew York Yankees (2013).\nOn August 15, 2013, Reynolds agreed to a deal with the New York Yankees. In his first at-bat as a member of the Yankees, he hit a home run against the Boston Red Sox. On August 28, Reynolds started at second base for the first time in his career while Robinson Canó and Eduardo Núñez were stricken with injuries. He batted .236 in 36 games with the Yankees, hitting six home runs and driving in 19 runs.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2014).\nOn January 17, 2014, Reynolds signed a minor-league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, with an invitation to major-league camp. Under the deal, Reynolds was to make $2 million, with an additional $500,000 in possible bonuses, if he made the major-league team. On March 25, the Brewers announced that Reynolds had made the Opening Day roster. He played in 130 games for the Brewers, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 45 runs, but posted only a .196 batting average for the season.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2015).\nOn December 11, 2014, Reynolds signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a one-year, $2 million contract that included playing times incentives. After five consecutive seasons with at least 21 home runs but batting averages that hovered between .196 and .221, he agreed to take a role as bench player to back up Matt Adams at first base and Matt Carpenter at third base. Reynolds hit his fourth career grand slam on May 4 against the Cubs, aiding the Cardinals to a 10–9 win. The next game, Reynolds's pinch-hit double drove in the go-ahead runs as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs, 7–4. He drove in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded infield single on June 23 against the Miami Marlins in a 4–3 win.\nAs a member of the Cardinals, Reynolds' first multiple-home-run game came against the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 6−5 extra-inning loss on July 12. It was his 22nd career multi-home-run game. He played in 140 games for the Cardinals, batting .230, with 13 home runs and 48 RBIs.\nSecont stint with Colorado Rockies (2016–2017).\nReynolds and the Colorado Rockies agreed to a one-year, $2.6 million contract on December 16, 2015, including up to an additional $1.1 million in performance bonuses. He appeared in 118 games in the 2016 season, and hit .282./356/.450 with 14 home runs and 53 RBIs in 393 at bats. He hit the third-longest home run in MLB in 2016, at 484 feet.\nReynolds signed a minor league contract with the Rockies on February 1, 2017. The contract included an invitation to spring training.\nDue to an injury to Ian Desmond, Reynolds became the Rockies' Opening Day first baseman for 2017. On April 3, Reynolds went 2-for-3, hitting a two-run home run in the top the second, logging two runs, three RBIs, and a walk on Opening Day against the Brewers. On May 9, in a 10−4 victory versus the Cubs, he tied his personal best by homering in his fourth consecutive game, first achieved August 6−9, 2009. In 520 at bats over 148 games with the Rockies in 2017, Reynolds batted .267/.352/.487 with an .839 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, had 97 RBIs, and hit 30 home runs, his eighth season with 20 or more homers, with 175 strikeouts (4th in the league).\nWashington Nationals (2018).\nA free agent after the conclusion of the 2017 season, Reynolds went unsigned until April 12, 2018, when the Washington Nationals signed him to a minor-league contract. The Nationals assigned him to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League. He played in 10 games for Syracuse, batting .231 with a double and a home run in 39 plate appearances, before the Nationals selected his contract on May 12, after they placed starting first baseman Ryan Zimmerman on the 10-day disabled list with a right oblique strain.\nReynolds made his season debut on May 13, hitting two home runs in the game. On July 6, Reynolds hit a pinch-hit, walk-off home run against the Miami Marlins. The next night, Reynolds went 5–5 with 2 home runs, a double, and a career-high, franchise record-tying 10 RBIs in an 18–4 win over the Marlins. It was the most RBIs in a game by any player in MLB since Scooter Gennett’s 10 RBIs for the Cincinnati Reds during his 4 home run performance on June 6, 2017, and it tied the franchise record set by teammate Anthony Rendon in 2017. On July 9, he was named the National League Player of the Week after slashing .625/.684/1.313 with 12 RBIs and 3 home runs in seven games. For the 2018 season, he batted .248/.328/.476 with 13 home runs and 40 RBIs in 206 at bats.\nThird stint with Colorado Rockies (2019).\nOn January 30, 2019, Reynolds signed another minor league contract with the Rockies with an invitation to spring training. If added to the Rockies' 40-man roster, Reynolds will receive a one-year contract for $1 million plus up to an additional $1 million in performance bonuses. Reynolds said he had interest from other teams but wanted to play with a contender, and expects to make spot starts or be a pinch-hitter off the bench. He is expected to be a backup first baseman for Daniel Murphy, who was Reynolds' teammate in Washington. On March 22, Reynolds was announced to have made the roster for the 2019 season. On July 21, 2019, Reynolds was designated for assignment. He was released on July 26, 2019. In 2019 he batted .170/.290/.311 with four home runs in 135 at bats.\nReynolds announced his retirement on April 9, 2020."

        "title": "Eddie Murphy (baseball)",
        "text": "John Edward Murphy (October 2, 1891 – February 21, 1969), nicknamed \"Honest Eddie\", was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nHe appeared in three World Series. His first two were with the Athletics in 1913 and 1914 World Series. Murphy appeared in the 1919 World Series as a member of the Chicago White Sox, a series best known for the Black Sox Scandal. Murphy is also known for having the longest hitting streak to begin a career of any player under 21 years old in MLB history, having started his career with hits in 12 straight games in 1912. Jordan Walker of the St. Louis Cardinals tied this record on April 12, 2023 against the Colorado Rockies.\nEarly life.\nEddie Murphy was born on October 2, 1891, the youngest child of Charles and Theresa Murphy. Charles Murphy was a college educated man which afforded him the ability to stay out of the coal mines of Pennsylvania, which was considered dangerous work. Instead, he worked as a hotel manager which was located near a rail line. The education of his father also helped provide a future for young Eddie that kept him out of the coal mines.\nProfessional baseball career.\nMurphy began his professional baseball career with the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern League, later named the International League. On August 24, 1912, the Orioles traded Murphy and Jimmy Walsh to the Philadelphia Athletics for Bris Lord, Claud Derrick, and cash.\nMurphy made his professional debut at the age of nineteen for the Scranton Miners of the New York State League in 1911. The team was managed by former MLB star Monte Cross. After getting 97 hits with a .300 batting average, Murphy moved on to the Baltimore Orioles. Before he made his pro debut, Murphy played as a ringer, more or less, for the Honsdale of the semi-pro Anthracite League.\nMurphy played in his first major league game on August 26, 1912. During his first season, he posted a batting average of .317 over 33 games, and he had a hit in each of his first 12 games, from August 26 to September 5, setting a record for rookies under 21 that still stands today after more than a century. During the 1913 season, he became a \"regular\" in the outfield and participated in the A's World Series contest against the New York Giants. In 1915, the Chicago White Sox purchased his contract. Murphy played the remainder of the 1915 and next six seasons for the White Sox.\nMurphy was a base stealing threat in the early part of his career, finishing eighth in the American league in 1914 with 36 steals and ninth the following season with 33 stolen bases. He would go on steal 111 bases throughout his career in the majors. \nMurphy had played for an A's team that was one of the best in the American League. However, after the underdog Boston Braves upset and swept the A's in the 1914 World Series, an angry Connie Mack sold off or outright released his best players. Murphy was one of the few hold overs on a depleted A's squad. However, his fortunes would change when Philadelphia went to Chicago to face the White Sox, and Murphy was informed by Mack that his contract had just been sold to the White Sox. Murphy was mainly a pinch hitter for most of his time in Chicago. In 1917, Murphy was on his third pennant winning team in five season, but did not appear in the World Series, as White Sox manager Clarence Rowland left Murphy off the play off roster in favor of Shano Collins.\nWith \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson and Happy Felsch called up by the military to build ships in the shipyard, Murphy regained a starting role. The depleted White Sox fell to sixth place and Rowland was fired and replaced by Kid Gleason.\nIn 1919, Murphy appeared in 30 games and hit for a .486 batting average. That year, the White Sox made the World Series. It was an infamous series, and as a result of the Black Sox Scandal, six members of the White Sox were banned from Major League Baseball; Murphy was not one of those players. Consequently, he was given the nickname \"Honest Eddie.\" Unlike before, Murphy was on the roster and made a few pinch hit appearances.\nAs the 1920 season rolled along, the White Sox were fighting with the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees for the pennant. Rumors swirled around that the fix was in for that season just as it had been in the World Series. After seven players were implicated in the fix, Murphy replaced the now suspended Buck Weaver at third base. The suspension took its toll on the White Sox, who quickly fell out of contention. White Sox owner Charles Comiskey issued checks in the amount of $1,500 to the players like Murphy who did not partake in the fix, telling the players they were wronged out of money that should have been theirs under no fault of their own.\nThe saga of the Black Sox scandal didn't end there for Murphy. In 1926, Murphy was called to testify before the baseball Commissioner Landis. Swede Risberg and Chick Gandil claimed that in 1917, the Detroit Tigers threw a series and that the members of the White Sox paid them to do so. Eddie Collins admitted that a collection was taken up among the players of the White Sox, but it wasn't for the Tigers to throw the series, but it was as a \"reward\" for the Tigers beating the Red Sox. Murphy testified that he never gave money to the collection and that he had no clue of the reward money being collected. After a brief investigation, Landis cleared Murphy and the other white Sox players and dismissed the claims of Risberg and Gandil.\nOn June 1, 1921 the Cleveland Indians placed a waiver claim on Murphy and purchased his contract from the White Sox. From 1921 until 1925, Murphy played for the Columbus Senators of the International league. Through his stint with Columbus, Murphy continued to be an excellent hitter, hitting .397 in 1925 at the age of 33, which won him the league's batting title. In 1927, he played for the Rochester Tribe (who would later go on to be called the Rochester Red Wings), playing for manager George Stallings and alongside former MLB star Rabbit Maranville. At the age of 35, Murphy appeared in 83 games for the Tribe, again batting over three hundred, batting .341 for the season.\nMurphy ended his MLB career with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1926. In 11 years, he had 680 hits, scored 411 runs with 111 stolen bases, and a .287 lifetime batting average with four home runs and 195 RBI. In his final major league game, Murphy only had one at bat. Giants pitcher Jimmy Ring got Murphy to hit into a double play in the Pirates 9–5 loss to New York.\nAfter his brief return to the majors, Murphy split the 1927 season between the Montreal Royals and Jersey City Skeeters before he retired for good.\nPost MLB career.\nAfter retiring, Murphy relocated with his wife, son, and daughter to Dunmore, Pennsylvania. He managed the local semi-pro team and later worked as a supervisor with the Works Progress Administration and helped arrange exhibitions for visiting troops during World War II. Murphy died on February 21, 1969, at the age of 77. He was buried at Queen of Peace Cemetery in Hawley, Pennsylvania."

There were 27 participants from 27 nations, with each nation limited to one competitor. The event was won by Russell Mockridge of Australia, the nation's first victory in the men's track time trial since 1932 and second overall (tying France for most of any nation). Marino Morettini's silver was Italy's first medal in the event; Raymond Robinson's bronze was South Africa's. France's three-Games podium streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The only returning cyclist from 1948 was tenth-place finisher Onni Kasslin of Finland. Russell Mockridge of Australia had competed in the road race in 1948; he had won the sprint and time trial at the 1950 British Empire Games and taken second place in the 1951 sprint world championship. Marino Morettini was the amateur world record holder.\nCzechoslovakia, Guatemala, Jamaica, Japan, Romania, and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the men's track time trial.

        "text": "The men's sprint (or \"scratch race\") at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland was held from July 28 to July 31, 1952. There were 27 participants from 27 nations, with each nation limited to a single cyclist. The event was won by Enzo Sacchi of Italy, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's sprint. Lionel Cox's silver was Australia's first medal in the event. Werner Potzernheim of Germany took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the semifinalists from 1948 returned. The heavy favorite was Enzo Sacchi, the reigning world champion. The man who would have been his biggest competitor, Russell Mockridge of Australia, competed only in the track time trial and tandem.\nFinland, Guatemala, Jamaica, Japan, Romania, and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 10th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds: four main rounds and three repechages. Each race involved the riders starting simultaneously and next to each other, from a standing start. Because the early part of races tend to be slow-paced and highly tactical, only the time for the last 200 metres of the one-kilometre race is typically recorded.\nThe trend in the Olympic sprint competition was toward expansion of a best-of-three match format (beginning in 1932 for the final, expanding in 1936 and 1948 to more rounds); the 1952 edition bucked that trend by returning to an entirely single-race format for the first time since 1928. It also used races with up to five cyclists, where other recent Games had limited individuals races to two or three competitors. A repechage was used after each round instead of only early rounds; late-round races featured three cyclists instead of the head-to-head format that had become common. This also meant that there was no bronze medal match.\nThe first round consisted of eight heats of three or four cyclists each; the winner of each heat advanced to the quarterfinals while all others were sent to the first repechage. The first repechage had four heats, one of four cyclists and three of five cyclists (though in one of these heats only three men started); again, the winner advanced to the quarterfinals, but this time all others were eliminated. The 12 quarterfinalists competed in four heats of three cyclists each; winners advanced to the semifinals while second and third place cyclists went to the second repechage. The second repechage had two heats of four cyclists each; the winner advanced to the semifinals while the others were all eliminated. With six semifinalists, the semifinals consisted of two heats of three men each. Once again, the winner of each heat advanced while others were sent to a third repechage. The third repechage was a single race of the four semifinal losers, with the winner advancing to the final. The final featured the remaining three riders.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nCyril Peacock broke the Olympic record with 11.7 seconds in the sixth heat of round 1. Werner Potzernheim matched that in the first heat of the first repechage; John Millman did the same in the third heat. Peacock recorded the same time again in the second quarterfinal. Potzernheim bettered that time in the fourth quarterfinal, finishing the last 200 metres in 11.6 seconds. Lionel Cox matched that time in the second semifinal, with Potzernheim tying it again in the third repechage.\nResults.\nSecond repechage.\nSecond repechage heat 2.\nA crash in the original race of this heat resulted in a re-run. Giménez had the lead with Martens on his outside; Lenormand hit Martens's back wheel while trying to pass him. Lenormand had to be taken to the hospital for his injuries and could not compete in the re-run. Martens was able to race, but was hampered by his injuries."

He later became a professional coach in the 2000s and 2010s. He has been an assistant coach of the New Zealand Warriors and the New Zealand Kiwis. He continues to work as a commentator.\nBackground.\nJustin Morgan was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nMorgan's career started with the Parramatta Eels. He later played for the Canberra Raiders, and, more famously, with the New Zealand Warriors who made the 2002 National Rugby League Grand Final after winning the Minor Premiership. He retired from playing at the age of 26.\nCoaching career.\nMorgan rose to prominence as coach of French club, Toulouse Olympique in 2005, when they reached the Rugby League Challenge Cup Semi-finals. In August 2005, Morgan took control of Hull Kingston Rovers after he was lured to the club by their chief executive Paul Lakin. It was a poor end to 2005 for Rovers after winning the Northern Rail Cup against Castleford Tigers as they were dumped out of the play-offs at home to Halifax. \nThe 2006 season however was far better for Morgan. His side lost just two games out of the eighteen they played that year, finishing top and then beat Widnes Vikings 29–22 to advance to the Grand Final at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington. They then beat the Vikings 29-16 which guaranteed promotion to Super League for 2007. On the cup front, Rovers achieved a huge upset in the quarter finals of the Challenge Cup to Super League side Warrington Wolves, running out 40-36 winners on the day. Rovers however reliquinshed their hold on the Northern Rail Cup as Leigh Centurions beat them 22–18 at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool in the final.\nIn their first year in Super League, Rovers started well, winning four out of their first five games including wins over Wigan Warriors and Leeds Rhinos. They led the table after victory over the Rhinos. Speculation over Morgan's future intensified as Leeds Rhinos Tony Smith, the new Great Britain Lions coach, and rumour had it that Morgan was being lined up as a replacement. However, on 18 April 2006, Morgan committed himself to the club until at least 2010, two years more than his previous contract stated.\nMorgan signed on as an assistant coach to the Canberra Raiders for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, replacing Quentin Pongia.\nIn 2014 Morgan joined Melbourne Storm as an assistant coach.\nMorgan re-joined the New Zealand Warriors for the 2016 season, as an assistant coach.\nOn 28 September 2016 he was announced as an assistant coach to the New Zealand national rugby league team."

        "text": "Michael G. Barnett (born October 9, 1948 in Olds, Alberta) is a Canadian ice hockey executive currently serving as Senior Advisor to the President-General Manager of the New York Rangers. He is best known in the world of hockey as a former agent representing sports icon Wayne Gretzky for two decades. He was listed among the \"100 Most Powerful People In Sports\" by \"The Sporting News\" on six occasions from 1994 to 2000. During his 12 years as President of International Management Group's hockey division, Barnett represented a who's who of the National Hockey League. Barnett negotiated the playing and marketing contracts for Wayne Gretzky, Brett Hull, Jaromír Jágr, Sergei Fedorov, Paul Coffey, Joe Thornton, Mats Sundin, Lanny McDonald, Grant Fuhr, Marty McSorley, Alexander Mogilny, Owen Nolan, Daniel Sedin and Henrik Sedin and numerous others. His ingenuity in finding language that challenged the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement, in finding products and companies for his clients that were groundbreaking in their launches, and his perpetual attention to the public relations of his clients, were all hallmarks of his career in athlete representation. Following his two-decades as one of the most highly regarded agents in all of sports, Barnett went on to become the General Manager of the Phoenix Coyotes from 2001 to 2007.\nPersonal life.\nBarnett grew up in Western Canada, before attending St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, on a hockey scholarship. He later attended the University of Calgary in his home province of Alberta. He was a two sport collegiate athlete in both football and hockey. Barnett's professional career led him to play with both the Chicago Cougars and Houston Aeros organizations of the World Hockey Association. He was a part of WHA history, playing in the first ever exhibition game between the WHA (Houston Aeros) and the NHL (St. Louis Blues). His playing career ended due to an eye injury in 1975.\nCareer.\nFollowing his playing career, Barnett and long time hockey agent Gus Badali created Sierra Sports Group. In 1982, Barnett formed his own sports management company, CorpSport International, based in Edmonton, Alberta. Modeled after Mark McCormack's International Management Group, CorpSport became the Canadian industry leader in representing a wide variety of Canada's top athletes. Wayne Gretzky and Lanny McDonald (hockey), Jim Nelford and Richard Zokol (golf), Kurt Browning (ice skating), Willie de Wit (boxing), Matt Dunigan (football), Cody Snyder (rodeo), and Steve Podborski, Brian Stemmle, Rob Boyd and Karen Percy (skiing) were all Canada's premiere athletes in their respective sports. CorpSport also represented Karen Baldwin, who was Canada's first ever Miss Universe in 1982.\nIn 1988, Barnett merged CorpSport International with IMG, where he ran the Los Angeles office. Over the course of his twelve years with IMG, Barnett rose to International Vice-President. CorpSport's Vice-President, Kevin Albrecht also joined Barnett at IMG, becoming President of IMG Canada, in Toronto.\nIn August 2001, Barnett left IMG and the athlete representation business to join his former client Wayne Gretzky, who had become an owner with the Phoenix Coyotes. In his first year as General Manager, the team established their best record in franchise's history. Seven years later, several key players that were signed by Barnett - all-time leading scorer Shane Doan, Keith Yandle, Martin Hanzal, and Derek Morris - remained on the team as important pieces of the Coyotes 2013-2014 roster. In May 2006, Barnett was named with Ken Holland to the management of Team Canada at the World Hockey Championships. In Riga, Latvia that year, Canada sent its youngest team ever (Sidney Crosby, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards). In April 2007, after six years, Barnett was relieved of his duties as General Manager of the Coyotes.\nIn July 2008, Barnett joined the New York Rangers, as Senior Advisor to the President-General Manager, Glen Sather. He remains in that capacity today.\nMarketing, Representation and Contracts.\nUpon his relocation to Los Angeles in 1988 as president of IMG Hockey, Barnett grew the division into one of the leading hockey representation companies in the NHL. Carefully hand choosing IMG staffers, former players and executives from the NHLPA, IMG Hockey under Barnett had nine full-time agents in five countries who annually represented a half dozen first round NHL draft picks. A staple of Barnett's presidency with IMG Hockey was their annual visit to the local Children's Hospital on the eve of the NHL draft in whichever city it was being held. The IMG agents and their fifteen to twenty draft prospects would spend the Friday night handing out NHL merchandise to hospitalized kids. The annual event was not for publicity purposes, rather it was closed to the media and made available only to the children, their families and the IMG Hockey group. Several of Barnett's IMG colleagues have gone on to be recognized as leaders in their field, notably Pat Brisson, Claes Elefalk and J.P. Barry, who later moved from IMG to CAA.\nDuring the NHL's 1994 lockout, Gretzky decided to put a team together and barnstorm Europe (Ninety Nine All Stars Tour), much like Babe Ruth had done decades before. Barnett was in charge of the eight game schedule and all of the tours logistics. With the support of IMG's Scandinavian office, the tour was an overwhelming success, selling out Europe's biggest arenas before Gretzky and Friends had even departed America. As General Manager of the Ninety Nine All Stars, Barnett arranged for youth hockey clinics in each European city, utilizing the NHL stars. Giving back to the community was forever a hallmark of the Gretzky-Barnett relationship, whether it be North America or beyond. With nine NHL Hall-Of-Famers in the lineup (Gretzky, Messier, Hull, Yzerman, Federov, Coffey, Fuhr, Blake, MacInnis), Barnett arranged for the live television rights to be sold to Canada's CBC Network.\nBarnett's creativity was not limited to the hockey world. In 1990, Barnett took his concept for an animated television series to DIC entertainment in Los Angeles. Not long after, the Saturday morning series ProStars, featuring Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and Bo Jackson, began airing on NBC.\nThe same year, with IMG's resources behind him and Mark McCormack as his mentor, Barnett developed new business for IMG's golf division. He was instrumental in the creation of The Norman Challenge, a made for television event that pitted Wayne Gretzky, Larry Bird and Ivan Lendl against Greg Norman on the CBS Network. Following its ratings success, IMG took the event to Swedish television using Swedish celebrity athletes. In 1999, Barnett worked with IMG's Executive VP Barry Frank in conceiving Monday Night Golf, which saw Tiger Woods taking on Sergio García under the lights for ABC Sports. Barnett's further involvement in IMG's golf division saw him acting as the agent for PGA Tour Hall of Fame golfer Raymond Floyd.\nMarketing Wayne Gretzky.\nIn the early 1980s, with Gretzky establishing himself as the NHL's best player and the ultimate spokesperson, Barnett and Gretzky designed a plan that would see \"The Great One\" enter into exclusive endorsement relationships with only blue-chip national and international corporations. There would be no short term deals, and every relationship would be tied to a third party charity that would benefit from the efforts of Gretzky and the corporation. Gretzky's brilliance, on and off the ice, combined with Barnett's vision would be a marriage that lasted over two decades.\nDespite playing in Edmonton, Alberta, Barnett convinced Canon (in 1983) to create a national billboard campaign that saw Gretzky's Edmonton Oiler image high above Times Square in New York. He also convinced North American contemporary artists Andy Warhol and LeRoy Neiman to release prestigious limited editions of the hockey legend.\nComplete with an Edmonton Oilers uniform and accessory sweatsuit, Mattel Toys launched the Wayne Gretzky doll.\nCanada's longest standing department store chain, Hudson's Bay Company, debuted a Wayne Gretzky section in every store exclusively selling the Gretzky brand of men's clothing for fall, winter and summer.\nRather than see Gretzky endorse an existing cereal brand, Barnett sought a proven company to create Gretzky's own cereal brand. Shortly thereafter, in 1984, General Mills launched ProStars cereal nationally in Canada. It was the first presweetened cereal that used aspartame as a sweetener. The cereal, with the side and back panels all Gretzky related, was popular for many years.\nGretzky was also a long time spokesman for Coca-Cola. In keeping with their long standing mandate of tying in a charity, Barnett worked with Coca-Cola to create the \"Coca-Cola Future Stars\" hockey camp that annually gave under privileged and mentally handicapped kids the chance to skate with Gretzky and other stars. In 1989, Gretzky appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial that aired during Super Bowl XXIII. It was the first ever US network commercial to air in 3D.\nIn 1988, Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. With Barnett's relocation to Los Angeles, Gretzky's arrival in a major US market took his profile to another level. Hockey itself established a whole new foothold in Southern California. Barnett recognized this growing popularity, along with an absence of ice arenas. Soon, multimillion-dollar Wayne Gretzky Roller Hockey Center's began to spring up in California, with youngsters wearing Wayne Gretzky's Ultra Wheels roller hockey equipment.\nOn the ice, Gretzky switched from Titan's wooden hockey stick to Easton's aluminum model. Barnett convinced Chairman Jim Easton to create a bright, new, chrome aluminum shaft that would be used exclusively by Gretzky in NHL action. The entire hockey world could not help but notice that Gretzky had made the change and Easton climbed from 12th to 1st in hockey stick sales.\nIn his King's jersey, Gretzky also launched on network television, the first ViewCam for Sharp Electronics.\nEven more memorable was Gretzky's single line \"no!\" in the famous Bo Jackson Nike commercial. Barnett and Gretzky worked with Nike from the early 1980s to his last game in the National Hockey League. With Gretzky, Nike broke into the hockey business and created their own line of equipment that sold worldwide. The last pair of skates that Gretzky wore in his final game as a Ranger were the latest Nike model.\nIn late 1996, Barnett reached for the sky with Campbell Soup Company, who had begun aggressively marketing their Chunky Soup brand in sports. In October 1996, Gretzky became the first person ever to appear on a Campbell's Soup label. Barnett insisted that the \"www.gretzky.com\" web address be displayed on each one of its first-run 55 million labels.\nRepresentation and Contracts.\nIn 1992, Barnett and his fellow talented IMG Hockey agents were representing a significant number of the NHL's biggest names. At Barnett's direction, the rights to those players names, images and likenesses were being held out of the majority of the NHLPA's (National Hockey League Players Association) group licensing contracts. Upon Bob Goodenow's arrival as the new Executive Director of the NHLPA, Goodenow took the NHLPA's licensing in-house. Before this change, a significant percentage of NHLPA licensing revenues had been going to an outside, third party licensing company. With the new licensing arrangement, Barnett agreed to include all of IMG's hockey clients in future NHLPA licensing deals. Having IMG's stars on board, the NHLPA's licensing revenues increased monumentally.\nDuring his years at IMG hockey, Barnett negotiated numerous contracts for IMG clients that often created breakthroughs, either economically or creatively or both, which benefitted all NHL players. In 1993, Barnett negotiated a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings that would pay Gretzky $25.5 million, an average of $8.5 million per year. The contract made Gretzky the highest paid athlete in all of North American team sports. Anticipating a labor dispute, Barnett structured the majority of the contract in the signing bonus, which saved Gretzky millions of dollars when the NHL ceased operation for a few months in 1994. Signing bonuses, but not salaries, are paid during a strike or lockout. Heavily loaded signing bonuses are now standard in the contracts of all major star athletes.\nIn 1998, Barnett signed Pittsburgh Penguins Jaromír Jágr, the NHL's best player at the time, to a 6-year, $48 million contract. That contract was the richest in total value and called for the highest annual salary in NHL history - $9.5 million per year over its last four years.\nOffer sheets have always been difficult for NHL agents to procure. Barnett succeeded in attracting three such offer sheets, the most of any NHLPA registered agent to date. In 1993, Barnett convinced the St. Louis Blues to sign Marty McSorley to an offer sheet worth $10 million. The Los Angeles Kings matched the offer, keeping the rights to McSorley. The contract then put McSorley ahead in salary of NHL all-star defensemen Chris Chelios, Ray Bourque and Al MacInnis.\nIn August 1997, the Toronto Maple Leafs presented an offer sheet to Swedish defenseman Mattias Öhlund, an unsigned 1994 first round pick of the Vancouver Canucks. Again, Barnett had done his job. Vancouver was forced to match, paying Öhlund $10 million total, with a $7.5 million signing bonus. It was several times greater than the Canucks original offer to Öhlund.\nIn February 1998, Barnett secured an offer sheet from the Carolina Hurricanes for Sergei Federov of the Detroit Red Wings. The $38 million, 6-year deal was appropriate for Federov, who had helped the Red Wings win the Stanley Cup in 1997. A provision in the contract that Barnett created was the ultimate \"poison pill\". Federov's $28 million signing bonus would be due in full if his team was to play in the Conference Final. Carolina was in last place at the time, while Detroit was in first. The Red Wings matched the offer, keeping the rights to Federov. Five months later, the Red Wings were forced to pay the total $28 million signing bonus when the team won the Western Conference. The NHL filed a grievance in opposition to Barnett's creative language, but an NHL arbitrator ruled in favor of Federov and Barnett.\nBarnett also used his creativity and negotiating skills on behalf of other high first round picks in the NHL Draft. In 1997, it was widely believed that the Boston Bruins would select Joe Thornton with the #1 overall pick. When the Bruins drafted him with the first selection, Barnett convinced the team to agree to a completely new contract format for entry-level players. The contract, often still referred to as the \"Thornton model\", forever changed rookie contracts in the NHL. Every first round pick after Thornton used the model. It became a standard understanding between player agents and NHL teams that the Thornton model would be required in order to sign top draft picks.\nIn 1999, the talented Sedin twins, Daniel and Henrik, from Sweden were entering the NHL Draft, both rated in the first round. The twins desire to play together in North America meant that they had to be drafted by the same team. Barnett worked directly with Vancouver Canucks General Manager, Brian Burke, together convincing all other NHL teams to pass on both twins. This allowed Vancouver to draft the Sedin's at #2 and #3. Daniel and Henrik Sedin have been the core of the Vancouver Canucks offense since that day."

        "title": "Tom Hancock (basketball)",
        "text": "Tom Hancock (born January 15, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is an American basketball player and coach. He started coaching college basketball at the University of Maryland in 1978, working for Lefty Driesell. After a year at the University of Evansville, he went to the University of Tennessee at Martin in the Gulf South Conference. Prior to his arrival, Tennessee Martin had lost more games than any other conference school. From the 1982-83 season until 1988, Hancock’s teams won more than any other school in the GSC; won two conference championships, were rated in the top 20 in Division II basketball four times, and went to the NCAA tournament twice. Hancock was voted GSC Coach of the Year in 1982-83 and was named the Best Men’s Basketball Coach in the history of Tennessee Martin by the ESPN Encyclopedia of College Basketball.\nOldham Celtics.\nIn the spring of 1992, Patrick O'Donnell called Coach Hancock and asked him if he was interested in coming to England to coach the Oldham Celtics for the 1992-93 basketball season. The Celtics were going to compete in the British Basketball League (BBL) for the second time in club history. The first time the Celtics played in the BBL - the United Kingdom top league - they only managed to win one game. Hancock was directed to recruit two american players to bring with him. Recruiting in both America and attending european tryout camps for american players, he and Pat O'Donnell found two players who were good enough to make the BBL all-star team in their first year. The Celtics finished the season in the upper half of the league table, and Hancock was chosen to coach the North Team in the BBL All-Star game. At the presentation night end of the year banquet, co-owner Yaro Martynik said, “We have signed some top quality basketball players in the past, but Tom Hancock has proved to be our best ever signing … He has made a tremendous impact…” \nNewcastle Eagles.\n In the spring of 1996, the Newcastle Eagles contacted Coach Hancock with an offer to coach the basketball team for the 1996-87 season in the BBL. The Sunderland/Newcastle club had not qualified for the playoffs the previous five years and were looking for new leadership. It was understood that Hancock would be allowed to make changes in the team roster once the season commenced. \n The Eagles were under the umbrella of Newcastle United Football under the leadership of Sir John Hall. Coach Hancock became acquainted with Sir John and his family. He was invited to the home of Sir John for dinner with other guests; he sat in Sir John’s private box at James Park for the Liverpool Football match, and he was invited by Sir John to have lunch with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at a business man’s lunch.\n Coach Hancock made two significant changes to the team roster, bringing in two american players who made the All-Star team while playing in the BBL. Hancock was named coach of the month, during the season while leading the Eagles to the BBL playoffs. \nMilton Keynes Lions 1999-2000.\n In the summer of 1999, Coach Hancock and the ownership of the Milton Keynes Lions reached an agreement for Hancock to coach the Lions for the 1999-2000 season. Milton Keynes had never had success in the BBL as was reported in BRITBALL labeling the Lions as “The worst franchise of the nineties.”\n Milton Keynes had not reached the playoffs for the previous eight seasons, but Hancock took charge with a roster he felt he could work with, he guided the team throughout the year with a stint back in America tending to family illness. The Lions made the playoffs for the first time in nine years, setting the stage for future success. At the end of the year awards dinner, the owner said, \"In some ways, Tom is the best coach I've ever seen.\"\nMilton Keynes Lions 2006-2007.\n During the winter of the 2005-2006 BBL season, Coach Hancock received a surprise phone call from the Milton Keynes Management asking him of his availability to return to England and coach the Lions for a second time. Milton Keynes was in the midst of a losing season and was expected to finish outside of the playoffs.\n Coach Hancock spent the remainder of the basketball season scouting american college basketball players feeling that changes would need to be made to a roster that was losing heavily. He found two excellent players knowing that one all-star caliber player can make a big difference. However, the roster remained the same except for a change at the guard position.\n In spite of this, and injuries to the two best players, the Lions finished with the best record in the history of the club in the non-divisional playoff league table structure, and made the playoffs. Along the way, Hancock was again chosen Coach of the Month, while guiding his fourth club in British Basketball to the playoffs in four tries, none of which had made it to the playoffs the year before Coach Hancock’s arrival. Coach Hancock left after the season knowing he would not return unless he had full control over player recruitment. At that point in time, he was the last non-playing american to coach full time in the United Kingdom."

He became captain of Bristol in 1957 and was central in the club's adoption of an adventurous and attractive style of play that became known as \"rugby Bristol fashion\".\nBlake's approach to the game was immediately successful.

The points scored record was then broken in the two subsequent seasons.\nEschewing kicking, Blake emphasised passing and running with the ball.

He also played for the Barbarians.\nBy profession a teacher, Blake was an inspirational teacher of history at Henbury School in Bristol, as well as St Brendan's College, and was Headmaster of St Wilfrid's Catholic Comprehensive in Crawley, Sussex.

He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast White Sox in 1980 and played with the Class-A Appleton Foxes of the Midwest League in 1981 and 1982.\nOn September 7, 1982 he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds (along with Wade Rowdon) as a player to be named later in the deal that had previously sent Jim Kern to the White Sox. He spent 1983 with the AA Waterbury Reds in the Eastern League, where he hit .257 in 131 games.\nHe was promoted to AAA in 1984 and assigned to the Wichita Aeros of the American Association. He hit .283 in 117 games. The Reds switched their AAA team to the Denver Zephyrs in 1985 and to the Nashville Sounds in 1987 and Garcia played with all of them.\nHe made his Major League debut on April 6, 1987 and had a sacrifice fly as a pinch hitter.

        "title": "1983 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 1983 America's Cup was a 12-metre class yacht racing series which pitted the defending New York Yacht Club's \"Liberty\" against the Royal Perth Yacht Club's challenger, \"Australia II\". The September 1983 series of match races was won by \"Australia II\", with four race wins to three, in the first successful challenge of the New York Yacht Club's 132-year defense of the Cup. The Australian syndicate's boat, skippered by John Bertrand, fought back from a 3–1 deficit to best the Dennis Conner-helmed defender, ending both the longest winning streak in sporting history and U.S. domination of the racing series.\nThe defender: \"Liberty\".\n\"Liberty\" won all the Defender trials and on 2 September 1983, the New York Yacht Club confirmed that \"Liberty\" was to represent the club as defender of the America's Cup.\nThe crew included team principal Dennis Conner as skipper, Tom Whidden, navigator Halsey Chase Herreshoff, Scott Vogel, and mainsheet trimmer John Marshall.\nDuring the summer preceding the trials Conner had been the focus of extensive media attention in the U.S., including an appearance on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine, a rare recognition for a sailor.\nLiberty had competed with John Kolius' \"Courageous\", and Tom Blackaller's Defender (sail no. US–33), in a defender series before being selected by the New York Yacht Club. Gary Jobson was the founder and tactician of the Courageous/Defender syndicate.\nThe challenger: \"Australia II\".\nAlan Bond arrived at Newport with \"Australia II\", billed as one of the biggest threats to American dominance of the 12 Metre class. The boat was designed by Ben Lexcen and skippered by John Bertrand. The revolutionary \"winged keel\" of the Australian yacht was a subject of controversy from the outset of the challenger series, with the New York Yacht club alleging that the winged keel boat was not a legal 12 Meter, and that the keel design itself was the result of Dutch engineers, and not by Lexcen. This second point could have made \"Australia II\" illegal under the requirement that the boat be \"designed and constructed in country\" as the Deed of Gift that governed the competition stipulated. The boat was ruled a legal 12 Meter, and she was allowed to participate in the regatta. The speed of the new contender, along with the controversy and protests intensified international media attention to the series.\n\"Australia II\" dominated the challenger series and entered the America's Cup finals as the most promising contender to date.\nThe races.\nThe U.S. yacht won the first and second races by margins of more than a minute when the Australian yacht suffered equipment failure, but the \"Australia II\" took the third race, and came back to win the fifth and sixth races after \"Liberty\" won the fourth. This was the first time the America's Cup had needed a sixth race, let alone a seventh.\nThe cup title came down to the seventh and final race. For the seventh and deciding race on 26 September 1983 the wind was light at around eight knots. The pre-start was not a typical match race start. \"Neither party wanted to make a mistake and end up in the protest room,\" Conner would explain later. \"Liberty\" won the start by eight seconds ahead of \"Australia II\" on paper but the Australians held a controlling position at the favoured end sailing toward the favoured side which gave them the early lead. \"Australia II\" was subsequently overtaken by Conner who built up what seemed to be an unassailable margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the America's Cup looked like it would stay in Newport. Conner failed to cover \"Australia II\" which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing \"Australia II\" to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Conner then engaged \"Australia II\" in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks including a number of faked \"dummy\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover. \"Australia II\" held on until both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of \"Liberty\" and sailed to the finish to take the race. \"Australia II\" crossed the finish line with a winning margin of 41 seconds, becoming the first successful challenger in the 132 years \"since the schooner \"America\" won it in a race around England's Isle of Wight in 1851\".\nAftermath.\nThe final race was televised in Australia in the early hours of 27 September 1983 (Australian time) just before dawn, and the victory was celebrated in public venues across Australia. Prime Minister Bob Hawke was interviewed at the dawn celebration at Royal Perth Yacht Club, Western Australia. After humorously fending off repeated questioning by journalists about whether he would declare a public holiday he admitted this was a state matter and outside his power as Prime Minister. He joked that he thought it should be and that any state Premiers who disagreed with him might \"find themselves in a spot of bother\". To rapturous laughter and applause, he said with finality: \"Any boss who sacks a worker for not turning up today is a bum\".\nIn stark contrast to Australia, the loss of the 1983 America's Cup was considered a time of shame in U.S. sailing, as the U.S. had been able to defend the Cup for 132 years in a row. Dennis Conner took the loss hard. Asked about how he felt initially after losing the Cup, Conner said: \"It was awful. I just did not want to get out of bed in the morning. I am usually full of life and energy... I just wanted to hide\".\nThe America's Cup was transferred from the New York Yacht Club to the Royal Perth Yacht Club located in Perth, Western Australia, which subsequently hosted its first, but unsuccessful, defense in the 1987 America's Cup. After losing the Cup, the U.S. had been determined to bring it back. Conner went to work on the next US America's Cup Campaign. With the help of designers Britton Chance Jr., Bruce Nelson and David Pedrick, the boat \"Stars and Stripes 87\" was created which, after progressively gaining speed in a grueling challenger series, became the 1987 challenger. Stars and Stripes sailed against Kookaburra, the Australian defender, with Conner winning the 1987 America's Cup and returning it to the U.S. The 1992 film \"Wind\" portrays in large part the loss of the 1983 Cup and the journey to regain it at the 1987 Challenge. While parts of the film take some creative license with the actual events, \"Wind\" has generally been acclaimed as the single most accurate and realistic sailing film ever made, capturing not only the technical and physical challenges of sailing, but also the realistic and daily culture and lifestyle of professional yachtsmen and yachtswomen.\nIn retrospect, Conner said that losing the Cup in 1983 had been good for the sport of sailing and the Cup itself:\n\"Me losing after 132 years was the best thing that ever happened to the America's Cup and the best thing that ever happened to Dennis Conner...Before the win by the Australians, the America's Cup was only big in the minds of the yachties, but the rest of the world didn't know or care about it at all. But when we lost it... it was a little bit like losing the Panama Canal - suddenly everyone appreciated it. If I hadn't lost it, there never would have been the national effort... without that there never would have been the ticker-tape parade up Fifth Avenue in New York, lunch with the President at the White House and all the doors of opportunity that it opened\"."

Due to sponsorship rules in force at the time, the boats were not allowed to be named after their sponsors which affected only one challenger. The Oracle boat was referenced by its sail number USA-76 because the team did not give the boat a name.\nOn January 19, 2003, the Swiss challenger Ernesto Bertarelli’s \"Alinghi\", skippered by Russell Coutts, won the Louis Vuitton Cup Finals by defeating the American challenger, Larry Ellison's \"Oracle\", 5–1, once again eliminating the United States from the America's Cup competition.\nThe America's Cup Races.\nRacing for the America's Cup began On February 15, 2003. In a stiff breeze, \"Alinghi\" won the first race easily after \"New Zealand\", skippered throughout the series by Dean Barker, withdrew due to multiple gear failures in the rigging and the low cockpit unexpectedly taking onboard large quantities of water.\nRace 2, on February 16, 2003, was won by \"Alinghi\" by a margin of only seven seconds. It was one of the closest, most exciting races seen for years, with the lead changing several times and a duel of 33 tacking manoeuvres on the fifth leg.\nThen on February 18, in Race 3, \"Alinghi\" won the critical start, after receiving last minute advice about a wind shift, and led throughout the race, winning with a 23-second margin.\nAfter nine days without being able to race, first due to a lack of wind, then with high winds and rough seas making it too dangerous to race, February 28, originally a planned lay-day, was chosen as a race day. Race 4 was again sailed in strong winds and rough seas and \"New Zealand's\" difficulties continued, when her mast snapped on the third leg.\nThe next day, March 1, 2003, was again a frustratingly calm day, the race finally being called off after the yachts had again spent over two hours waiting for a start in the light air. \"Alinghi\" skipper Russell Coutts was unable to celebrate his 41st birthday with a cup win, but was in a commanding position in the series to do so on March 2. Race 5 started on time in a good breeze. \"Alinghi\" again won the start and kept ahead. On the forth leg, \"New Zealand\" broke a spinnaker pole during a manoeuvre. Although it was put overboard and replaced with a spare pole, \"New Zealand\" was unable to recover, conceding Alinghi's sweep to the title.\nThe win by \"Alinghi\" meant Coutts, who had previously sailed for New Zealand, had won every one of the last 14 America's Cup races he had competed in as skipper, the most by any America's Cup skipper. This meant he had won an America's Cup regatta twice as challenger, as well as having been a successful defender.\nCrew.\nTeam New Zealand.\nCameron Appleton was the backup helmsman with Rod Davis, Dan Slater and Clay Oliver in the reserve afterguard."

        "text": "The 1971 Giro d'Italia was the 55th edition of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race consisted of 20 stages and an opening prologue, starting in Lecce on 20 May and finishing at the Vigorelli velodrome in Milan on 10 June. There were three time trial stages and a single rest day. Gösta Pettersson of the team won the overall general classification, becoming the first Swedish rider to win a Grand Tour. Herman Van Springel () placed second, 2 min and 32 s in arrears, and Ugo Colombo (Filotex) was third, just three seconds slower than Van Springel.\nTeams.\nTour de France organizer Félix Lévitan and the Mars-Flandria were in disagreements over the team's participation in the coming Tour de France and there was speculation that the team would instead race the Giro d'Italia. The team chose to wait for Lévitan's decision regarding their entry, which came following the Giro's start, and therefore did not participate in the Giro. Ultimately, Lévitian requested the team to pay extra money, on top of the 25,000 franc entry fee, to participate in the Tour. A total of 10 teams were invited to participate in the 1971 Giro d'Italia.\nEach team sent a squad of ten riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 100 cyclists. The majority of riders were Italian (72), while 28 riders were foreign. Of the non-Italians, Belgians had the most with twelve riders, 10 Spaniards which comprised the whole KAS team, 3 Swedes, 2 Swiss, and one French rider. Only two of the ten teams entering the race were not based in Italy: KAS (Spain) and Magniflex (Belgium). Giorgio Favaro was the last rider to arrive for the race because his Molteni teammate Martin Van Den Bossche was removed shortly before the race's start due to the discovery of an abscess that was operated on in a Vicenza hospital. Out of the riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 75 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nOn 15 January, it was announced that Eddy Merckx the winner of the previous year's race and the 1968 edition would not participate in the race for the first time in four years. Instead, he would focus solely on preparing for the upcoming Tour de France, which he hoped to win for the third consecutive year. An \"El Mundo Deportivo\" writer felt Merckx's absence opened the race for other riders to win. The starting peloton featured three previous winners: Franco Balmamion (1962 &amp; 1963) riding for , Salvarani's Felice Gimondi (1965 &amp; 1967), and Gianni Motta (1966), also of Salvarani. Gimondi had finished in the top five of the general classification in each Giro since 1965. Motta entered the Giro after having won the Tour de Romandie. Motta and Gimondi were named favorites. Salvarani announced they would be racing the Tour de France in July; however, \"Het Vrije Volk\" writer Peter Ouwerkerk questioned whether the team - which had thirteen riders total - had enough stamina for these large three-week races.\nOuwerkerk felt Salvarani's biggest challenger was to be the Molteni team, even without Merckx, and he specifically felt Herman Van Springel was capable of winning the race. He referenced Gimondi's previous season where he exceeded expectations as a primary reason for his support. Van Den Bossche was also thought to be a challenger for the Salvarani riders before his aforementioned withdrawal before the race. Molteni's riders Marino Basso and Romano Tumellero were thought to give the team enough support in the absence of Merckx. Italo Zilioli, Franco Bitossi, Gösta Pettersson, Patrick Sercu, and Michele Dancelli were other riders that were thought to be contenders for the overall victory.\nRoute and stages.\nThe race route was unveiled by race director Vincenzo Torriani on 24 February 1971. The start of the race was announced to be in Lecce after the officials of the city paid 20 million lira to the organization to earn the honor. The race contained 20 stages, one of which was a split stage, and one opening prologue. There were ten stages that included categorized climbs that had points to count towards the mountains classification, including the twelfth stage which was a climbing individual time trial to the Serniga di Salò. Six of the stages featured summit finishes. Together, the amount of climbing for the categorized climbs included in the race totaled to be . There were three total time trials, two individual and one team leg. The final stage of the race ended in Milan at the Vigorelli velodrome. The race was televised in an hourly program each day and also covered over the radio.\nThe race route traveled all the way down to the boot of the Italian countryside. The opening prologue from Lecce to Apulia time trial stage covering , was broken into ten equal segments, with one rider from each team of ten contesting one part. The team with the lowest total time was declared winner and all of the team's riders go to wear the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" the following day. The times did not count towards the general classification for the race. When writing about this stage's format 44 years later, rider Renato Laghi commented \"Torriani was forever having strange ideas.\"\nThe race entered two countries aside from Italy, Yugoslavia and Austria. This was the first time the Giro entered Austria, as the race traveled through the country to finish on the Großglockner. The race's entry into the Dolomites from June 7 to June 9 was expected to be the highlight. Former Italian cyclist Cino Cinelli stated that he had tried to climb the mountain several times and that the race's cars would have a hard time climbing the mountain.\nThere was some concern over the quality and condition of the some roads used early in the race, particularly during the second mass-start stage. Five-time champion Alfredo Binda said \"Only a climber can win it and it will remain uncertain until Ponte di Legno.\" \"El Mundo\" writer Bosch praised race organizer Torriani for experimenting with new routes and felt that this route was \"the best.\"\nRace overview.\nThe race started at 1:45 PM local time in front of the Piazza Sant'Oronzo, it was estimated that 200,000 people watched along the course. Salvarani won the team time trial event by three seconds over Molteni and one of their leaders, Gimondi, registered the fastest time over the at 8' 26 s. The favorites entering the day, Ferretti, finished in fourth, 52 s slower than Salvarani. The group remained together initially before Molteni's Luigi Castelletti attacked off the front of the peloton and gained a few minutes advantage before KAS, G.B.C., and Ferretti riders raised the tempo and caught Castelletti. As rain started to hit the course, Marinus Wagtmans (Molteni) won the second traguardi tricolori sprint of the leg, ahead of Attilio Rota (Dreher). The two then opened up a gap between the peloton reaching 55\", but Rota refused to help with the pace and the two were with several kilometers remaining. After the day had under left there was a crash involving roughly 50 riders. The riders remounted and another attacked ensued by a group of riders; however, it was caught as the peloton geared up for a bunch sprint. The sprint to the line was closely contested by Franco Bitossi (Filotex) and Marino Basso (Molteni) and both celebrated as if to have won the stage, but a photo finish revealed Basso to be the victor and he assumed the lead of the general classification and points classification. The second stage of the race was the longest of the race at .\nDuring the seventeenth stage, that finished on the Großglockner, an Alpine pass. Race leader Claudio Michelotto held on to the back of a team car to finish the climb and was given a one-minute penalty. Following the stage, Pettersson took the race lead from Michelotto. Pettersson became the first rider born north of the Rhine to win the Giro d'Italia. In addition, he became the first Swedish rider to win a Grand Tour.\nDoping.\nDoping controls were conducted following each stage finish. If a rider tested positive, the punishment was a ten-minute penalty and their stage results were voided. It was announced on 26 May that Gianni Motta had tested positive for ephedrine. In response to the news, Motta stated that he had used his grandmother's herbs to help with his fatigue. Lucillo Lievore also tested positive.\nClassification leadership.\nTwo different jerseys were worn during the 1971 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a cyclamen jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15. The mountains classification leader. The climbs were ranked in first and second categories, the former awarded 50, 30, and 20 points while the latter awarded 30, 20, and 10 points. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. In addition there was the \"Cima Coppi\", the Grossglockner, which was the highest mountain crossed in this edition of the race, which gave 200, 100, 80, 70, and 50 points to the first five riders summit the climb. The first rider over the Grossglockner was Pierfranco Vianelli. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time."

Two days after the draft, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs for the rights to Hall of Famer Red Kelly, who had retired as a player but accepted a job coaching the Kings.

He played for the California Angels in Major League Baseball (MLB), and for the Yokohama BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). During his playing career, he batted and threw right-handed and was listed at and . He later served as a hitting coach in Minor League Baseball.\nBaseball career.\nNorth America.\nRose played baseball for San Dimas High School in California, where he had a .515 batting average during his senior season in 1985. He was selected by the California Angels in the fifth round of the 1985 MLB draft and signed with the team. He played in the Angels' farm system for several teams from 1985 through 1992, except for 1987. Rose sat out the 1987 season, working for a graphics company in Orange County, California, before returning to baseball the following year. His longest assignments were with the Quad Cities Angels of the Class A Midwest League for 264 games during 1986 and 1988, and the Edmonton Trappers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League for 216 games during 1990–1992. Over seven seasons, Rose appeared in 648 minor-league games, registering a .288 average with 49 home runs and 372 runs batted in (RBIs). Primarily a used as a third baseman, second baseman, and shortstop, Rose made several appearances as a catcher, first baseman, and outfielder—he also pitched in one game.\nRose played a total of 73 major league games during 1989–1992; the most MLB games he played during one season was 30 in 1992. He batted .245 with five home runs and 23 RBIs with the Angels, while defensively playing primarily at second base (43 games), along with appearances at first base, third base, and in the outfield. Rose was selected as the Angles starting second baseman at the start of the 1992 season. However, he soon began to struggle and Rene Gonzales started platooning the position with him. On May 19, Rose hit a home run in his last major-league at bat. Two days later, he and the team were involved in an accident when the team bus veered off a road in Deptford Township, New Jersey. Rose’s suffered a severely sprained right ankle in the accident and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. After, he rehabilitated in the minors on stints with the Palm Springs Angels and the Trappers. On October 16, however, the Angels sold his contract to the Yokohama Taiyo Whales in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nJapan.\nAfter Rose's contract was sold by the Angels to the then-Yokohama Taiyo Whales of NPB's Central League (CL), the team was renamed as the Yokohama BayStars prior to the 1993 season. In his first season with the team, he played in all 130 games and tied for the most RBIs in the CL with 94. He also received the Best Nine Award for best second baseman in the league. Rose's success continued over the next several seasons and he became a central figure in Yokohama's famed \"machine gun\" batting lineup as its cleanup hitter. In 1998, he helped the BayStars win their first CL title and Japan Series in 38 years.\nNext season, Rose batted a career-high .369 along with 37 home runs and 153 RBIs. His batting average won him the 1999 CL batting title and was the highest ever in Japanese baseball among right-handed hitters at the time. His RBIs that season also ranks second-most in a season in NPB history. He also hit his third cycle, the most in NPB-history, and was named the Most Valuable Player in Game 2 of the 1999 All-Star Series. In June of that season, Rose had indicated that he would retire at the end of the year. After his success, however, he played another season in which he batted .332 with 97 RBIs with 21 home runs. Rose announced his retirement after the season in October 2000. The BayStars and Rose failed to reach an agreement on a new contract after the team only offered a salary decrease from his estimated ¥360 million salary that season. He noted that he did not want to play for any other team.\nRose's NPB career spanned eight season from 1993–2000. During that time, he won six Best Nine Awards and was selected to four All-Star Series. Defensively, he played predominantly as a second baseman in NPB, with limited appearances at first base and third base. In 1998, he was awarded the Golden Glove Award for second basemen. He is often regarded as one of the best foreign players in BayStars and Japanese professional baseball history. For the BayStars 70th anniversary in 2019, Rose was voted by fans as the best second baseman in the team's history.\nCoaching.\nRose first served as a hitting coach during the 2013 season with the Spokane Indians, a Texas Rangers farm team in the Class A Short Season Northwest League. He then spent 2014 coaching for the Rangers' Class A affiliate in the South Atlantic League, the Hickory Crawdads. Rose was next the hitting coach for the High Desert Mavericks, a Class A-Advanced Rangers farm team in the California League, during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. In 2017, he served in the same capacity for the Down East Wood Ducks, also a Rangers Class A-Advanced farm team, in the Carolina League. \nRose moved to the Baltimore Orioles organization for the 2018 season, as hitting coach of the Delmarva Shorebirds in the South Atlantic League. In February 2019, he was named hitting coach for the Frederick Keys, then a farm team of the Orioles in the Carolina League. After the 2019 season, the Orioles chose not to renew the contracts of the Keys' coaching staff.\nExternal links.\n, or NPB "

        "title": "Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing",
        "text": "Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing is a boxing video game that was developed by Park Place Productions and published by Virgin Interactive in 1992. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis console.\nOverview.\nThe game features Muhammad Ali and nine fictional heavyweight boxers. The game is presented using a mixture of 2D sprites and a 3D ring which allows boxers to move 360 degrees about the ring.\nIn career mode, the player can choose to fight as any of the game's ten boxers. The selected boxer starts at rank ten in the heavyweight division, and fights their way through all the others in order.\nGameplay.\nDuring fights, available punches to be thrown include jabs, hooks, crosses and uppercuts. In simulation mode it is possible to choose to throw any type of punch with either hand, whereas in arcade mode the player chooses which type of punch to throw and the AI determines which of the boxer's fists is the most appropriate to throw it. Defensive maneuvers include blocking and clinching. The more punches a boxer throws, the less damage his punches inflict.\nThe game can be played in either arcade or simulation mode. Many in-game features are customizable, including round length, number of rounds, and the length of time a boxer must be on the canvas to be classed as knocked out.\nPresentation.\nThe visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers and a simple 3D rendering of the ring. The boxers' sprites include views of them from a side-on position, and from viewpoints that show them having turned a small distance clockwise or anti-clockwise around the ring. As a boxer attempts to move around the ring, the appropriate series of sprites are shown, which works to give the illusion of their turning about.\nBlood effects simulate the cuts that boxers sometimes suffer during matches; however, the effect is wildly exaggerated in the game and huge splashes of blood can sometimes be seen flying off a boxer's face. Blood stains remain on the ring floor for the rest of a match; combined with the amount of blood that comes out of fighters' faces, this often leads to much of the ring being covered in it by the end of a match. The damage received to a boxer's face is exhibited by close-up pictures that are shown between rounds. Such images show wounds such as bloody noses or black eyes. The wounds start off semi-realistically, but after sustained punishment, often develop into wildly exaggerated versions of the kind of injuries boxers suffer. In the later rounds of a fight, boxers' faces will sometimes be ripped open by so many large, gaping cuts that they become practically unrecognizable as human beings, let alone individual boxers.\nRather than providing an accurate representation of reality, the game's sound effects reflect an attempt to make the game more exciting by exaggerating the impact force of punches. In particular, the effects for hard punches sound extremely forceful, being more reminiscent of a car door being slammed shut than boxing-glove covered fists impacting with another person.\nThe game features digitized speech effects for the introduction of fighters, knockdown counts, and the announcement of the outcome of a fight. It is also one of the few boxing games to depict an in-game referee.\nWhile after each fight judges' scorecards are shown for each round, these almost always have no bearing on who the winner is. This is because the winner is decided solely by whichever boxer lands more punches in the fight. The only occasion these scorecards decide an outcome is if both fighters land exactly the same number of punches during a fight.\nReception.\n\"MegaTech\" gave the game 92% and a Hyper Game Award, stating that it \"captures the atmosphere of boxing better than any other boxing game\"."

He began his pro career with the AFL's Cincinnati Bengals in 1968, and also played for the NFL's Bengals as well as the New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots.\nEarly life.\nPhillips grew up in Beaumont, Texas, the oldest of four children. He attended Charlton-Pollard High School.\nHe played college football at Michigan State University, where he played safety on defense. He played in one of the greatest college football games of all-time, the historic 10-10 tie between undefeated MSU and undefeated Notre Dame. He was a mathematics major.\nHowever, during his senior season he forged a check and was sentenced to 18 months for four years at the penitentiary at Jackson, Michigan. He was paroled after four months; he credits his time in prison with teaching a lot about life, but he gave up hope of being drafted into pro football.\nBut the expansion Cincinnati Bengals and coach Paul Brown were willing to take a chance on Phillips. He was drafted as a defensive back in the fourth round (84th overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft by the then-AFL Bengals. He was released from prison on August 2, 1968, and was met by Paul Brown's son, Mike Brown, who took Phillips directly to the Bengals training camp in Wilmington, Ohio, where he was installed as a defensive back. Paul Brown called Phillips \"a kid with an engaging personality who has it all in front of him.\"\nIn his rookie season, 1968, the expansion Bengals' first season, he played strong safety on defense but also had one carry for seven yards on offense. But in 1969 he was switched to fullback and came on strong with 118 carries for 578 yards (a 4.9 average) and three touchdowns, including a career-long 83-yard run. He also caught 13 passes for 128 yards, a 9.8 average.\nIn his third season, 1970, he started all 14 games and increased his totals to 163 carried for 648 yards (a 4.0 average) and four touchdowns, plus 31 receptions for 124 yards and one touchdown. In 1971, he started 10 of 14 games, with 94 carries for 420 yards (a 4.5 average) and 22 receptions for 125 yards and one touchdown.\nIn 1972, his playing time decreased with the Bengals. He started in three of the 13 games he played, with 48 carries for 207 yards (a 4.3 average) and one touchdown, plus 10 receptions for 50 yards.\nPhillips joined the New Orleans Saints for the 1973 season and thrived as a starter for all 14 games. He totaled 198 carries for 663 yards (both career highs) although his yards-per-carry average fell to 3.3. He also had 22 receptions for a career-high 169 yards.\nIn 1974, he was no longer a starter, but still played in all 14 games with 174 carries for 556 yards (a 3.2 average) and two touchdowns with 11 receptions for 55 yards.\nBy 1975 he joined the Oakland Raiders, for whom he played in all 14 games, starting two, and had 63 carries for 298 yards (a 4.7 average) and one touchdown with four receptions for 25 yards. He also returned 12 kicks for 310 yards, a 25.8 average.\nIn 1976, he was a member of the New England Patriots, for whom he played 13 games with 24 carries for 164 yards and one touchdown with one reception for 18 yards. He also returned 14 kicks for 397 yards, a career-high 28.4 average. His last season was 1977 with the Patriots. He played all 14 games but with only five carries for 27 yards and one touchdown.\nPersonal life.\nAs a sophomore at Michigan State, Phillips met his future wife, Julie. On September 1, 1969, Julie gave birth to their son Jess Phillips III.\nDuring his off-seasons in Cincinnati, Phillips worked as a mortgage loan officer for then Central Trust Bank, and he worked for a company that printed weekly commodity charts and mailed them out to futures' brokers and traders."

Campbell began his Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Chicago White Sox, but had very little playing time in the major leagues. In 1932, Campbell was traded from the White Sox to the St. Louis Browns, with Bump Hadley, for Red Kress. In St. Louis, Campbell was a starting outfielder, and performed well, driving in 106 runs in 1933. In the 1935 season, Campbell played with the Cleveland Indians, after being traded for multiple players and cash. In Cleveland, Campbell hit for considerably higher averages than he had in St. Louis, although injuries limited his playing time.\nOn July 2, 1936, as a member of the Indians, Campbell went 7-7 in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. In the first game, he went 6-6 with 5 RBI in a 14-6 win. In the second game, he singled in one at-bat, then left the game.\nIn January 1940, the Indians traded Campbell to the Detroit Tigers for Beau Bell. The trade worked out for Campbell, as the Tigers won the American League pennant, and Campbell played all seven games of the 1940 World Series. Campbell had nine hits, four walks, scored four runs, five runs batted in and a home run in the World Series, with a batting average of .360, on-base percentage of .448 and slugging percentage of .520.\nCampbell later played for the Washington Senators.

He was named \"Most Courageous Athlete of the Year\" in 1936 by the Philadelphia sports writers. He was stricken with spinal meningitis in 1935 and given a 50–50 chance of living. Campbell joined the service in World War II and spent 38 months in the Army Air Corps. Campbell returned from the war and played in the minor leagues in 1946 with Buffalo Bisons and Minneapolis Millers at age 36 before retiring.\nCampbell was inducted into the Lyons Township High School Hall of Fame in 1995."

        "title": "1965 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1965 AFL Championship Game was the American Football League's sixth championship game, played on December 26 at Balboa Stadium in San Diego, California.\nIt matched the Western Division champion San Diego Chargers (9–2–3) and the Eastern Division champion Buffalo Bills (10–3–1) to decide the American Football League (AFL) champion for the 1965 season.\nThe defending champion Bills entered the game as 6½ point underdogs; the Chargers had won the first regular season meeting on October 10 by a convincing 34–3 score, and tied the Thanksgiving rematch at twenty points each.\nIn favorable conditions on the day after Christmas, the Bills shut out the Chargers and repeated as champions, scoring two touchdowns in the second quarter, one on a punt return. They added three field goals in the second half to win 23–0. Of the ten AFL title games, this was the only shutout: the Chargers had advanced to five of the first six, but won only one, in 1963.\nBills' quarterback Jack Kemp, the league's most valuable player, was named MVP of the game; he and Paul Maguire were among the five ex-Chargers on the Bills' roster that were previously released by San Diego head coach Sid Gillman.\nThis was the last AFL Championship to end the season; the AFL–NFL merger agreement was made the following June, and the first Super Bowl followed the 1966 season.\nOfficials.\nThe AFL still had five game officials in 1965; the NFL added a sixth official this season, the line judge. The AFL went to six officials in 1966, and the seventh official, the side judge, was added in .\nReferee Jim Barnhill died less than three months after this game; while officiating a basketball playoff game in Wisconsin, he collapsed and died at age 45.\nPlayers' shares.\nThe winning Bills players were allocated $5,189 each, while the Chargers players received $3,447 each. This was twice as much as the previous year and about 70% of the players' shares for the NFL championship game.\nBecause of the smaller venue, the attendance was nearly 10,000 lower than 1964, but the television money was increased with NBC.\nAftermath.\nThis game marked the first time the AFL Championship Game was televised in color, and the last time that a final pro football championship was decided in December, within the same calendar year as regular season games (the 1965 NFL Championship Game was played on January 2, 1966). The following season would conclude with the first Super Bowl played in January 1967.\nThis is the last professional American football championship game to have been won by a team from Buffalo, New York, as well as the last of any major league team from the city. Indeed, the fortunes of both teams, and for that matter both cities, would go southward since then. The Bills would not appear in another championship game until Super Bowl XXV when the infamous Wide Right occurred, and would also proceed to lose the next three Super Bowls. The Chargers meanwhile would not appear in another championship until Super Bowl XXIX, which they lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 49-26. San Diego and Buffalo currently have the longest and second-longest championship droughts respectively for any city that has at least two major sports franchises."

This is done in order to \"run before the wind', i.e., sail with the wind directly behind the vessel rather than tacking.\nWhen a square-rigger is running downwind, and the yards are positioned perpendicular to the line of the keel, both sheets that control the yard (braces) are tied off aft (i.e., straight back), leading to the figurative phrase \"Both sheets aft.\"\n\"Both sheets aft, The situation of a square-rigged ship that sails before the wind, or with the wind right astern. It is said also of a half-drunken sailor rolling along with his hands in his pockets and elbows square.\"\nFurther definition.\n\"Square ... A term peculiarly appropriated to the yards and their sails.

Each team would play a home-and-away game against the other 7 teams in the league for a total of 14 games, and the best team in the Eastern Division would play against the best in the Western Division in a championship game.

On December 6 at Oakland, the Raiders beat the Bills on the final play of the game, 16–13, and did not try for an extra point. Boston won at Kansas City, 31–24, to take Buffalo's lead away. In \"Week Fourteen\", Boston was idle, and Buffalo took a 1/2 game lead with a 30–19 win at Denver. As it turned out, the Eastern Division title would come down to the final game of the season, with Buffalo (11–2–0) traveling to Boston (10–2–1) on December 20, with the winner to take all. Jack Kemp led the Bills to three touchdowns for a 24–14 win to capture the title.\nThe Western Division race was less dramatic.

        "title": "1964 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1964 AFL Championship Game was the American Football League's fifth championship game, played at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday, December 26.\nThe Buffalo Bills (12–2) of the Eastern Division hosted the defending AFL champion San Diego Chargers (8–5–1) of the Western Division. The two had met twice in the regular season and the Bills won both, most recently by three points in San Diego a month earlier on Thanksgiving Day. Hall of fame wide receiver Lance Alworth of the Chargers was injured in the final regular season game (left knee hyperextension) and did not play. The Chargers had lost three of their last four games to end the regular season, and the Bills were slight favorites to win the title at home; with Alworth out they became strong favorites.\nGame summary.\nSan Diego opened the game with an 80-yard drive in four plays, but it was their only score as the Bills won 20–7 for their first league championship. Combined with the next season, the Bills' consecutive AFL titles are the only two championships ever won by a major league team based in Buffalo.\nOne of the game's most iconic plays was one known as the \"hit heard 'round the world,\" when Bills linebacker Mike Stratton laid a particularly hard hit on Chargers running back Keith Lincoln that broke a rib and forced him out of the game midway through the first quarter. Lincoln had over 330 yards of offense in the previous year's title game and had already rushed for 47 yards, caught a pass for 11 yards, and kicked an extra point (as the reserve placekicker) in the first 6½ minutes. Without Lincoln and Alworth, the San Diego offensive attack was severely hindered. \nBills' fullback Cookie Gilchrist rushed for 122 yards on sixteen carries, while quarterback Jack Kemp completed ten of twenty passes for 188 yards and scored a fourth quarter touchdown on a sneak. Rookie kicker Pete Gogolak added two field goals in the first half. War Memorial Stadium was filled with a sellout attendance of 40,242.\nAftermath.\nIt was the final game for Chargers quarterback Tobin Rote, who had led the Detroit Lions to the NFL title seven years earlier in 1957 and the Chargers to the AFL crown in 1963. He was replaced in the game by John Hadl, who had played most of the regular season.\nThe 1964 AFL championship game was the penultimate pro football championship game played in Buffalo (the Bills hosted again in 1966, but lost in their attempt for a third consecutive AFL crown). Held six days after the completion of the 1964 regular season, it was the only AFL title game not played on Sunday, as well as the final one televised in black-and-white. The NFL's championship game was played the following day on Sunday, December 27.\nThis was the last AFL game on ABC television; rights were sold in January 1964 to NBC for $36 million over five years, beginning with the 1965 season. This infusion of cash helped spur a bidding war for talent with the NFL, which led to the AFL–NFL merger agreement in June 1966. With the exception of the 1966 Continental Football League championship, ABC did not carry pro football again until after the completion of the merger and the subsequent creation of \"Monday Night Football\" for the season.\nPlayers' shares.\nThe winning Bills split their players' shares for the title game 43 ways for $2,668 each, while the Chargers split theirs into 44 shares for $1,738 each. These shares were about one-third of those for the NFL title game in 1964, at $8,000 and $5,000 each. With the new television deal with NBC, the players' shares for the AFL title game nearly doubled in 1965."

        "text": "The 1963 AFL season was the fourth regular season of the American Football League.\nThe season ended when the San Diego Chargers defeated the Boston Patriots in the AFL championship game – to this date the only major league championship won by the Chargers and the city of San Diego.\nThe original eight franchises of 1960 remained, but two underwent name changes, with one relocating. The Titans of New York changed their team colors and were renamed the New York Jets; the defending AFL champion Dallas Texans moved north to Missouri and became the Kansas City Chiefs.\nDivision races.\nAs with the previous three seasons, the AFL had 8 teams, split into two divisions. Every team played two games against the others for a total of 14 games, and the division winners met in the AFL championship game. If there was a tie in the standings at the top of either division, a one-game playoff was held to determine the division winner. San Diego led the Western Division for the entire season, with the Oakland Raiders following one game behind from \"Week Eight\" onward. The Raiders had started at 2–0, then lost four straight, then began a winning streak. Starting from a 2–4 handicap was insurmountable, and although Oakland beat San Diego twice (34–33 on October 27, and 41–27 on December 8), they were unable to catch up.\nThe Eastern race changed in \"Week Seven\", after the Jets lost to Oakland, 49–26, and the Patriots and Houston Oilers tied at 4–3–0 for the lead. Houston, winner of the first three Eastern titles, pulled ahead the next week, and Boston beat them 45–3 the week after that; the next week, Boston lost 7–6 to San Diego, while Houston beat the Jets 31–27 to pull ahead again. Two weeks later (\"Week Twelve\"), San Diego beat Houston 27–0, while Boston led again after a 17–7 win over the Buffalo Bills. In \"Week Thirteen\", Boston was at 7–5–1, and Buffalo and Houston right behind. In the final week, spoiler San Diego took out Houston, 20–14. Buffalo won 19–10 over the Jets, while Boston lost 35–3 at Kansas City, giving the Bills and Pats records of 7–6–1 and forcing a one-game playoff, for a spot in the AFL Championship game.\nThe season schedule itself was pushed back a week from what was originally planned, owing to the assassination of President Kennedy, which resulted in the AFL moving games from that weekend (i.e., the weekend of November 23–24) to the weekend of December 21–22. Since only three games had been scheduled, with Boston and Buffalo both having a bye, it meant that the Patriots and Bills finished their regular schedule on Saturday, December 14, a week before the league's other six teams did. Consequently, the Patriots and Bills could have played their tiebreaker playoff on December 22, potentially leaving the AFL Championship Game for the next weekend (the originally scheduled date), since they knew after games of December 15 that they and they alone had tied for the division title. However, the Western Division race had not yet been decided and Chargers and Raiders owners Barron Hilton and Al Davis respectively objected to playing the Eastern playoff \"early\" on the grounds that it would have given the Eastern winner an unfair advantage in terms of rest in case the Chargers and Raiders also had to play a tiebreaker. The Chargers won their last game and with it won the West outright, nevertheless the Bills-Patriots Eastern Division playoff was not played until after the following week on Saturday, December 28 (the day before the Chicago-New York NFL Championship Game). This meant that the Boston-San Diego championship game was not played until January 5, 1964. Thus was held the second professional playoff game ever held in January (with the AFL's first ever title playoff on January 1, 1961, being the only time before then that that had occurred). As it happened, the Patriots-Chargers playoff was also latest date on which a non-Super Bowl playoff game was ever held, and it retained that record until the AFC and NFC Championship Games of January 7, 1979. No 14-game season ever ended later.\nRegular season.\nThe defending champion Dallas Texans relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and changed the team's name to the Kansas City Chiefs. Meanwhile, the New York Titans went under new ownership and changed their name to the New York Jets as they prepared to move from the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan to Shea Stadium in Queens near LaGuardia Airport, and their colors went from navy blue and gold to green and white."

The Western Division champion San Diego Chargers won 51–10 over the Eastern Division champion Boston Patriots. The Chargers' Keith Lincoln was named the game's most valuable player (MVP).\nAt the end of the regular season, the Chargers (11–3) won the Western Division for the third time in the four-year existence of the AFL. In the Eastern Division, the Patriots and the Buffalo Bills had identical 7–6–1 records, which required a tiebreaker playoff game on December 28 in Buffalo.\nEastern Division playoff.\nIn their final regular season games on Saturday, December 14, Boston lost and Buffalo won to draw even in the standings. Three-time division winner Houston (6–6) controlled their own destiny, but lost the next day and were eliminated. Buffalo and Boston had two weeks to prepare for the playoff, as their bye weeks were postponed from November 24 to December 22, due to the assassination of President Kennedy.\nThe game was played on Saturday, December 28, as the following day was the NFL championship game. On a slippery field at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo with an inch of snow, visiting Boston led 16–0 at halftime and won 26–8. Quarterback Babe Parilli threw a touchdown pass in each half to fullback Larry Garron and Gino Cappelletti made four field goals for the Patriots. The Bills' sole score was a 93-yard touchdown pass play in the third quarter with a two-point conversion, which cut the lead to eight points.\nSurface: Natural grass\nChampionship Game.\nIdle during the week of Eastern Division playoff, well-rested San Diego was a touchdown favorite at home to win the AFL. Fullback Keith Lincoln performed tremendously and led the Chargers to a 51–10 rout of Boston. Named the game's MVP, he rushed for 206 yards on 13 carries, led the team with 123 yards in receiving, and completed a pass for 20 yards.\nThe game was not a sellout; the attendance of 30,127 was several thousand under Balboa Stadium's capacity.\nThe Chargers' championship win is noted for being the only major sports title for the city of San Diego, the longest drought for a major American city. The Chargers played in San Diego through 2016, then returned to Los Angeles in 2017. The Patriots' first league championship came in the 2001 season in Super Bowl XXXVI.\nPlayers' shares.\nThe attendance in San Diego was nearly 8,000 lower than the previous year's game in Houston, but the players' shares were up slightly with increased television revenue. The winning Chargers players each made around $2,500, while the Patriots received about $1,700 each. These shares were less than half of those for the NFL title game in 1963, at approximately $6,000 and $4,200 each."

        "text": "The 1962 AFL Championship Game was played on December 23 at Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, Texas. The Western Division's Dallas Texans (11–3) defeated the host Houston Oilers of the Eastern Division (also 11–3) by a score of 20–17 after two overtimes. The Oilers were trying for their third consecutive American Football League title.\nBackground.\nThe two teams were the class of the league that year, and they split their regular season series, with the visiting team winning each game. The Texans thumped the Oilers at Houston 31–7 on October 28, and the next week the Oilers returned the favor with a 14–6 win at the Cotton Bowl.\nDallas was coached by the erudite Hank Stram, and featured players on offense included Abner Haynes, quarterback Len Dawson, and rookie running back Curtis McClinton, a powerful All-American from Kansas. The defense showcased Johnny Robinson and E. J. Holub.\nHouston was coached by Frank \"Pop\" Ivy, the third head coach of the Oilers in three seasons. The team featured a host of offensive talent with veteran quarterback George Blanda, Charlie Tolar, the fleet-footed Billy Cannon, Charlie Hennigan, and unheralded Willard Dewveall. Jeppesen Stadium ticket takers counted 37,981 fans in attendance. Astronaut Gus Grissom placed the ball on the kicking tee as the honorary referee.1 2 3\nHouston entered the game as a 6-point favorite.\nGame summary.\nAt the time, it was the longest game in the history of professional American football, and remains the longest professional championship game (and third-longest professional game) in the history of the sport.\nFirst quarter.\nEarly in the game both teams relied on the run. Houston with Tolar and Cannon gained the advantage and advanced the ball to the Dallas 4-yard line. The Dallas defense rose to the occasion and hit Blanda as he attempted to pass causing the ball to wobble right into the eager arms of the Texans' EJ Holub for an interception. Holub scrambled upfield but Houston's Al Jamison saved a touchdown by knocking Holub out of bounds at midfield. Len Dawson then mixed running and passing to the Houston 8 where Tommy Brooker booted a 16-yard field goal.\nHouston started driving again with Tolar and Cannon running, often from a \"double wing\" backfield formation. The drive stalled and Blanda missed a 47-yard field goal to conclude the 1st quarter.\nSecond quarter.\nWhen Dallas took possession, Jack Spikes promptly darted around left end for 33 yards, augmented by a 15-yard face mask penalty against Houston. Dawson then hit Abner Haynes, who had lined up as a flanker, on a curl-out pattern and Haynes scooted down the right sideline for 28 yards and a touchdown. Brooker's extra-point made it 10–0, Dallas.\nLater, in the quarter, Houston had the ball at their 32, when Blanda lofted a pass deep, but Dave Grayson picked the ball off and returned it to the Houston 29. Dallas kept the ball on the ground, with Haynes scoring his 2nd TD, and Dallas led 17–0. George Blanda would not be deterred and continued to pass, but a 4th down incompletion at the Dallas 25 ended another drive, and any more scoring threats in the first half.\nAt halftime, AFL Commissioner Joe Foss presented Rookie-Of-The-Year Curtis McClinton and Player-Of-The-Year Len Dawson with Mercury S-55 convertible automobiles.\nThird quarter.\nThe Oilers received the kickoff and Blanda again came out throwing. With Charlie Tolar (an oil-well fire fighter in the off-season)3 knocking defenders down and Blanda passing, Houston culminated the drive with a 15-yard pass to Willard Dewveall, closing the gap to 17–7, Dallas.\nLater in the third period Haynes fumbled and Houston recovered at the Dallas 20, but Johnny Robinson picked-off Blanda's pass at the goal line and returned in to the Dallas 37.\nDallas kept the ball on the ground in the 2nd half, intending to use up the clock and keep Houston's potent offense off the field. Dallas consistently moved the ball, but could not get into scoring position.\nFourth quarter.\nGeorge Blanda using the double wing backfield, had Houston driving again. On a third down pass from the Dallas 24, Johnny Robinson delivered a hard hit to Billy Cannon at the goal line, knocking the ball loose and preventing a touchdown. Blanda then kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 17–10, Dallas.\nDallas stayed conservative and Blanda continued the aerial assault connecting with Cannon and Hennigan to move to the Dallas 1-yard line. Fullback Charlie Tolar, the \"human bowling ball\", took the ball in on a 1-yard dive, again knocking defenders out of the way. Blanda's extra-point tied the game at 17–17.\nWith the clock running down, Dave Grayson blocked a 42-yard field goal attempt by Blanda to end any more scoring threats.\nOvertime.\nThe first overtime started with a potentially damaging gaffe by Dallas captain Abner Haynes, who won the toss and said, \"We'll kick to the clock,\" inadvertently leaving his team with neither the first possession or favorable wind conditions. What Haynes wanted was the wind behind his team, but by saying \"We'll kick...\" first, he gave the Oilers the choice of having the wind at their backs. As it turned out, it didn't matter. The first overtime went scoreless, but Bill Hull intercepted a Blanda pass to end it with the Texans at the Oilers' 48.\nIn the second overtime, Jack Spikes picked up ten yards on a pass reception and nineteen yards on a rush. After the Texans ran a couple of plays to position the ball, rookie Tommy Brooker came in on fourth-and-nine, and kicked a 25-yard field goal after 2:54 of the sixth quarter, or 17:54 of sudden-death overtime, to end the game.\nThe Houston Oilers had come within a hair's breadth of winning the first three AFL championships, but the Texans prevailed, 20–17, in their last game before moving north to Missouri to become the Kansas City Chiefs. They would win the AFL title again in 1966 and 1969, gaining berths in the first and fourth Super Bowls.\nPlayers' shares.\nThe overflow attendance of nearly 38,000 brought a gate of about $170,000 ($ in dollars). The winning Texans players each made $2,261 ($ in dollars), while the Oilers received $1,471 each ($ in dollars) . These shares were less than half of those for the NFL title game in 1962, at $5,888 and $4,166 each.\nAftermath.\nAt the end of the season, the Texans moved to Kansas City, Missouri and changed their name to the Chiefs. The Chiefs would return to the AFL Championship 4 years later in 1966 to earn a trip to Super Bowl I.\nThe Oilers would go on to have four straight losing seasons before making it the AFL Championship game again in 1967, where they would lose to the Oakland Raiders.\nAs of , this is the last title game to have been played in Houston, and also the last title game hosted by the Oilers/Titans franchise, which moved to Tennessee after the 1996 season (they have played in the AFC Championship Game three times since the move, all on the road). The Houston Texans, who commenced play in 2002, are currently the only NFL team which has never played in a post-merger conference championship game."

In the Eastern Division, the Titans of New York lost 27–10 to Denver, while Boston beat Buffalo 52–21, in \"Week Seven\", for a tie in the race, with the Pats at 3–3–1 and the Titans at 3–3–0. The Titans lost, 48–13 to San Diego, in \"Week Nine\". The following week, though (November 12), Houston beat Boston, 27–15, to take a half-game lead, and won the division by a full game."

        "text": "At the end of each UEFA European Championship tournament, several awards are attributed to the players and teams which have distinguished from the rest, in different aspects of the game.\nAwards.\nThere are currently five post-tournament awards, and one given during the tournament:\nPlayer of the Tournament.\nThe \"Player of the Tournament\" award is presented to the best player at each edition of the UEFA European Championship since 1996.\nUEFA published on its website the Player of the Tournament in 1984, 1988 and 1992. The winners were Michel Platini, Marco van Basten and Peter Schmeichel, respectively. However, these winners are unofficial. \nDue to Schmeichel's award in 1992 being unofficial, Gianluigi Donnarumma was the first goalkeeper to officially win the award, at UEFA Euro 2020.\nTop goalscorer.\nIf there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 2008 the tie-breaker goes to the player who has contributed the most assists. If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker goes to the player who has played the least amount of time. Between the years 1960 and 2016, the Golden Boot award went to the top goalscorer of each edition of the UEFA European Championship. At Euro 2020, there was a new physical and digital trophy presented to the tournament's top scorer. It was commissioned by Alipay, the Chinese company sponsoring the award. \"Sculpted in the shape of the Chinese character '支' (pronounced zhi, and meaning 'payment' as well as 'support'), the barefooted player on the trophy reflects the egalitarian footballing ideal that success on the pitch comes regardless of background or status,\" according to UEFA.\nYoung Player of the Tournament.\nThe \"Young Player of the Tournament\" award is presented to the best player in the tournament who is at most 22 years old. For the UEFA Euro 2016, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1994. The award was first given out in 2016.\nMan of the Match Award.\nThe \"Man of the Match\" award picks the outstanding player in every game of the tournament since 1996.\nTotal awards&lt;br&gt;\"As of 28 June 2021\"\nTeam of the Tournament.\nEditions.\nThe \"Team of the Tournament\" is a team of the best performers at each respective UEFA European Championship edition, as chosen by the UEFA Technical Study Group since 1996. UEFA also retroactively named teams of the best 11 players from the 1960 to 1992 tournaments. The number of players in these squads has changed, from 18 players in 1996, 22 players in 2000, and 23 players from 2004 until 2012. Since 2016, a team of 11 players has been named.\nAll-time Euro XI.\nIn June 2016, ahead of UEFA Euro 2016 in France, UEFA published an All-time Euro XI; the winning team was chosen based on votes cast on EURO2016.com and Twitter. The application featured the 11 players who have made the greatest impact at EURO final tournaments. Nominees had to meet at least two of the following four criteria:"

Parsons suffered a career-ending eye injury in 1939, forcing him to retire from the National Hockey League. Parsons later became involved with CCM hockey and the development of hockey helmets and facial protection. The George Parsons Trophy is given annually to the player judged to be the most sportsmanlike at the Memorial Cup tournament.\nPlaying career.\nParsons played four seasons of junior ice hockey from 1930 to 1934, and appeared in the 1933 Memorial Cup as a member of the West Toronto Nationals, and the 1934 Memorial Cup as a member of the Toronto Young Rangers. While still a junior in 1932, he was also used as a call-up to senior hockey teams in the Toronto Mercantile Hockey League, and the Toronto Independent Hockey League. Parsons participated in the 1935 Allan Cup with the Toronto All-Stars.\nParsons signed as a free agent with the Maple Leafs on October 22, 1935. Parsons played the 1935–36 season with the International Hockey League's Syracuse Stars, then made his NHL debut playing five games with the Leafs in the 1936–37 NHL season. He finished the season as a member of the Syracuse Stars who won the inaugural Calder Cup in the 1936–37 AHL season. He began the next season with Syracuse, then moved up to the Leafs.\nAn on-ice accident at Maple Leaf Gardens against the Chicago Black Hawks resulted in Parsons losing his left eye.\"\"I remember the date well. It was March 3rd, 1939. I was 24 years old. Earl Robinson of Chicago tried to lift my stick but he hit me in the eye. When I was in the hospital the president of the league, Frank Calder, visited me and suggested that I shouldn't play again.\"— George Parsons\"\nParsons was forced to retire from the NHL due to a rule prohibiting players with reduced sight. The league had previously adopted the Trushinski Bylaw by-law which forbade players with one eye to play. It was named after a minor leagueplayer named Frank Trushinski, who had lost sight in one eye, and then lost most of the sight in his other eye.\nCCM hockey.\nParsons became involved with CCM hockey, helping to develop helmets and facial protection that would be safer for players. Within CCM, he was the North American sales manager to vice-president of product development. By early 1976, CCM had developed a hockey helmet complete with eye and face shield and lower face protector that was both approved by the Canadian Standards Association and endorsed by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association."

She is the UIC Flames women's basketball all-time leader in career points, career free throws made, career three-point shots made as well as single-season three-point shots made and was the first female Flames basketball player to have her number retired. She was the 1996 Midwestern Collegiate Conference (now Horizon League) Women's Basketball Player of the Year. She won an Illinois High School Association (IHSA) class AA championship in high school. She is the sister of Jenny McCarthy and cousin of Melissa McCarthy.\nEarly life.\nMcCarthy was born on October 26, 1974, in the village of Orland Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. She is the third of four sisters: Lynette, Jenny and Amy. The family has German, Irish, and Polish ancestry. Growing up she went to St. Turibius Elementary, and the family lived in a two-bedroom until they could afford to expand it with additional bedrooms. She had a Catholic upbringing on Chicago's South Side. Her parents, Dan and Linda McCarthy of Orland Park, encouraged all of their kids to be active in high school sports: Lynette ran track; Jenny played softball; and both Amy and Joanne chose basketball. All four were also gymnasts and bowlers as youths. Dan was a steel plant foreman, who sometimes juggled three jobs to send his children to private Catholic schools. Lisa worked out of the home as a beautician. \nJoanne attended Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School where she starred in basketball. Mother McAuley, which was the largest American all-girls school with 1,915 students during McCarthy's senior season, was a volleyball powerhouse. In 1989, the school made the IHSA Class AA final four in basketball with McCarthy. As a junior, she was a member of the Mother McAuley 1991 girls Class AA state championship team. She was a teammate with her sister Amy at Mother McAuley.\nBasketball career.\nCollege.\nMcCarthy played for UIC from 1992 to 1997. She was a two-time First-Team All-Midwestern Collegiate Conference (MCC, now Horizon League) selection and 1996 MCC Player of the Year. For the 1996–97 season she was the preseason MCC Player of the Year selection. During her career at UIC, she played with her younger sister, Amy. She and Amy formed the starting backcourt in Joanne's final season. In some statistics, they were first and second on the team. While at UIC, she majored in psychology.\nShe had set several records for the University of Illinois-Chicago including career scoring (1,805 points), career assists (430) and career Three-point field goal percentage (.385) by the time her career ended in 1997. In 2001, her number 21 jersey was retired by UIC, the schools first such honor for a female basketball player. She surpassed Penny Armstrong's career point total of 1,657. With over 70 consecutive starts, she also set the school's iron woman record. Other school records that McCarthy retired with include career three-point field goals made (238), career free throws made (463), single-season three point shots made (76), career free throw percentage (81.4%), career games played (115), career games started (111), and single-season games played/started (31).

She was later drafted with the first pick of the fifth round of the 1998 American Basketball League draft by the Chicago Condors. McCarthy was a late addition to the Condors opening night inaugural roster when Katrina McClain decided that she would not join the Condors team that she had been assigned to following the disbanding of the Atlanta Glory. Joining the Condors meant McCarthy could play professionally in the same home arena (UIC Pavilion, now known as the Credit Union 1 Arena) that she did in college. During the 1998–99 season, she played in six games for the Condors, where she was coached by Jim Cleamons. Initially, she had joined the team as a \"salaried replacement player if anyone is injured\". When the league folded, she tried out for the Los Angeles Sparks and Utah Starzz.\nPersonal life.\nFollowing basketball, McCarthy moved to Los Angeles and became a makeup artist.

        "text": "Kenneth George Sanders (born July 8, 1941) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1964 to 1976 for the Kansas City Athletics, Boston Red Sox, Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, California Angels, New York Mets, and Kansas City Royals.\nEarly years.\nSanders attended St. Louis University High School in St. Louis, Missouri, and was a standout in soccer, football and baseball. After a month at St. Louis University, he signed with the Kansas City Athletics as an amateur free agent in .\nHe went 19–10 with a 3.21 earned run average as a starting pitcher his first professional season with the Florida State League's Sanford Greyhounds. He split his time between starts and relief appearances until , when he was converted to a full-time reliever with the Birmingham Barons. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees later that season, pitching 1.2 innings without giving up a run. For the season, Sanders went 0–2 with a 3.67 ERA and one save.\nAfter spending all of in triple A, Sanders was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 1965 rule 5 draft. In , he went 3–6 with two saves and a 3.80 ERA for the Bosox before being dealt back to Kansas City with Jim Gosger and Guido Grilli for Rollie Sheldon, Jose Tartabull and John Wyatt. He made his only major league start upon his return to the A's, pitching four innings of one run ball against the California Angels before giving way to the bullpen.\nWith the exception of a brief one month call-up in by the Oakland Athletics, Sanders spent the next three seasons in the minors. Just prior to Spring training 1970, he, Mike Hershberger, Lew Krausse Jr. and Phil Roof were traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Don Mincher and Ron Clark.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nThe Brewers lost 97 games their first season in Milwaukee (after having spent one season in Seattle as the Pilots). One of the few bright spots on the team was Sanders' emergence as a legitimate major league closer. Sanders set a club record with 13 saves to go along with a 5–2 record and 1.75 ERA. His season was even more impressive as he led Major League Baseball with 83 appearances on the mound (his closest competitor was Cincinnati Reds pitcher Wayne Granger with 70), and set a major league record by finishing 77 of them. He also led the major leagues with 31 saves. Coupled with his seven wins, Sanders figured in 38 of the Brewers' 69 wins.\nHe began the season as the Brewers' closer, pitching 18.2 innings and earning four saves before giving up his first earned run of the season. From there, things went south for Sanders, as he found himself at 1–7 with a 3.45 ERA and 13 saves at the All-Star break. He lost the confidence of new Brewers manager Del Crandall, and only picked up four more saves for the rest of the season. Following the campaign, Sanders was traded twice in a span of 32 days. First, to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Jim Lonborg, Ken Brett and Earl Stephenson for Don Money, John Vukovich and Bill Champion on October 31. Then, to the Minnesota Twins along with Ken Reynolds and Joe Lis for César Tovar on December 1.\nJourneyman.\nSanders earned eight saves for the Twins by the end of May despite a relatively high 5.60 ERA. He lost the closer's job to Ray Corbin, and was placed on waivers. He was soon claimed by the Cleveland Indians, and pitched far more respectably with his new club, going 5–1 with a 1.65 ERA and five saves. Back-to-back poor performances against the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles led to his release in .\nHe soon signed a minor league deal with the California Angels, and was promoted to the big league club after 19 games at triple A. He appeared in nine games with the Angels, earning one save. During the off season, he was traded to the New York Mets for catcher Ike Hampton.\nThough the Mets finished in third in the National League East in , it was not out of a lack of pitching. Sanders, along with former Brewers teammate Skip Lockwood and Bob Apodaca, gave the Mets one of the more formidable bullpens in the division. For his part, Sanders went 1–1 with a 2.30 ERA and five saves. Toward the end of the season, his contract was sold to the Kansas City Royals. He started the season playing minor league ball for the Brewers before retiring, and moving into real estate.\nCareer stats.\nAs a reliever, Sanders only had 67 plate appearances. One of his two career RBIs came against Hall of Famer Jim Palmer in 1966."

His manager, John McGraw, was one of the first to use a relief pitcher to save games.\nOn June 29, 1905, while playing for the Giants, Elliott played a part in history that would be immortalized some 80 years later with the making of \"Field of Dreams\".

Roberts was the oldest man to play the position of goaltender in National Hockey League history, and in two different stretches of several decades was both the oldest player to play an NHL game and the youngest to play goal in the NHL. Roberts was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, but grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nRoberts played a total of ten games in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, New York Americans, and Chicago Black Hawks, as well as playing sixteen seasons in the minor leagues, most notably for the Cleveland Barons and the New Haven Eagles. His career was interrupted for four seasons after he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, he played only one more regular season of professional hockey.\nRoberts made his NHL debut with the Boston Bruins on December 8, 1925, substituting for injured regular Doc Stewart in a 3-2 win against the Montreal Maroons. At age 19, he was the youngest goaltender in NHL history, until surpassed by Harry Lumley nearly twenty years later.\nOn November 25, 1951, Roberts, then an assistant trainer with the Black Hawks, had to finish the third period for the injured Lumley, at that point the Black Hawks' starter. Although Roberts didn't yield a goal, his Hawks still fell to the Detroit Red Wings, 5-2. The then 45-year-old Roberts, in his last NHL game, became the oldest player to play in an NHL game; a record he held until broken by Gordie Howe in 1979, and also passed by Chris Chelios. He remains the oldest goaltender to play in an NHL game. He also was the final NHL player who was active in the 1920s.\nRoberts was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005."

According to the Canadians the trouble started when Winters first threatened to \"get\" every one of the visiting players, and then also verbally abused their coach Father William Stanton with \"the coarsest language\", and that it later escalated into a full scale riot when Cleveland player Elmer Irving threatened both the referee and the Ottawa players after having been penalized.\nThe Cleveland version on the other hand laid the blame on Ottawa player Jim Burnett, claiming the riot had started when Burnett slashed Winters across the nose with his stick. In the following melee Ottawa's goaltender Vincent Doran hit Elmer Irving over the head with his stick, after Irving had held down Ed Nagle, which left Irving with a fractured skull. Cleveland's trainer then took part in the melee and hit Ottawa player Redmond Quain over the head with a bottle. The spectators (a 2,000 crowd) then jumped onto the ice to join in, and the police had to be called upon to quell the disturbance, with a number of people getting hurt in the ensuing panic. Vincent Doran was arrested on a charge of assault to kill, for his attack on Irving, and his teammate Redmond Quain also appeared in a Cleveland police court as a witness against the Cleveland team's trainer. Doran was later dismissed by the police court when Irving refused to prosecute him."

He was also a co-founder of Christian Brother's Hockey Sticks, along with his brother Bill Christian and brother-in-law Hal Bakke.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Warroad, Minnesota, Christian began playing hockey at a young age. He would play on the roads, lakes, and outdoor rinks with his friends for up to five hours each day. Growing up he and brother, Billy, would use magazines as padding. They only had one pair of skates between the two of them and would share that pair each time they would go skating. Christian also played organized hockey at Warroad High School. He began playing at Warroad in 1950 and was the leading scorer within two years. During the 1953 season, Christian led Warroad to the State Tournament.

They officially moved to this new plant in 1969 and operated there for many years. During the 1980 Winter Olympics, the business received additional attention. Roger's nephew Dave Christian led the U.S. team in assists and brought another gold medal to Warroad. This was not only a great accomplishment for Dave but this was beneficial for the family's company. After this, sales boomed to up to 40% more sticks. This was mainly because Dave was using a Christian Bros stick while he successfully received the gold medal.\nChristian and his brother sold their company in 2002 because of changes in materials, multi-national competition, and increased licensing fees.\nPersonal life.\nChristian and his wife, Jean, had three sons. He died on November 9, 2011, in Grand Forks, North Dakota."

Mather was a member of the American 1948 Winter Olympics ice hockey team. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998.\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nMather's career started in Belmont, where he played for his hometown Belmont High School. Possessing a quick shot and deceptive speed, Mather earned the nickname of “Little Poison” during his time at Belmont High. His strong play during his high school career would allow him to go on and play for Dartmouth College; while there Mather would center future Olympic teammates Bruce Cunliffe and Ralph Warburton. This line would prove to be highly successful as it would lead Dartmouth in scoring for two seasons and with the aid of his two wingers Mather would record a minimum of 6 points in a game an amazing 7 times including a 10-point game vs. Middlebury College on February 2, 1944. The trio would also be a big component in helping Dartmouth achieve an astonishing 46-game unbeaten streak (45–0–1) from 1941–42 to 1944–45. In 1947 Mather would lead Dartmouth in scoring, tallying 56 points and helping them to a 16–2–2 record. The ’47 season would also see one of Mather’s career highlights as he scored a crucial game winning goal to help Dartmouth defeat Michigan in Ann Arbor. The win would clinch the number one ranking in the country, which was significant given there was no NCAA Tournament during this time.\nInternational career.\nMather’s strong play, along with that of his line mates at Dartmouth, led to an invitation to play on the United States Olympic team for the whole line. The 1948 Winter Olympics held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, however, were not without their share of controversy. Due to a dispute with the Olympic Committee, the US team was allowed to compete and have the results of their games count in the standings, but they were not eligible to win a medal. This did not slow Mather as he played in all eight US games, leading them in scoring with 16 goals and 27 points. The tournament was also witness to another of Mather’s career highlights when he scored an impressive five goals against Austria. Overall, his strong play helped the United States finish the tournament in what would have been 4th place, had they not essentially been disqualified. Mather also represented the United States in the 1949 World Championships held in Stockholm, Sweden, winning a Bronze Medal.\nLater career.\nMather continued his Hockey career playing for the Boston Olympics in the Eastern Hockey League. Where Mather gained notoriety as one of the best Americans on a team that not only played Eastern powers but against Canadian powers from the Quebec Senior Leagues, Mather was even selected as an All-League Center. In 1950 Mather signed with the Boston Bruins; unfortunately he would never play a game for the B’s. However he would make frequent appearances in benefit games with the \"old time Bruins\".\nAfter his playing days Mather shared his knowledge of the game, becoming a coach for youth hockey.\nMather died suddenly in 1975 at age 49."

        "text": "The 1967 AFL season was the eighth regular season of the American Football League.\nThe season ended when the Oakland Raiders (13–1) hosted the Houston Oilers (9–4–1) in the AFL championship game on December 31. The Raiders won 40–7 and then met the NFL's Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II two weeks later, won by Green Bay, 33–14.\nThis was the final season that all AFL on-field officials wore vertically striped red and white uniforms. The next year all officials would wear uniforms mirroring those of their NFL counterparts.\nDivision races.\nThe AFL's nine teams, grouped into two divisions (5 teams in the Eastern Division), faced each other at least once, and each team would play six others twice. Though the New York Jets and the Houston Oilers were both in the Eastern Division, they met only once that season, on October 15. The best team in the Eastern Division would play against the best in the Western Division in a championship game. If there was a tie in the standings at the top of either division, a one-game playoff would be held to determine the division winner."

        "text": "The 1967 AFL Championship Game was the eighth American Football League championship game, played on December 31 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California.\nIt matched the Western Division champion Oakland Raiders (13–1) and the Eastern Division champion Houston Oilers (9–4–1) to decide the American Football League (AFL) champion for the 1967 season.\nQuarterback Daryle Lamonica, traded from the Buffalo Bills in the offseason, led the Raiders to a 13–1 record, throwing 30 touchdown passes in the process. The Oilers went from last place in the East in 1966 (3–11) to first in 1967, beating out the New York Jets by a game. Most of the Oilers' offense centered on big fullback Hoyle Granger, and a midseason quarterback trade for the shifty Pete Beathard (sending their own starter, Jacky Lee, to the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs) proved to be the spark that turned Houston's season around.\nThe teams had met once in the regular season, three weeks earlier in Houston, with Oakland winning 19–7 to clinch the Western division title. This was Houston's fourth and final appearance (1960, 1961, 1962) in the title game and Oakland's first. \nIn contrast to the frigid conditions earlier in the day at the NFL championship game in Green Bay, the temperature for the AFL title game in northern California was . The host Raiders were ten-point favorites.\nOakland won 40–7 and shredded the Oilers with 364 yards of offense, including 263 yards rushing, while allowing just 146 total yards and 38 yards on the ground. The Raiders also forced three turnovers and lost none themselves.\nThe attendance of 53,330 was a new record for the AFL title game, passing the 42,080 of the previous year at Buffalo.\nGame summary.\nShortly after 2 pm PST, Oakland's Dave Grayson returned the opening kickoff 47 yards, sparking a drive into scoring range, but it ended with no points when George Blanda missed a 38-yard field goal attempt. Houston then mounted their own drive into Raiders territory, but they also came up empty as a result of a fumble by tight end Alvin Reed on the Oakland 30-yard line that was forced and recovered by linebacker Dan Conners. Following a three-and-out for each team, Rodger Bird returned Jim Norton's 39-yard punt 9 yards to the Raiders 43-yard line, where they drove 28 yards to score on Blanda's 37-yard field goal with 3:06 left in the first quarter. Houston's next drive stalled on their own 44 and Norton had to punt again on the quarter's final play. Despite their 3–0 deficit, the Oilers seemed to be playing fairly well, having outgained Oakland in total yards, 93-52.\nThis quickly changed on the first play of the second quarter. Hewritt Dixon took a handoff from Lamonica, ran around the left end, and took off down the sidelines untouched for an AFL championship record 69-yard touchdown run, giving the Raiders a 10–0 lead. The rest of the game would be a desperate struggle for Houston's defense to keep the Raiders from adding more points, sometimes successful, but often not. Oakland defensive back Willie Brown intercepted a pass from Beathard on the Oilers next drive, though this only led to a missed 44-yard attempt by Blanda. After a punt, the Raiders drove to the Houston 36, but came up short again when Dixon was stuffed for no gain on 4th and 1. After another Norton punt, Oakland drove from their own 22-yard line to the Oilers 17. Faced with 4th and 1 again, the Raiders sent their field goal unit on to the field, but ran a fake field goal play with Lamonica (the holder on special teams) throwing a 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dave Kocourek. This gave Oakland a 17–0 lead with just 12 seconds left in the half.\nOakland completely took over the game in the second half. Houston defensive back Zeke Moore fumbled the opening kickoff when tackled by Duane Benson, and Ken Herock recovered the ball, returning it 6 yards to the Houston 29. Seven plays later, Lamonica made the score 24–0 with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then after a three-and-out, the Raiders drove 56 yards to go up 27-0 on Blanda's 40-yard field goal. The next Houston drive resulted in yet another three-and-out, and Norton's 33-yard punt gave Oakland the ball on their 46. Houston managed to force a punt of their own, but Mike Eischeid's 44-yard kick pinned them back at their own 2-yard line. The next drive resulted in more of the same, another three-and-out and another Norton punt, which Bird returned 19 yards to the Oilers 31-yard line. Oakland then scored on a 7-play drive that ended on a 40-yard Blanda field goal, putting the team up by a score of 30–0.\nThis time, Houston managed to respond, driving 78 yards in 5 plays to score on Beathard's 5-yard touchdown pass to Charley Frazier, cutting the score to 30–7. But by this point, less than 13 minutes remained in the game. Meanwhile, Oakland struck back with a 36-yard field goal, and later finished off the scoring with a 7-play, 48-yard drive that ended on Lamonica's 12-yard touchdown pass to Bill Miller.\nNeither quarterback had a particularly good day. Beathard completed just 15 of 35 passes for 142 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Frazier was the top receiver of the game with 7 receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown. Bobby Jancik returned 4 kickoffs for 100 yards. Lamonica finished the day with 10 completions in 24 attempts for 111 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 22 yards and another score. Dixon rushed for 144 yards and a touchdown, and caught a pass for 8 yards. Banaszak rushed for 116 yards on just 15 carries, and caught a 4-yard pass. Blanda set an AFL championship record with four field goals on six attempts. Norton also had a busy day for Houston, punting 11 times for 423 yards.\nOfficials.\nThe AFL added a sixth game official, the side linesman, in the previous season; the NFL added its sixth official, the line judge, in . The seventh official, the side judge, was added in .\nPlayers' shares.\nThe winning Raiders earned about $6,500 each, while the Oilers received about $5,000 each.\nThe upcoming Super Bowl II awarded an additional $15,000 per player for the winners and $7,500 each for the losing team."

        "text": "The 1966 AFL season was the seventh regular season of the American Football League. The league began its merger process with the National Football League (NFL) in June, which took effect fully in .\nThe season also saw the debut of the expansion Miami Dolphins, the AFL's ninth team (an odd number), requiring an idle team each week. A sixth official, the Line Judge, was added to the officiating crew; the NFL added the Line Judge the previous season.\nThe season ended when the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the two-time defending champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship game, and were defeated by the NFL's Green Bay Packers in the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, now known as Super Bowl I.\nDivision races.\nThe AFL now had nine teams, grouped into two divisions (the new Miami team was in the Eastern Division, now with five teams), and still played a 14-game schedule. In previous seasons (with eight clubs), each played a home-and-away game against the other seven. All nine teams faced each other at least once, and each team played six others twice. Though Boston and Miami were both in the Eastern Division, they met only once, on November 27 (each team played Western Division teams Kansas City and Denver twice, while Boston also played San Diego twice and Miami played Oakland twice --- meaning that the Patriots and Dolphins each had a schedule that called for them to face three non-division opponents more often than they played a divisional opponent).\nAs in earlier years, the division champions met in the league championship game, with the home team rotating, this year to the Eastern champion. If there was a tie in the standings at the top of either division, a one-game playoff would be held to determine the division winner, with the other division's winner idle. \nRegular season.\nPrior to the season, the AFL–NFL merger was announced in June, and both leagues agreed to have their champions meet in an annual AFL-NFL World Championship Game (later known as the Super Bowl), beginning in January 1967. Additionally, a common draft was introduced, with the first held in March 1967.\nAlso, the Miami Dolphins joined the AFL as its first expansion team. Joe Auer would score the first touchdown in Dolphins history, returning an opening kickoff for 95 yards versus the Oakland Raiders. "

        "title": "1966 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1966 AFL Championship Game was the seventh American Football League's championship game, played at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on January 1, 1967.\nIt matched the Western Division champion Kansas City Chiefs (11–2–1) and the Eastern Division champion Buffalo Bills (9–4–1) to decide the American Football League (AFL) champion for the 1966 season.\nThe host Bills entered as two-time defending champions, but the visiting Chiefs were three-point favorites, mainly because of their explosive and innovative offense led by head coach Hank Stram. The Bills were a more conventional team with a solid defensive line and a running mindset on offense. The two teams had split their season series, played early in the schedule without weather as a factor, with the road team winning each.\nThe Chiefs defeated the Bills by a score of 31–7, and advanced to Super Bowl I to play against the National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers.\nBackground.\nThe game was originally scheduled for Monday, December 26, the week after the conclusion of the regular season. The AFL–NFL merger agreement of June 1966 called for a \"world championship game\" between the league champions. When a date of January 15, 1967, was established, the AFL title game was moved to January 1, same as the NFL championship game in Dallas. The AFL game was at 1 p.m. EST, televised by NBC, and the NFL game followed at 4 p.m. on CBS.\nLike the NFL, the host team for the title game was alternated between the divisions, regardless of record. In the AFL, the Eastern division hosted in even-numbered years and the Western in odd; home-field advantage was not adopted until .\nKansas City Chiefs.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs finished the 1966 regular season with an 11–2–1 record and clinched the Western Division title five weeks earlier, on November 27. Quarterback Len Dawson finished the season with 2,527 passing yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 10 interceptions, giving him a 101.7 passer rating. The team's top wide receiver was Otis Taylor who caught 58 passes for 1,297 yards and 8 touchdowns; Chris Burford also contributed by catching 58 passes for 758 yards and 8 touchdowns. Mike Garrett was the team's leading rusher, gaining 801 yards and 6 touchdowns. Other reliable options included Curtis McClinton (540 yards, 4 touchdowns) and Bert Coan (521 yards, 7 touchdowns). The Chiefs' offense consisted of five All-Stars: Len Dawson, Curtis McClinton, Otis Taylor, Jim Tyrer, and Ed Budde.\nTheir defense featured six All-Stars: Johnny Robinson, E.J. Holub, Sherrill Headrick, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, and Jerry Mays.\nGame summary.\nIn a chilly drizzle, Kansas City broke open a tied fierce 7–7 battle and dominated the rest of the contest from there on, forcing four turnovers (without losing any themselves) and outscoring host Buffalo 24-0 over the last three quarters.\nOn the opening kickoff, Fletcher Smith's short kick was fielded by defensive end Dudley Meredith, who promptly fumbled the ball, and KC punter Jerrel Wilson, who also played on the kick coverage team, recovered it for the Chiefs on the Bills 31-yard line. This led to the first score of the game, a 29-yard touchdown pass from Len Dawson to tight end Fred Arbanas. After an exchange of punts, Buffalo tied the game when receiver Elbert Dubenion raced ahead of defensive back Fred Williamson, \"the Hammer\", caught a pass from Jack Kemp at the Chiefs 45, and raced all the way to the end zone for a 69-yard touchdown reception.\nLater on, Mike Garrett's 27-yard punt return gave the Chiefs a first down on the Bills 45-yard line. After a few plays, Dawson made a key 15-yard completion to Arbanas advancing to the Buffalo 29. It was the last catch of the day for Arbanas, who ended up leaving the game with a separated shoulder; however, it paid off big time as Dawson threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Otis Taylor on the next play, giving the Chiefs a 14–7 second quarter lead. Buffalo responded with a drive deep into Chiefs territory, featuring Kemp's 30-yard completion to rookie receiver Rob Burnett to the Kansas City 12-yard line. But in what turned out to be one of the most crucial plays of the game, Kemp's next pass resulted in a costly interception in the end zone by safety Johnny Robinson, who returned the football 72 yards to the Bills 28. Mike Mercer eventually cashed in the turnover with a 32-yard field goal that gave the Chiefs a 17–7 halftime lead.\nThe third quarter was a defensive struggle with each team punting the football twice. Near the end, Kansas City got possession of the football on the Bills 42-yard line, but failed to score when Mercer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt.\nThe Chiefs put the game away with consecutive touchdown drives in the fourth quarter. First, Dawson's 45-yard completion to Chris Burford gave the team a first down at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Garrett then ran the ball on the next four plays, concluding with a 1-yard touchdown run. On the first play of Buffalo's next drive, receiver Glenn Bass lost a fumble that Bobby Hunt returned 21 yards to the Bills 20-yard line, which led to another Garrett touchdown run, the final score of the game from 18 yards. Buffalo could do nothing with their next drive, and on their final one of the day, Kemp was intercepted by Emmitt Thomas.\nDawson completed 16 of 24 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 28 yards. Garrett rushed for 39 yards and two touchdowns, caught 4 passes for 16 yards, returned a kickoff for 3 yards, and added another 37 yards on 3 punt returns. Kemp completed 12 of 25 passes for 253 yards and a touchdown, coupled with two costly interceptions. Burnett caught six passes for 127 yards.\nOfficials.\nThe AFL added a sixth game official, the side linesman, in 1966; the NFL added its sixth official, the line judge, during the previous season. The seventh official, the side judge, was added in .\nPlayers' shares.\nThe winning Chiefs split their players' shares for the title game 51 ways for $5,308 each, while the Bills split theirs into 47 shares for about $3,800 each.\nThe upcoming Super Bowl I awarded an additional $15,000 per player for the winners and $7,500 each for the losing team."

        "title": "History of the South Africa national rugby league team",
        "text": "This is a history of the South Africa national rugby league team.\nAttempted establishment.\nRugby league would first gain attention in South Africa when the English and French would attempt expansion in the 1950s for the purpose of creating further international opposition. Three games would then be played between the two nations on the continent but both sides viewed the matches as nothing more than friendly fixtures so never undertook the games in a serious manner and the public never subsequently took to the three exhibition games.\nFormation of national side.\nOver the next several years rugby league would lie dormant in South Africa and it was not until the 1960s when talks of creating a national side began. After much discussion within South Africa, it was eventually agreed that a national side would play a touring Great Britain and then undertake a tour of Australasia. The first South African national side played their first competitive fixture on 23 August 1962 and put on a good showing against the much stronger British but eventually lost by nineteen points, 49–30. The following two fixtures turned out to be much the same with the South Africans being defeated on another two occasions but putting in good performances whilst never being comprehensively beaten. The South Africans would embark on their first tour eleven months later with a twenty-four-man squad that included several former Springboks. The tour would start with several friendly fixtures against various minor representative sides where they would gain two comfortable victories, the first international fixture of the tour would take place in Brisbane against the world champion Australians and the South Africans would perform with courage but eventually lose the match 34–6. The following test was played a week later in Sydney that again saw the team put in a tough effort but would lose again 54–21. South Africa would leave Australia without an international win and be low on confidence heading to New Zealand to play a sole fixture against the New Zealand Kiwis whom were expected to win comfortably. However the match turned out to be a tough encounter and surprisingly saw the team gain its first international victory 4-3 The South African side was supplemented by several Australians for this match and so the fixture was not granted test match status.\nAfter this first string of international fixtures the South Africans became disheartened after only winning four of the thirteen tour matches and rugby league again lay dormant for decades. Initiative taken to develop the game in South Africa, were continuously hit by well organised efforts to withhold playing fields from the league clubs. This was one of the most important reasons why the league game could not settle. Municipal officials and rugby union played a major role to cripple all efforts. The league players who could not carry on while their friends were overseas threw in the towel and that was the main reason for the league dry up. (Ex-player: \"I know what happened\" - Jan Prinsloo)\nThe Rugby League World Cup tournament had been scheduled to be held in France in 1965, this time with the inclusion of the South African team. However the tournament was abandoned.\nFirst World Cup.\nThe early 1990s would see new South African administrators begin to rebuild the international facet of South African rugby. During 1992 the South African national side would again play for the first time in years against several combined African representative teams and the following years would see things look more promising for the Africans with their qualification into the 1995 World Cup and more regularity in international fixtures. Their first World Cup would see the South Africans seeded into the toughest group of the competition containing Australia, England and Fiji. The South Africans would find their three group matches extremely difficult and would fail to win a match during the tournament.\nSecond World Cup.\nThe following years saw the South Africans play on an inconsistent basis against several touring sides most notably including the touring French and Russian sides. Continued progress would see them again qualify for what would be their second consecutive World Cup in 2000 and leading into the tournament they were hopeful of gaining their first Cup win after being drawn into an easier yet still competitive group with France, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. Prior to the tournament they would play Wales for the first time in a tough friendly encounter. After initial optimism leading into the competition the South Africans would face Tonga in their first world cup fixture and be comprehensively beaten 66–18. The following world cup matches would add further disappointment and diminish all optimism the South Africans originally had leading into the competition with a following loss to Papua New Guinea 16-0 and a heavy loss to the French which saw captain Jamie Bloem sin-binned and investigated following comments made about the referee after the match.\n2006 Italian tour.\nAfter a second disappointing World Cup the side would again begin playing irregularly with one off fixtures over the next several years usually against touring national sides but it would not be until 2006 when they would again undertake another tour to foreign soil. A tour to Italy would be undertaken in June 2006 that saw the South Africans play in two tests and gaining their largest victory to date along with appearing in a separate rugby league nines competition in Montelanico."

        "text": "The 1975 Giro d'Italia was the 58th running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Milan, on 17 May, with a set of split stages and concluded with a summit finish to the Passo dello Stelvio, on 7 June, with another split stage, consisting of an individual time trial and a mass-start stage. A total of 90 riders from nine teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Italian Fausto Bertoglio of the Jolly Ceramica team. The second and third places were taken by Spaniard Francisco Galdós and Italian Felice Gimondi, respectively.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Brooklyn's Roger De Vlaeminck won the points classification and Andrés Oliva and Francisco Galdós of KAS won the mountains classification. Brooklyn finished as the winners of the team points classification. Roger De Vlaeminck won seven stages.\nTeams.\nA total of nine teams were invited to participate in the 1975 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 90 cyclists. From the riders that began this edition, 70 made it to the finish on the Passo dello Stelvio.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the race was revealed on 10 April 1975.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were three main individual classifications contested in the 1975 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Three of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo dello Stelvio. The first rider to cross the Stelvio was Spanish rider Francisco Galdós.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the Campionato delle Regioni classification. This was a replacement for the \"traguardi tricolore\" classification that was calculated in previous years. The leader wore a blue jersey with colored vertical stripes (\"maglia azzurra con banda tricolore verticale\")."

        "text": "Richard Delano Campbell (born December 21, 1958) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1981 to 1984. He played college football for the California Golden Bears. He was selected in the first round of the 1981 NFL Draft with the sixth overall pick.\nCampbell was a highly touted recruit out of Santa Teresa High School in San Jose, California, and was Cal’s starting quarterback for his sophomore through senior seasons, 1978-1980. He earned the highly-valued Joe Roth Award as a sophomore in 1978. Roth, who had helped recruit Campbell to Cal, was a quarterback for the Golden Bears in 1975 and 1976. Roth died of cancer in February 1977 just weeks after completing his 1976 season, and the annual award bearing his name goes to the Cal player who best exemplifies Roth's courage, sportsmanship and attitude.\nCollege career.\nAt the University of California, Berkeley, Campbell led a very competitive Golden Bears team his junior year in 1979, winning 7 games and losing several very close games: 14-10 against #11 Michigan, 28-27 at UCLA, 24-14 to #3 USC (undefeated and eventual Rose Bowl winner), and 28-24 to #16 Washington. In discussing game film of Michigan's 14-10 win over Cal, coach Bo Schembechler referred to Campbell as \"a big, strong, powerful quarterback\" who \"can pick you to death with his throwing arm\" as he almost pulled off the upset A fumbled kickoff return by Cal gave Michigan the ball at the 9-yard line, setting up a two play touchdown drive. The Bears did win the rivalry Big Game at Stanford 21-14 in November, one of his fondest memories from his days as the Golden Bears' QB: \"Just walking off the field and hearing one side of the stands so silent\". Campbell lifts the Axe, the rivalry trophy for the winner, after Cal defeats Stanford, November 17, 1979. Here is a short video summary of the \"nail-biter\" Cal-Stanford games of 1979 and 1980, Campbell's junior and senior years, and both Cal wins. Watch the entire 1979 Cal-Stanford game here. \nCampbell’s success his junior year led to his being featured on the cover of Street and Smith’s Official Yearbook 1980 College Football Preview. Stats for 1979 show Campbell was 3rd in the nation in passing yards, 2nd in completions, 2nd in completion %, and Cal was 3rd in Team Passing Offense. “Though this season's 1980 Cal Bears will be 75% freshman and sophomores, not the best mix to contend for a championship ... they probably will again go as far as quarterback Rich Campbell’s brilliant right arm can carry them. He completed 67% of his passes (241 of 360 for 2859 yards and 15 TDs) last season as a junior, despite throwing into an 8-man coverage most of the time. Breakdowns in the kicking game accounted for all five of the Bears 1979 regular season losses” \nHe was an All-American his senior season in 1980, completing an NCAA best 71% of his passes. He set a then-NCAA record with 43 completed passes in 53 attempts in a losing effort against the Florida Gators. However his senior year was hampered by a late-season knee injury in the game at USC. During his college career at Cal, he passed for 7174 yards, a record at the time. He is still fourth all time in both passing yards and completions at Cal, as well as 12th in touchdown passes. Among the greatest quarterbacks ever at Cal, he is the most accurate passer in Cal history, as well as in the top five in both yards per attempt at 7.7 and passing efficiency rating (min. 300 attempts) at 132.7.\nCampbell was a part of one of the strangest incidents at Cal’s Memorial Stadium that didn't involve the Stanford band (\"The Play\" happened three seasons later). After a punt in the 3rd quarter of the USC game in 1979, a hang glider decided to land on the stadium grass. The glider's path had him heading straight for the 6-foot-5 quarterback who was coming onto the field. \"The crowd was buzzing and that caused me to turn around. He was about 5 feet off the ground and coming in fast. I kept getting lower and lower until I had to drop to all fours,\" Campbell recalled. \"If I hadn't, he'd have clipped my head off.\" Shown are the ticket stub from that day, the Annual Joe Roth Memorial game, against #3 USC and the game program with Campbell from the earlier #11 Michigan game, Sept 29, 1979.\nProfessional career.\nSelected by the Green Bay Packers in the 1st round (6th overall) of the 1981 NFL Draft, and the only 1st round quarterback chosen, Campbell eventually played in only seven games over four NFL seasons. Packers offensive coordinator Bob Schnelker thought Campbell didn't have the arm strength, so he rarely put him in to play. Campbell recalls offensive coordinator Schnelker (a former tight end - not a quarterback) as “a really good X’s and O’s guy but not a guy that will work with you after practice and encourage and develop you. That was what I needed at that time and I didn’t get it.” Campbell led the Packers to a last minute road win over the Chicago Bears near the end of the 1984 season; that Bears team would make it to the NFC Championship game, and the Bears defense would dominate the entire NFL the next year, winning the Super Bowl. Trailing by a point with 1:53 to go, Campbell moved the Packers 71 yards, capping the drive with a 43-yard TD pass to Phillip Epps with 34 seconds to go. The Packers won 20-14, avenging an earlier 9-7 loss to Chicago in September. After that 1984 season, the Packers traded Campbell to the Los Angeles Raiders, but he never played again. He has since become a newspaper columnist at Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers.\nThe Packers did not draft another quarterback in the first round until 2005, when Aaron Rodgers, also from the University of California and who broke some of Campbell’s team records, became a Packer."

        "text": "John Keith Butler (born May 16, 1956) is a former American football coach and linebacker. He played for the National Football League (NFL)'s Seattle Seahawks for ten years. Butler spent 23 years coaching in the NFL, predominantly with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nCollege career.\nButler played college football at Memphis State University (University of Memphis since 1994), starting for three years at inside linebacker under head coach Richard Williamson. He had 384 career tackles and seven interceptions, leading the Tigers in tackles during his junior and senior seasons. Butler was named an AP All-American in his senior year and played in the Senior Bowl and Blue–Gray Football Classic.\nNFL career.\nButler was the 36th selection in the 1978 NFL Draft, taken by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round. He started 132 of 146 games in his ten-year career, and finished with 813 tackles (ranking second on the Seahawks' all-time tackles list).\nCoaching career.\nNCAA coaching career.\nButler began his coaching career at his alma mater in 1990, coaching linebackers and later expanding his role to cover defensive ends and special teams by 1997. He was the architect of a surprise 3-4 defensive scheme which led to Memphis' shocking 1996 upset of the #6 Tennessee Volunteers, led by junior quarterback Peyton Manning. He then moved to Arkansas State in 1998 to serve as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach.\nNFL coaching career.\nButler’s professional football coaching debut came as a linebackers coach for the expansion Cleveland Browns in 1999. He was the only assistant coach retained after a staff turnover in 2001 and coached the next two seasons under Butch Davis, mentoring the expansion club's first ever Pro Bowl selection, linebacker Jamir Miller.\nButler moved to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2003, serving as linebackers coach. He was instrumental in mentoring the development of the Steelers' renowned linebacking corps. His linebacker experience helped the Steelers consistently lead the NFL in rushing defense, total defense, and sacks between 2004-2012. Butler was influential in the development of Pro Bowl linebackers Joey Porter, James Farrior, Lawrence Timmons, LaMarr Woodley, and James Harrison. Harrison, in particular, improved from an undrafted practice squad linebacker into the NFL Defensive Player of the Year under Butler's tutelage.\nDuring his twelve-year tenure as the Steelers' linebackers coach, Butler was considered the heir-apparent for the defensive coordinator position held by the respected Dick LeBeau. Following LeBeau's resignation, Butler was promoted to Defensive Coordinator on January 13, 2015. The Steelers defense was vastly improved in Butler's first season, increasing their sack total from the prior season 33 to 48, increasing their turnovers from 21 to 30, decreasing their points allowed by 4 per game, and leading the NFL in red zone turnovers.\nOne of the significant accomplishments during his tenure as Defensive Coordinator was that the Steelers “lead, or tied for the lead, in overall sacks for the last five years under Butler, setting an NFL record in 2020 when they did it a league-high four years in a row.” Butler announced his retirement from coaching on January 22, 2022.\nPersonal life.\nButler married his wife Janet in 1980 and together they have three adult sons, Blake, Brandon, and Brett. Both Blake and Brandon played college football: Blake played offensive line for the University of Memphis from 2002 until 2006, and Brandon played linebacker/defensive end for the University of Akron from 2003 until 2006, and later at Ashland University during the 2007 and 2008 seasons."

        "text": "American Football Association of Finland (Finnish: Suomen Amerikkalaisen Jalkapallon Liitto, abbreviated SAJL) is the national governing body of American football in Finland. It was founded in 1979 and it is a founding member of the European Federation of American Football, EFAF and International Federation of American Football, IFAF. Since 2000, American football has grown steadily. In 2006 there were 27 clubs playing the sport with over 100 teams and over 1400 players. In 2012, the association's competitions fielded over 150 teams with more than 2200 licensed players.\nThe President of the American Football Association of Finland is Roope Noronen.\nMembers.\nThe sport, like it is in the vast majority of other sports, is club-based in Finland. In 2013, the association had a total of 36 active member clubs. The largest number of clubs (5) come from capital city Helsinki, with 3 more hailing from the metropolitan area or neighboring municipalities. Besides Helsinki, Jyväskylä is the only other city that host two or more clubs (Jaguaarit, men's and junior teams and Jaguars, a club fielding women's team)\nLeagues.\nIn Finland, American football is played in men's, women's and youth leagues.\nMen.\nMen's teams are divided into four divisions with provisional promotion and relegation rules.\nLeague license system.\nThe two highest tiers have a league license system in place, hence no promotion and relegation between these and 2nd division are ever based on competitive results alone. In addition to competitive status, teams have to reach a certain level when it comes to economics and organizational structure. They must meet a number of standards in different fields, such as the number of licensed players, the number of junior teams, etc. The criteria are the same with Maple League and 1st division licenses, however, for League teams, the standards are higher.\nAfter each season teams must apply for a place in the Maple League and the 1st division. Teams eligible to apply for a spot in Maple League are the ones ranked from #1 to #10 in the national ranking, including Maple League teams from the previous season, plus 2–4 of the best teams from the 1st division, depending on the number of Maple League teams the previous year. The teams that are eligible for 1st division are the teams from the previous year and the two best from 2nd division. SAJL checks the applications and grants licenses according to their seed in the previous season. In seeding the teams, the winner of Spaghetti Bowl overtakes the last team from Maple League and the winner of 2nd division is favored before the last teams from 1st division.\nThe system was put in place largely to ensure long-term planning and sensible running of clubs. The system has already shown its cruelty as teams with no alarming difficulties in competitiveness have been relegated due to lack of management and/or economic difficulties.\nRealignment for 2014.\nPrinciple decisions have been made to realign the competition structure for the 2014 season.\nThe most noticeable change will be a new level of competition that will be added between the current 2nd and 3rd division. This has been seen as a necessary step towards making a separation between teams in the current 2nd division. Due to its large size (most teams in SAJL competitions of any age group) and its status as the lowest level of 11-man football, the 2nd division carries a wide range of teams with great differences in the level of play and goals as an organization. The new 2nd division would comprise the top-tier team of the current 2nd division, giving them the chance to play more games between teams of their level. The new league dubbed as \"the new 3rd division\", would now serve as the lowest-tier 11-man football league. It would also provide a better platform for starting and lower-level teams.\nYouth and women's leagues.\nYouth leagues run in 21 and under, 19 and under, 17 and under, 15 and under and 13 and under categories which are called A-, B-, C-, D- and E-juniors respectively. Except for E-juniors, all age classes have championship and division leagues. There are no direct promotion or relegation between the two levels, clubs are free to sign up according to their preference. Championship league winners, however, are given the title of national champion of their respective age class. In championship leagues, A-, B- and C-juniors play with normal 11-man and D-juniors with 9-man rules. All division leagues from A to D-juniors and E-juniors are played with 7-man rules.\nWomen have previously played flag football, but the league for tackle football for women had its inaugural season in 2008. Women play with 9-on-9 rules. 1st division with 7-on-7 rules will be started in 2013. From 2014 season on women's championship series is played with 11-on-11 rules as is the international competition organized by IFAF.\nNational teams.\nSAJL currently fields five national teams: men's senior, U-19, U-17, U-15 and women's team.\nMen's Senior National Team.\nThe men's national team has taken a part in European Championship tournaments since their beginning in 1983. The Finnish National team is the most successful team in Europe, being the only team to participate in all final tournaments and having won European Championship 5 times (1985, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 2000) while finishing second in 1983, 1991 and 2001 and third in 1987 and 2005. The national team has also taken part in 1999 World Championship tournament and 2003 and 2007 qualifications.\nCurrently, Finland is viewed as 5th ranked team in Europe based on the result of 2010 EFAF European Championship, where Finland's only victory came in the 5th place game against Great Britain. The Germany-based tournament was originally awarded to Finland and was scheduled to be held in 2009 but it was later postponed due to women's football European Championships (also hosted by Finland and Finnair Stadium, the slated venue for the EFAF competition too).\nMen's U-19 National Team.\nThe first junior national team was ensembled in 1988. The first years saw just single games against amateur club teams from Nordic countries. In 1992, the first-ever European Junior Championship was held in Toulouse, France. Finland entered the competition with a team now consisting of players, according to new international rules, 19 years old and under. Finland was crowned as the first European Junior Champions beating Italy in the semifinal game and the host nation France in the final game. Finland has since participated every time in the biannual event - apart from the 2002 competition when they lost the qualification game to the Czech Republic. Finland was the most successful team in the first years of the competition, winning the first three titles followed by a bronze medal. The new millennium has seen the tightening of competition with new participants and the rise of powerhouses like Germany. Since losing the bronze game in 2000 EJC, Finland has not qualified for the medal games.\nFinland was in the race for spots in the first World Junior Championship to be held in Ohio, USA in summer 2009. Qualification was done in the 2008 EJC with three top teams granted a spot. Finland, finishing 7th, fell short as Germany, Sweden and France prevailed.\nFinland has also participated in Nordic Junior Championship played biannually since 1997, winning four gold and two silver medals. Finland will host the 8th Championship played in Vantaa in October 2010.\nThe junior national team has a history of being the showcase of best youth talent in Finnish American football. Many of Finland's best players have starred the junior team during their careers, including Michael Quarshie, Seppo Evwaraye and Klaus Alinen.\nMen's U-17 National Team.\nThe project for creating a new junior national team for younger players that weren't yet getting playing time in the U-19 team began in 2007. The age limit was first set to 16. With one and a half years on preparation, the team was set to take part in Nordic Championship scheduled to be held in Tampere, Finland. The tournament was eventually canceled because of financial difficulties of Norway and Denmark. Finland had to settle to a game against Sweden. However, this match was given the championship's status and Finland went on to win the inaugural U-16 Nordic Championship beating Sweden 33-6.\nAs of the 2009 season, the age limit for this junior class was set to 17 to meet EFAF regulations.\nMen's U-15 National Team.\nFlag football.\nFinland has been an eager participant in international tournaments in youth flag football. Their best result so far has been fourth place in the 2006 European Championships. U15 European Championships in 9-man flag football was played from 1995 to 1999. Finland won 4 of those 5 European Championships. Finland did not participate in the 9-man Flag in 1999.\nDevelopment team for contact football.\nDue to the rise of contact football as the pre-eminent form of play amongst 11 to 15-year-olds, a new team will be formed in fall 2013. Naming it \"U-15 Development Team\" is a conscious decision not to call it a \"national team\", but instead a team which gathers talented players from the age group to develop their skill for upcoming junior national teams.\nWomen's National Team.\nThe women's national team started in 2000. In the 2004 World Championship, Finland's two teams took silver in the 7vs7 competition and placed fourth in 5vs5's. The big success came the next year in the European Championships when the team went undefeated to claim the title. In the 2006 World Championships, they took bronze and in 2007 they narrowly failed to defend their title in the EC, taking silver.\nThe newest addition to the association's list of national teams is the women's tackle football team. After years of flag football and semi-contact, women's tackle football was introduced in 2008. The women's team also hosted Sweden in a historical international game between two women's tackle football teams. Finland's experience became plainly obvious with a crushing victory with a score of 66–0.\nWith the growth of women's American football in many countries, IFAF has established Women’s World Championship of American Football and the first-ever tournament was hosted by Sweden in late June 2010. The USA took the inaugural championship, beating Canada in the final game 66–0. Finland earned its place as Europe's top country with a 26–18 victory over Germany in the bronze game.\nFinland will host the second IFAF Women's World Championship in the summer of 2013.\nFinland vs. Sweden.\nThroughout its time as an independent state, Finland has had big rivalries in all fields of sport against its neighboring country Sweden, and American Football makes no exception.\nThe men's senior team played an annual game against Sweden in 1992–1998. The tradition was revived in 2003 and it is nowadays a fixture in national team's yearly schedule.\nThe U-19 team also had its encounters with Sweden in the '90s but in recent years the juniors have faced only in international tournaments.\nThe two newest national teams, U-17's and women's, also had their first taste of the rivalry in 2008. Both series have been continuous from their inaugural year on.\nFinnish American Football Hall of Fame.\nTo honor people distinguished in Finnish American Football over the years, the SAJL founded the Finnish American Football Hall of Fame in 2004. Induction can be merited for the work done both on and off the field and to anyone with enough contributions to the sport in Finland."

        "title": "1998 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 1998 Major League Baseball season ended with the New York Yankees sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series, after they had won a then AL record 114 regular season games. The Yankees finished with 125 wins for the season (regular season and playoffs combined), which remains the MLB record.\nThe 1998 season was marked by MLB’s expansion to 30 teams (16 in the NL, 14 in the AL), with two new teams–the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the American League–added. To keep the leagues with even numbers of teams while allowing both leagues to have a new team, the Milwaukee Brewers were moved from the American League Central Division to the National League Central Division. The Detroit Tigers were shifted from the American League East to the American League Central, while the Devil Rays were added to the American League East. The Diamondbacks were added to the National League West, making the NL have more teams than the AL for the first time (this arrangement would last until the end of the 2012 season, when the Houston Astros moved from the National to the American League for 2013, giving each league 15 teams).\nThe biggest story of the season was the historic chase of the single-season home run record held at the time by Roger Maris. Initially, the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners started the season on a pace to both break Maris' record. In June, the chase was joined by the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who broke the decades-old record of Rudy York for most home runs in a calendar month with 20 that month. Eventually, Griffey fell off the record pace, but still ended with 56 homers. Both McGwire and Sosa broke the record in September, with McGwire ultimately finishing with 70 homers to Sosa's 66. McGwire's record would last only three years, with Barry Bonds hitting 73 in 2001. The 1998 season was also the first in MLB history with four players hitting 50 or more homers, with Greg Vaughn of the San Diego Padres hitting 50. In a postscript to the record chase, both McGwire and Sosa have since been widely accused of having used performance-enhancing drugs during that period, and McGwire would admit in 2010 that he had used steroids during the record-setting season.\nThe defending World Series champions Florida Marlins finished last in the NL East Division at 54–108, making it the first, and only, time that a team went from winning the World Series one year to finishing with 100 or more losses and last in their division the following year.\nNew commissioner.\nOn July 9, 1998, Major League Baseball Executive Council chairman Bud Selig officially became the 9th commissioner of baseball, though he had been the \"de facto\" commissioner for nearly 6 years. During that time, the owners had tried to find a replacement for previous commissioner Fay Vincent who was forced to step down by the owners towards the end of 1992 season mainly due to the lockout he intervened in during the 1990 season.\nPostseason.\nThis was the first season in which teams were seeded by their respective win–loss record within their respective leagues.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nMLB statistical leaders.\n1 American League Triple Crown pitching winner\nTelevision coverage.\nThis was the third season under the five-year rights agreements with ESPN, Fox, and NBC. ESPN continued to air \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and \"Wednesday Night Baseball\". Fox's coverage included \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" broadcasts, Thursday night games on Fox Sports Net, and Saturday primetime games on FX. NBC aired the All-Star Game. During the postseason, ESPN, Fox, and NBC split the four Division Series. NBC then televised the American League Championship Series while Fox aired both the National League Championship Series and the World Series."

        "text": "Daniel Nicholas Noonan (born July 14, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers. He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers.\nEarly years.\nNoonan was born six miles from the University of Nebraska campus. He attended Lincoln Northeast High School, where he played both defensive and offensive tackle. As a senior in 1982, he helped the team win a state title, while receiving All-American and All-state honors. He was selected to play in the state’s 1983 All-Star Shrine Bowl football game played at Nebraska Memorial Stadium.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Nebraska, to play under head coach Tom Osborne. He was a defensive tackle during his first two seasons. \nAs a junior, defensive coordinator Charlie McBride moved him to middle guard and he became a starter. He tallied 3 sacks against the University of Illinois. He made 9 tackles both against the University of Oklahoma and the University of Michigan.\nNoonan had a dominant season as a senior, registering 53 tackles and 12 sacks (led the team), on a team that ranked second in the nation in total defense, allowing 235.5 yards per game and only 2.4 yards per run. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Big 8 Athlete-of-the-Year, First-team All-American (AP, UPI, FWAA, Kodak, Walter Camp, Football News), All Star Japan Bowl and Big 8 Player-of-the-Week (Florida State).\nIn 1991, he was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was selected by the Omaha World-Herald as one of Nebraska's Top 100 greatest athletes.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nNoonan was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (12th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft, with the intention of being the eventual successor to All-Pro Randy White and to help revitalize an aging defensive line. After having the longest holdout by a rookie in franchise history at the time, he fell behind in learning the nuances of head coach Tom Landry's flex defense and was only a situational player. He began at defensive end, before being moved to defensive tackle in the second half of the season. White was limited with injuries, so Noonan helped in run situations, finishing with 27 tackles and one sack.\nBy his second season he was considered the Cowboys' strongest player, being able to bench press 505 pounds. Despite suffering hip, knee and heel injuries, his best year statistically was in 1988, when he replaced White as the starter at right tackle, recording 16 starts, 84 tackles, 7.5 sacks (tied for the team lead with Garry Cobb) and returned one interception for a touchdown. Against the Atlanta Falcons, he intercepted a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown and sacked quarterback Chris Miller for a safety. In the eighth game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had 9 tackles and 3 sacks.\nIn 1989, he missed 9 games with a groin injury he suffered in training camp, posting only 5 starts in 7 games, 23 tackles, 9 quarterback pressures, one sack and one pass defensed. \nIn 1990, he regained his starting role (15 starts), finishing fourth (first among defensive lineman) on the team in tackles (85), while also making 4.5 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures and 4 passes defensed.\nAfter starting the first 3 games at right tackle in 1991, with the addition of Tony Casillas, plus the emergence of Russell Maryland and Jimmie Jones, he was moved to a backup role and played sparingly the rest of the season, making 20 tackles (2 for loss), one quarterback pressure, one pass defensed and one sack.\nHe was released after starting the first 2 games of the 1992 season on September 14, to make room for Russell Maryland upon his return from a toe injury. He started 41 out of 67 possible games and recorded 15 sacks in his Cowboys career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nOn September 16, 1992, he was claimed off waivers by the Green Bay Packers, played 6 games as a backup in the team's 3-4 defense and recorded 4 tackles, before being waived on November 10.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn April 6, 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos. He retired on August 17, after missing almost half of the team's training camp with a knee injury.\nPersonal life.\nNoonan married his wife Julie in 2002 and have six children (Sydney, Sam, Maverick, Alec, Branson and Marisa) and one grandchild Levi ."

        "title": "The Wednesday Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Wednesday Cricket Club, founded in 1820, became one of the pre-eminent cricket clubs in the Sheffield area. It was the direct forerunner of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was reformed in 2011 and has risen from Section 7 in the Mansfield District League to Section 2 in 2017. Its midweek side play in Division A of the Sheffield Alliance Midweek League in 2018 having won Division B in 2017.\nHistory.\nSix local tradesmen – William Stratford, John Southren, Tom Lindley, William Woolhouse, George Dawson and George Hardisty - founded the Wednesday Cricket Club in 1820. Its name referred to their day off from work, the only day they could play. William Stratford was the first president, followed by Richard Gillott. The club played at several cricket grounds in the Sheffield area.\nSheffield had been the hub of cricket in the north of England during the first half of the nineteenth century, and Sheffield Cricket Club had played under the guise of a \"Yorkshire\" side for many years prior to the formation of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1863.\nSeveral prominent local cricketers appeared for the Wednesday club, such as Michael Ellison, William Slinn, Tom Hunt, George Pinder, Tom Armitage, George Ulyett, and Tom Marsden. Ellison went on to help form Yorkshire County Cricket Club whilst Armitage and Ulyett were selected for England's first Test cricket tour of Australia in 1877. Marsden was for many years the best single wicket cricketer in the north of England and was said to have put up a £50 reward for anyone to beat him. The great southern cricketer of the time, Fuller Pilch, did just that in 1833, beating Marsden in Norwich. When a rematch was organised, over 20,000 spectators crammed into the Old Darnall ground hoping to see Marsden defeated once more. Marsden also scored 227 in a game for Sheffield &amp; Leicester versus Nottingham, at that time only the third double century seen in England. In 1841, Marsden he finally lost his northern single wicket crown to Henry Sampson, another Wednesday player, who later that year scored 162 against Sheffield.\nIn 1867, the Wednesday cricket club formed a football club, primarily to keep players fit over the winter months. The Wednesday Football club rose to national prominence by the end of the 19th century, winning the 1896 FA Cup Final and becoming English Champions in 1903. The football club officially changed their name to Sheffield Wednesday F.C. in 1929. Several players managed to successfully appear for both the football and cricket sections of the club in the late 19th century including William Stacey and Lance Morley notably George Ulyett. Ulyett played cricket several times for England and also played football for Wednesday in 1882-83 and 1883-84 seasons as a goalkeeper.\nThe cricket club was disbanded in 1924 due to financial difficulties. \nIn 2011 a group of Sheffield Wednesday football supporters re-formed the club, entering the side into a local Sheffield league in time for the start of the 2011 season. Christopher Bolsover was the first captain of the re-formed club."

        "text": "The 1990 Giro d'Italia was the 73rd edition of the race. It started off in Bari on May 18 with a individual time trial. The race came to a close with a mass-start stage that began and ended in Milan on June 6. Twenty-two teams entered the race, which was won by the Italian Gianni Bugno of the Château d'Ax–Salotti team. Second and third respectively were the Frenchman Charly Mottet and the Italian rider, Marco Giovannetti. Bugno wore the pink jersey as leader in the general classification from the first to the last stage (before him, only Girardengo in 1919, Binda in 1927 and Merckx in 1973 achieved the same).\nIn addition to the general classification, Gianni Bugno also won the points classification. In the race's other classifications, Vladimir Poulnikov of the Alfa Lum–BFB Bruciatori team completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing in fourth place overall; rider Claudio Chiappucci won the mountains classification, and rider Phil Anderson won the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1990 edition of the Giro d'Italia, ten of which were based outside of Italy. The starting riders came from a total of 20 different countries; Italy (89), Spain (24), France (20), Switzerland (12), and the Netherlands (11) all had more than 10 riders. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Of these, 92 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 26.85 years, ranging from 21–year–old Florido Barale () to 39–year–old Pierino Gavazzi (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (24), while the oldest was (29).\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nReigning champion Laurent Fignon () returned to defend his title and was seen as a favorite to win despite a sub–par Classics season. Marco Giovannetti () who won the Vuelta a España a few weeks prior was seen as a contender. He was seen as one of the better Italian riders with a chance to win the overall, while it was noted that it would be difficult to win the Giro and Vuelta in the same season as only two riders – Eddy Merckx (1973) and Giovanni Battaglin (1981) – had accomplished that prior. Milan–San Remo winner Gianni Bugno () entered the race and writers considered him a contender, others wrote him off as Classics rider. \"La Repubblica\" mentioned that he could be the new Francesco Moser. 's Charly Mottet due to his recent victory in the Tour de Romandie also received consideration as a favorite. For the 1990 season, Mottet altered his normal schedule to include the Giro d'Italia and not ride the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré.\nOther riders that received attention as contenders were Steven Rooks, Urs Zimmermann, and Gert-Jan Theunisse. Rooks and Theunisse were expected to make their presence known in the final week of racing. Spanish rider Marino Lejaretta () was thought to be the best Spanish rider to make a run during the three weeks. Reigning world road race champion Greg LeMond () entered the race in poor form and without and high placings. IT was reported that LeMond had been recovering from a viral illness two months prior. Polish rider Zenon Jaskuła () was seen as a rider who had a chance to place high.\nTwenty–seven year old Adriano Baffi () was thought to be the premier sprinter in the race. The strongest team in the race was thought to be as they had won 26 races before the start of the Giro. Former winner Stephen Roche and Pedro Delgado chose not to participate in the Giro in favor of racing the Tour de France. Moreno Argentin and Maurizio Fondriest did not participate either. Mexican Raúl Alcalá () who recently won the Trump Tour chose to ride the Tour over the Giro.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1990 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 16 December 1989 in Milan. In order to avoid overlap with the World Cup held in Italy, the race was moved forward a week and two stages were removed. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were eleven stages containing categorized climbs, of which four had summit finishes: stage 3, to Mount Vesuvius; stage 7, to Vallombrosa; stage 16, to Passo Pordoi; and stage 17, to Aprica. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 19, which consisted of a climbing time trial to Sacro Monte di Varese. In total, there were 35 categorized climbs across 13 stages and made for of climbing, less than the previous year. The organizers chose to not include any rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was 336 km longer, contained the same amount of rest days, and one less individual time trial. In addition, this race contained the same number of half stages, one, as the year before. The event traveled into the neighboring Austria when the race reached the Dolomites, specifically into Klagenfurt.\nThe route was found to be balanced with five summit finishes and three time trials, while the difficult parts had adequate rest in between. There were thought to be chances for puncheurs and traditional sprinters.\nClassification Leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1990 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. It was crossed twice by the riders, for the first climbing of the mountain, Italian Maurizio Vandelli was the first over the climb, while Charly Mottet was first over the second passing. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing).\nThe intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

It started in Bacoli, on 20 May, with a prologue and concluded in Milan, on 13 June, with a mass-start stage. A total of 130 riders from thirteen teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Belgian Michel Pollentier of the Flandria team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Francesco Moser and Gianbattista Baronchelli, respectively. Freddy Maertens won 7 of the first 11 stages before abandoning due to a crash on Stage 8B.\nMaertens was one of five riders within 1:00 of the lead at the time of his abandonment. This followed his performance of winning 13 stages along with the General Classification at the Vuelta a month earlier.\nMoser took the Pink jersey from Maertens in the first week and held it until the high mountains of stage 17 which ended in Cortina d'Ampezzo where Pollentier took a :03 lead by beating Moser by :25. Over the next few stages he built this lead up to about 2:00 before the final time trial where he won the stage by :30 over 2nd place Moser and sealed the Giro victory.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Sanson's Moser won the points classification, Faustino Fernández Ovies of KAS won the mountains classification, and Sanson's Mario Beccia completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing ninth overall. Flandria finished as the winners of the team points classification.\nTeams.\nA total of 14 teams were invited to participate in the 1977 Giro d'Italia.

Out of the 140 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 121 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the 1976 winner, Felice Gimondi. Freddy Maertens, Gianbattista Baronchelli, and Gimondi were seen by many news outlets to be the favorites to win the race.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the race was revealed on 19 February 1977.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 1977 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Four of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Valparola Pass. The first rider to cross the Valparola Pass was Spanish rider Faustino Fernández Ovies. The fourth classification, the young rider classification, was decided the same way as the general classification, but exclusive to neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). The leader of the classification wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the Campionato delle Regioni classification. The leader wore a blue jersey with colored vertical stripes (\"maglia azzurra con banda tricolore verticale\"). The Fiat Ritmo classification, which was created in honor Juan Manuel Santisteban who died in stage 1A of 1976 edition. In all stages longer than , there was a banner at that point in the stage to designate a special sprint. The winner of the sprint in each stage received a Fiat 127 in this edition, as opposed to a Fiat 131 in its inaugural year."

Covering a total of , it included four time trials (three individual and one for teams), and fifteen stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. Seven of these fifteen stages had summit finishes: stage 4, to Todi; stage 6, to Campitello Matese; stage 9, to Montefiascone; stage 10, to Bibbiena; stage 15, to Orta San Giulio; stage 17, to Colli di San Fermo; and stage 19, to Selva di Val Gardena. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter and contained one more time trial. In addition, this race contained one more set of split stages.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1983 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Pordoi Pass. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spanish rider Marino Lejarreta. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

A total of 171 riders from nineteen teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Italian Roberto Visentini of the team. The second and third places were taken by Italian riders Giuseppe Saronni and Francesco Moser, respectively.\nSwiss rider Urs Freuler was the first rider to wear the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). The race lead was passed between five riders across the first five days of racing. Saronni gained the overall lead after the conclusion of the sixth stage and maintained an advantage through the fifteenth day of racing. As the race crossed several Alpine passes in the sixteenth stage, Visentini gained the race lead due to his strong performance on the stage. Visentini then defended the race lead until the race's conclusion on 2 June.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Guido Bontempi of won the points classification, Pedro Muñoz of Fagor won the mountains classification, and Gis Gelati-Oece's Marco Giovannetti completed the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing eighth overall.

From the riders that began this edition, 143 made it to the finish in Merano.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did not include the 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. An \"El Mundo Deportivo\" writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be the favorites to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the best chances to win the race, out of all the Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's results would depend on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1986 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 8 February 1986. It contained four time trials, three of which were individual and one of which was a team event. There were twelve stages containing categorized climbs, of which three had summit finishes: stage 14, to Sauze d'Oulx; stage 16, to Foppolo; and stage 19, to Peio. The organizers chose to include no rest days. Torriani did not want to interfere with the World Cup being held in Mexico. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained two less rest days, and the same number of time trials. In addition, this race contained the same number of stages, but one less set of half stages.\n\"l'Unita\" writer Gino Sala believed the route to be more challenging than the routes within the past few years. He criticized the route for the stage three team time trial for going over dangerous roads. Author Bill McGann believed Torriani designed the route to be relatively flat in order to increase the likelihood of Italian riders Giuseppe Saronni and Francesco Moser winning the race. Five-time champion Eddy Merckx believed the route to be \"decapitated.\"\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a prologue that navigated through the streets of Palermo, which was won by Urs Freuler by one second over the second-placed finisher. Later that day, the first mass-start stage was raced. The leg was marred by a large crash about from the finish which saw Emilio Ravasio sustain heavy injuries and continue to race until the end of the leg. Shortly after the stage, he fell into a coma, only to die two weeks later. Sergio Santimaria won the stage through a field sprint, and, with the time bonus, he earned race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). Stage 2 also culminated with a bunch sprint where Skala-Skil's Jean-Paul van Poppel took the lead with left and held on to win, as well as take the overall lead. The third stage was a team time trial that traveled around Sicily. Del Tongo-Colnago won the time trial by nine seconds over Supermercati Brianzoli-Essebi, which put their rider Giuseppe Saronni into the pink jersey. Gianbattista Baronchelli rode away on a climb late into the fourth stage and rode by himself to victory, earning the race lead in the process. American Greg LeMond won the fifth stage after attacking a few kilometers from the finish. Saronni led the peloton across the finish line two seconds after LeMond crossed the finish line.\nIn the race's sixth stage, Roberto Visentini won the leg after attacking a few kilometers from the finish. Saronni regained the race lead after finishing second on the stage and earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio da Silva won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.\nThe twelfth stage of the race was a individual time trial that stretched from Sinalunga to Siena. Lech Piasecki of Del Tongo-Colnago won the stage and was one of five riders to complete the course in under an hour. Due to his strong time on the stage, Saronni increased his advantage over all of his rivals except for Visentini who finished quicker. The next day of racing saw several breakaway groups try to form, but all with no success as the main field finished the stage together with a field sprint that was won by van Poppel. The race's fourteenth stage saw the race head back into the mountains, with a summit finish to Sauze d'Oulx. As the peloton made its way up the final climb, Pedro Muñoz, Martin Earley, and Stefano Giuliani formed a breakaway group out in front. With about three kilometers left in the stage, Earley attacked and went on to win the stage after riding by himself for the remainder of the stage. Dag Erik Pedersen won the next stage through a bunch sprint.\nThe sixteenth stage saw the race travel across several mountain passes in the Alps, with Muñoz winning the stage after attacking on the day's final climb of the day. Visentini, who finished third on the stage, gained enough time on Saronni to take the overall lead from him by over a minute. Bontempi won his fourth stage of the race after out-sprinting the rest of the peloton for the victory the day after. The next leg of the race was another individual time trial that was in length and very flat. Francesco Moser won the stage by forty-nine seconds over the second placed rider and his time, when coupled with the performance of the other riders, moved him into third overall. rider Johan van der Velde won the next leg of the race after attacking on a descent before the stage's final climb to Peio.\nThe twentieth stage of the race came down to a field sprint that was won by Bontempi. The penultimate stage of the race traversed several mountain passes in the Dolomites. Four riders escaped off the front of the peloton, meanwhile the general classification contenders remained together behind the leading group. As the leading group neared the finish, da Silva attacked and went on to win the stage by seven seconds. The general classification contenders finished together, despite attacks from LeMond. The race's final stage began and ended in Merano and . Belgian Eric Van Lancker won the leg by means of a bunch sprint.\nThree riders achieved multiple stage victories: Bontempi (stages 7, 10, 11, 17, and 20), da Silva (stages 9 and 21), and van Poppel (stages 2 and 13).

Kas were forced to decline their invitation, in favor of racing the Vuelta a España, by the Spanish Federation which wanted the \"best Hispanic\" peloton to be competing in Vuelta that year. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 130 cyclists. From the riders that began this edition, 111 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the 1978 winner, Johan De Muynck. Successful French rider Bernard Hinault did not enter the race.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was unveiled on 22 March 1979. Covering a total of , it included five individual time trials, and nine stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter and contained one more time trial. In addition, this race contained one less stage.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 1979 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Four of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi, which was first crossed by Italian rider Leonardo Natale. The fourth classification, the young rider classification, was decided the same way as the general classification, but exclusive to neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). The leader of the classification wore a white jersey. In addition, the rider had to be aged 24 and younger.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the Campionato delle Regioni classification. The leader wore a blue jersey with colored vertical stripes (\"maglia azzurra con banda tricolore verticale\"). The Fiat Ritmo classification, which was created in honor Juan Manuel Santisteban who died in stage 1A of 1976 edition.

In a letter to Harold Austin, the Manly rugby club secretary, Tom Richards said that rugby was \"a splendid break in the irksome routine of military life, which dulls one's wits and brings on a state of general carelessness\".\nThe eight \"old\" Rugby clubs in Turkey are the Istanbul Ottomans, Metu Rugby, Kadikoy, Girne Pumas, Saint Benoit, Saint Joseph Istanbul, Saint Joseph Izmir, IRC and Koc School. For many years, apart from playing the odd game against a Greek team, or from Northern Cyprus there was little outside contact.\nThe game is undergoing development by the efforts on senior level of the clubs such as Rugby Union, Metu Rugby previous champion, Istanbul Ottomans, Kadikoy rugby and samsun rugby. Those teams are working hard to encourage the sport to be known, loved, and played nationwide. With the progress and the determination of the clubs, a Turkish national rugby union team is expected to emerge in the near future. A new Rugby Club has also recently been established in the Aegean resort town of Kusadasi and are called the Kusadasi Eagles. The Eagles host a tournament each year in Kusadasi open to Turkish and overseas clubs.\nNiall Doherty (Ireland) in the Technical Director and Head Coach for Turkey.\nThe Pumas were founded in October 2003 and have developed into one of the most respected teams competing in the Turkish league with matches being played against the Istanbul Ottomans, Metu Rugby, Samsun, Kadikoy, Bakirkoy. They have regular test matches with teams from the UN and recently played host to Worcester Rugby Club who enjoyed their tour of Northern Cyprus."

It was built as a Works Progress Administration project in 1936, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe stadium is home to the Eau Claire Express of the Northwoods League, the Eau Claire Cavaliers amateur team, the Eau Claire Bears amateur team, the Eau Claire Pizza Hut American Legion team, the Eau Claire Memorial, North, Regis and Immanuel Lutheran high school baseball teams, and the UW-Eau Claire club baseball team.\nThe left field wall is adjacent to the sideline of the Carson Park football stadium field. During the football season, temporary bleachers from the baseball stadium are positioned on left field with the front of the bleachers placed along the left field wall facing the football field.\nHistory.\nThe land that became home to Carson Park, located on a peninsula surrounded by Half Moon Lake in Eau Claire, was donated in 1914 to the city of Eau Claire by an heir to William Carson. The following year, the park was opened. Construction of a sports complex, including a baseball stadium, football stadium and tennis courts, began in 1935 as a Works Progress Administration project. The first game was played in the stadium on May 4, 1937, in a Northern League game between the Eau Claire Bears and Superior Blues.\nThe stadium later was home to the Eau Claire Braves minor league baseball team. Among those who played for the Braves were Henry Aaron, Joe Torre, Bob Uecker, Andy Pafko and others who later played in Major League Baseball. Following the departure of the Braves in the 1960s, the Eau Claire Cavaliers amateur team began play in 1971. Under manager Harv Tomter, the team won 5 amateur baseball national championships.\nA statue honoring Henry Aaron was erected in front of the stadium in 1994. A renovation project around 1997/98 added permanent seats behind home play, benches in the lower areas of the grandstand, and a remodeled concourse and exterior.\nUpon the arrival of the Eau Claire Express Northwoods League franchise in 2005, the stadium underwent renovations for that season. A fan deck was added in the right field corner, a children's area was added along the 3rd-base foul line near the left field corner, and an electronic message board was added to the scoreboard. The field was re-leveled and re-sodded prior to the 2007 season. The press box was expanded with new sections along the first- and third-base sides for the 2009 season."

The game was held on July 13, 1993, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland, the home of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 9-3.\nThis is also the last Major League Baseball All-Star Game to date to be televised by CBS and to be held in Baltimore. During the pregame broadcast coverage, CBS announced the death of NASCAR driver Davey Allison from a helicopter accident the previous day.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nNational League.\nThe trainers for the National League were Dave Labossiere of the Houston Astros, and Gene Gieselmann of the St.Louis Cardinals\nAmerican League.\nThe trainers for the American League were Richie Bancells of the Baltimore Orioles, and Barry Weinberg of the Oakland Athletics.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nSee also: \"1993 All-Star Game Play by Play\".\nThe pregame colors presentation was from the color guard of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Geddy Lee, lead singer of the band Rush later sang the Canadian National Anthem, while actor James Earl Jones recites the U.S. National Anthem, accompanied by the Morgan State University choir. At the conclusion of the National Anthem, fireworks exploded over Fort McHenry while airplanes from Andrews Air Force Base flew over Camden Yards.\nTo commemorate the 35th anniversary of the 1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which had been played at Memorial Stadium, Hall-of-Famer and Baltimore native Al Kaline joined the ceremonial first pitch ceremonies. Also joining the ceremonies was Orioles Hall-of-Famer Brooks Robinson.\nThe visiting National League scored in the first inning off starting pitcher Mark Langston when Barry Bonds doubled with one out and Gary Sheffield followed with a home run for a 2-0 lead. The American League got a run back in the second when Kirby Puckett homered with one out off the NL starter, Terry Mulholland. Roberto Alomar tied the game at two in the third inning, leading off with a home run, off Andy Benes.\nThe AL went ahead to stay with three runs in the fifth. John Burkett came in to start the inning, and first batter Ivan Rodriguez doubled and scored on a single by Albert Belle, who went to second when Justice made an error on the play. Ken Griffey Jr., singled home Belle and went to second on the throw home. After Cecil Fielder was hit by a pitch, Kirby Puckett doubled home Griffey for the third run of the inning and a 5-2 AL lead. Steve Avery relieved to get the last out of the inning. The NL got a run back in the top of the sixth. Jimmy Key started the inning and gave up a double to Bonds, followed by a single to Sheffield and a sacrifice fly to Barry Larkin, making the score 5-3.\nThe AL broke the game open in the bottom of the sixth with three more runs. With two outs, Carlos Baerga reached on an error by shortstop Jeff Blauser, then Albert Belle walked. Devon White doubled home Baerga and after John Smoltz relieved Avery, Belle scored and White went to third on a wild pitch. Juan Gonzalez walked, then Smoltz threw his second wild pitch of the inning, allowing White to score the third run of the inning, giving the AL an 8-3 lead. Smoltz tied an All-Star game record with two wild pitches, but he was the first to throw them in the same inning.\nThe AL got the last run of the game in the seventh inning when Greg Vaughn led off with a single and scored on a two-out double by Terry Steinbach, both hits off Rod Beck, making the final score 9-3. The last out however ended strangely, when American League (Blue Jays) manager Cito Gaston allowed Blue Jays closer Duane Ward to close out the game in the ninth at Camden Yards, rather than hometown hero Mike Mussina. Fans cheered as the Orioles' Mike Mussina warmed up in the bullpen and chanted \"We Want Mike!\", but after the last out of the game, the fans booed Gaston for not putting in Mussina to close out the game. Fans began throwing various waste onto the field until an appeal from Mussina himself stopped the crowd. Mussina said that he warmed up so he would not mess up his regular pitching schedule, as he was going to pitch the next day. Despite this, many people believe that he started warming up so that the fans would get riled up, meaning that Gaston would most likely put him in. As it was, Mussina did not play in the All-Star Game, and Ward did not get the save."

        "title": "Youth Olympic Games",
        "text": "The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an international multi-sport event for athletes between 15 and 18 years old, organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format, though in reverse order with the Olympic Winter Games held in leap years instead of the Summer Olympic Games. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012.\nThe idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved the creation of a youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the travelling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes.\nSeveral other Olympic events for youth, like the European Youth Olympic Festival held every other year with summer and winter versions, and the Australian Youth Olympic Festival, have proven successful. The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events. The YOG is also a successor to the discontinued World Youth Games.\nThe Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days, whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and Lillehammer in 2016 had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days. Even though this exceeded initial estimates, the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents. The most recent Summer YOG was the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires. The most recent Winter YOG was the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne. The next Summer YOG to take place will be the 2026 Summer Youth Olympics of Dakar, Senegal while the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics is now taken place in Gangwon, South Korea.\nHistory.\nThe concept of the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian industrial manager Johann Rosenzopf in 1998. This was in response to growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities, especially amongst youth in developed nations. It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games. Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people, the IOC's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative. IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much about cultural education and exchange as it was about sports, which is why the Culture and Education Program (CEP) was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games. Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007. There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values. The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008. On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck, host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012.\nRequirements of host cities.\nThe scale of the Youth Olympic Games is smaller than that of the Olympics, which is intentional and allows for smaller cities to host an Olympic event. Potential host cities are required to keep all events within the same city and no new sports venues should be built. Exceptions to this building moratorium include a media centre, amphitheatre facilities for classes and workshops, and a village for coaches and athletes. This village is to be the heart of the Games for the athletes, and the hub of activity. No new or unique transportation systems are required as all athletes and coaches will be transported by local shuttles. According to bid procedures, the athletics venue must hold 10,000 people, and a bidding city must have a 2,500-seat aquatics facility for the Summer editions.\nFinancing.\nThe original estimated costs for running the Games were US$30 million for the Summer and $15 million to $20 million for Winter Games (these costs did not include infrastructure improvements for venue construction). The IOC has stipulated that costs for infrastructure and venues is to be paid by the host city. The IOC will pay travel costs to the host city and room and board for the athletes and judges, estimated at $11 million. The funding will come from IOC funds and not revenues. The budgets for the final two bids for the inaugural Summer Games as submitted by the IOC came in at $90 million, much higher than the estimated costs. The cost of the first games in Singapore escalated to an estimated S$387 million ($284 million). Sponsors have been slow to sign on for the YOG, due to the fact that it is a new initiative and corporations are not sure what level of exposure they will get. The budget for the inaugural Winter Games to be held in Innsbruck has been estimated at $22.5 million, which does not include infrastructure improvements and venue construction.\nParticipation.\nOver 200 countries and 3,600 athletes participated in the inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics. Participants are placed in the following age groups: 15–16 years, 16–17 years, and 17–18 years. The athlete's age is determined by how old they are by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG. Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations (ISF) for the various sports on the program. To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places. A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks. This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval. There is a cap of two teams (one boys' and one girls') per nation. Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports.\nSports.\nSummer Youth Olympics.\nAll sports on the core program of the Summer Olympics, as well as most of the optional sports added in the 2020 and 2024 Summer Olympics, have been represented in the program of the Summer Youth Olympics. Most team sports use versions with reduced team sizes, including replacing regular basketball with 3x3 basketball, football with futsal, handball with beach handball, field hockey with hockey5s, indoor volleyball with beach volleyball, and, in 2026, baseball with baseball5. The 2026 edition will mark the first time the summer youth program has an equal number of events for boys and girls.\nUnlike the traditional Games, it is up to the Organizing Committee to choose which disciplines will be chosen to be played in collective sports. Twenty-seven sports were introduced in the 2010 Games. The Organizing Committee for the 2014 Games, chose beach volleyball (replacing their indoor counterpart) and field hockey as optional sport. In the 2018 Games, six sports were introduced: beach handball (replacing their indoor counterpart), breakdancing, futsal (replacing their association counterpart), karate, roller speed skating and sport climbing. The 28 Olympic core sports are expected to feature in the 2026 Games, being confirmed in 2020.\nThe following sports (or disciplines of a sport) make up the current and discontinued Summer Youth Olympic Games official program and are listed alphabetically according to the name used by the IOC. The discontinued sports were previously part of the Summer Youth Olympic Games program as official sports, but are no longer on the current program. The figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport contested at the respective Games; a bullet () denotes that the sport was contested as a demonstration sport.\nDemonstration summer sports.\nSix sports have been demonstrated at the Summer Youth Olympics. Skateboarding, Sports Climbing, Inline Speed Skating, and Wushu were demonstrated at the 2014 games and included in subsequent editions. Three sports were demonstrated at the 2018 games and have not yet been included in subsequent editions:\nWinter Youth Olympics.\nAll sports on the core program of the Winter Olympics have been a part of every Winter Youth Olympics. In 2020, ski mountaineering was added as an optional sport (it was later added to the program of the 2026 Winter Olympics). The 2024 Winter Youth Olympics marked the first time at any Olympic Games that the program included an equal number of events for male and female athletes. No sports have been demonstrated at the Winter Youth Olympics. There have been 46 disciplines across 16 sports in the Winter Youth Olympics between the 2012 Games to the 2020 Games.\nThe following sports (or disciplines of a sport) make up the current and discontinued Winter Youth Olympic Games official program and are listed alphabetically according to the name used by the IOC. The discontinued sports were previously part of the Winter Youth Olympic Games program as official sports, but are no longer on the current program.\nCulture and education.\nEducation and culture are also key components for the Youth edition. Not only does the education/culture aspect apply to athletes and participants, but also youth around the world and inhabitants of the host city and surrounding regions. To this end, a Culture and Education Program (CEP) will be featured at each Games. The first CEP at the 2010 Singapore Games featured events that fostered cooperation amongst athletes of different nations. It had classes on topics ranging from health and fitness to the environment and career planning. Local students from Singapore made booths at the World Culture Village that represented each of the 205 participating National Olympic Committee. The Chat with Champions sessions were the most popular portion of the program. Participants were invited to hear inspirational talks given by former and current Olympic athletes.\nAlso part of the CEP is the Young Ambassadors Programme, Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models. Under the Young Ambassadors Programme, a group of youths aged 18 to 25 years old are nominated by the NOCs to help promote the YOG in their regions and communities, and encourage the athletes to participate in the CEP programmes.\nThe Young Reporters Programme provides journalism students or those who have recently started their journalism careers a cross-platform journalist-training programme and on-the-job experience during the YOG. Young Reporters, between the ages of 18 and 24, are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents.\nActing as mentors to help support and advise young Olympians are the Athlete Role Models, who are typically active or recently retired Olympians nominated by the IFs, such as Japanese wrestler Kaori Icho, Italian Simone Farina and Namibian Frank Fredericks.\nEmphasis on exchange goes beyond the CEP. Another unique feature of the Youth Olympic Games is mixed-gender and mixed-national teams. Triathlon relays, fencing, table tennis, archery and mixed swimming relays are a few of the sports in which athletes from different nations and mixed genders can compete together. YOG organizers are also using social media such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter as key platforms for engaging young athletes before, during, and after each celebration of the Games. Multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and multi-age requirements are the targets of the program, which stress the themes of \"Learning to know, learning to be, learning to do, and learning to live together\".\nList of Youth Olympic Games.\nIn early November 2007, Athens, Bangkok, Singapore, Moscow, and Turin were selected by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. In January 2008, the candidates were further pared down to just Moscow and Singapore. Finally, on 21 February 2008, Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne, Switzerland, winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow.\nOn 2 September 2008 IOC announced that the executive board had shortlisted four cities among the candidates to host the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012. The four candidate cities were Harbin, Innsbruck, Kuopio, and Lillehammer. IOC president Jacques Rogge appointed Pernilla Wiberg to chair the commission which analysed the projects. As with the Summer Games, the list was then shortened to two finalists, Innsbruck and Kuopio, in November 2008. On 12 December 2008, it was announced that Innsbruck beat Kuopio to host the games. Nanjing, China was selected by the IOC over Poznan, Poland to be the host-city of the 2014 Youth Olympics. The election was held on 10 February 2010, two days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Lillehammer, Norway hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics."

        "title": "Ice Hockey Australia",
        "text": "The Australian Ice Hockey Federation, currently trading as Ice Hockey Australia (IHA), is the official national governing body of ice hockey in Australia and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nIt was first established in 1908, making it one of the oldest national ice hockey associations in the world.\nThe purpose of Ice Hockey Australia is to encourage, promote, control and administer all forms of ice hockey in and throughout Australia through and by various Member States for the mutual and collective benefit of the members and sport itself.\nIHA also governs an eight-team, semi-professional league, known as the Australian Ice Hockey League.\nHistory.\nThe beginnings of Australian ice sports.\nThe beginnings of ice sports in Australia are traced back to the evening of Wednesday 12 October 1904 during a carnival held at the Adelaide Glaciarium, the first ice rink built in Australia. This important location for Australian ice sports began as a Cyclorama, which opened on Friday 28 November 1890 at 89 Hindley Street, Adelaide. On the evening of Tuesday 6 September 1904, the building was reopened after being remodeled by a new group called the Ice Palace Skating Company, owned by H. Newman Reid and referred to as the Glaciarium or Ice Palace Skating Rink. On the evening of Wednesday 12 October 1904 a match for what was called \"hockey on the ice\" was held during the carnival at the Adelaide Glaciarium. This game was not ice hockey, it was an adaption of roller polo to the ice using ice skates instead of roller skates. At the time this version of roller polo adapted to the ice was being played in Adelaide, ice hockey was already a well established sport and had been codified for almost 30 years. Though what was played in Adelaide was being called \"hockey on the ice\", it was not ice hockey.\nThe beginnings of ice hockey.\nThe birthplace of ice hockey in Australia was in the Melbourne Glaciarium in Melbourne and was the first time and place that ice hockey had been played in the country. An exhibition of ice hockey was held at the end of the opening night of the Melbourne Glaciarium on the afternoon of 9 June 1906, at 16 City Road, South Melbourne Victoria.\nThe first recorded game of ice hockey in Australia was on Tuesday 17 July 1906 and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American warship the . The game was a deviation from the ice hockey already being played in Canada so this first game is regarded as a first step in the evolution of the Australian game into the already established game of ice hockey. The teams had been practicing for 4 weeks leading up to the game. The game was a variation of the Canadian game being played at the time, it was played in two 15 minutes halves, using a red ball the size of a tennis ball and made from gutta-percha and curved heavy-headed sticks as used in English field hockey at the time. The teams consisted of 6 men per side with the following positions: Goal-Keeper, Half Back, Center, Left Rush and Right Rush. It is better said that this game was the first step of the Australian game evolving into contemporary ice hockey as it still differed from the already popular Canadian game at the time.\nAt the time, the Canadian game of ice hockey was being played with a puck, and included a 7th position called a Rover and was played onside – which meant that forward passing was not allowed. The McGill Rules were first published on 27 February 1877 in the Montreal newspaper, \"The Gazette\". It was essentially the same set of rules to the already established game of field hockey and even continued to use the word within the set of rules for ice hockey. One of the defining characteristics of the game of ice hockey at the time of the first Australian game was that it used a puck instead of a ball, this distinguished it from similar stick and ball games at the time such as bandy.\nThe American team was made up of:\nThe Australian team was made up of:\nProfessor James Brewer was the umpire.\nThe Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS Baltimore wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers with red socks.\nThis game was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium and at 9:00pm a whistle blew to clear the public skaters from the ice surface so that the surface could be cleaned with scoops and brooms to remove the snowy covering generated by the public skating session before.\nThe skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans as the American team had played as a team before against another American ship on a frozen river near Shanghai and defeated them. The Australians had never played as a team before but had the advantage of having been on the ice more recently than the American team. The game was hard-fought and result of the game was a 1–1 tie. The USS \"Baltimore\" team were first to score when Mr. T. H. Miller scored goal but Mr. Dunbar Poole scored off a hard shot to tie up the game.\nIn its second ice skating season, the Sydney Glaciarium management drew plans to facilitate ice hockey matches between an Australian team selected from ice skating patrons and teams drawn from the crew of various visiting fleet of American warships, known by the name Great White Fleet. Sydney was the first stop made by the fleet to Australia and invitations to the proposed hockey match were sent to the officers and petty officers of each warship, planning to host the match on the evening of their arrival on 20 August 1908. The first match that was arranged ended up being scheduled for the evening of 26 August 1907 at the Sydney Glaciarium. Though the American team had not been on skates for 3 years, they still managed to win the game 5 – 1 against the Australian team formed from Sydney Glaciarium patrons. The Australian team was first to score but the Americans would tie up the game in the first half. In the second half, the Americans would go on to score 4 more goals. An important aspect to this game was that the American players were using much larger hockey sticks than the local Australian team.\nOn 1 September 1908 the fleet would also visit Melbourne afterwards where they would play ice hockey against a local team, presumably again, using the larger ice hockey sticks and a puck made from a disc of wood. Due to the absence of 2 of the American players, each team played with only 5 men per side in the first game instead of the 7 normally played but this would play an important part to establishing the codified version of ice hockey in Australia rather than the Australian variant played before. The Victorian team won the first game 9 – 2 at the Melbourne Glaciarium.\nIn the second game played 2 days later on 3 September 1908, each team had 7 men per side available and played with a rubber puck. The Victorians benefited greatly by the visit from the Canadian lacrosse team that had visited months before as they became more skilled at \"nursing\" or cradling the puck. The game was refereed by Walter Purbrick and the Victorians defeated the Americans 6 – 4.\nThe first association.\nThe first Australian ice hockey association was formed in Melbourne, Victoria on 12 September 1908 after the close of the season in the Melbourne Glaciarium. The name of the association was the Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey Association (VAIHA). The association consisted of 4 ice hockey clubs:\nThe first state championship series in Australia was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium between 14 September 1909 – 27 September 1909. The grand final was held on the evening of 27 September 1909 and was between the Glaciarium and Melburnians. The Glaciarium won the championship final by a score of 3-0 and were awarded gold medals.\nInterstate ice hockey.\nIce Hockey matches between Victoria and New South Wales would begin almost immediately after the 25 July 1907 opening of the Sydney Glaciarium, with a match scheduled for 5 August 1907 that pre-dated the formation of State Associations.\nThe first inter-state ice hockey championship was held between a state representative team from Victoria and from New South Wales between 31 August-4 September 1909. This tournament was a best-of-3 format and saw Victoria win the series 2 games to 1. New South Wales was represented by a newly formed team in 1909 and traveled to Melbourne on 29 August 1909 which marked the first national interstate competition for senior men's hockey in Australia.\nThe Victoria state team won the inaugural tournament to become the first winners of the interstate competition, with Robert Jackson as the captain who scored 3 goals in the second half of the final game.\nThe first game of the series had a final score of 2-1 with New South Wales defeating Victoria. Friday 3 September 1909 the Victorian team defeated the New South Wales team 1-0, giving Victorian goaltender Charles Watt the first recorded shutout in Australian interstate ice hockey competition history. In the third game of the series both teams had won a game each. Victoria defeated New South Wales 6-1 and became the first team to win the interstate competition in Australia.\n18 September 1911 was the third game of the 1911 interstate ice hockey competition series. Jim Kendall was on crutches due to splitting his shinbone from a blow to the leg with a hockey stick in the previous game and was unable to play but New South Wales had already clinched the series after winning the first 2 games. Dunbar Poole was unable to stay and had also left, leaving the New South Wales team short 2 players. A decision was made to complete the final game of the series with a composite team of Dark Blue and Light Blue teams made up of the Victoria and New South Wales teams and emergency back up players for the Victorian team. The first half of the game saw 2 goals by Leslie Reid and one by Keith Walker place the Light Blue team in front by a score of 3–1, C. Smith scoring the goal for the Dark blue team. The second half of the game saw a comeback by the dark blue side with 3 goals by Jack Pike and a goal to Reid and Smith. The final score was 6–3 in favor of the Dark Blue team. The newly appointed second president of the VAIHA, Philip John Rupert Steele Sr, presented a cup gifted by John Edwin Goodall to the injured New South Wales captain Jim Kendall on the evening after the final game of this series.\nThe Great War.\nThe first ice sports to be held at the Sydney Glaciarium for the 1914 season were scheduled for 4 August 1914 which involved skating for men and women as well as a women's hockey game. The Goodall Cup interstate series was scheduled to be played in the Sydney Glaciarium in the last 2 weeks of August 2014.\nEfforts were made to continue the ice hockey season in 1915 and there was the promise of ice hockey games being scheduled. The Melbourne Glaciarium remained open and ladies skating events were held during this time.\n31 July 1918 a hockey game between a blue team and white team was held at the Melbourne Glaciarium in which Ferrera's Blue team scored in the second half of the game to defeat the White team.\n1923 saw a big step forward on the national level. While the Victorian team was visiting Sydney for the Goodall Cup series, a central body was formed to control the game on an Australia wide basis. Players were now receiving equipment from Canada and some were beginning to wear production and homemade protective padding and gloves. The twenties drew to a close with New South Wales still dominating the interstate scene. The tragic economic depression was sweeping the world and entertainment was something people listed very low on their budgets.\nThe early 1930s were remarkable for the development in the strength and character of Australian Ice Hockey. Inter state growth was on the rise and new faces joined the sport, whose names are still known to this day. With the outbreak of war in the later part of the decade, as was the case in the First World War, hockey players were quick to join up and several were decorated for their devoted and heroic service to their country.\n1922: The first national women's tournament.\nThe first inter-state women's ice hockey championship tournament was held in the first week in August 1922 between New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales won the first game of the series 3-0.\nScheduled between 20–23 October 1988 was the inaugural Australian Women's Championship\n1923–1931 AIHA: The first national ice hockey association.\nIn 1923 the first national federation for ice hockey in Australia formed and was named the Australian Ice Hockey Association. John Edwin Goodall became the first elected president and A. De Long became the first elected Secretary/ Treasurer. The Goodall Cup would remain as the trophy awarded to the inter state championship for men and the Gower Cup would continue to be awarded to the inter state championship for women until at least 1928.\nIn 1930 a proposal for the formation of the Australian Ice Hockey Council was proposed and constituted afterwards in a meeting in Melbourne. A meeting was scheduled for the 1931 Interstate Series in Sydney, when the Victorian team would visit.\n1926: The first junior ice hockey competition.\nDuring the annual meeting of the Ice Hockey Association on the evening of 17 May 1926 at the Melbourne Glaciarium, the plans for a junior ice hockey competition were made. The officers elected during this meeting were Mr. Sutherland (President), Mr. G. Bannerman, (Secretary), Mr. A. de Long (Treasurer).\n1938: AAIAA the breakaway association.\nOn the evening of 20 September 1938 a private meeting was held at the Sydney Ice Palais between players, speed skaters and other interested people regarding the attitude the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association had adopted with regard to allegations of illegal and rough play during recent ice hockey games. The meeting was held to discuss the refusal by the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association (NSWIHA) to give guarantees that their referees would be instructed to enforce the ice hockey rules set out by the NSWIHA and eliminate the widely criticised illegal play made by the media, players and general public. The meeting was also there to discuss the NSWIHA decision to cancel all of its games at the Sydney Ice Palais. A notion was passed which strongly condemned the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association for not providing the guarantee that they would instruct their referees to enforce the rules during the games and a unanimous decision was made that the 40 attendees that represented NSWIHA would submit their resignation from the NSWIHA immediately. In addition to this, all attendees of this meeting would unite to form a breakaway national association called the Australian Amateur Ice Athletics Association (AAIAA) to control all ice sports including ice hockey and promote ice sports in Australia. New South Wales Ice Hockey Association was still affiliated with the Australian Ice Hockey Council (AIHC).\nThe presence of the breakaway association addressed the need to recognise the Sydney Ice Palais as it was not recognised by the Australian Ice Hockey Council nor were undefeated Canadian Bears ice hockey club that were scheduled to play against a team representing Australia. It also created conflict. The games were for 15, 19, 21 October 1938 against the undefeated Canadian Bears team that played there. In a meeting on the evening of 30 September 1938 the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association, still affiliated with the Australian Ice Hockey Council threatened to ban any players that partook in the game against the Bears. Four Victorian players (Ellis Kelly, C. Mitchell, H. Lloyd and Johnny White) were selected to join the Australian team to play against the Canadian Bears and were determined to play in the games but for that to happen The Victorian Ice Hockey Association needed to break away from the Australian Ice Hockey Council and join the Australian Amateur Ice Athletics Association for them to be eligible. If the Victorian Ice Hockey Association remained with the Australian Ice Hockey Council and the 4 players participated in the games against the Canadian Bears the 4 players would be banned from playing under the Australian Ice Hockey Council.\nMiddle years.\nWhen ice hockey was ready to be resumed after World War II, the position regarding players was the best it had ever been. A ready made pool of youngsters was waiting to join the returning servicemen in what were to become the boom years of the game. In 1947, Victoria won the Goodall Cup after 25 years of being in the wilderness.\nThe next year 1951, the association became the strongest it has ever been. The association took steps to have only four teams in each rink brought about ability to concentrate the quality of the teams, and have a better quality of game.\nIn 1980 it was decided by the Australian Ice Hockey Federation that, for the first time, it would be mandatory for players under the age of 18 to wear full face masks beginning in the 1981 season. This was in the interest of greater player safety and would bring Australia in line with international regulations. The decision was based on evidence of a marked decline in facial and dental injuries to players aged under 16 years old who had this mandatory face mask regulation introduced the year before.\nThe first Australian Junior team was scheduled to represent Australia in the 1983 world junior championships. In 1981 the Australian Ice Hockey Federation established a national junior training camp, with the first training sessions to be held between 29 May 1981 to 31 May 1981 at Narrabeen Fitness Camp. It was planned that 65 junior ice hockey players from around Australia would attend the camp, hoping to be selected to represent Australia in junior hockey for the first time.\nNational teams.\nEach year Ice Hockey Australia participates in a number of international championships that are held by the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nAffiliated organizations.\nIce Hockey Australia has many state branches across the country:\nIn addition to the above, there are three organisations affiliated to IHA, with responsibility for the control of ice hockey within their own organisations but remaining under the rules and regulations of IHA. The affiliated bodies are:\nNational Championship Awards and Trophy's.\nGoodall Cup.\nThe Goodall Cup is a perpetual trophy that is annually awarded to the playoff champions of the Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). The trophy is named after Australian born player John Edwin Goodall who donated a cup to the Interstate competition originally held annually between state representative teams for Victoria and New South Wales. The Interstate competition began in 1909 and John Edwin Goodall gifted a cup to the interstate series in 1911.\nJoan McKowen Memorial Trophy.\nThe Joan McKowen Memorial Trophy is awarded to the winners of the playoffs for the national senior women's competition, the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League. The trophy is named in memory of Joan Moreen McKowen and was established in 1994.\nNathan Walker Trophy.\nFormerly referred to as The AJIHL Champions Trophy due to not having a name, the award was renamed the Nathan Walker Trophy for the 2018-19 Australian Junior Ice Hockey League season, in honor of Australia's first player to make it to the National Hockey League - Nathan Walker. The Nathan Walker Trophy is awarded to the winners of the playoffs for the national junior men's ice hockey competition, the Australian Junior Ice Hockey League. The cup was donated by the Old-timers Ice Hockey Australia Network in 2012 for the inaugural season for the AJIHL.\nJim Brown Shield.\nThe Jim Brown Shield is awarded to the winner of the interstate tournament for men aged 17 years and older . The trophy is a shield named after James Archibald Brown, a Scottish born migrant who was an ice hockey champion and speed skating champion record holder. In 1964 the president of the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association, Harry Curtis, donated the Jim Brown Shield for the interstate junior ice hockey tournament aged 18 years and under in the name of James Archibald \"Jimmy\" Brown who had died five years before.\nSyd Tange Trophy.\nThe Syd Tange Trophy is awarded to the winning state team of the under 18 national tournament. The trophy is named after Sydney Edward Tange (1917–2005).\nKurt DeFris Trophy.\nThe Kurt DeFris Trophy is awarded to the winning state team of the under 15 national tournament.\nPhillip Ginsberg Memorial Trophy.\nThe Phillip Ginsberg Memorial Trophy is awarded to the winning state team of the under 13 national tournament.\nJohn McCrae – Williamson Memorial Trophy.\nThe John McCrae – Williamson Memorial Trophy is awarded to the winning state team of the under 11 national tournament."

        "title": "1978–79 Boston College basketball point-shaving scandal",
        "text": "The 1978–79 Boston College basketball point-shaving scandal involved a scheme in which members of the American Mafia recruited and bribed several Boston College Eagles men's basketball players to ensure the team would not win by the required margin (not cover the point spread) or win by the required margin (cover the point spread), allowing gamblers in the know to place wagers against that team and win.\nScheme proposal.\nThe scheme was conceived by Rocco Perla and his brother Anthony in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the summer of 1978. The Perla brothers were small-time gamblers who saw the upcoming 1978–79 Boston College Eagles basketball season as a perfect opportunity to earn a lot of money. Needing an inside man, the brothers wanted to recruit Rick Kuhn, a high school friend of Rocco who was entering his senior year at Boston College and was expected to be a key member of the 1978–79 Eagles team.\nThe Perla brothers proposed a simple scheme: they, along with Kuhn, would select certain basketball games where the projected point spread separating Boston College from its opponent was expected to be significant. Kuhn would be responsible for ensuring, by his play on the court, that Boston College fell short of the point spread. Thus, for example, if participating bookmakers determined Boston College to be an eight-point favorite in a particular game, Kuhn would be paid a bonus, usually $2,500, if they won by less than eight points. In addition, they were given the opportunity to bet the money they were paid and double their winnings. Kuhn agreed to participate, and brought in his teammate Jim Sweeney.\nSetup.\nThe Perla brothers mobilized a betting syndicate to maximize their potential gain from the scheme. They contacted a local friend, Paul Mazzei, who was known to have influence within major New York gambling circles. Mazzei in turn contacted Henry Hill, a Lucchese crime family associate from New York who had befriended Mazzei while both men were serving sentences in a federal prison. Mazzei and the Perla brothers were particularly hopeful that Hill would enlist the support of his associate, James Burke, to finance the payments to the players and to set up a network of bookmakers who were in on the scheme. These bookies could handle large bets and lay them off and spread the bets among a number of unsuspecting bookmakers around the country so as not to arouse suspicion. They would also ensure protection for the enterprise in the event that the unsuspecting bookmakers, all of whom had toughs at their disposal to collect unpaid debts, discovered they were being swindled. Hill and Burke were brought into the scheme, after receiving approval from Lucchese family capo Paul Vario.\nBurke, through Hill, would front the money to pay the players, forwarding the money through Mazzei and the Perla brothers. The same channels would be used for the passing of the point spread from Burke and Hill to the players. Burke had Hill fly to Boston on November 16, 1978, to meet with Mazzei, Kuhn, Tony Perla, and any other member of the Eagles team interested in participating in their scheme. Said Hill, \"I asked the players which of the upcoming games they felt we could shave. Sweeney took out one of those little schedule cards, circled the games he thought we could fool around with, and gave the card to me. They kept saying that they liked the idea of just shaving points and not blowing the games.\" However, as noted below, the scheme also worked in games where the Eagles were expected to lose anyway, with them shaving points so that the syndicate could bet on the other team winning by more than the point spread.\nPoint fixing.\nIn their game against Providence on December 6, 1978, Boston College's team was favored to win by six to seven points. Kuhn was thus expected to keep the score below the six- to seven-point margin. However, the test run for the scheme proved unsuccessful when Boston College established an early lead and ultimately won the game by nineteen points. Enraged by their gambling loss, the Perla brothers, along with Mazzei, Burke and Hill, decided to recruit additional Eagles players to enhance their control over the outcome of the games. They had Kuhn approach Ernie Cobb, the leading scorer on the team, but it has never been proven if Cobb agreed to cooperate. Burke instructed Hill to warn the players to keep to their end of the deal because \"you can't play basketball with broken hands.\"\nThe December 16 game against Harvard was chosen as the second test for the scheme. Boston College was favored by twelve to thirteen points, but won the game by only a three-point margin, 86–83. The syndicate was very happy with this result, and Kuhn was given cash to distribute to the players for their efforts. The scheme continued to work successfully in the December 23 game against UCLA. In this game, UCLA was favored to win over the Eagles by a fifteen to eighteen-point spread, so the syndicate bet on them to win by a margin greater than the point spread. The Eagles managed to lose by 22 points, 103–81, with the syndicate winning its bet.\nSuspecting that some bookmakers might be getting wise to the scheme, the conspirators temporarily revised their strategy after the UCLA game. To allay any suspicions of foul play, they decided to bet on Boston College to win by more than the point spread (\"cover the spread\") in a game that they were confident the Eagles would win handily. The conspirators chose the January 17, 1979, game against Connecticut to implement this plan. Their strategy was effective Boston College, a five-point favorite, covered the spread with a 90–80 win over Connecticut.\nIn early February, Boston College was scheduled to play two New York State teams, Fordham and St. John's. The conspirators decided that these games presented especially good opportunities because New York bookmakers generally accepted large bets for New York teams. They reintroduced the original strategy, which proved successful for the February 3 Fordham game when Boston College, a ten-point favorite, won by seven points. The February 6 game against St. John's was a \"push\" (winning back exact bets), as the syndicate neither won nor lost when St. John's prevailed 85–76, the exact point spread (nine) the bookmakers had offered.\nConfident from their recent success, the conspirators viewed the February 10 game against Holy Cross as an opportunity to reap the full benefits of their scheme. They were aware that bookmakers generally accepted large bets on this game both because Boston College and Holy Cross were traditional rivals and because the game was being nationally televised. Holy Cross was favored to win and, consistent with the scheme, were bet on to win by a margin greater than the seven-point spread. Holy Cross ultimately won by only two points, as Cobb scored eight points in the final minute to bring the Eagles close, and everyone involved lost a substantial amount of money. Hill stated that, at the time, he and Burke were watching the game on television at Burke's home in Queens, and Burke put his foot through the television in anger at having lost $50,000 ($ today). Said Hill, \"He wanted me to fly up to Boston. Ultimately, nothing happened. Jimmy said he was finished. He didn't want to be bothered with these kids anymore.\" The scheme thus ended on an unsuccessful note.\nBoston College's basketball team ended their 1978–79 season with a 22–9 record. The players involved in the scandal were paid between $500 and $1,000 for each game and were given the chance to double it betting on the games. Hill reportedly cleared over $100,000 ($ today) and bettors higher up the line were said to have made up to $250,000 ($ today).\nUncovering of the scheme.\nThe conspiracy unraveled in 1980 after Hill was arrested by New York State authorities on drug trafficking charges and was subsequently implicated in the Lufthansa heist, which occurred while the point-shaving scheme was underway. Hill turned state's evidence in exchange for avoiding prison and possible execution by Burke and the Lucchese family. While he was being questioned, FBI agents inadvertently mentioned Hill's frequent trips to Boston around the time of the Lufthansa heist. Hill revealed his involvement in the point-shaving scheme, offering to relate the full story if federal officials would guarantee him full immunity and would agree to intercede on his behalf to convince state officials to drop the drug charges pending in state court. Edward A. McDonald, who coincidentally had graduated from Boston College in 1968 and who had played briefly on the basketball team, prosecuted the case.\nA grand jury indicted Burke, Mazzei, Kuhn and the Perla brothers. Hill was listed as a co-conspirator but was not named as a defendant. At trial in 1981, the government's case consisted primarily of the testimony of Hill and three other witnesses: Sweeney and Joseph Beaulieu, both Boston College players, and Barbara Reed, a 23-year-old nurse who lived with Kuhn during the 1978–79 Eagles season. The government presented telephone records showing evidence of extensive communications between the conspirators during the 1978–79 season and records provided by Western Union and various hotels which further corroborated government testimony.\nAfter a four-week trial, each conspirator was convicted on charges of conspiracy, conspiracy to commit sports bribery and interstate travel with the intent to commit bribery. Burke was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment. Kuhn was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, later reduced to 28 months. Mazzei and Tony Perla were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Rocco Perla was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Sweeney was not charged. Cobb was acquitted of any wrongdoing, despite Kuhn giving Cobb's girlfriend an allegedly unsolicited envelope with $1,000.\nAftermath.\nOn August 12, 2008, an anonymous user edited the Wikipedia article on the scandal, naming former player Joe Streater as an accomplice in the point-shaving, claiming he had been recruited by Kuhn alongside Sweeney. No source was given for this claim, with Streater's last appearance for the team occurring in the 1977–78 season, but the claim remained for more than five years, resulting in a number of media sites including Bleacher Report, ESPN and Yahoo News erroneously naming him as a point-shaver.\nIn 2014, the ESPN-produced \"30 for 30\" series debuted \"Playing for the Mob\", the story about how the point-shaving scheme during the 1978–79 season unfolded. The documentary, narrated by Ray Liotta (who portrayed Hill in the film \"Goodfellas\"), was set up so that the viewer needed to watch \"Goodfellas\" beforehand to understand many of the references in the story."

He started 35 games at Michigan and was selected as an All-American in 1991. He played professional football as a center and guard in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins in 1992 and for the Carolina Panthers from 1995 to 1997.\nEarly years.\nElliott was born in Carmel, Indiana, in 1968. He attended Carmel High School.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nElliott enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1987 and played college football for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1988 to 1991.\nAs a sophomore, Elliott started all 11 games, nine at right guard and two at left guard, for the 1989 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10–2 record and was ranked #7 in the final AP Poll in Bo Schembechler's last season as head coach at Michigan.\nAs a junior, Elliott started all 12 games, four at left guard and eight at center, for the 1990 Michigan team that compiled a 9–3 record and was ranked #7 in the final AP Poll. Elliott started the season at left guard, but was moved to center after Steve Everitt broke his foot in Michigan's 45–17 victory over Maryland. Elliott was named the co-MVP of the 1991 Gator Bowl at the conclusion of his junior season.\nAs a senior, Elliott started all 12 games, eight at left guard and four at center, for the 1991 Michigan team that compiled a 10–2 record, won the Big Ten championship, and was ranked #6 in the final AP Poll. Elliott again started the season at left guard, but moved to center for four games after Steve Everitt suffered a broken jaw in the Notre Dame game on September 14, 1991. At the end of the season, he was selected as a first-team All-American and a first-team All-Big Ten player.\nProfessional football.\nElliott was selected by the Washington Redskins in the 12th round (336th overall pick) of the 1992 NFL draft. He was the final selection in the final round of the draft, giving him the designation of Mr. Irrelevant. Despite the moniker, Elliott appeared in 16 games, two as a starter, for the Redskins during the 1992 season. He spent the 1993 season on injured reserve, and he was cut during training camp in 1994.\nDuring the 1994 NFL season, Elliott was unable to sign with another NFL team. Instead, he worked as a sideline reporter covering Washington Redskins games and as a color commentator for high school football games in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nIn 1995, Elliott attempted a comeback and signed with the Carolina Panthers. When he was announced as a starter for the Panthers during the 1995 preseason, Elliott described it as being \"a little like a fairy tale\" and \"a dream come true.\" He was the Panthers' starting right guard in 14 games during the 1995 season. The following year, he appeared in 16 regular season games, 12 as a starter, as a center and left guard for the 1996 Carolina Panthers team that compiled a 12–4 record, won the NFC West, and lost to the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. He was dubbed \"Lego Man\" in 1996 because he started at center and guard and also played some at tackle. In his final NFL season, Elliott appeared in 16 games, six as a starter, as a left guard for the 1997 Panthers. While playing for Carolina, Elliott founded Fatguy Charities to raise money for children.\nIn four NFL seasons, Elliott appeared in 63 games, 34 as a starter, for the Redskins and Panthers. He played longer in the NFL than any prior player to bear the \"Mr. Irrelevant\" moniker.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring as a player, Elliott covered NFL Europe on Fox Sports and college football games on ESPN.

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team toured England in the 1906 season. The team played 19 matches between 11 June and 18 August 1906 of which 13 were regarded as first-class.\nA somewhat more formal selection process seems to have been followed than for the 1900 tour but the team was still selected by representatives from Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad. The team was perhaps a little stronger than that of 1900 but two tours to the West Indies in 1901-02 and 1904-05 had shown again that the combined West Indies team was of quite a modest standard compared to English first-class counties. Despite this the same mistake was made as in 1900 and an overly ambitious tour programme was arranged. This included 19 matches, mostly against first-class counties. As in 1900 they suffered a series of heavy defeats early on but later in the tour had some success, particularly in heavily defeating Yorkshire. The first-class teams fielded somewhat weakened sides to make the matches more competitive but the early defeats had again limited public interest.\nSydney Smith was the star all-rounder of the team in the early matches but he later lost form, especially his batting. He was particularly effective against the minor teams. Richard Ollivierre and Oliver Layne also performed as useful all-rounders. Percy Goodman, Bertie Harragin, Lebrun Constantine, George Challenor and Harold Austin all batted well on occasions. Harragin missed a number of matches through injury. Austin was perhaps a disappointment. As in 1900 the Jamaican players did little.\nTommie Burton left the tour early. No reason for this is given in contemporary publications but it is reported that his tour \"ended in acrimony when he was sent home after refusing to carry out menial duties for white members of the side.\nTouring team.\nSince the first tour to England in the summer of 1900 there had been two further tours by English teams to the West Indies. These were the tours captained by Richard Bennett in 1901–02 and by Lord Brackley in 1904–05. The selection of the West Indies team took place after the 1905–06 Inter-Colonial Tournament in January 1906. The team was selected by two representatives from each of the three competing colonies; Jamaica, Grenada and St. Vincent being unrepresented. Charles Ollivierre was now playing for Derbyshire and so was unavailable.\nThe 15 players that made up the team consisted of:\nBurton, Constantine, Goodman and Learmond had been part of the 1900 team. Richard Ollivierre was the brother of Charles Ollivierre who had toured in 1900.\nR.H. Mallett was the manager. Austin was elected as captain while Goodman and Harragin were chosen for the selection committee.\nThe majority of the team was white. The Professionals Burton, Cumberbatch and Layne were black as were Constantine and Ollivierre amongst the Amateurs.\nStrangely Cumberbatch was invariably reported in contemporary publications as being \"C. P. Cumberbatch\" whereas it appears that he was actually \"A.B. Cumberbatch\", C. P. Cumberbatch being a different player.\nPreliminaries.\n13 of the team departed from Barbados aboard RMS \"Trent\" on 22 May arriving in Southampton on 4 June via Cherbourg. Bancroft and Cameron were already in England. Mr Mallet met the team at Southampton.\nIn England the team stayed initially at the Manchester Hotel, Aldersgate Street, London. The team practised at Lord's and played a number of preliminary matches, some arranged by WG Grace.\nMatches.\nStatus.\nOf the 19 matches 6 were not regarded as first-class. These were the matches against Lord Brackley's XI, Minor Counties XI, Wiltshire, South Wales, Northumberland and Durham, and Norfolk. These are shown in \"italics\" below.\nMatch 1 v W.G. Grace's XI.\nBy a strange coincidence this match started on exactly the same day and date as the 1900 tour, i.e. Monday 11 June. The home team was styled W.G. Grace's XI rather than London County, mainly because London County had lost its first-class status at this time. The tourists left out Cameron, Morrison, Ollivierre and Parker.\nW.G. Grace's team won the toss and batted. The highlight of their innings was 105 by Albert Lawton out of 193 in 85 minutes, adding 150 for the fourth wicket with Edward Sewell in 70 minutes, the whole innings lasting just 3 and a half hours. When they batted the West Indians did badly and were 87/6 at the close. Only Lebrun Constantine with 89 avoided complete disaster. Batting fourth he was ninth out and his runs were made out of 124 and came in just 95 minutes and scoring 60 of the 66 runs scored for the last four wickets.\nW.G. Grace did not enforce the follow-on and Archie Cumberbatch and Oliver Layne took a number of early wickets and reduced Grace's team to 53/7. However the tail added good runs with William Murch making a useful 53. Layne ending up with 6/74. Getting 376 for victory was never on but the tourists disappointed with 128 having been 7/38 at one stage. Bertie Harragin top scored with 50 made in 30 minutes with 5 6s, 4 4s and 2 2s, including 3 6s in one over from WG. The match was finished inside two days.\nMatch 2 v Essex.\nOllivierre and Parker replaced Burton and Challenor. Essex won the toss, batted and made 226 on a cold day. Left-handed New Zealander Dan Reese top scored with 70 out of 178 in 140 minutes. When they batted the tourists did well with Oliver Layne making 106 in 3 hours, Harold Austin 74 in 2 and a half hours and Bertie Harragin 51 in 40 minutes to give the West Indians a first innings lead of 153. Austin and Harragin added 151 for the fourth wicket in 125 minutes.\nBatting again Essex did much better with Percy Perrin and Charlie McGahey scoring well and at the end of the second day they were 212/2, Perrin and McGahey adding 136 in the last 90 minutes of play. The tourists took a number of quick wickets early on the third day but a partnership of 95 for the last wicket in 50 minutes left them a target of 243. Only Sydney Smith with 46* scored many runs and they fell 111 runs short.\n\"Match 3 v Lord Brackley's West Indian XI\".\n\"This match was ruled not first-class by the M.C.C. Lord Brackley's team consisted of 11 of those who had toured the West Indies with him in the 1904–05 season. Hayes was playing in a county match and was unavailable. Burton, Challenor and Morrison replaced Cumberbatch, Goodman and Parker.\"\n\"Batting first the West Indies did badly and were dismissed for 158 with George Simpson-Hayward taking 7/37 with his lobs. Richard Ollivierre was top score with 41 in 50 minutes. Teddy Wynyard scored a rapid 76 in the reply of 213 with Charles Morrison taking 5/58.\"\n\"Second time round the tourists started badly and were 99/6. A useful partnership of 149 in 80 minutes for the seventh wicket between Harold Austin and Bertie Harragin enabled them to set Lord Brackley's XI a target of 244. Harragin made 86 in 90 minutes. When the home side batted Morrison took quick wickets and the score was 80/4 at the close. Wynyard, who had opened in the first innings, batted down the order because of injury and used a runner. He was again the top scorer with 70* in 125 minutes and led the team to an exciting two wicket victory. Ollivierre was no-balled when, seeing Wynyard out of his ground, he threw at the stumps in an attempt to run him out.\"\n\"Match 4 v Minor Counties XI\".\n\"Cumberbatch, Goodman and Parker replaced Austin, Bancroft and Burton. Goodman captained the side, won the toss and batted first, Ollivierre kept wicket in Bancroft's absence. The tourists made a disappointing score of just 204 with Bertie Harragin scoring 68 out of 94 in 65 minutes. The Minor Counties got within 12 runs of the West Indian score with 62 in 88 minutes from William Coleman from Hertfordshire the top scorer.\"\n\"The second time around the tourists did much better. Sydney Smith with 93 and Harragin with 63 adding 130 runs for the fifth wicket in 80 minutes. Set a target of 351 the Minor Counties were quickly 11/3 and never got close. Smith took 5/45 to go with his 4/86 in the first innings and his scored of 23 and 93.\"\n\"After the match Harragin attempted to beat his West Indian record for throwing the cricket ball. However he only reached 124 yards 2 feet 10 inches compared to his record of 128 yards 4 inches.\"\nMatch 5 v Surrey.\nAustin, Bancroft and Burton replaced Cumberbatch, Goodman and Learmond. Surrey batted first and reached 174/2 at lunchtime. When 6 wickets were down Keith Bancroft dislocated a finger and Richard Ollivierre replaced him as wicket-keeper. Oliver Layne ended up with 7/76. The tourists did badly when they batted and were 103/8 at the end of the first day.\nOn the second morning the West Indians followed-on and were quickly 57/4. Bertie Harragin and Harold Austin then added 90 in 65 minutes. Harragin's innings of 57 lasted 75 minutes. The tourists were headed for an innings defeat but a ninth wicket stand of 48 in 30 minutes between Lebrun Constantine and Tommie Burton enabled them to set a target of 47. In the match 5 of the West Indian batsmen were run out. The match ended a day early.\nAfter the match Harragin made another attempt at throwing the cricket ball. This time he reached only 119 yards 2 feet.\n\"Match 6 v Wiltshire\".\n\"Cameron, Cumberbatch, Goodman and Learmond replaced Bancroft, Constantine, Morrison and Parker. Ollivierre kept wicket. This was Cameron's first match of the tour and was to be Burton's last. Wiltshire won the toss and batted. This was a 2-day match.\"\n\"Rain prevented play until after 2:30 on the first day. Wiltshire scored 233 with Arthur Newman scoring 72 with 4 6s. Sydney Smith took 8/93. In reply the West Indians were dismissed for 149 with Smith top scorer with 52 and William Overton taking 5/58.\"\n\"A draw looked likely but the pitch was ruined by rain and the tourists lost by 86 runs. Smith took 4/46 in the second Wiltshire innings and with 26 was top scorer again in the West Indians second innings. Ollivierre, who had kept wicket for most of the match, took 4/5 in 2.4 overs, all bowled. The West Indians started their innings with only 90 minutes remaining but were dismissed 4 minutes before the end of the match.\"\nMatch 7 v Hampshire.\nBancroft, Constantine and Morrison replaced Burton, Layne and Learmond. Batting first the tourists made a disappointing score of just 166, Sydney Smith again top score with 48 adding 84 with Percy Goodman in 75 minutes. William Langford took 8/82. Charlie Llewellyn with 60 and Phil Mead with 132 added 124 for the third wicket. At the close of play Hampshire were in a commanding position at 235/3. Mead was eventually out after an innings lasting 170 minutes and Hampshire had a first innings lead of 183.\nThe West Indians batted better second time around. Richard Ollivierre made 67 and Smith again excelled with 100, the pair adding 100 for the fifth wicket in 55 minutes. Ollivierre hit in splendid fashion. Set 111 Hampshire were 61/4 but made the target comfortably. Smith took 4/53 and 7 wickets in the match.\n\"Match 8 v South Wales\".\n\"Parker replaced Harragin. The South Wales side consisted of players from Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. The game was virtually won on the first day when the West Indians won the toss, scored 324 and had the South Wales team at 93/6. The tourists were 23/4 but Sydney Smith again batted well scoring 140* in 145 minutes. He added 126 with Lebrun Constantine in 65 minutes and then 110 with Richard Ollivierre in 70 minutes.\"\n\"Smith wrapped up the tail on the second morning and ended with figures of 5/28. The tourists made 176 when they batted again and set the South Wales team an impossible target of 399. Only Alec Thackeray batted well scoring 59 in 35 minutes. Smith took 4/36.\"\n\"Smith had been top scorer and leading wicket taker for the West Indians in each of the last three matches. He had had a run of being top scorer in 5 consecutive innings. At this stage of the tour he had scored over 700 runs at an average approaching 60 and taken over 50 wickets at an average of under 20 in just 8 matches, 4 first-class and 4 not.\"\nMatch 9 v Kent.\nHarragin and Learmond replaced Cameron and Parker. The Kent innings of 471 lasted just 4 hours and 40 minutes. Arthur Day scored 82 out of 155 in 90 minutes while Frank Woolley scored 77 out of 122 in 45 minutes. Only Richard Ollivierre was at all effective with 7/144. The tourists were 15/0 at the close.\nMost of the tourists got to double figures but they only reached a total 248, Colin Blythe taking 7/86. Keith Bancroft top scored with 53 in 90 minutes. Following-on Harold Austin and Bertie Harragin added 79 for the second wicket in 55 minutes but thereafter wickets fell at regular innings and they fell 14 runs short of making Kent bat again. Harragin sustained a leg injury which forced him miss a number of matches. The match finished a day early.\nMatch 10 v M.C.C..\nMorrison replaced the injured Harragin. The M.C.C. team was captained by Plum Warner, a native of Trinidad and included Edward Challenor, an elder brother of George Challenor who was playing occasionally for Leicestershire and who was born in Barbados. Batting first lost wickets regularly although George Challenor made 59 in 80 minutes the tourists were 136/7 at lunchtime. After lunch Archie Cumberbatch scored a rapid 59* in 65 minutes enabling the total to reach 240. The M.C.C. were 89/6 but then Warner and Charles Veal added 80 in 45 minutes and then Gerry Weigall added 75 with Warner in 50 minutes and the M.C.C. gained a first innings lead of 29. Sydney Smith took 5/78.\nThe tourists were 73/3 at lunch on the second day but afterwards they collapsed before Bert Vogler, the South African googly bowler, who ended up with 9/44, the other batsman being run out. He had not bowled in the innings until the score was 35/0. Set just 87 the M.C.C. made the runs easily. The game finished a day early again.\nMatch 11 v Derbyshire.\nCameron and Layne replaced Bancroft and Parker, Ollivierre keeping wicket. Derbyshire's team included Charles Ollivierre, Richard's brother, who had toured with the West Indies in 1900. Batting first the tourists made 233 with Percy Goodman scoring 81* out of 142 in 140 minutes. Derbyshire reached 105/3 by the close. On the second day they reached 217, 16 short of the West Indian total.\nBatted again the West Indians were 62/4 but Oliver Layne scored 63 in 115 minutes added useful runs with Richard Ollivierre and Harold Austin. Derbyshire had 2 overs at the end of the second day. Set 259 Derbyshire Charles Ollivierre and Ernest Needham, the England footballer, added 123 in 65 minutes. Maynard Ashcroft who had retired earlier with a fly in his eye returned and saw Derbyshire to a 6 wickets victory with Ollivierre.\nMatch 12 v Scotland.\nBancroft replaced Cameron. Play was delayed until after lunch and when they batted Scotland only managed 147 and by the end of the first day the West Indies were 109/4, Lebrun Constantine scoring a rapid 68 in 50 minutes and adding 87 with Oliver Layne. The tourists were heading for a small lead but a last wicket stand of 72 between Harold Austin and George Learmond gave then a lead of 102.\nScotland fared badly when they batted again and were 45/3. A stand of 78 between Maurice Dickson and Charles Mannes saw then to 155/4 at the close of the second day. Dickson was bowled by Richard Ollivierre but the bails took several seconds to fall and he was given not out by the umpire. He eventually took his score to 81 on the third day and the tourists were set a target of 203. George Challenor with 90 scored out of 148 lead the West Indians to a 6 wicket victory.\nMatch 13 v An England XI.\nThis was in the nature of a festival match, the England XI being referred to as a \"scratch eleven\". Cameron and Parker replaced Goodman and Learmond. Constantine kept wicket even though Bancroft was playing. Fifty-nine-year-old Monkey Hornby was the original captain of the England XI. However he got lumbago and was replaced by Albert Peatfield early on the second day. Even though he was a substitute Peatfield was allowed to bat. This was his only first-class match.\nWinning the toss the tourists batted and made 201 with Lebrun Constantine top scorer with 54 in 70 minutes. In reply the England XI made just 138. On the second day the West Indians scored 158 with Constantine again top scorer with 51, Sam Hargreave taking 7/49. The England XI reached 40/0 by the close. Most of the last day was lost to rain and the match was drawn. Willie Quaife and Arthur Day added 20 in 10 minutes at one stage.\n\"Match 14 v Northumberland and Durham\".\n\"Goodman and Learmond replaced Cameron and Morrison, Bancroft kept wicket. George Challenor played an excellent innings of 97 in the first innings. George Turnbull, who never played a first-class game taking 8/110. In reply the combined team was 102/8 at the close.\"\n\"Play did not start until 4pm on the second day because of rain. Set 237 on the third day the batting of combined team proved disappointing. In the match Sydney Smith scored 41 and 32 and took 6/56 and 5/49.\"\nMatch 15 v Yorkshire.\nCameron replaced Learmond. West Indies won the toss, batted first and scored 270, Lebrun Constantine 79 and Oliver Layne 63 adding 117 for the second wicket in 70 minutes. When they batted Yorkshire were sensationally dismissed for 50 in 80 minutes with Richard Ollivierre 7/23 and Sydney Smith 3/27 bowling unchanged.\nThey did not enforce the follow-on on the second morning. George Challenor and Constantine added 69 for the first wicket in 35 minutes, Layne scored another half century and Percy Goodman 102* out of 173 in 90 minutes before the declaration at 4pm, setting Yorkshire a target of 525. Yorkshire reached 114/4 in 100 minutes by the close of the second day. David Denton, 42* overnight, reached 112* but the team fell well short of their target. Ollivierre took 4 more wickets to add to his 7 in the first innings. This was certainly the best result of the tour.\nMatch 16 v Leicestershire.\nLearmond and Morrison replaced Cameron and Parker. Leicestershire won the toss batted and were soon 41/4 but Harry Whitehead and Samuel Coe added 83 in an hour and the home side eventually reached 274. In reply George Challenor and Lebrun Constantine scored 86 in 50 minutes and the tourists reached 124/2 at the close of play. Constantine eventually scored 92 in 110 minutes adding 79 in an hour with Sydney Smith. The rest added little and the tourists ended up 32 short on the first innings. William Odell took 6/60.\nLeicestershire made a bad start to their second innings and were 105/6. Coe and Vivian Crawford, who scored 51, then added 64 in 30 minutes. Coe was then joined by Richard Crawford and added 51 more and then Coe and Thomas Jayes added 46 more before the close of play, leaving them in a strong position 299 ahead. Coe eventually fell for 86 made in 150 minutes and the tourists were left to make 351. Challenor and Constantine again gave the West Indians a good start adding 116 for the first wicket. Smith, Percy Goodman and Harold Austin all added useful runs and at 241/4 a surprise win looked possible. Wickets then fell regularly and they ended up 24 runs short.\n\"Match 17 v Norfolk\".\n\"Harragin and Parker replaced Bancroft and Morrison. Learmond and Constantine kept wicket. Batting first the tourists made a useful total of 375. George Challenor made 37, Lebrun Constantine 41, Oliver Layne 62, Percy Goodman 88, Harold Austin 32 and Richard Ollivierre 42.\"\n\"Ollivierre and Layne had Norfolk in trouble and they were bowled out for 91. Following-on they did a little better but Layne and Sydney Smith this time did the damage. Basil Cozens-Hardy top scored with 48. In the match Ollivierre took 3/42, Layne 9/89 and Smith 7/90.\"\nMatch 18 v Nottinghamshire.\nCameron and Morrison replaced Learmond and Parker. Constantine and Ollivierre kept wicket. Only 3 and a half hours play was possible on the first day during which time Nottinghamshire reached 254/5. James Iremonger and Wilfred Payton added 123 in 80 minutes for the third wicket. Payton eventually fell for 113 in 135 minutes. The remaining wickets fell in 55 minutes on the second morning. The tourists started badly being 2/3 in the first over. Sydney Smith scored 43 but it was left to Bertie Harragin with 26 to avoid the follow-on. Thomas Wass took 5/89.\nWhen they batted again John Gunn scored 112 out of the innings total of 180 scored in 130 minutes, reaching his century in two hours. Left with nearly four hours to get 328 the West Indians started well with George Challenor and Oliver Layne scoring 129 for the first wicket. Challenor eventually made 108 and a useful stand between Harragin 43* and Archie Cumberbatch 13* saw out time. Albert Hallam took 9 wickets in the match.\nMatch 19 Northamptonshire.\nGeorge Challenor and Lebrun Constantine added 60 in 50 minutes giving the tourists a good start. Wickets then fell and it was left to Percy Goodman with 107 and Richard Ollivierre with 50 to enable the total to reach 297 made in 220 minutes. Goodman's innings lasted 150 minutes. Northamptonshire were soon in trouble and ended the day on 29/4, Ollivierre and Sydney Smith taking two wickets each. On the second day only George Thompson with 51 did much and the team was dismissed for 85. Smith ended up with 6/39.\nThe tourists did not enforce the follow-on and were quickly dismissed for 99 by Thompson with 5/47 and William East with 4/45. Scoring 312 to win seemed unlikely but they reached 60/1 at the close of the second day. Ollivierre and Smith again did the damage and the tourists won comfortably by 155 runs. Smith took 6/60 to return match figures of 12/99.\nSummary.\nOf the 13 first-class matches played, 3 matches were won, 8 were lost and 2 were drawn. In all matches 7 were won, 10 were lost and 2 were drawn.\nPost Tour.\nAn additional match was arranged against W.H. Laverton's XI at Oldfields Ground, Uttoxeter on 20 and 21 August. the West Indians scored 268 and 146, W.H. Laverton's XI 154 and 150/6 and the match was drawn. This additional match was played after the tour proper had ended and was not regarded as part of it. A yet further match is noted in which Constantine scored 111 but no other details are given.\nThe team sailed from England on the RMS \"Trent\" encountering a storm on the voyage and reached Barbados on 17 September.\nSydney Smith remained in England after the tour to qualify for Northamptonshire.\nGeneral Comments.\nThe tour was clearly regarded as disappointing: \"There is no getting away from the fact that the programme arranged for them was too ambitious, and they failed to make any strong appeal to the public. Any hope they might have had of attracting attention, was destroyed by the ill-success that attended them in their early fixtures.\" and \"The plain truth is that the players were not good enough to make the English counties feel in the smallest degree apprehensive. Hence the comparative indifference with which the matches were regarded.\"\nAlthough Bancroft was selected as the wicket-keeper at least 3 other players kept wicket at various times. Ollivierre was clearly a useful keeper but was too valuable as a bowler.\nThe running between the wickets was still poor and there were a large number of run outs.\nThe fielding was also regarded as of low standard. \"They must, if they wish to succeed, pick the ball up clean.\"\nSome comments were made about the fielding positions used by the tourists. 'Cricket' reports that \"The West Indians still arrange their field in a manner which seems curious to Englishmen, and apparently they do not yet realise that a cover-point 50 and 60 yards from the wicket cannot possibly save the single, and can seldom cover enough ground to save the four. Sometimes they have an extra-cover who, while cover stands close in, fields almost behind him at a distance of forty yards or so; but once or twice at Lord's on Monday in the M.C.C. match the ball went through both men, although it was not hit hard enough to reach the boundary. On the same day Challenor sometimes at point and sometimes in a position which is a sort of \"third man close in\", fielded brilliantly.\"\nAverages.\nThe following averages are for the 13 first-class matches only.\nBatting.\nIn all 19 matches SG Smith was leading run scorer with 1107. LS Constantine with 1025 and G Challenor with 1017 also reached 1000 runs.\nBowling.\nOllivierre bowled 3 wides, Smith 2 no balls and 12 wides, Morrison 2 no balls, Cumberbatch 3 wides, Parker 2 wides.\nIn all 19 matches SG Smith took 116 wickets. RC Ollivierre was second highest wicket taker with 71."

        "title": "Australian rugby league premiers",
        "text": "The Australian rugby league premiers are the winners of the top grade competition in Australian rugby league, which is currently the National Rugby League. From 1908 until 1995, when the ARL Premiership was formed, there were two premiers, one each from Sydney and Brisbane. This occurred again in 1997 during the Super League war. \nHistory.\nFrom 1905 the states of Queensland and New South Wales were beginning to create Rugby League competitions, using the rules created in Northern England as a break-away game from Rugby Union.\nThe first season of rugby league in Australia commenced in New South Wales and was held in 1908 and was run by the New South Wales Rugby Football League. Queensland Rugby League was established in 1908 also; they ran their inaugural senior season in 1909. Both states ran parallel state competitions from that time. The game was adopted in both states in order to break away from the amateur rugby union competitions that existed at the time. The players had fallen out of heart with the administration of that game due to increased revenue from the game not being reflected in player allotments. At the end of the 1908 NSW season, South Sydney became the first team to win the New South Wales premiership. The Fortitude Valley Diehards, then known as Valleys, won the inaugural senior Queensland Rugby league season in 1909.\nThe New South Wales Rugby League and Brisbane Rugby League competitions ran parallel to each other for nearly the entire 20th century, with interstate competitions held annually. However, due to these competitions being mainly between state representative sides, apart from a few NSWRL premier v BRL premier competitions held in the 1920s, there was often no way to determine a national premier.\nAfter 19 years of interstate-era dominance by New South Wales, the advent of State of Origin football in 1980 led to increased nationalisation of rugby league in Australia. After a failed proposal to play the first ever \"National Championship\" game in 1984 between the highly fancied BRL premier Wynnum-Manly Seagulls and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs of the NSWRL, it was decided that the Queensland Rugby League should form a team in 1986 to enter the NSWRL premiership. While the QRL slowly looked to create their own team, a private bid from the Brisbane Broncos consortium won the licence and the team entered the NSWRL in 1988. As a result, the standard of the Brisbane Rugby League decreased, and no BRL player was picked to represent Queensland or Australia afterwards; at this point most historians agree that the NSWRL became the premier competition nationwide.\nAlthough the BRL was also a first-class competition, similar to Australian Rules Football, where the Australian Football League which evolved from the Victorian Football League keeps VFL statistics back to 1897 as its own history but considers South Australia's SANFL and Western Australia's WAFL as separate competitions, the National Rugby League counts the history of the NSWRL Premiership as its own but considers the Brisbane Rugby League separate. Therefore, BRL champions are considered Australian Rugby League premiers but are not NRL premiers.\nStarting from 1995, the New South Wales competition began to call itself the Australian Rugby League. In 1997, an actual national competition was created by News Limited known as Super League, this was formed and run alongside the New South Wales and Queensland state premierships, a number of New South Wales competition teams being promoted to it. Later that year, an agreement was made between Super League and the New South Wales competition, following massive financial loss to both parties, to merge into a new National competition, known as the National Rugby League.\nSouth Sydney, with 20 New South Wales State titles, have been crowned New South Wales premiers more times than any other team. Fortitude Valley Diehards won the Queensland competition 23 times during its period as a first class competition, giving them the most first-class titles in Australian rugby league. They are followed by St. George with 15 premierships, including a record 11 New South Wales premierships in a row between 1956 and 1966. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks took nearly 50 years to win their maiden premiership in 2016 - longer than any other club in the history of the game (Parramatta's maiden premiership came in its 35th season in 1981).\nThere are 3 clubs currently playing in the National Rugby League that are yet to win a premiership; Redcliffe Dolphins, New Zealand Warriors and the Gold Coast Titans.\nSince 1908, counting the NRL and some of its predecessors (including the 1997 Super League Season), the following sides are a few who have never won a premiership:\nAll BRL teams except the Ipswich Jets and Logan Scorpions won a premiership during its time as a top-level competition.\nList of Premierships.\nPremiership performances by team.\n- *Denotes no grand final played\nList of QRL/BRL premiers (1909–1994).\nNote: The BRL maintained first class status until 1994 when the NSWRL became the ARL and a national competition was formed."

Competition took place in the Fencing Hall at the Helliniko Olympic Complex on August 17. The event was won by Marcel Fischer of Switzerland, the nation's first victory in the event and first medal of any color since 1952. Wang Lei's silver was China's first medal in the men's individual épée. Defending champion Pavel Kolobkov earned bronze, finishing a set of three different-colored Olympic medals in the event (silver in 1992, gold in 2000). Kolobkov was the fourth man to earn three medals in the event and had the best record of any of the four; only Ramón Fonst (with two gold medals) had more individual Olympic success in the men's épée. It was the fifth consecutive Games in which a Russian fencer reached the podium, including medals for Russian fencers competing for the Soviet Union (1988) and Unified Team (1992).\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFour of the eight quarterfinalists from 2000 returned: gold medalist (and 1992 silver medalist) Pavel Kolobkov of Russia, silver medalist Hugues Obry of France, fourth-place finisher Marcel Fischer of Switzerland, and eighth-place finisher Zhao Gang of China. The reigning (2003) World Champion was Fabrice Jeannet of France; Kolobkov (1993, 1994, and 2002) and Obry (1998) were also prior World Champions.\nAlgeria made its debut in the event. France and the United States each appeared for the 22nd time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition continued to use the entirely single-elimination (with bronze medal match) format introduced in 1996. All bouts were to 15 touches.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nAs there were more than 32 entrants in this event, five first round matches were held to reduce the field to 32 fencers.\nMain tournament bracket.\nThe remaining field of 32 fencers competed in a single-elimination tournament to determine the medal winners.

        "text": "Peter James Wallace (born 16 October 1985) is a former Scotland international rugby league footballer who played for the Penrith Panthers and the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL.\nA New South Wales State of Origin representative, Wallace began his career playing as a but later moved to . He announced his immediate retirement following a string of injuries on 12 June 2018. He now works as an assistant coach for the Penrith Panthers.\nBackground.\nWallace was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and raised in Blaxland, New South Wales by his mother Dianne. Wallace has never met his father, who reportedly remained in Melbourne.\nHe attended Blaxland East Public School and Blaxland High School, and played his junior rugby league for Lower Mountains Eagles before moving to St Marys Saints at the age of 12.\nWallace is of Scottish descent through his maternal grandmother.\nPlaying career.\nPenrith Panthers.\nWallace made his NRL début at Canberra Stadium against the Canberra Raiders in round 17 of the 2005 season.\nHe did not feature throughout the entire 2006 NRL season for Penrith.\nIn round 3, 2007, against the Brisbane Broncos, Wallace kicked a 44-metre field goal in golden point, with Penrith winning 29–28.\nWallace was the subject of controversy when he was dropped to NSWRL Premier League in round 15 of the NRL competition in 2007. Penrith coach Matthew Elliott moved Wallace to the premier league on what he claimed to be poor form. However Wallace had earned a man of the match award only two weeks before, but had a poor game the week later.\nThe controversy came when claims were made that Wallace was dropped due to the fact that he had signed with the Broncos, but teammate Joel Clinton, who was also Brisbane bound, wasn't dropped. There were rumours from the media, that Wallace wanted out of the Penrith Panthers to go to Brisbane mid-season. Wallace denied these claims, and wanted to fulfill his contract with the Penrith club, even if it was in premier league.\nIt remains unclear how the move to the Brisbane club came about.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nWallace's career at the Brisbane Broncos started in 2008. He guided his new club to a first round victory over his old club, the Penrith Panthers, before picking up consecutive \"Man of The Match\" awards in his next two matches, also wins for Brisbane. Wallace performed very strongly while Darren Lockyer was injured and provided much needed stability in Brisbane's halves and a good kicking game.\nWallace was selected for the City vs Country Origin match in 2008. In May, 2008, Wallace was selected as halfback for New South Wales for game I of State of Origin on 21 May at ANZ Stadium. With his first touch of the ball, he made a line break. He also had a hand in two tries and placed a pin point accurate kick for Anthony Quinn to score the second try of the night. He made only one error and took many hits from Queensland players, making 29 tackles.\nWallace was selected for the Blues again in Game II (playing on his normal home ground) before he ruptured a testicle and missed Game III. After State of Origin ended Wallace was reunited with halves partner Darren Lockyer at the Broncos. Wallace's great form from the start of the season had slightly been lost but he still remains to be a future star and a great prospect for the Brisbane Broncos. On 15 July 2008, Wallace extended his contract with the Brisbane Broncos until 2012.\nOn 20 October 2008, Wallace was arrested after a scuffle with security at a pub in Mooloolaba, Queensland, where it was believed he was celebrating his 23rd birthday.\nHe was selected for NSW City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. Later in the month he was named in the 17-man squad to represent New South Wales in the opening State of Origin match on 3 June 2009, in Melbourne.\nWallace was injured at the time of Brisbane's 2009 post-Origin slump and upon his return the club enjoyed its best winning streak in five years, reaching the finals. However, in Brisbane's second play-off win Wallace broke his ankle, meaning he would miss the grand final qualifier.\nAt the end of the 2013 NRL season, Wallace was selected to represent Scotland at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup held in Europe.\nReturn to Penrith.\nWallace played for the Penrith Panthers again from the 2014 NRL season. He sustained a season-ending ruptured anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee on 27 July 2014.\nWallace finished off the 2015 NRL season playing 13 games and scoring two tries\nIn 2016, from round 2-8 Wallace had a temporary and successful shift from to hooker. In round 9 of the 2016 NRL season, Wallace kicked the match winning field goal in Penrith's 19-18 win against the Canberra Raiders. Wallace would return to the hooker role after James Segeyaro was dropped to NSW Cup. Wallace played his 200th NRL career game in round 16, against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in Penrith's 28-26 win. Playing well at his new found position, Wallace signed a two-year deal with the club on 25 July 2016, extending his contract with Penrith to the end of 2018. Playing an instrumental part in helping Penrith reach the finals, he finished off the year as the Penrith club's most experienced player and their first-choice hooker. He played in all 26 games scoring five tries, kicking three goals, and one field goal.\nHe played 19 games in 2017 NRL season, scoring two tries.\nOn 12 June 2018, Wallace announced his retirement from the NRL effective immediately. The Penrith club released a statement in which general manager Phil Gould praised the 32-year-old for his \"incredibly selfless act\". Gould also revealed Wallace had played the last two seasons with no anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after a failed knee reconstruction. Wallace joined Penrith's coaching staff immediately as he transitioned into life after playing.\nScotland.\nEligible through his maternal grandmother, Wallace was unable to represent Scotland at the 2008 World Cup due to treatment for injuries. \nHe made his international début at the 2013 World Cup, playing at halfback in all four of Scotland's matches.\nWallace was unavailable for the 2016 Four Nations due to an elbow injury sustained at the end of the 2016 NRL season.\nThe following year, Wallace was forced to withdraw from Scotland's 2017 World Cup squad to recover from numerous injuries obtained throughout the 2017 NRL season."

        "title": "Fred Davis (snooker player)",
        "text": "Fred Davis (14 August 1913 – 16 April 1998) was an English professional player of snooker and English billiards. He was an eight-time World Snooker Championship winner from 1948 to 1956, and a two-time winner of the World Billiards Championship. He was the brother of 15-time world snooker champion Joe Davis; the pair were the only two players to win both snooker and English billiards world championships, and Fred is second on the list of those holding most world snooker championship titles, behind Joe.\nDavis' professional career started in 1929 at the age of 15 as a billiards player. He competed in his first world snooker championship in 1937 and reached the final three years later, losing to Joe by 36–37. From 1947, Davis played in five straight finals against Scottish player Walter Donaldson, winning three. When the event merged into the World Professional Match-play Championship in 1952, Davis won five more championships, defeating Donaldson three times and then John Pulman twice.\nDavis won the World Billiards championship twice in 1980, defeating Rex Williams in the May event, and later Mark Wildman in the November event. With the beginning of the snooker world rankings in 1976, Davis was ranked fourth in the world, and remained on the professional tour until 1993 when, aged 80, he retired due to arthritis in his left knee. He died in 1998 after a fall in his home in Denbighshire, Wales.\nEarly life.\nFred Davis was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire on 14 August 1913, the youngest of six children of coalminer-turned-pub landlord Fred Davis and his wife Ann-Eliza. His snooker-playing brother Joe, 12 years his senior, was the eldest of the six siblings. Joe actively discouraged Fred's professional ambitions, telling Fred that he was not good enough to pursue a professional career. Fred learned to play on a miniature table, a Christmas gift from his parents. Fred instead played English billiards which he later called \"his first love\", and he won the British Boys Under-16 Billiards Championship in 1929. In 1929, he turned professional automatically under the rules of the Billiards Association and Control Council. By the time he was ready to play competitive billiards, the sport was in sharp decline, although he did defeat Kingsley Kennerley to win the United Kingdom Professional Billiards Championship in 1951. Davis remarked that, once snooker had come to the fore, he assumed he would never play another billiards match.\nCareer.\nPre-war career.\nAfter a career in billiards in his youth, Davis concentrated on snooker. He first played in the World Snooker Championship in 1937 but lost 17–14 to Welshman Bill Withers in the first round, a defeat that Davis put down to ignoring his worsening eyesight. His brother Joe considered this defeat an affront to the family honour, and hammered Withers 30–1 in the next round. Joe's fury with his brother's performance persuaded Fred to consult an optician, who devised a pair of glasses with swivel lens joints to help his play. He reached the semi-finals in 1938 and 1939 before reaching the final in 1940, losing 36–37. Davis was called up on 20 July 1940 to serve in the British Army for the Second World War, only five days after his wedding.\nPost-war career.\nHaving dominated snooker from 1927 to 1946, Joe Davis retired from the World Snooker Championship after his 1946 victory. Fred reached the final the following year, but lost 62–82 to Scot Walter Donaldson. The pair made up the final for five straight years until 1951, with Davis winning in 1948, 1949 and 1951. Joe Davis had been undefeated in the world championships, but Fred would go on to be the only player to beat Joe on level terms – a feat he achieved four times between 1948 and 1954, despite Joe previously telling Fred that he would never beat him. Snooker remained a huge attraction at this time, and crowds filled Blackpool Tower Circus to see Davis beat Donaldson 84–61 in the 1948 final and 80–65 in the 1949 final. However, times were changing, and from 1950 matches became shorter. Donaldson beat Davis for the last time to win the 1950 title, 51–46.\nAs defending champion, Davis did not play in the 1952 event, which was only contested by two players. Following a disagreement between some of the players and the governing body, Davis played in an alternative tournament – the World Professional Match-play Championship. Davis then won each of the first five championships. Davis won the first three of these events over Donaldson, but when Davis won the 1954 event with a 39–21 victory over Donaldson, it was clear there was a decline in interest as only five players entered the championship; Donaldson then retired.\nAfter defeating John Pulman in two close finals in 1955 and 1956, Davis chose not to play in the 1957 Championship—held in Jersey and, for financial reasons, featuring just four entrants—thus leaving the path clear for Pulman to win the event. After the war Davis and his wife had invested in a hotel in Llandudno, and this gave them some financial security away from snooker. This proved a wise move; by the early 1960s Davis was playing exhibitions in aid of cancer charities, but soon even this limited amount of snooker activity dried up. Following tours of Canada and Australia (where he won an international tournament in 1960) and after an exhibition in Pontefract where he performed in front of only a handful of people, Davis effectively went into retirement. He hardly played for four seasons before being contacted by Rex Williams, who was keen to restart interest in snooker. Under Williams, the championships were resumed in 1964 on a challenge basis. Davis challenged Pulman on three occasions, but lost in 1964 by 19–16, in 1965 by 36–37 and in 1966 by five matches to two.\nModern era.\nThe revival of the World Championship as a single-elimination tournament in 1969 saw Davis defeat future world champion Ray Reardon 25–24 before losing 37–24 to Gary Owen in the semi-finals. Davis's match with Reardon would earn a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest recorded snooker session and Reardon would later note that he learned more from that match than he had in the previous 20 years playing the sport. That same year BBC TV started its \"Pot Black\" series. Davis's familiarity with long matches contested over several weeks in his prime meant he was not immediately suited to the single-frame format of the event; however, he adapted well to it, finishing as runner-up to John Spencer in the 1971 series. He also achieved the highest in the 1970 (54), 1971 (73) and 1975 (87) series.\nSoon after winning a Professional Snooker Association of Canada's Invitation Event, in which he defeated Paul Thornley in the final in May 1970, Davis suffered the first of two heart attacks, and did not participate in the 1970 World Championship, which was held in Australia and won by John Spencer. He lost 31–21 to Spencer in his first match in the 1972 championship, but defeated David Greaves 16–1 in the second round of the 1973 championship before losing to Alex Higgins, the defending champion, 16–14 in the quarter-finals, a match most notable for a leak in the roof which forced rain to stop play while a cover was found and the position of each ball marked.\nDavis gained his revenge in 1974, when he beat Higgins 15–14 in the quarter-finals, having earlier beaten Bill Werbeniuk 15–5. This return match with Higgins also contained a notable incident when the referee, Jim Thorpe, called a in frame 25, a decision to which Higgins vehemently objected, swearing at the referee. Higgins blamed his subsequent defeat on the incident, but never blamed Davis for any part of it, clearly stating his admiration for Davis for playing so well following his second heart attack. Davis, for his part, also praised Higgins for his \"sportmanship\". However, Davis lost 15–3 to eventual champion Reardon in the semi-finals.\nIn 1975, Davis travelled to Australia to compete in the World Championship, where he played Dennis Taylor, but lost by a single frame, 15–14. The 1975 Watney Open in Leeds provided some consolation, and Davis beat Patsy Fagan 13–9 and John Spencer 13–12 before losing 17–11 in the final to Alex Higgins. Davis stated that a win over Spencer convinced him that he could still compete at the highest level of tournament play. World rankings were introduced in 1976. Despite Davis's abilities peaking long before this, he was still ranked number 4 that season. In 1977 Davis was ranked number 9, rising to 6 during both the 1978 and 1979 seasons; he maintained his form as the tour expanded, still being ranked inside the top 16 players in 1982, aged 67, and only falling outside the top 64 in 1988, aged 74. Although Davis lost 15–13 to Eddie Charlton in the quarter-finals of the 1976 World Championship, having beaten Werbeniuk 15–12 in round one, he came close to winning his first professional title for twenty years at the 1976 Pontins Professional. With victories over Willie Thorne, 7–4 in the quarter-finals, and Graham Miles, 7–2 in the semi-finals, he faced Reardon in the final. Davis missed a crucial in the , having made a break of 107 during the match, and Reardon won 10–9.\nHe reached the semi-finals of the 1978 World Snooker Championship, at the age of 64, having defeated John Virgo 9–8, Dennis Taylor 13–9 and Patsy Fagan 13–10. He met Perrie Mans and trailed 14–16, but missed a , which allowed Mans to take the frame, and eventually win 18–16. The crucial missed was watched by his brother Joe, who was taken ill after the miss; he was rushed to hospital to undergo a six-and-a-half-hour operation, but died a few weeks later. This would be the last time Davis would reach the semi-finals of the event. Davis closed 1978 with a quarter-final appearance in the UK Championship. He defeated veteran Yorkshireman John Dunning 9–2 before losing to Alex Higgins 9–4.\nIn early 1979 Davis met Alex Higgins in the final of the Castle Open (an event hosted at Bernard Bennett's club in Southampton). During the World Championship that year he beat Kirk Stevens 13–8 to progress to the quarter-finals. This match was to be his last victory at the Crucible Theatre, but Davis compiled the first century of the championship, a break of 109 in the sixth frame — an effort even applauded by the referee. In the quarter-final against Eddie Charlton, Davis soon fell 5–0 behind; he later admitted that he unwisely played an attacking game. This style enabled him to make a break of 110 in the eighth frame to reduce his arrears from 6–1 to 6–2, but he lost the match 13–4.\nDuring the first World Challenge Cup in 1979 Davis acted as England's captain (the team was completed by John Spencer and Graham Miles). He won his first seven frames as England won matches 8–7 over Northern Ireland and the Rest of the World. England were, however, defeated 14–3 in the final by Wales. Although Davis lost 13–5 to David Taylor in his first match in the 1980 World Snooker Championship, he did reach the quarter-finals of the UK Championship the following season, with a 9–6 victory over Mark Wildman before his 9–6 defeat by Alex Higgins. In 1981, at the age of 67, Davis played in his last snooker final, the Raffles/Sheffield Shield Tournament played at the Sheffield Snooker Centre. He beat Mike Watterson 9–6 and Dennis Taylor 9–5. In the final he led Terry Griffiths 4–1, but eventually lost 9–5. Earlier in the season he played in his last Masters, beating Kirk Stevens 5–4 in the first round before losing to Terry Griffiths 5–2 in the quarter-finals.\nLater years.\nDavis played professionally into old age, making his last appearance in the World Snooker Championship in 1984 aged 70, where he lost to Werbeniuk 10–4. The following year he trailed Canadian Bob Chaperon 7–2 in the fourth qualifying round, but came back to win the match 10–9. Davis showed similar resilience in the 1985 UK Championship qualifying rounds to survive 9–8 against John Rea. He then went on to beat Werbeniuk 9–7 in the first round, having trailed 5–3 at the interval. Davis then lost to Alex Higgins 9–2 in the second round. That same month Davis defeated Billy Kelly and then Kirk Stevens in the Mercantile Credit Classic; Stevens amusingly asked Davis not to retire until Stevens had finally defeated him. Davis would be defeated 5–3 by Eugene Hughes in the fourth round.\nIn the qualifying rounds of the 1988 World Snooker Championship Davis beat Jack Fitzmaurice 10–8 and Jim Bear 10–4 before losing to Australian John Campbell 10–3 in the final qualifying round. This gave Davis a cheque for £3,117, which despite winning the event eight times, was his highest ever in a professional snooker competition. The following year he beat Bernard Bennett 10–4 in the second round of qualifying for the World Championship, it would be his last victory in a championship he had first graced 52 years earlier.\nDuring the 1989–90 snooker season Davis recorded wins over Jimmy van Rensberg and Mike Watterson, but a 10–6 defeat by Ian Brumby in the second round of qualifying for the World Championship meant that he was forced into a 'play-off' to maintain his full professional status where he was defeated 10–5 by Jason Prince. Suffering from arthritis of the knee, Davis limped from the arena to the press conference during which he was given an emotional standing ovation from spectators, players on other match tables and even those on the practice tables, who all ceased playing to acknowledge the moment. At the press conference, Davis announced he was now retired from competitive snooker but would keep playing in UK-based billiard tournaments. However, snooker threw its doors open to all comers and Davis resumed his snooker career, but played little competitive billiards thereafter.\nDuring the 1990–91 snooker season he recorded his final professional snooker victories at the Mercantile Classic. In the preliminary round he beat veteran Southampton professional Bernard Bennett 5–1 and Tony Wilson 5–4 on the same day. In the next round he lost 5–2 to Rex Williams in a match which saw 99 years of professional experience between the two players. As a former World Champion, Davis was invited to compete in the 1991 World Masters, where he lost to Steve Davis 0–6. This was Fred's last TV appearance in a competitive match. At the age of 79, Davis played in the preliminary rounds of the 1992 Grand Prix, losing 5–1 to the 17-year-old Ronnie O'Sullivan.\nBilliards.\nDavis won the World Billiards Championships in June 1980, beating Rex Williams 5978–4452, and in so doing became the only player except for Joe Davis to have lifted both the World Snooker and World Billiards titles. However, he was quick to point out that standards differed markedly from those of the 1930s when the top players made such large breaks that they killed the game as popular entertainment. He received £1500 plus a cheque for £500 for the highest break (583); this was presented to him by 94-year-old Willie Smith, World Billiards champion in 1920 and 1923. Davis also retained the title later in November the same year, when the championship was restored to a knock-out basis for the first time since 1934. Davis beat Paddy Morgan 1907–978, John Barrie 1253-1153 and Mark Wildman 3037–2064 in the final to pocket £4000, then a record for a billiards event.\nThe modest billiards revival continued during the 1980s. In March 1982 he was defeated by a record narrow margin of six points in the semi-finals whilst defending his world title, as eventual champion Rex Williams beat him 1500–1494. In the 1983 event he beat Clive Everton and Eddie Charlton \"en route\" to the final where he lost to Rex Williams 1500–605, but took the highest break prize for an effort of 427. Also revived (from 1979) was the United Kingdom Professional Billiards Championship. Although Davis lost the title 1548–1031 in the semi-final of the 1979 event (to John Barrie) Davis looked likely to reclaim the title in 1983 when, having dispatched Ian Williamson and Ray Edmonds, he led Mark Wildman 750–477 after the first session of the final. However, Wildman recovered to take the title by 1500–1032.\nIn the 1984 World Billiards Championship Davis lost to Eddie Charlton 1436–829 in the semi-finals. After this time billiard events increasingly changed structure to a series of games of 400 or 150 points. Davis was less happy with this structure; with this and with his advancing years, he fared less well at the game after this time. In the 1985 World Championship he defeated Clive Everton 3–1 in round one, but fell 3–0 to Australian Robby Foldvari in the quarter-finals. The following year (still seeded third) he lost 3–0 to Bob Close, who was making his professional debut. In 1987 he reached the quarter-finals of both the UK Billiards Championship and the World Championship, but lost on both occasions to Robby Foldvari. Davis's last entry in the World Billiards Championship came in 1992, but with the main competition to be played in India, he did not play his first-round match against David Barton. Davis did enter the 1993 UK Billiards Championship, but did not play his first-round match against Ian Williamson and he also scratched from the Radiant Grand Slam Second Leg where he was due to play David Edwards that same month.\nRetirement and death.\nDavis was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977. Davis (accompanied by his wife Sheila) was presented with the award by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at Buckingham Palace. Davis retired in 1993, aged 79, having lost to future world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan 5–1 in the Grand Prix qualifying during his last season. Davis lost 10–1 to Peter Daubney in the first round of qualifying for the 1992 World Snooker Championship. Four months later he lost 5–0 to Mark King in the sixth round of qualifying for the 1993 event; it was Davis' last World Championship match. His last competitive snooker match came in August 1992 when he lost 5–1 to Neil Tomkins in the 1992 European Open.\nOn 14 August 1993 Davis turned 80, and still held a ranking of 259. He said then that he would have loved to continue playing, but was prevented from doing so by the severe arthritis in his left knee which made it painful to walk. Indeed, it was Davis' attempt to redistribute his stance which contributed to such heavy defeats in his final snooker matches. He died in April 1998 in Denbighshire, three days after a fall at his home.\nControversy.\nAt the end of 1988 Davis spoke out against the governing body and its running of the game. His comments followed the convening of disciplinary action against him following his withdrawal from the Mercantile Credit Classic qualifying competition the previous May. Davis withdrew because of intense discomfort caused by his arthritis and confirmed his withdrawal twice with the tournament director, David Harrison. Davis was furious that his unblemished 60-year career had been called into question by a disciplinary board and took up his case via association member Ian Doyle. Doyle offered an apology, but no official apology was given. Davis stated that the WPBSA was more interested in thinking of ways to get at Barry Hearn, rather than acting in a constructive manner and accused the WPBSA of trying to buy off lower-ranked players to \"get them on their side against Hearn\".\nCareer titles.\nA list of Davis's professional snooker and billiards championships is shown below."

        "title": "George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)",
        "text": "George Wilson (May 9, 1942 – July 29, 2023) was an American professional basketball player. Wilson played as a center for the Cincinnati Royals, Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics, Phoenix Suns, Philadelphia 76ers, and Buffalo Braves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1964 to 1971. Before turning professional, he played college basketball for the Cincinnati Bearcats and won a gold medal in the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nEarly life.\nWilson was born in Meridian, Mississippi, on May 9, 1942, and grew up on the west side of Chicago. He attended Marshall High School and led the Commandos basketball team as a center to four straight appearances in the Chicago Public League, winning the Illinois state championships in 1958 and 1960.\nAs a senior, he was named a high school All-American after three seasons of averaging 25, 27, and 26 points per game, and in 1960 he was the inaugural winner of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Player of the Year award. Wilson was named All-State three years. He was named to the \"Parade\" All-America Boys Basketball Team's third team in 1959 and the first team in 1960.\nCollege career.\nRecruited by many colleges, he chose to attend the University of Cincinnati primarily because of his admiration of Bearcats star Oscar Robertson. As a sophomore in his first year on the varsity in 1961–62, he broke into the starting lineup for Ed Jucker's Bearcats in the 14th game, and for the season he averaged 9.2 points per game. The Bearcats were co-champions of the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) and posted a record of 29–2, capping off the season by winning the NCAA championship game over Ohio State 71–59, the Bearcats' second consecutive national title.\nAs a junior in 1962–63, Wilson led the Bearcats with 11.2 rebounds per game, a .505 field goal percentage and 1.4 blocked shots to go with 15.0 points per game. He was named All-MVC, and he was named second-team All-American by \"The Sporting News\" and Converse. The Bearcats went 26–2, again won the MVC and advanced to the NCAA championship game for the third consecutive season, but they were beaten by Loyola University Chicago in overtime, 60–58.\nIn his senior season of 1963–64, Wilson (who was team co-captain with Ron Bonham) again led the Bearcats in rebounding with 12.5 per game, field goal percentage at .535 and blocked shots with 1.7 per game. He set a new Bearcats record with eight blocked shots in a game against Dayton. He also scored 16.1 points per game as he was again named All-MVC. The Bearcats finished the season 17–9.\n1964 Olympics.\nWilson was a member of the 1964 U.S. Olympic basketball team, which went undefeated and won the gold medal.\nNBA career.\nThe Cincinnati Royals selected Wilson with their territorial selection in the 1964 NBA draft. In November 1966, the Royals traded Wilson to the Chicago Bulls for Len Chappell. He played as a backup for the Bulls, focusing on defense and rebounding.\nThe Seattle SuperSonics acquired Wilson from the Bulls in the 1967 NBA expansion draft. He played as a reserve forward for the inaugural SuperSonics and averaged 6.1 points per game. The following year, the Phoenix Suns acquired Wilson from the SuperSonics in the 1968 NBA expansion draft.\nPlaying for the Suns, Wilson saw the most playing time of his professional career and averaged 11.6 points per game and 12.3 rebounds per game with them. However, in January 1969, the Suns traded Wilson to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jerry Chambers. He played for the 76ers as a reserve while Lucious Jackson was injured. The Buffalo Braves selected Wilson from the 76ers in the 1970 NBA expansion draft. He retired from the NBA in 1971.\nPersonal life.\nWilson graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1964 with a degree in education. He was also a member of the Beta Eta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.\nIn 2006 Wilson was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100th anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. In 2010 Wilson was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame.\nWilson worked as a YMCA director and lived in Fairfield, Ohio. He competed in the Senior Olympics in golf, basketball, and horseshoes.\nWilson died on July 29, 2023, at age 81.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "Golf in Australia has been played in Australia since 1839. The Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Tour of Australasia is the main men's tour in Australia. In women's golf, the ALPG Tour has operated since 1972.\nGoverning body.\nGolf Australia is the national sporting body that runs golf in Australia. It was formed in 2006 as a merger of the Australian Golf Union (AGU) and Women's Golf Australia (WGA). The state golf associations are Golf New South Wales, Golf Northern Territory, Golf Queensland, Golf South Australia, Golf Tasmania, Golf Victoria and Golf Western Australia.\nTournaments.\nThe PGA Tour of Australasia is the main men's tour in Australia. It was founded in 1973 as the PGA Tour of Australia, and changed to its current name in 1991. The tour is one of the five charter members of the International Federation of PGA Tours, making it a 1st tier tour. In 2007 the tour has a schedule consisting of 12 events, but only three of them are sole-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia. The PGA Tour of Australasia's development tour is the Von Nida Tour.\nAustralia's premier golf tournament and national Open is the Australian Open, run by Golf Australia, which has been held since 1904. Other tournaments include the Australian PGA Championship, which has been held since 1929, and the Australian Masters, held from 1979 to 2015.\nIn women's golf, the ALPG Tour has operated since 1972. It became a member of the International Federation of PGA Tours in 2009 when that organisation expanded to include all of the major women's tours. In its most recent season, 2011–12, the tour consisted of 12 events. The two richest are respectively the Ladies Masters, held since 1990, and the Women's Australian Open, held since 1974. Both events are co-sanctioned with the Ladies European Tour, and since the 2012 edition, the Women's Australian Open has also been co-sanctioned by the U.S. LPGA Tour.\nIn addition to regular tournaments, Australia has hosted the 1998 Presidents Cup, 2001 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, 2007 Lexus Cup, 2011 Presidents Cup and 2013 World Cup of Golf. The 2016 World Cup of Golf was scheduled to be played in Melbourne.\nAustralia's top golfers, whether male or female, generally move to more lucrative tours—the European Tour or the U.S. PGA Tour for men, and the Ladies European Tour or the U.S. LPGA Tour for women—at the first opportunity.\nThe Australian Amateur Championships for men and women is the premier amateur event in Australia run by Golf Australia. Hundreds of golf clubs across Australia also participate in nationally organised amateur events at their local clubs. The most popular are Handiskins (Individuals), and the Volkswagen Scramble (Teams), where amateur golfers with varying handicaps compete at club-sanctioned events for club prizes and qualification to contest national championships.\nHistory.\nThere are several claims for the earliest golf played in Australia. To date there is only one claim with contemporaneous evidence. This primary source evidence comes from ten entries in 1839 in the diary of Alexander Brodie Spark. These show that golf was played in 1839 at Grose Farm, which is now part of urban Sydney. Spark and his friends instituted the New South Wales Golf Club on 1 June 1839, but the Club and the golf at Grose Farm had very short lives and there is no direct connection to the current New South Wales Golf Club. Spark was a wealthy merchant, a well connected and well respected member of colonial society, and can be considered as a reliable witness. Golf at Grose Farm was strongly influenced by Royal Blackheath Golf Club in England.\nThe NSW Golf Club (no continuous connection to the present NSWGC) and Grose Farm are the first golf club and first golf course in Australia. The oldest club and course in continuous existence are different. Determining them is difficult and there is no consensus. The oldest continuous surviving club is believed to be The Australian Golf Club in Sydney. The members met as an informal club in 1882/83 and the Club was formally constituted in 1884, but the Club lost its home course from 1888 to 1895. They may or may not have played elsewhere. They continued to exist as a legal entity by keeping their bank account open and in credit. When they resumed playing, at a new course in Queens Park, they played for the same trophies as in 1884. Their Cadogan Cup is the oldest golf trophy played for in Australia.\nAs a result of The Australian Golf Club's lack of a course for a period, the Royal Melbourne Golf Club maintain that they are the oldest golf club in Australia 'without interruption'. Other claims are made for early golf played at the Ratho estate at Bothwell, Tasmania, though these are now believed to relate to Bothwell district in general in the 1860s. Contemporary evidence dates the Ratho course to the early 20th Century.\nApart from the references below, The Brassie of February 2015 and November 2015, contains articles with further on early golf history in Australia.\nPlayers.\nAustralians have won a total of 27 majors in men's and women's competition.

His single game from the interchange bench was against the Sydney Roosters in a brief but impressive debut.\nAtkins came on midway through the second spell and was subsequently smashed in two massive tackles from Roosters enforcer Adrian Morley with his first two touches. The lightweight winger or fullback made the mistake of carting the ball straight up at one of the hardest hitters in the NRL but got straight to his feet on both occasions to his credit.

I knew he has been one of the toughest kids I have been watching for two years so he obviously relished his opportunity but he left his step on the bench\". \"He definitely gave the players a lift when he went on,' Kemp said. \"They took one look at him - the kid's only 80kg - and he didn't take a backward step. This is what we are trying to build.\"\nLater that year he also represented both Auckland and New Zealand 'A' against a Jim Beam Selection.\nIn 2005 he was part of the New Zealand Universities side that won the Student World Cup in Australia. Atkins attended AUT University.\nIn 2006 he represented New Zealand Maori at the Pacific Cup.\nIn 2008 he joined the Auckland Vulcans in the NSW Cup."

He played 71 games in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, Edmonton Oilers, and New York Rangers between 1995 and 1999. He played right wing/centre and shot right-handed.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur career.\nGrowing up in New Brunswick, Fraser played with the Moncton Minor Hockey Association and was recognised as a First Team National Midget All-Star. Despite growing up in Moncton, he chose to play with the Notre Dame Hounds in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League in order to improve his skills. In his senior year, he helped the Hounds reach the regional championships. He scored four goals, including the game winner, to help them clinch the Air Canada Cup trophy, Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association midget AAA championship, and the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League regular-season title.\nUpon graduating from high school, Fraser began his collegiate career with Dartmouth College in the ECAC Conference. In his freshman season, Fraser ranked second among team rookies with 10 goals and 10 assists for 20 points. He was subsequently drafted in the 9th round, 193rd overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. He was also named to the All–ECAC Hockey Rookie Team for 1990–91. After being drafted, Fraser returned to Dartmouth where he experienced a disappointing 1991–92 season. The Big Green struggled to win games and they experienced an 16-game losing streak that Fraser helped snap on February 10, 1992. He subsequently finished the season with 11 goals and seven assists for a career-low 18 points. Despite this, he was still the Big Green's leading scorer.\nFollowing the disappointing 1991–92 season, Fraser bounced back and had a career year during the 1992–1993 season. Although he began the season on a slow start, he experienced a resurgence during the back half of the season and began putting up points. By February 12, 1993, Fraser ranked fifth among all league scorers with 22 points through ECAC games and 28 overall. By early March, he had accumulated 20 goals and 22 assists for 38 points and was subsequently named Team MVP. His 19 goals in ECAC play ranked him second in the entire conference. Fraser finished the season with 44 points in 26 games to clinch the team's top scorer award and earn ECAC Second Team All-Ivy honors. His efforts helped the Big Green finish with an 11–6 record, their best record since 1979–80, and he spent the summer training with the Canada men's national ice hockey team.\nUpon returning to Dartmouth for the 1993–94 season, coach Roger Demment praised Fraiser for improving every aspect of his game during the summer. He began the season by tallying six goals through his first seven games, including a hat-trick in an 11–4 win over the University of Vermont on November 22, 1993. As a result of his successful start to the season, Fraser participated in the Spengler Cup with Team Canada. He subsequently became the first Big Green player to compete at the highest level of international play since Carey Wilson in 1984. Upon returning from the competition, Fraser became the first Big Gren player in 13 years to record their 50th career collegiate goal. In February, he became the first Dartmouth player since 1984 to reach the 100 points milestone in his collegiate career. Despite his efforts, the Big Green were eliminated from playoff contention.\nProfessional.\nAfter college Fraser joined the Canadiens' minor league affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens. He played two seasons in Fredericton, including a productive 1995–1996 campaign, where he scored 74 points in 58 games. This play allowed Fraser to make his NHL debut with the Montreal Canadiens that year, appearing in 14 games and scoring 2 points. Fraser began the 1996–1997 season with the Fredericton Canadiens but was traded to the Calgary Flames early in the season. Fraser played the majority of the season with the Saint John Flames, scoring 32 points in 37 games.\nFraser signed with the Edmonton Oilers for the . He played the majority of year in the minors, with the Hamilton Bulldogs, where his play allowed him to return to the NHL with the Oilers for the last few months of the season. Once up with the Oilers, he scored 23 points in 29 games and earned a full-time spot with the Oilers for the playoffs, appearing in 11 games and scoring 2 points.\nFraser signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers for . He appeared in 28 games with the Rangers, scoring just 6 points, and was sent to the Hartford Wolf Pack for the remainder of the season, scoring 37 points in 36 games with that club.\nFollowing the 1998–99 season Fraser retired from hockey.\nAfter retirement, he earned an MBA at Babson College."

His older brother, Lawrence, followed his lead shortly afterwards. Joe served in the Army in France during the war. Because the brothers held an honorable discharge from the Army, they were entitled to automatic US citizenship and on March 17, 1920, just five weeks before playing in the 1920 Summer Olympics, they both became naturalized Americans.\nHe was the captain and a forward on the 1920 American ice hockey team, which eventually won the silver medal. He returned to Pittsburgh and played for the Yellow Jackets until March 30, 1922. He was one of the leading scorers in the amateur ranks throughout his career. The January 23, 1922 issue of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" described McCormick as \"one of the cleanest and fairest players to ever don a uniform\". The \"Post-Gazette\" also stated that he had one of the most powerful shots in hockey, \"shooting past goaltenders from 50 feet away\". He later ended his career with the Portland Rosebuds in 1925. On October 7, 1925, McCormick was traded to Portland along with Bobby Trapp in exchange for Eddie Shore and Art Gagne."

The race consisted of 20 stages, starting in San Pellegrino Terme on 18 May and finishing Bolzano on 7 June. There was one time trial stage and a single rest day. Eddy Merckx of the Faemino team won the overall general classification, his second victory. Italians Felice Gimondi (Salvarani) placed second, 3 min and 14 s slower than Merckx, and Martin Van Den Bossche (Molteni) was third, nearly five minutes behind Merckx.\nTeams.\nA total of 13 teams were invited to participate in the 1970 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 130 cyclists. Out of the 130 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 97 riders made it to the finish in Bolzano.\nThe teams that took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did feature the previous year's winner Felice Gimondi (Salvarani). Despite an initial unwillingness to participate relating to his expulsion the year before, Eddy Merckx chose to enter the race after the race organizers agreed to send all doping controls to Rome rather than conduct them in a van that moved with the race. Merckx entered as the primary favorite to win the race. He entered the race having already won several races that season including: Paris–Nice, Paris–Roubaix, and La Flèche Wallonne, among others. \"Le Confédéré\" felt that Merckx's greatest challenge would come not from Italian riders, but the Belgian Walter Godefroot (Salvarani). Godefroot was thought to be the leader for the Salvarani team as Gimondi entered the race in poor form. Gianni Motta was absent from the race as he was recovering from a knee operation earlier in the season.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was revealed on 31 March 1970 by race director Vincenzo Torriani. The race covered across twenty stages and one rest day. Compared to the previous edition, the 1970 edition was shorter and included only four stages longer than with stage 14 being the longest at . In April, the route was announced to have nineteen categorized climbs that awarded points towards the mountains classification, while the final route included seven more categorized climbs. In total, were climbed.\nSan Pellegrino Terme hosted the race's start and then it travelled west, visiting the Alps before turning south and then east towards Treviso. A transfer then occurred to Terracina and the race moved north along the coast. The race made its way to the Dolomites for three stages before finishing in Bolzano. The route did not visit Milan for the first time in race history.\nThe route featured less transition stages than in previous years, which was thought to allow for more action in the race.\nClassification leadership.\nTwo different jerseys were worn during the 1970 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a cyclamen jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15. Before the start of the 1970, Termozeta replaced Dreher Brewery as the sponsor of the points classification and so the color of the leader's jersey changed from red to cyclamen. The mountains classification leader. The climbs were ranked in first and second categories, the former awarded 50, 30, and 20 points while the latter awarded 30, 20, and 10 points. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. In addition there was the \"Cima Coppi\", the Passo Pordoi, which was the highest mountain crossed in this edition of the race, which gave 200, 100, 80, 70, and 50 points to the first five riders summit the climb. The first rider over the Passo Pordoi was Luciano Armani. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time."

The club has four senior XIs playing Saturday sides that compete in the Cheshire County Cricket League of which the 1st XI is in the ECB Premier League.\nHistory.\nThe first game at Boughton Hall was played 20 May 1873. \nIn the 1870s Boughton Hall was a large private house standing in spacious grounds. The owner of the time, Mr John Thompson, acquired a taste for cricket on his scholastic travels which took him to Rossall School and then Cambridge. Thompson, upon his return, converted part of the Hall's grounds into a cricket field to which he invited friends to play, under his captaincy, as Boughton Hall Cricket Club. Early games were against local teams such as Eaton Park Club, 22nd regiment and Arnold House. Liverpool and Warrington also visited and played host to the ‘Hall but generally came second place to a club which was quickly established as the envy of the area. Even in these early days fixtures were commonplace against the likes of Huyton. Oxton, New Brighton and Birkenhead Park.\nIn the 1880s the club, now run by a committee and levying subscriptions, went from strength to strength and began to run a second XI. At this time there was a Chester and District League which accommodated teams such as Tattenhall, Bunbury, Chester City, Saltney, Buckley, St Oswald's and Flint. Boughton Hall, however, played teams further afield and in 1887 the inaugural fixture against Neston was played.\nFixtures played in 1900 included: Bootle, Neston, Western, Wrexham, Winnington Park, Warrington, Llandudno, Northern, Knutsford, Birkenhead Park, Eaton Park and Rock Ferry. Fixtures ran from 28 April to 8 September."

        "title": "West Central Lacrosse League",
        "text": "The West Central Senior Lacrosse League (WCSLL) is a men's Senior C amateur box lacrosse league sanctioned by the British Columbia Lacrosse Association in Canada.\nOfficially named the West Central Senior 'C' Lacrosse Association, it is usually referred to as the \"West Central League\" or just simply the \"'C' League\" and consists of nine teams based in cities located in the Greater Vancouver area — all playing the majority of their games from a central venue located at Port Coquitlam Arena. The league schedule is typically contested from mid-April until early August.\nLeague history.\nHarry George Woolley founded the West Central Lacrosse League (WCLL) in fall 2002. Earlier in 2002, while being commissioner of the West Coast Senior Lacrosse Association (WCSLA) Senior B league, Woolley saw 55 players cut with nowhere to play. He completed the necessary paperwork and helped organize the WCLL get off the ground.\nThe vision Woolley had in establishing the West Central Lacrosse League (WCLL) was to create a recreational league that any lacrosse enthusiast could join.\nOriginal Teams.\nThe West Central League started play in 2003 with four teams: the Abbotsford Attack, Port Coquitlam Hitmen, Port Moody Express, and Vancouver Vipers.\nThe Port Coquitlam Hitmen were founded by Scott Parsons. The Port Moody franchise originated after the 2002 Alcan Cup in Vernon. The Port Coquitlam Knights Senior B team, which was started by David George Wisniewski and Edward Gosse. The Knights wete a ragtag team of friends that included the likes of Keith Armstrong, Julian Brambleby,Terry and Bill Mosdell, Jim Steedsman, Ritchie and Troy Baker, Sennan Joseph,Harry Preston, Mike O Reilly, David Bensmiller and Scott Parsons.This gang of misfits, that loved game came together for an Alcan cup Senior B tournament in Prince George BC. The Knights walked away with a not so, so surprising Bronze medal. The next year the Knights journeyed to Vernon for a as a 12-team tournament as they did the year before in Prince George, realized that things needed to change.David Wisniewski told Glen \"Moose\" Scott (Prince George senior lacrosse commissioner) at the Alcan Cup tournament that he would be putting a Port Moody Senior C team in for the next year's Alcan Cup. The West Central League originally excluded Port Moody from the league; Surrey, Abbotsford, Vancouver and Port Coquitlam being the original teams. Port Moody, despite having a full roster and financial support, was told that this was a four team league at the league's first meeting. Surrey then later backed out and Port Moody stepped in to take their place. The original proposed name for the team was the Port Moody Beasts, but this was soon dropped in favour of the Port Moody Express. The Abbotsford Attack were started by Cam Janzen and Tom Potter as they wanted to have a box team for all the Abbotsford field players to keep their skills up over the off-season. Terry(the maniac) Kirstiuk was responsible for founding the Vancouver Vipers (named after the former Vancouver Senior B team from the late 1990s), a squad which struggled through its first season with short-benches and an inexperienced roster.\nSeasons.\n2003.\nThe first league match was played on May 10, 2003, a 9-9 tie in which Kelly Scott of Abbotsford Attack scored the league's first goal (against Port Coquitlam Hitmen). Port Moody Express and Port Coquitlam Hitmen were the dominant teams during the inaugural season, finishing 1st and 2nd respectively in the regular season standings and both met in the playoff finals with Port Coquitlam defeating Port Moody 12-10 in overtime to win the Gale Lloyd Trophy — symbolic of the league's playoff championship. In the league's consolation bronze game, the Vancouver Vipers, who went winless during the regular season, pulled off a 7-4 upset to defeat the Abbotsford Attack.\n2004.\nThe 2004 regular season basically saw a repeat finish of the previous year, although Port Coquitlam finished tied for points with Abbotsford. Vancouver Vipers picked up its first and only win of the regular season at the expense of Port Coquitlam. Port Moody and Port Coquitlam met again in the playoff championship, with the game going into overtime but this time Port Moody walking away with the Gale Lloyd trophy in an exciting 9-8 victory. Abbotsford defeated Vancouver 11-7 in the re-match for the bronze medal game.\nOne major change which occurred prior to the 2004 campaign was the adoption of one central arena location in Port Coquitlam for all games regardless which teams were playing. In the inaugural season, a different team would host games each weekend at their own home arena. Players complained about the travel (especially back-to-back Saturday-Sunday games played in Abbotsford and Vancouver-Kerrisdale) and confusion over scheduling locations, so the decision was made to centralize everything out of Port Coquitlam Arena. Since then, just over 80% of all league games have been played at Port Coquitlam Arena — with the remainder rescheduled elsewhere when not available.\n2005.\nOn February 23, 2005 the North Shore Indians from North Vancouver were approved and joined as the league's first expansion team. Port Coquitlam and Port Moody met yet again in the playoff finals — this time Port Coquitlam taking the trophy home with a 10-8 win.\nIn October 2005, during the off-season, Vancouver's executive decided to rename the team the Burrards to keep in line with all other Vancouver box lacrosse teams from minor up through to senior level.\n2006.\nIn 2006, the league's fourth campaign, Port Moody dropped the unpopular PoCoMo moniker and proceeded to shellshock the league with its 10-0 start. Port Moody walked away with the championship in an easy 11-3 win versus North Shore, while Abbotsford took the bronze against Vancouver.\nDespite the overwhelming dominance of Port Moody (who went on to win the Alcan Cup Invitational Senior C Championship held in Prince George and then capped it up the following week with winning British Columbia Senior C provincial championships in Richmond and New Westminster), the league saw the closest parity and balanced play between teams since the league started.\n2007.\nThe first half of the 2007 season was fairly close, as on any given day depending on who showed up any team could beat another. As the season progressed however, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, and North Shore were able to fortify themselves prior to the roster deadline with signing cuts to boost their fortunes in the standings as Abbotsford and Vancouver slid downwards from remaining with pretty much the same intact rosters for the entire season.\nIn the bronze medal game played the following day, the Abbotsford Attack held a 7-4 lead after forty minutes but then the Indians mounted yet another of their third-period comebacks. Abbotsford were able to hang on for a 9-8 victory over the North Shore Indians.\nThe championship game featured the fourth time the Port Moody Express and Port Coquitlam Hitmen had met in the finals — and once again it was an interesting and exciting game. Port Coquitlam held narrow 1-goal leads after each of the first two period, but Port Moody were then able to outscore the Hitmen 6-4 in the third-period to win the championship 15-14.\nThe following weekend, four teams traveled to Prince George to compete in the British Columbia Senior 'C' Provincial and Alcan Cup tournaments. In a tournament which none of the host teams were able to make the finals, Port Moody Express and Port Coquitlam participated in the provincials with Port Moody losing to Kelowna Raiders (Okanagan Xtreme League) in the gold medal game. In the Alcan Cup, North Shore Indians and Vancouver Burrards finished ahead of their Prince George opposition to meet for the gold medal, with the Indians taking the gold 10-4 in the championship game.\n2008.\nOn February 21, 2008 the league expanded when the West Van Outlaws from West Vancouver were accepted into the league as its sixth team. Along with the new team, the regular season schedule was increased from 12 to 15 games and the playoff final made into a best-of-three series. Expansion required the league to change its scheduling so that its Saturday night double-headers involving four teams became triple-headers involving all six teams and the bye weeks eliminated.\nPort Moody Express and Port Coquitlam Hitmen battled neck and neck throughout the season for first place.\nIn the championship finals between Port Moody Express and North Shore Indians, the defending champion Express swept the best-of-three series 10-8 and 12-6 to win the Gale Lloyd Trophy for the third year in a row, and the fourth time in five seasons.\nPort Moody Express and North Shore Indians then traveled the following week to Kelowna to represent the league in the British Columbia Senior 'C' Provincials. Port Moody won all their games in the round-robin section but lost in the gold medal game to the Kelowna Raiders. North Shore finished in third place in the four-team tournament, ahead of Vernon Royals of the Okanagan Xtreme League. In the Alcan Cup, played in Prince George the same weekend, the Vancouver Burrards were unable to repeat their silver medal appearance from the year before, losing to Regina Heat and Prince George BX Pub Bandits to finish in fifth place with a record of 1 win and 2 losses.\n2009.\nThe league saw further change during the off-season when it expanded to eight teams on February 26, 2009. The Coquitlam Cobras and Ladner Pioneers were accepted into the league as expansion teams while the Abbotsford Attack (now devoid of its Ladner-based players) moved across the Fraser River to Maple Ridge to become the Ridge Attack — later going by the name Maple Ridge Attack in 2010.\nPort Moody Express repeated as British Columbia Senior 'C' provincial champions when they defeated the Armstrong Shamrocks and Kelowna Raiders in the three-team provincial tournament held in Armstrong during the August 14–16, 2009 weekend. In the Alcan Cup the following weekend, the Vancouver Burrards travelled to Prince George as the only visiting team entering the five-team tournament. Vancouver—who were reinforced with players picked up from the Port Moody Express and Armstrong Shamrocks—cruised through the round-robin section with a record of three wins and one loss against their Prince George opposition which then advanced them to the gold medal game for the second time in three years. They faced a re-match versus Prince George Shooters Pub Devils, against whom they had lost the previous day, but this time won 8-7 and took home their first Alcan cup title in five years.\n2013.\nThe league expanded back to eight teams in 2013 when Burnaby Lakers and Richmond Roadrunners joined. Vancouver Burrards adopted the North Shore Indians identity and wore their uniforms.\n2016.\nThe league expanded to nine teams in 2016 with the addition of the Mission Cedar Kings. Previously denied use of the Adanacs name when they joined the league in 2009, the Coquitlam Cobras were renamed Coquitlam Adanacs in 2016 to reflect the universal naming of all Coquitlam lacrosse teams from minor programmes through into senior leagues under the Adanacs name starting that year.\nLeague Executive.\nLeague Commissioners\nChairmen of Board of Governors\nSecretaries\nTreasurers\nStatisticians\nProvincial Co-ordinator\nTeam Executives.\nCoquitlam Cobras\nLadner Pioneers\nRidge Attack (Abbotsford 2003–2008)\nPort Coquitlam Hitmen\nPort Moody Express\nVancouver Burrards\nFormer teams.\nNorth Shore Indians (2005–2009)\nWest Van Outlaws (2008–2009)\nRegular season standings.\n\"W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OL = Overtime Losses, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, PTS = Points, AS = Assists, PEN = Penalties, PIM = Penalty Minutes\"\n\"Vancouver forfeited game to Port Moody 1-0 on May 10, 2003\"\n\"PoCoMo forfeited game 1-0 to Vancouver on July 23, 2005.

        "text": "The 2008 IIHF World Championship was played between May 2 and May 18, 2008 in the Canadian cities of Halifax (Nova Scotia) and Quebec City (Quebec). The two venues were the Halifax Metro Centre and the Colisée Pepsi. The tournament was won by Russia which claimed its first gold medal since 1993.\nIt was the 72nd IIHF World Championship event, and was run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It was the first time the final tournament is held in a non-European country since 1962, when it was held in Colorado, USA. The IIHF wanted to celebrate the federation's 100th anniversary by holding the tournament in the country where ice hockey was born. The tournament was also included as part of the celebrations of Quebec City's 400th anniversary.\nThe tournament featured many countries' elite stars, as it served as the last and most important stage in selecting nine automatic qualifiers for the men's hockey competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a process that uses the IIHF World Ranking standings after the tournament.\nOn May 8, 2007, the IIHF announced it \"will also formalize the Triple Gold Club by awarding commemorative medals to the 19 players who have won the three most prestigious championships in world hockey: Olympic gold, Stanley Cup, and World Championship gold. The ceremony will take place in Canada during the 2008 World Championship.\"\nThere were two changes in the format compared to earlier years. Because of the distance between Halifax and Quebec City, the quarter-finals were played within the group, instead of crossing over which has happened since 2000. The relegation round was different too, as it consisted of two best-of-three series instead of a round robin series between four teams.\nFor the first time in 40 years, the matches were played on smaller, NHL size rinks, 200 ft × 85 ft (roughly 61 m × 26 m), compared to the IIHF standard which is roughly 200 ft × 98.5 ft (61 m × 30 m).\nRules.\nFor standing purposes, points shall be awarded as follows:\nIf a game is tied after regulation time, a five-minute four-on-four sudden-death overtime session is played followed by a three-player shootout if necessary. Exceptions: quarter-finals, semi-final and bronze-medal overtime session are 10 minutes and gold-medal game overtime session is 20 minutes.\nIf teams are tied in a standing based on points, the following tie-breakers are applied:\n1) The most points earned in direct games involving tied teams.\n2) The best goal differential in direct games involving tied teams.\n3) The most goals scored in direct games involving tied teams.\n4) Follow steps 1, 2 and 3 with games involving the highest non-tied team in the same group.\n5) Repeat step 4 with games involving the second highest non-tied team in the same group.\n6) Continue this process with all non-tied team games.\nThis was also the first major IIHF championship that used the four-official system with two referees and two linesmen instead of standard three-official system with only one referee.\nPreliminary round.\nSixteen participating teams were placed in the following four groups. After playing a round-robin, the top three teams in each group advanced to the Qualifying round while the last team competed in the Relegation round.\nQualifying round.\nThe top three teams in the standings of each group of the Preliminary round advance to the Qualifying round, and are placed in two groups: teams from Groups A and D compete in Group E, while teams from Groups B and C compete in Group F.\nEach team is to play three games in this round, one against each of the three teams from the other group with which they have been paired. These three games, along with the two games already played against the other two advancing teams from the same group in the Preliminary round, will count in the Qualifying round standings.\nThe top four teams in both groups E and F to advance in quarter-finals.\nRelegation round.\nTeams finishing last in all four Preliminary round groups competed in the Relegation round in order to determine which two nations would be relegated to the IIHF World Championship Division I. The four teams were paired in two best-of-three series.\nFrance defeated Italy, while Slovakia defeated Slovenia, both in 2 games, and secured themselves a place among the top sixteen hockey nations in the world. Italy and Slovenia were relegated to Division I for the 2009 tournament, and will be replaced by Austria and Hungary, the winners of the 2008 Division I tournament.\nRanking and statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top 10 skaters sorted by points, then goals.

In men's major championships the lowest rounds are 62 by Branden Grace at the 2017 Open Championship and by Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele at the 2023 U.S. Open. The lowest officially recorded round is 55 by Rhein Gibson in 2012. In women's major championships the lowest round is 61, held jointly by Leona Maguire, Lee Jeong-eun and Kim Hyo-joo, all at the Evian Championship.\nLowest rounds of golf.\nThe lowest officially recorded round of golf is 55 by Rhein Gibson (12 birdies and two eagles on a par 71) on May 12, 2012, at River Oaks Golf Club in Edmond, Oklahoma. This score is recognized by the Guinness World Records. Three other rounds of 55 are documented, but these are commonly discounted due to the length of the course or the nature of the round. On August 27, 2020, another was added, as Alexander Hughes shot a 55 in Jenks, Oklahoma, within 100 miles of where Gibson had his best day.\nPossibly the lowest documented round in competitive golf is 57, achieved by (among others) Bobby Wyatt in the 2010 Alabama Boys Junior Championship, and Alex Ross in the 2019 Dogwood Invitational. Ross's round was 15-under-par for the Druid Hills Golf Club course in Atlanta, and included 13 birdies and one eagle.\nLowest rounds in professional competition.\nOther tournaments.\nNotes: \nLowest rounds in men's major championships.\nIn men's major championships the lowest round is 62 which was first recorded by South African golfer Branden Grace in the third round of the 2017 Open Championship.\nMany players have recorded a score of 63. Johnny Miller was the first golfer to shoot 63 in a major and was the only golfer to shoot 63 in the final round to win a major until Henrik Stenson did so as well during the 2016 Open Championship at Royal Troon Golf Club. Greg Norman, Vijay Singh, Brooks Koepka and Tommy Fleetwood are the only golfers to record two rounds of 63 in the majors.\nLowest rounds in women's professional competition.\nOfficial tournaments on major tours.\nThere have been 3 rounds of 58 recorded on the Ladies European Tour, all in the Bloor Homes Eastleigh Classic. These rounds were achieved by Trish Johnson (1990), Jane Connachan (1991) and Dale Reid (1991). This tournament was played on a par 65 public golf course. The lowest Ladies European Tour round on a course with par of minimum 70 has been 61.\nLowest rounds in women's major championships.\nIn women's major championships the lowest round is 61, which has been recorded by three golfers: Leona Maguire, Lee Jeong-eun and Kim Hyo-joo.\nPerfect round.\nA perfect round is a round of eighteen holes where all holes were played on average at one under par (average of birdie on every hole) resulting in a score of 55 on a par 73 course, 54 on a par 72 course, 53 on a par 71 course, and 52 on a par 70 course. \nThere is a philosophy popularized by Pia Nilsson's Vision 54 that concentrates on achieving the perfect round, the basic ideology being that striving for perfection results in better scores even if the goal is not met. Cecilia Ekelundh, who formerly played on the Ladies European Tour, did keep the perfect round on her mind by drawing a 54 on the ball she played in competition."

        "text": "Walter Scott \"Steve\" Brodie (September 11, 1868 – October 30, 1935) was an American professional baseball center fielder. He played in Major League Baseball from 1890 to 1902 for the Boston Beaneaters, St. Louis Browns, Baltimore Orioles (NL), Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles (AL), and New York Giants. Brodie set a 19th-century record by playing in 727 consecutive games. In the mid-1890s, along with Willie Keeler and Joe Kelley, he was part of one of the best outfields of his era.\nEarly life.\nBrodie was the son of Irish immigrant Alexander Brodie, a tailor and a Shakespearean actor. In 1887, Brodie moved to Roanoke, Virginia, where he played in the semiprofessional industrial leagues. That same year, Brodie, 18, met Carrie Henry, 15, and they got married. The couple lived in Roanoke through Brodie's baseball playing career.\nBaseball career.\nBrodie took on the nickname Steve because of the daredevil of the same name, who was said to have survived a jump off of the Brooklyn Bridge. The ballplaying Brodie broke into the major leagues with the Boston Beaneaters in 1890; NL teams sought a high volume of new players that year because they had lost players who jumped to the new Players' League. In 1891, Brodie began a 727-game streak of consecutive games played, the longest such streak in the 19th century.\nBrodie spent several years in the outfield with the Baltimore Orioles of the 1890s. His teammates in the outfield were two future Baseball Hall of Fame members, Willie Keeler and Joe Kelley, giving the Orioles one of the best outfields of the 19th century.\nOn the baseball field, Brodie was known as a jokester with an eccentric personality. Teammates and fans were sometimes taken aback when he recited Shakespearean verse during games or carried on conversations with himself in the outfield.\nIn 1438 games over 12 seasons, Brodie posted a .303 batting average (1728-for-5703) with 886 runs, 191 doubles, 89 triples, 25 home runs, 900 runs batted in, 289 stolen bases, 420 bases on balls, .365 on-base percentage, and .381 slugging percentage. He recorded a .958 fielding percentage primarily as an outfielder but also played several games at second and third base.\nLater life.\nWhen the Federal League emerged as a third major league, Brodie became a scout for the Baltimore Terrapins. The YMCA sent him to France to facilitate recreation programs for U.S. soldiers in World War I. He later served as an administrator at Baltimore's Municipal Stadium. Brodie died in 1935 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Baltimore County."

He played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Orphans, Cleveland Blues / Bronchos / Naps, Chicago Cubs and Brooklyn Superbas. In 1092 games spanning over 12 seasons, McCarthy recorded a .287 batting average with 551 runs, 171 doubles, 66 triples, 8 home runs, 476 RBI and 145 stolen bases. He ended his career with a .947 fielding percentage.\nHis last home run was hit in 1899, and from 1900 to the present no one has had more at-bats without a home run: 2,736. In 1904, McCarthy suffered an unusual injury when he tripped over the broom used by the umpire to clean home plate, and injured his ankle. Soon afterwards, a rule specified that umpires would clean home plate with a whisk broom and store it in their pocket when not in use. On April 26, 1905, McCarthy is the first fielder to throw out three base runners at home plate, achieving the feat against the Pittsburgh Pirates. \nHe attended Holy Cross College before joining the major leagues. In 1899, he married Jessie Halpin. After his playing days, he remained in baseball for a time as a minor league manager, then took other jobs, being listed in 1930 as a clerk in a Chicago probate court."

He was drafted in the eighth round of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams.\nThree times Stewart was drafted in baseball but he finally opted for pro football after an outstanding career with the Fresno State U., Bulldogs. The Rams, who have been less than astute with their higher draft picks, did themselves proud in grabbing Stewart as an eighth-rounder in 1987. Although a linebacker and pass rusher at BC, Stewart was converted to safety by Fresno coach Jim Sweeney and in that role, has established himself as a fast, hard hitter for the Rams, with aggressiveness that spills over to special team.\nIn 1992, Stewart started all 16 games last season and was second on the team in tackles with 81. He had two interceptions, forced two fumbles and had a sack. He made a reported $270,000 last year and when negotiations on a new contract began this year he argued that he was worth about three times that much.\nThe Rams originally offered a three-year deal worth about $650,000 a year, but by the time Stewart ended his holdout, he had settled for a $1.1 million, two-year deal."

He played college basketball for the Grambling State Tigers and was the Southwestern Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1976. Wright played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Washington Bullets and the Detroit Pistons. He also played for six seasons in Italy. After his playing retirement, Wright joined the Tigers as an assistant coach from 1990 to 1992 and returned as the head coach from 1999 to 2008.\nCollege career.\nWright was a highly recruited prospect while he played at Western High School in Washington, D.C. He chose to commit to the Grambling State Tigers in honor of his mentor Hershell West, who had played for the Tigers and coached Wright when he played at Richwood High School in Louisiana. From 1973–76, Wright was one of the most decorated Grambling players. In 1974, he was named the Southwestern Athletic Conference Freshman of the year. He was also a two-time All-SWAC selection for the remainder of his career, and a two-time first team NCAA Small College All-America. He led the university to the 1976 SWAC Tournament Championship. After being named the SWAC Player-of-the-Year in 1975–76 as a junior, he decided to declare for the 1976 NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nNBA.\nWright was selected with the 14th pick overall in the 1976 NBA draft by the Washington Bullets. He played a significant part of the Bullets' successful team of the late 1970s, as a substitute. With the Bullets he won an NBA title in 1978 and reached the Finals the next year. After a disappointing season in which they were knocked out from the playoffs by the Philadelphia 76ers, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons, for whom he played only 46 games in two seasons. He decided to move to Italy in 1982 and signed with Banco di Roma.\nSuperstar in Italy.\nWright was an immediate star in Italy. The team finished the regular season in first place and reached the finals series against Olimpia Milano after defeating European champions Ford Cantù in the semi-final series, with homecourt advantage in hand in the final. Roma won the series 2 games to 1 and won its first ever Italian championship. The next season was even greater, as Roma participated in the FIBA European Champions Cup as Italian champions, and Wright provided one stellar performance after another. Roma finished the Final group stage first placed tied with Barcelona, so the two teams qualified for the final game for the European champions cup in Geneva. Wright was the top scorer for his team, of the 79-73 final win, scoring 27 points and leading Roma to its first ever European title in their first finals appearance. Wright was also selected as the European player of the year. Although he had a successful season, Wright left the team after failing to qualify to the Italian playoffs and signed with Fantoni Udine where he played for two seasons. In 1987 he returned to Banco di Roma for one more season.\nCoaching career.\nWright already was a player-coach in his last days in Italy. He was appointed assistant coach at Grambling in 1990 and stayed for office for two seasons. Afterwards he was a scout for the Seattle SuperSonics and the Washington Wizards, and an assistance coach at Ouachita High School in his hometown of Monroe, Louisiana. In 1999 Wright was appointed head coach at Grambling. He was released from his duties in April 2008.\nPersonal life.\nHe is married to Jacqueline Bradford, of Jonesboro, La. in May 1977. They have three children: Larry Jr., Ashana, and Lance. Larry Jr is an NFL scout with the Houston Texans. He also has a daughter named Imani, a standout basketball player in her own right, who graduated high school in 2013, and went on to play college ball at Baylor for her freshman and sophomore years (2013-2015) before transferring to Florida State where she had to sit out a year. All three of Larry and Jacqueline's children were scholarship athletes. Larry Jr. signed at Notre Dame out of high school in 1994 and graduated from Louisiana Tech University (1995–1998), where he was a three-year letterman. Ashana played basketball at Grambling State University (1995–1999), where she was a four-year letter winner on the Lady Tigers basketball team while winning four straight conference championships and never losing a home game in four years. Lance was a three-year starter at offensive center on the Grambling football team (2000–2004)."

        "text": "Gordon Lenear Wood (May 25, 1914 – December 17, 2003) was an American high school football coach in Texas. He was a head football coach for forty-three seasons, winning or sharing twenty-five district championships and nine state championships.\nWood mainly ran a variant of the single wing formation, called \"Warren Woodson Wing T\", named after the former Hardin–Simmons coach whom Wood admired. Though it was primarily a running offense, Wood was ahead of his time because his teams could also pass effectively from it.\nEarly life.\nWood was the fourth son and the youngest of eight children. He grew up in West Texas, mostly in and around Abilene spending most of his childhood picking cotton to help support his family. He decided not to be a cotton farmer at the age of twelve when his family's crops failed and his father moved him to other farms in West Texas and New Mexico to pick and pull cotton. Wood stayed on those farms from late summer until November and didn't start school until December. His father never appreciated education, so Wood didn't start school until he was seven years old. Because his family moved around so much, Wood attended several different schools in and around Abilene before he graduated from Wylie High School in 1934.\nWood was active in sports throughout his education and got his first taste of competition when he played basketball in the sixth grade. In seventh grade, Wood played in the first football game he had ever seen. He misinterpreted the \"fight\" chants at the pep rally, and during the game, he spent most of his time beating up the opponent he was supposed to block. In tenth grade, Wood transferred to Abilene High School because the Wylie school did not suit out a football team. He played football for eight weeks before he succumbed to pressure from his father, who didn't think his son should be wasting time on sports and school, and transferred back to Wylie High School. At Wylie, Wood continued to play basketball and run track. He was an excellent athlete and a starter in both sports.\nIn 1934, Wood was the third fastest runner in Taylor County and was scouted by coach Leslie \"Fats\" Cranfill from Hardin–Simmons University, who offered Wood a partial athletic scholarship to Hardin–Simmons. After some convincing, Wood's father gave him his blessing and set his son up living with a friend in Abilene. Eventually, Wood earned a full scholarship, and the University provided him with room and board. At Hardin–Simmons, Wood played football and basketball, ran track, and boxed in order to maintain his scholarship. Despite nearly flunking out his first semester, Wood did well in college. He was never a star athlete at the university, but he did learn a lot about sports and coaching. It was at Hardin–Simmons that Wood decided he wanted to be a coach.\nSpur and Rule high schools.\nAfter he graduated from Hardin–Simmons in 1938, Wood received his first coaching job as an assistant at Spur High School. He was the assistant coach for football and head coach for track and basketball under head coach, Blackie Wadzeck. Coach Wood coached at Spur for two years when Coach Wadzeck, was promoted to high school principal. Originally the school board offered Wood the head coaching position, but rescinded their offer when they thought a better candidate came into the picture.\nCoach Wood found his first head coaching position at Rule High School in 1940. Rule was already in the midst of a nineteen-game losing streak when Wood took over, and he had a hard time improving their record. He lost the three opening games of the season extending the streak to twenty-two before he earned his first win as a head coach. Rule ended the season with only two wins and eight losses. The next year Wood won the opening game over his old coaching grounds at Spur, but finished the season with only three wins, three losses, and two ties. After two years, Coach Wood finished his first head-coaching job at Rule with a record of five wins, eleven losses, and two ties. Wood was looking forward to a better third season at Rule, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he resigned from his position at Rule and enlisted in the Navy.\nNavy.\nWood initially washed out of the Navy Officer's Candidacy School, but the Navy realized he had training skills, and Wood was made into a chief petty officer. He trained new recruits and traveled around the nation escorting men to training facilities. Wood was able to coach while in the Navy. In 1942, while he was waiting to be called up for duty, the Abilene school district hired Coach Wood on a day-to-day basis, and he was able to coach spring training for seventh and eighth graders. The following fall, while on furlough for a few weeks, Wood was asked to fill in as head football coach at Haskell High School where he is credited with one win. Wood also coached basketball in the Navy using new recruits to form teams. He would often convince men to play for him as they rolled in for training.\nIt was in the Navy that Wood met his wife Katharine. He was spending a night out in San Diego when the two met. Gordon and Katharine courted for two months before they married in January 1945. A few weeks later they were expecting their first child. Their daughter, Patricia Wood, was born in September 1945, just days before Gordon Wood received his discharge.\nRoscoe, Seminole, and Winters.\nBecause he was a schoolteacher before the war, the Navy allowed Wood to discharge early when he found a job as the principal at Roscoe, Texas High School. At Roscoe, Wood taught three math courses, drove the school bus, and coached football, basketball, and track. While coaching at Roscoe, Coach Wood started using his legendary winged-T offensive formation for the football team. In his first year coaching at Roscoe, Wood took his team through an undefeated season and won the district championship only to lose the first game in the state playoffs. The next year, Roscoe lost the opening game of the season, but it was two ties in district play that cost them the district title and kept them out of the 1946 playoffs. Coach Wood ended his career at Roscoe with sixteen wins, two losses, and two ties.\nIn 1947, Coach Wood followed Roscoe's superintendent to become Seminole, Texas High School's head coach. Seminole offered better pay, a larger high school, and a less stressful job. Coach Wood was no longer a principal, had no math courses to teach, and was helped by three assistants. It was at Seminole that Coach Wood first hired Morris Southall to be his assistant coach. The two became lifelong friends and coached together for thirty-one years. In 1947, Seminole won the district championship with nine wins and one loss but lost the first game of the state playoffs. The next season the football team went 6-3-1, followed by a 4-4-2 season in 1949. After the 1949 season, Coach Wood resigned as head coach, leaving Seminole with nineteen wins, nine losses, and three ties. Coach Southall took over as head coach at Seminole, while Coach Wood moved on to Winters High School. At Winters, Coach Wood's football team went 6-4 in 1950, but the poor condition of the gym and neglect from the school board caused him to resign after only one season.\nStamford.\nCoach Wood found his next coaching job at Stamford, Texas High School. His first season in 1951, the Stamford Bulldogs won nine games, but one loss to district rival Anson kept them out of the district championship and the state playoffs. The next year, Stamford went undefeated in the regular season followed by Coach Wood's first ever playoff win. Stamford won two playoff games before losing to Terrell in the state semifinals. Coach Wood ended the 1952 season with thirteen wins and one loss. In 1953, Coach Wood took Stamford through another undefeated season, this time losing to Phillips in the state quarterfinals, and ending the 1953 season with eleven wins and one loss. In 1954, Wood had another winning season when Stamford won nine games, but a loss to Colorado City kept them out of the district championship and the state playoffs. That loss would be the last Coach Wood or Stamford would see for the next couple of years.\nIn 1955, Coach Wood brought Stamford to yet another undefeated season followed by playoff victories. This time Stamford went undefeated in the playoffs ending their season with a 34 to 7 victory over Hillsboro to claim the state championship. The Stamford Bulldogs went undefeated again in 1956, earning Coach Wood back-to-back state championships and extending the team's winning streak to 32 games. The 1957 season started well when three opening victories brought the streak up to 35, but Sweetwater ended Stamford's long years of success with a 24 to 7 victory over the Bulldogs. A second loss to the Seymour Panthers shut out Stamford's hopes for another district title and another shot at the state crown. The next year Coach Wood moved on to Victoria, while Stamford claimed another set of back-to-back championships in 1958 and 1959. Wood ended his career at Stamford with eighty wins and six losses, a 93% winning record.\nVictoria.\nIn 1958, a much better paying job enticed Wood to leave West Texas for the first time as a head coach. He landed in Victoria, Texas, where he reunited with Assistant Coach Morris Southall. That year, Wood also hired Kenneth West as an assistant coach. West had played for Wood at Stamford in 1951. The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was getting paid well in Victoria, making about $10,000, but a lack of fan support and homesickness for West Texas convinced him to move back west. He left Victoria with twelve wins, seven losses, and one tie.\nThe job he really wanted was San Angelo Central, which had just opened after Bob Harrell resigned. However, it eventually went to Emory Bellard, so Wood had to settle for Brownwood.\nBefore they left Victoria, the Wood family decided to add another member. In 1959, Gordon and Katharine decided to adopt a baby. They had been trying for years to have a second child, and while in Victoria, a friend convinced them to adopt. They adopted a newborn baby boy into their family in 1959 and named him Jim Wood.\nBrownwood.\nCoach Wood found his last head coaching position at Brownwood, Texas High School in 1960. Coach Southall followed Wood to Brownwood, and the two finished their careers together with the Lions. A few years later, Coach West would also reunite with Coaches Wood and Southall. West coached for Coach Wood until being promoted to an assistant principal in 1984.\nThe Brownwood Lions had long been on the losing side of the football field, only winning one district championship between 1920 and 1959. 1960 was Coach Wood's first year in Brownwood and he brought the team a 13-1 season. Temple was the only loss the Lions received that year and Brownwood easily claimed the district title for the first time in many years. The Lions went undefeated in the playoffs and won their first state championship, beating Port Lavaca Calhoun 26 to 6 for the state crown.\nIn 1961, Terry Southall, the first of Coach Southall's three sons, suited out for the Brownwood varsity squad. Coach Wood's team won eight games that season with one loss in non-district play, but a tie with Breckenridge also meant a tie for the district title. Breckenridge advanced to the state playoffs on penetrations, while the Lions turned in their gear. In 1962, Brownwood went undefeated in the regular season with Terry Southall leading the way at quarterback. The Lions scored one playoff victory before losing to Dumas 36-18 in the state quarterfinals and ending the season with eleven wins and one loss. 1963 produced a winning season for Brownwood, but two losses to Stephenville and Wichita Falls Rider kept them out of the state finals. The Lions ended the season with eight wins and two losses. 1964 was also a winning season, but seven wins wasn't enough that year. A tie with Graham and two losses to Cleburne and Wichita Falls Hirschi left Brownwood players sitting at home for another playoff series.\nIn 1965, Coach Wood picked up a tip from Coach Pete Elliot and converted his Lions' defense to Elliot's \"Illinois Defense\". The change paid off well, and Brownwood was six games into the season before another team scored. Coach Wood's team won fourteen games to claim the district title and their second state championship without a loss on their record. Si Southall, Coach Southall's second son, joined the Lions' varsity squad the following season in 1966. Southall led the team at quarterback to eight victories, but losses to Abilene Cooper and Vernon cost Brownwood another shot at the playoffs. 1967 proved to be a better year. Brownwood suffered their first loss to Abilene Cooper and tied Wichita Falls Hirschi 21 to 21, but with Si Southall and thirteen returning lettermen leading the way, Brownwood captured twelve more wins and their third state championship before they turned in their gear in December.\nThe 1968 Brownwood Lions opened the season with a loss to Abilene Cooper followed by a win over Fort Worth Trimble Tech and a second loss to Wichita Falls Washington. Brownwood went undefeated in district play and faced Washington again in the district championship game. This time Coach Wood's Lions defeated the Leopards to secure another district title, but Brownwood lost the first game of the playoffs to Lubbock Estacado 49-0, ending their season with nine wins and three losses. 1969 was Coach Wood's tenth season at Brownwood, and he brought the Lions another winning season. Early losses to Abilene Cooper, Woodrow Wilson, and Abilene nearly stopped the Lions, but Coach Wood led the team to an undefeated district season and another district title. Brownwood capped off the season with a 21 to 12 victory over Bonham for Brownwood's fourth state title in Coach Wood's ten-year tenure.\nThe third Southall son, Shae, joined the squad in 1970, and Coach Wood was able to bring him and the other Lions to another winning season. After losing the opening game to Abilene Cooper, Brownwood claimed victories over twelve opponents and won another district title. A tie to Monahans nearly cut Brownwood's playoff tour short, but Brownwood advanced on penetrations and defeated Cuero 14 to 0 to claim the Lions' fifth state crown. This was Coach Wood's second set of back-to-back state championships. After the season ended, the city of Brownwood decided to set aside a special day for Coach Wood. On 1971-05-14, he was honored at a ceremony where he was accompanied by former players, coaches, senators, representatives, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, University of Texas Head Coach Darrell Royal, and even former President Lyndon Johnson, who was the key speaker at the ceremony.\nThe 1971 season opened with two losses to Abilene Cooper and Abilene High, but Coach Wood left no disappointment the rest of the season, and the Lions claimed their fifth straight district title. Coach Wood was able to get his team as far as the state semifinals, where they were defeated 10 to 8 by Plano. In 1972, Brownwood opened their season in the newly built Cen-Tex Stadium. Abilene Cooper upset the stadium's christening with a 27 to 13 victory over the Lions. The next week Sweetwater cost Brownwood another loss. Iowa Park and Burkburnett also defeated the Lions before the season finally ended. Even though Brownwood had a winning season with six wins, those four losses cost them their long held district title and their shot at the state playoffs. In 1973, Brownwood defeated Abilene Cooper for the first time in seven years. The Lions would go on to take nine more victories, but a loss to Wichita Falls Hirschi cost them the state playoffs. The district championship was declared a tie, but because they had defeated Brownwood, Hirschi advanced to the state playoffs.\nIn 1974, Brownwood lost their season opener to Abilene Cooper, but went undefeated the rest of the season to claim the district championship. They won two playoff games before tying Gainesville at 20. Gainesville advanced to the finals on first downs, and the Lions turned in their equipment. In 1975, Coach Wood suited out his son, Jim Wood, at the end position. That year, Brownwood lost their opening game to Abilene Cooper, and a loss to Perryton in district play cost the Lions the district title. The 1977 season fared better. After an undefeated season, the Lions clinched the district title and advanced through the state playoffs only to lose the state championship game to Dickinson, 40 to 28. In 1978, Brownwood lost the opening game to Abilene Cooper, but that game was later forfeited and Brownwood went undefeated the rest of the season to reclaim the district title. Coach Wood led the team to their sixth state championship with an undefeated record of fifteen wins.\nWood opened up the 1979 season with a loss to Abilene Cooper. The Lions suffered a second loss to San Angelo Lake View, but Coach Wood was able to scratch nine more wins on his record to claim the district title. The Lions won their first playoff game only to lose, 15 to 11 to Beaumont Hebert in the state quarterfinals. The next season, Coach Wood lost the opening games to Abilene Cooper and Breckenridge. The Lions would tie another non-conference game to Weatherford at 0 before going undefeated the rest of the season and claiming another district title. 1980 also played another role in Brownwood's history, as Cen-Tex Stadium was renamed Gordon Wood stadium. The Lions inaugurated the stadium's new name with a 34 to 7 victory over Stephenville on October 24. After the regular season, Wood's Lions won the opening round of the playoffs against Wichita Falls Hirschi, but lost to Lubbock Estacado 14 to 0 in the quarterfinals. The Lions turned in their gear with eight wins, three losses, and one tie.\nWood started the 1981 season with a loss to Abilene Cooper, but that would be the only loss the Lions would see that season. Brownwood went on to win thirteen victories to claim another district title and their seventh state championship. The Lions opened up the next season with their first win over Abilene Cooper since 1977. That game was also historical because it was Wood's 366th win, which tied Red Franklin's record set back in 1958. When Brownwood won their next game over Weatherford, Coach Wood became the winningest high school football coach in the United States with 367 wins. Although his team lost to San Angelo Central and another loss to Cleburne (9-3 at TCU's Amon G. Carter Stadium, est attendance of 38,000 fans) cost the Lions their district crown the UIL passed a new rule in 1982, which allowed two teams from each district to advance to the state playoffs. Brownwood took the second place spot, but lost their first game in the playoffs to Gainesville, 14 to 12. Wood's team put away their cleats with nine wins and three losses.\nIn 1983, Coach Wood suffered non-conference losses to Abilene Cooper and San Angelo Central, and a 30-3 home, district loss to the Cleburne Yellow Jackets cost Brownwood's Lions the district title. Wood won the rest of the regular season games that year finishing with eight wins, but Brownwood lost a nail-biter to Vernon 11 to 6 in the first playoff game. Wood took the Lions to six more wins in 1984, but losses to Cleburne, Abilene Cooper, and Everman, and a tie with the Killeen Kangaroos left Brownwood in third place in their conference. The Lions had to sit out the 1984 playoff season. Wood lost three regular season games in 1985 to Killeen, Joshua, and the Cleburne Yellow Jackets. But the Lions tied for second place in their district and made it into the state playoffs. Brownwood defeated Mineral Wells in the first playoff game, but lost to Lubbock Estacado 29 to 28 in the quarterfinals. That was Wood's last game and he ended the season with eight wins and four losses. Wood spent twenty-six seasons at Brownwood before he retired at the age of 71. Altogether at Brownwood, Coach Wood won 15 district championships, 2 co-district championships, seven state championships, and gained a record of 257 wins, 52 losses, and 7 ties, an 82% winning record.\nLegacy.\nCoach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant of Alabama was once asked why he left Texas A&amp;M for the University of Alabama. Bryant said, \"I left Texas A&amp;M because my school called me. Mama called, and when Mama calls, then you just have to come running.\" Bryant had played at Alabama from 1931–1934. Later, Bryant was again asked why he left A&amp;M, and he replied, \"I had to leave Texas. As long as Gordon Wood was there, I could never be the best coach in the state.\"\nWood is remembered throughout the coaching realms as always being a student of football. Former Dallas Cowboys' head coach, Bill Parcells, once told the story of how Wood drove five hours each day for weeks just to watch his Texas Tech linebackers practice. Baylor's former head coach, Grant Teaff, said that Wood once spent the night in his film room just to ask how a particular play had been run. He had also been a major opponent to the \"no pass, no play\" laws of the early 1980s. Wood hardly lost any players after the laws had been passed.\nAfter his retirement, Wood stayed very active in the coaches associations he had become involved with over the years. He gave an abundant number of speeches and is notable for being one of Grant Teaff's Master Coaches in 2002. Over the years, Wood developed several medical conditions including skin tumors, artificial hips, a stroke, and having triple bypass surgery in 1990. He attempted to keep up with his hobbies, but over the years his conditions would no longer allow him to do so. The only hobby Wood would never give up is football. Even after retirement, he would travel across the state to watch high school teams compete on the gridiron. He watched many high school games vigorously until he died in December 2003. Coach Wood suffered from a heart attack and died at the age of 89.\nRecord.\nWood set a state and national record with a total of 396 wins, 91 losses, and 15 ties in 43 seasons as a head Texas high school football coach, an 80% winning record. Over those 502 games, Wood made stops at eight schools and won eleven state championships, nine in football. His first state title came from his 1948 Seminole track team, and his second was his 1954 Stamford golf team. The first two of his nine football state championships came from his 1955 and 1956 Stamford teams. He won seven more at Brownwood in 1960, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1978, and 1981. On top of that he either won or shared 25 district titles.\nWood's original record had been believed to be 405-88-12 (81%). He was awarded for that record at the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, which had inducted him in 1983. Coach Wood was believed to be the only coach to ever achieve four hundred wins, however, the 405 wins record came under scrutiny when researchers found discrepancies in 2001. After corrections were made, the \"Dallas Morning News\" reported that his record had been modified and officially stood at 396-91-15. Since his retirement, four other high school coaches in the US, including Coach G.A. Moore from Sherman, Texas, have broken Coach Wood's 396 wins record.\nAwards and accomplishments.\nOn top of setting the record for most wins in the twentieth century, Coach Wood has received numerous other awards and accomplishments. He coached four Texas All Star Teams: two in 1957 and 1958, and two at the Oil Bowl Classic in 1977 and 1985. His teams won in 1958 and 1977. Coach Wood also gained experience with professional football when he coached the summer camp for the Canadian League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 1972 to 1974.\nThe Texas Sportswriters Association named Wood Coach of the Year three times: 1956, 1970, and 1978. The Texas High School Coaches Association named him their president in 1959 and inducted him into their Hall of Honor in 1967. Hardin–Simmons University presented Wood with the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1979 and inducted him into the Hall of Fame in 1996. In 1979, the National High School Athletic Coaches Association named him the National High School Football Coach of the Year and, in 1996, inducted him into their Hall of Fame . The American Football Coaches Association decided to honor Wood in 1983; the same year he was inducted into the Texas High School Coaches Hall of Fame and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. In 1984, Wood was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame.\nThe Touchdown Club of Houston presented Wood with the Touchdowner of the Year Award in 1986. In 1999, the NCAA presented Wood with the Football Coaches of America Lifetime Achievement Award (Grant Teaff Award). In 1993, Martin Communications Publications named Coach Wood Co-Coach of the Century along with Coach Paul Tyson in their Tops in Texas. In 1999, the \"Dallas Morning News\" named Wood Coach of the Century. Wood liked the name so much, it became the title of his 2001 autobiography, \"Coach of the Century: an Autobiography by Gordon Wood\". Of all the honors Coach Wood has received, his personal favorite was having Brownwood's football stadium named for him in 1980. Wood had been deeply involved in building the stadium. He was also the best coach of Texas high school football ever."

        "text": "The Billiards World Cup Association (BWA) was a governing body for three-cushion carom billiards which organized and marketed the Three-Cushion World Cup from 1985 to 1999. It was subordinate to the Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB).\nHistory.\nThe idea.\nIn 1985, the \"BC 1921 Elversberg\", a German carom billiards club, ordered four new carambolage tables from the Belgian company \"Deque.\" They expected to be able to negotiate the price a few percent down, however \"Deque\" did not agree, but instead, made the suggestion that their official representative, Raymond Ceulemans could hold a demonstration at the inauguration. The club did not hesitate and accepted the offer, since it was rather uncommon to get the then 32-time world champion in three-cushion as a private entertainer.\nThe show was held on 18 December 1985. For the first time, the club had specially built grandstands. The stands were full as Ceulemans and Klaus Bosel played. After the expected win of Ceulemans’ by more than 50 points, he entertained the crowd with some artistic trick shots before dinner.\nSince it was getting late and restaurants were no longer open, Bosel, Ceulemans, and Werner Bayer (former billiards club president) decided to go to Bosel's home, where Bosel's wife cooked for the guests. Midnight was approaching, it was Bosel's birthday and a bottle of champagne was opened, as the three sat together and talked about the future of three band billiards. Ceulemans said, much to the Bayer's amazement, that he still needed to work \"properly \" to make ends meet. Thus the idea was born to professionalize and market three-cushion billiards.\nFounding.\nOn 29 December 1985, the inaugural meeting was held at the hotel \"Goldener Kopf\" (English: \"Golden Head\") in Bad Säckingen near the German Swiss border. Fifteen people came to the establishing assembly. They decided that the seat of the BWA would be Geneva in order to be close to the UMB and the IOC Supporters included, among others, Georg Peltzer, senior director and descendant of Henry Simon Simonis, founder of Simonis Billiard cloth factory in 1680, and Reinhold Würth, senior partner of the Würth Group."

        "title": "Official (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, an official (usually called a referee) enforces the rules and maintains order in the game. The title of official also applies to the scorers and timekeepers, as well as other personnel that have an active task in maintaining the game. Basketball is regarded as among the most difficult sports to officiate due to the speed of play, complexity of rules, the case-specific interpretations of rules, and the instantaneous decision required.\nThere is one lead referee and one or two umpires, depending on whether there is a two- or three-person crew. In the NBA, the lead official is called the crew chief with one referee and one umpire. In FIBA-sanctioned play, two-person crews consist of a crew chief and an umpire, and three-person crews contain a crew chief and two umpires. \nRegardless, both classes of officials have equal rights to control almost all aspects of the game. In most cases, the lead official (in FIBA, the crew chief) performs the jump ball to begin the contest, though NFHS, NCAA, and the NBA, have allowed the referee to designate which official (referee or umpire; in the NBA: crew chief, referee, or umpire) shall perform the jump ball.\nUniforms.\nIn American high school and college basketball, officials wear black-and-white-striped shirts with black side panels, black pants, and black shoes. Some state high school associations allow officials to wear grey shirts with black pin-stripes instead of black-and-white-striped shirts. \nNBA officials wear light grey shirts with black slacks and black shoes. The NBA shirt is light grey with thin white stripes, black sleeves, a black stripe on either side, a red and blue collar, the official's number in the center at the top on the back, and the NBA logo above the left breast and the Nike Swoosh on the right. NBA Summer League officials wear the same light grey shirt but with a black collar. The WNBA referee shirt is almost identical to the NBA referee shirt except that its collar is orange and the WNBA logo takes the place of the NBA logo.\nFIBA officials wear a grey (torso) and black (sleeves) shirt, black trousers, black socks, and black shoes. Officials in competitions organized by Euroleague Basketball – the EuroLeague and EuroCup – wear an orange shirt. Officials in the Israel Basketball Association wear the EuroLeague's orange shirt but sometimes wear royal blue shirts for contests between two Israeli teams. NBL officials wear green shirts with black shoulders and stripes on the sides with black pants. The NBL logo is atop the breast and a sponsor's name is on the back. Shirts are V-neck, without a collar, and pants lack belts.\nAll officials wear a whistle that is used to stop play as a result of a foul or a violation on the court. Hand signals are used to indicate the nature of the infraction or to administer the game.\nIn higher levels of college and professional basketball, officials wear a timing device on the belt-line called PTS (Precision Timing System). The device is used by on-court officials to start and stop the game clock in a timely manner, rather than waiting for the scoreboard operator (timekeeper) to do so.\nPositions and responsibilities.\nThe officials must ensure that the game runs smoothly, and this encompasses a variety of different responsibilities, from calling the game to player and spectator management. They also carry a duty of care to the players they officiate and to ensure that the court and all equipment used is in a safe and usable condition. Should there be an issue that inhibits the safe playing of the game, then it is the job of the officials to rectify the problem. Quite often, the job of an official surpasses that of the game at hand, as they must overcome unforeseen situations that may or may not have an influence on the game.\nThere are two standard methods for officiating a basketball game, either \"two-person\" or \"three-person\" mechanics depending on how many officials are available to work the game.\nIn \"two-person\" mechanics, each official works either the lead or the trail position. The lead position is normally along the baseline of the court, with the trail position having its starting point at the free-throw line extended on the left side of the court facing the basket. Officials change position often during the game to cover the area in the best possible way. As the game transitions from one end of the court to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. Between the two positions, each is responsible for a specific part of the court as well as two each of the side, base or back court lines. Officials change position after certain calls (mostly when the lead official calls a defensive foul). This allows officials to alternate between positions to increase the speed of play; one official will approach the bench whilst another, usually the closest to the bench at that time, will move to occupy his position. This also prevents one official from always working one particular team's basket throughout the course of the game.\nIn \"three-person\" mechanics, the court is further divided among three officials, with the lead (baseline) official determining the position of the other two officials. Normally, the lead official will move to the side of the court in which the ball is located (strong side), particularly if there is a \"post-up\" player in that position. The official that is on the same sideline as the lead official then takes up a position approximately level with the top of the three-point line and becomes the \"trail\" official, while the third official will stand across the court near the free-throw line in what is called the center position. This creates a triangle coverage of the court. Often, the lead will switch sides of the baseline during a play, requiring the trail to move down to be level with the free-throw line and become the new center, while the center will move up and become the trail. As the ball moves to the other end of the court in transition, the lead will become the trail, the trail will become the lead, and the center official will remain in the center (unless the new \"lead\" moves across the baseline to cover the strong side, in which case the center official and trail would then switch positions.)\nDifficulty.\nBasketball is regarded by many fans as among the most difficult sports to officiate. Usually basketball officials have only split seconds to determine if an infraction has occurred, due to the speed of play of the game and the officials' proximity to the action. Especially difficult are the \"charge/block\" call and shooting foul/block attempt. Officials often rely on instant replay to review plays. Only recently has a coach been allowed to contest a call by the official, or one missed by them, but this is only valid for a specific window.\nDespite the misconception that basketball is a non-contact sport, officials often let a large amount of marginal or incidental contact pass uncalled. An official must always be aware of not just what is happening around the ball, but the roughness of play going on around the whole court, adding to the job of the official.\nFurther complicating the job of an official is the proximity to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within a few feet of the official, as are coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, officials are able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.\nDuties.\nThe duties of the basketball referee are exactly this: to ensure the game is played safely and fairly. The referee enforces the rules of the game and in a game will make hundreds of decisions—determining when a violation or foul occurs and then stopping the game to issue the correct penalty.\nViolations.\nWhen a violation occurs, game action is immediately stopped. These include traveling, illegal dribbles, out-of-bounds, and other violations. The official is required to blow the whistle and immediately stop play and award the ball over to the opposing team, thereby allowing for fair play in the game. Along with those, during a game, contact fouls can occur that, if called, will result in the opponent getting two shots from the free-throw line."

Over the years, the BCPBL has served as a talent pipeline for Major League Baseball as numerous BCPBL players have been selected in the Major League Baseball entry draft and gone on to have successful careers in professional baseball.\nLeague History.\nKnown as the Island Premier Baseball League when it was founded in 1995, the league originally included only five teams, all from Vancouver Island: Victoria Investors, Victoria Selects, Mid-Island Canadians, Nanaimo Pirates and the Parksville Royals. Although these five teams had been playing exhibition games against teams from the Lower Mainland, only in 1999 did the league officially expand to include six new teams: North Shore Twins, Vancouver Mounties, Coquitlam Reds, North Delta Blue Jays, White Rock Tritons, and Abbotsford Cardinals.\nIn 2000, the league expanded once again by adding two more teams: the Whalley Chiefs and Penticton. Later that year, the league changed its name to the British Columbia Premier Baseball league to reflect its new membership.\nIn 2009, the PBL would again expand, by bringing a team back to Vancouver known as the Vancouver Cannons. In 2010, the PBL board has granted a second PBL franchise to Victoria, known as the Victoria Eagles.

As a manager, he led a team whose members included the first African-American players in Major League history.\nAfter retiring from the major leagues, Morton served intermittently as an official and went on to become an influential minor league baseball executive.\nMajor league career.\nMorton played for, and managed in, the American Association, with the Toledo Blue Stockings in and the Detroit Wolverines in . He played one season prior to managing, , and managed the Toledo Maumees after his playing career was over. He compiled a career managerial record of 121 wins and 153 losses.\nHe was the manager for the 1884 Toledo Blue Stockings, who had transferred into the American Association from the Northwestern League after the season. It was this team that included Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother Welday Walker, who are now considered the first African-American players to play in Major League Baseball. On August 10, 1883 before a scheduled exhibition game, Cap Anson and his Chicago White Stockings had told Morton that his team would not play on the same field as the Walker brothers. Even though he had initially given Walker the day off due to injuries, Morton then re-inserted Moses in the game. He did this to force Anson to either play or lose his portion of the gate receipts. Anson decided to play that day, but when Chicago came to town the following year, they had already signed an agreement that the Walker brothers would not play.\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career, Morton spent much of his time as an executive, most notably as the founder and president of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League during its existence from 1905 through 1912. By the end of its seven-year lifespan, the league had enlisted the membership of no less than 40 ball clubs based in over 20 cities. Morton also served as an official, umpiring a number of games during the 1886 season. He died in Massillon, Ohio at the age of 67, and was buried at Glendale Cemetery in Akron, Ohio."

        "title": "TCU Horned Frogs baseball",
        "text": "The TCU Horned Frogs baseball team represents Texas Christian University in NCAA Division I baseball. The Frogs have competed in the Big 12 Conference since 2013 and previously competed in the Mountain West, Conference USA, Western Athletic Conference and Southwest Conference. Since February 2003, the Horned Frogs have played their home games at Lupton Stadium, located on the TCU campus in Fort Worth, Texas. The Frogs are led by head coach Kirk Saarloos.\nHistory.\nThe early years.\nTCU has fielded a baseball team since 1896, before the university found its permanent home in Fort Worth. The Horned Frog baseball team began playing baseball in the Southwest Conference (SWC) when it became a member of the conference in 1923. In their inaugural SWC season, the Frogs finished the year with a 13–11 overall record and a 2–10 conference record.\nThe Southwest Conference years.\nIn 1933 Dutch Meyer, most noted for his tenure as head coach of the two-time national champion football team, led TCU to its first SWC title with a 9–1 record. The Horned Frogs went on to win 4 more SWC titles in 1956, 1966, 1967 and 1994. The SWC baseball tournament began in 1977, but the Horned Frogs never earned a conference tournament title before the SWC dissolved following the 1996 baseball season.\nThe wandering years.\nThe dissolution of the SWC in 1996 touched off a period of instability for the Horned Frogs that lasted nearly two decades, during which they made stops in six conferences. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the TCU Horned Frogs first joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). During the 1997 and 1998 seasons, TCU competed in the WAC South Division with the New Mexico Lobos, UNLV Rebels, and former SWC member Rice Owls. The Horned Frogs made two appearances in the WAC baseball tournament in the team's five seasons as a member of the WAC. Eight WAC member schools joined with schools from several other conferences to form the new Mountain West Conference (MWC) in 2000. Two seasons later, TCU joined the Houston Cougars, another former SWC member, in entering Conference USA (C-USA) for the 2002 season.\nLongtime TCU head coach Lance Brown, a SWC hall-of-famer as both a TCU player and TCU coach, retired after the 2003 season. Through his career as TCU's skipper, Brown notched a school-record 517 wins. After Brown's departure, TCU would go on to make several more conference moves in the early 2000s and see an emergence of its baseball program as a perennial national power.\nTCU's emergence under Jim Schlossnagle.\nJim Schlossnagle was hired as TCU's head coach in 2003 and coached his first season at TCU in Spring 2004. His impact was immediate. Former Head Coach Lance Brown had recruited several exceptional classes, which allowed Schlossnagle to coach his first TCU team to the program's first regular season conference championship in a decade, its first conference tournament championship in history, and its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1994. Under Schlossnagle, conference championships began piling up year after year, in conference after conference. Schlossnagle's Horned Frogs repeated as C-USA regular season and tournament champions in 2005, and once again earned a berth to the NCAA tournament.\nPrior to the 2006 season, conference realignment again led TCU to change conferences as eight other C-USA members changed conference homes. The Horned Frogs joined the Mountain West Conference (MWC), where the Frogs competed for seven years (2006–2012). In each season in the MWC, TCU advanced to the NCAA tournament and won at least a share of the Mountain West regular season title. In those seven years, TCU also won four MWC Tournament championships. During this era, TCU won its first-ever NCAA Regional Championship in 2009, and repeated the feat in 2010 and 2012. In 2009, the Horned Frogs advanced to its first NCAA Super Regional, where the Texas Longhorns eliminated TCU from the Tournament. In 2010, TCU and Texas met again in an NCAA Super Regional, but the Horned Frogs emerged from the rematch—advancing to the College World Series for the first time in school history. TCU compiled a 3–2 record in its first CWS appearance, eventually falling in the national semifinal to UCLA.\nIn 2011, the MWC Champion Horned Frogs were eliminated from the NCAA tournament in the Fort Worth Regional, but TCU came storming back in 2012 by winning the College Station Regional over host Texas A&amp;M. TCU advanced to the 2012 Los Angeles Super Regional, where they were again eliminated from NCAA tournament play by the Bruins.\nThe Big 12 Conference era.\nAfter 16 combined seasons wandering through the Western Athletic Conference, Conference USA and Mountain West Conference (and after brief plan to join the Big East Conference), the Horned Frogs rejoined three former SWC rivals, the Baylor Bears, Texas Longhorns, and Texas Tech Red Raiders, as members of the Big 12 Conference. Pre-season expectations for the Horned Frogs were high after the 2012 Super Regional run, but TCU finished their inaugural season in the Big 12 with a 29–28 record. This season marked the first and only time under Jim Schlossnagle that the Horned Frogs failed to make the NCAA tournament and win a conference title.\nThe Horned Frogs showed tremendous improvement in their second year in the Big 12. TCU finished the 2014 regular season in second place and swept through the 2014 Big 12 tournament, 4–0, to earn the Big 12 Tournament title. This was the first Big 12 championship won by any TCU team since joining the league on July 1, 2012. The late-season surge earned TCU a coveted National Seed for the first time in the program's long history. TCU hosted and won the 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Regional. Then, as a National Seed, TCU earned the right to host its first Super Regional. The 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Super Regional matched the TCU Horned Frogs against the Pepperdine Waves, winners of the 2014 San Luis Obispo NCAA Regional. The Horned Frogs took 2 of 3 in the Super Regional series to advance to the 2014 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In this, their second CWS appearance in program history, TCU notched a 1–2 record after winning its opening games versus Texas Tech, then falling to Virginia and Ole Miss.\nIn 2015, TCU earned its first Big 12 Regular season Baseball Championship. The Horned Frogs were the fifth different team in as many years to win the conference title, and their victory marked the ninth time in Big 12 history that the prior year's Tournament champion went on to win the following year's regular season crown. During the regular season, head coach Jim Schlossnagle notched his 200th conference win and 500th total win as TCU's head coach. The Frogs won their second NCAA Regional of the Big 12 era by defeating North Carolina State, and then hosted and defeated Texas A&amp;M in the 2015 Fort Worth Super Regional to advance to the 2015 College World Series. This season marked the 11th season in 12 years that TCU won either a regular season or conference tournament championship, the fifth time in seven years that the Horned Frogs advanced to a Super Regional, and the third time in six years that TCU advanced to the College World Series.\nAfter significant roster turnover due to graduation and the MLB Draft, 2016 was expected to be a rebuilding year for the Horned Frogs, yet TCU won the 2016 Big 12 Tournament and was selected to host and won their third consecutive NCAA Regional. The Frogs advanced to the College Station Super Regional, where they defeated Texas A&amp;M to advance to the College World Series for the third consecutive year.\nOn June 9, 2021, Schlossnagle was named the head baseball coach of the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, leaving the Horned Frogs.\nKirk Saarloos Era.\nSchlossnagle’s longtime TCU pitching coach, Kirk Saarloos, took over the program after Schlossnagle left for Texas A&amp;M.\nIn 2022, the Horned Frogs won the Big 12 regular season championship and made an appearance in the College Station Regional. Saarloos was awarded Big 12 Coach of the Year.\nIn 2023, the Horned Frogs finished 4th in the Big 12 regular season. They won the Big 12 Tournament championship, the Fayetteville regional against national #3 seed, Arkansas, and the Fort Worth Super regional against national #14 seed, Indiana State to clinch the program’s sixth College World Series appearance.\nAttendance.\nSince Lupton Stadium opened in 2003, annual total and average attendance for TCU baseball has steadily increased from approximately 1,500 fans per game to over 4,000 fans per game. The increase in attendance has coincided with the Horned Frogs’ 2010, 2014, 2015 and 2016 College World Series appearances and the 2010 Lupton Stadium seating expansion.\nTotal and average attendance at Lupton Stadium has ranked in the top 15 for NCAA home games since TCU's 2011 season. In 2015, TCU and Lupton ranked 8th nationally in total attendance, 10th national in average attendance, and led all private schools in the nation in total and average attendance. \nThe record attendance of 8,994 was set on June 10, 2023 when TCU hosted Indiana State in a 3-game NCAA Super Regional, surpassing the previous record of 8,812 set just one day earlier. 8,994 also set a new record for the largest crowd on a college campus for any school in Texas.\nPeople.\nOther baseball awards.\nSource:\nHorned Frogs in Major League Baseball.\nSource:"

        "text": "FIBA European Champions' Cup for men's clubs – origins and early history (1958–1960).\n\"L'Equipe\" is widely credited for birthing the idea of a European club competition, first and foremost, in European football. Basketball was soon to latch onto the quickly successful idea, and the concept was discussed by FIBA, during the 1957 FIBA EuroBasket, in Bulgaria. Then FIBA Secretary General William Jones, set up a commission consisting of Borislav Stanković (Yugoslavia), Raimundo Saporta (Spain), Robert Busnel (France), Miloslav Kříž (Czechoslovakia), and Nikolai Semashko (Soviet Union), to come up with a proposal.\nThe commission invited Europe's national basketball federations to send their national domestic league champions, L'Equipe donated a trophy, and in 1958, the \"FIBA European Cup For Men's Champion Clubs\", or, \"FIBA European Champions' Cup\", started, with the inaugural 1958 FIBA European Champions Cup season.\nClubs from Eastern Europe (from the former Soviet bloc) dominated the early years of the competition. They not only won the first six editions of the competition (Rīgas ASK three times, CSKA Moscow twice, and Dinamo Tbilisi once), but also managed to reach the finals as runners-up four times in the first six years (Academic twice, Dinamo Tbilisi once, and Rīgas ASK once).\nThe 2.18 m (7'2\") tall Soviet player Jānis Krūmiņš, was the man in the middle for Rīgas ASK's initial league three-peat championship, as he was an unmatched dominant force around the basket.\nThe 1960s, Real Madrid and CSKA Moscow rise.\nIn the 1960–61 season, things began to change. The main Western European basketball club, Real Madrid, started to show signs of ambition, and was eliminated only after the semifinals, by Rīgas ASK.\nThe following two years, the Spanish Primera División champions, Real Madrid, found their way to the final game, but lost both times, versus Dinamo Tbilisi (1961–62 season) and CSKA Moscow (1962–63 season). Eventually, Real won the first of its ten European crowns in the 1963–64 season, by beating the Czechs of Spartak ZJŠ Brno in the final.\nHowever, that same season, the USSR Premier League champions did not participate, because the senior Soviet Union national team (made up of 90% of the players from CSKA) was preparing for the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Anyway, this season was a big twist for European club basketball, as it marked the beginning of the domination of the \"wealthy\" Western European clubs.\nIn the 1965–66 season, Olimpia Milano, then known for sponsorship reasons as Simmenthal Milano, was in part led to championship by a young and smart American small forward: Bill Bradley, who would later become an NBA champion in 1970 and 1973, with the New York Knicks. Still later, Bradley would become a senator for the state of New Jersey and, finally, a candidate for the United States Presidency. Bradley, who was studying at Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, took advantage of his year in Europe, to give decisive help to Milano.\nReal Madrid won the 1967–68 season's final. Real Madrid could rely on players like Clifford Luyk, who was the competition's first naturalized American player with such a big role on a team, Emiliano Rodríguez, Miles Aiken, Bob Burgess, and later Wayne Brabender. In the 1968–69 season's final, CSKA Moscow, inspired by the talented player Sergei Belov, managed to beat Real Madrid in Barcelona in the final. The young Belov had 19 points that night, but his teammate, the big 2.15 m (7'1\") tall center Vladimir Andreev, exploded for 37 points in the game.\nThe 1970s, Varese-Meneghin Dynasty.\nAfter the dynasties of the Soviet clubs and Real Madrid, the 1970s were, without any doubt, the decade of the Italian League club Varese.\nVarese found a way, year after year, to reach the final game of the competition. In fact, Varese played in all ten of the league's finals in the 1970s decade, and they won five of them. Real Madrid, CSKA Moscow, the Yugoslav club Bosna Sarajevo, and the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv, were the other champions of the decade.\nAt that time, Varese was led in part by the legendary center, Dino Meneghin, whom was surrounded by other players such as, one of the best scorers in Italian League history, Bob Morse, the Mexican shooter Manuel Raga, Ottorino Flaborea, John Fultz, Ivan Bisson, etc.\nIn the 1970–71 season's final, CSKA Moscow won its last top-tier European title, until they finally won it again in the year 2006. They beat Varese (or Ignis Varese for sponsorship reasons) in the final, thanks to Sergei Belov's 24 points. Varese, after a tough win in the championship game against Jugoplastika Split in the 1971–72 season's final, won the championship one more time, against CSKA in the 1972–73 season's final. They won the title despite the play of Sergei Belov. Belov, was once again the final's top scorer, with 36 points scored in the 1973 championship game.\nIn the 1973–74 season final, Ignis Varese, after almost securing the win, was upset by Real Madrid, on an unbelievable late surge, led by Wayne Brabender and Carmelo Cabrera.\nIn 1976–77 season's final, the Israeli Super League champions Maccabi Tel Aviv, whose leaders Jim Boatwright and Miki Berkovich, combined for 43 points against Mobilgirgi Varese, won the first of their six European-wide crowns, which was a big surprise to the world of European club basketball. Finally, in the 1978–79 season's final, the Yugoslavian First Federal League's school of basketball began to dazzle Europe. Bosna Sarajevo, led by a young head coach (32 years old) named Bogdan Tanjević, beat Emerson Varese, in the final at Grenoble, France. The great performances in the game of the club's shooters, Žarko Varajić (45 points), and Mirza Delibašić (30 points), gave Yugoslavia its first top-tier European club title.\nThe 1980s, Italian and Yugoslav dominance.\nWhat could have been the decade of Maccabi Tel Aviv (six finals appearances, but only one win), eventually became a triumph for Italian League basketball clubs (seven finals appearances, and five wins).\nItaly's top league managed to generate three different European club champions (Cantù, Virtus Roma, and Olimpia Milano) in only seven years. The 1980s decade was also marked by the definitive emergence of the elegant and inspired Yugoslav First Federal League's style of basketball play. First, the Yugoslav club Cibona Zagreb, led by the phenomenal scorer Dražen Petrović, won the league's final two times in a row (in 1985 and 1986). After that, the Yugoslav club Split Croatia, won three consecutive titles (in 1989, 1990 and 1991), and revealed the talent of its star players Dino Rađa, Toni Kukoč, and others, like (Zoran Savić, Zoran Sretenović, Velimir Perasović, Duško Ivanović, Žan Tabak, Goran Sobin, Luka Pavićević...).\nIn the 1982 Final and the 1983 Final, Cantù, the traditional runner-up to the mighty Varese in the Italian League, won back-to-back championships, thanks to the young and talented scorer Antonello Riva, who scored 16 points in the first final, and then 18 points in the second final. The former Varese star, Dino Meneghin, who had since joined Olimpia Milano, had imported his winning tradition to the Capital of Lombardy, to play in his eleventh European Final in 1983. But he eventually lost the game, in what seemed like a wrestling match between him Wallace Bryant of Ford Cantù, in what was one of the most physical and \"ugliest\" finals of all time.\nAfter Cantù's back-to-back championships, Banco di Roma Virtus won the league's title following year. Its American player, Larry Wright led the way in the 1984 Final, as he scored 27 points in the game. Following that was the reign of Cibona Zagreb, and the club's player, marvelous Dražen Petrović.\n\"Little Mozart\", as Petrović was nicknamed, scored 36 points against Real Madrid in the 1985 championship game, and then added 22 points against Arvydas Sabonis and Žalgiris Kaunas in the final a year later. Italy got back to its back-to-back title tradition in 1987, and 1988, as Olimpia Milano, then bearing the sponsorship name of Tracer Milano, beat Maccabi Tel Aviv Elite twice in the finals. Then, in the 1989 Final, the wonderful generation of Jugoplastika Split (Kukoč, Rađa, Perasović, Savić, etc.) took over, and dominated European club basketball, as the team won three straight championships.\nThe 1990s, the Greek rise.\nPrior to the 1991–92 season, the league changed its name from the \"FIBA European Champions' Cup\", to the \"FIBA European League\". It then changed its name again prior to the 1996–97 season, to the \"FIBA EuroLeague\", which marked the first use of the name \"EuroLeague\", in the competition's history. The 1990s decade saw two of the most exciting and controversial endings in the history of the competition.\nIn the 1992 Final, Partizan Belgrade's young duo of Sasha Djordjević and Sasha Danilović, led the underdog team to a title, which was the fourth consecutive title for a Yugoslav Federal League club. Danilović was named the EuroLeague Final Four MVP, but it was Djordjević's last second, coast-to-coast three-pointer, which lifted Partizan to a 71–70 victory against the Spanish club Montigalà Joventut Badalona.\nThe following 1993 Final saw another underdog take the league's title, as the French League club Limoges CSP, stunned the Toni Kukoč-led club of Benetton Treviso, in the title game.\nIn the 1994 Final, 7up Joventut Badalona made up for their last second defeat against Partizan Belgrade two years earlier. That time, it was the Spanish League club's turn to stage a late rally, which came against an Olympiacos Piraeus team with the regular season's best record. Joventut power forward Corny Thompson, hit a three-pointer (just his fifth of the entire season), to put his team up by 2-points, with 19 seconds remaining in the game.\nOlympiacos Piraeus had a chance to tie the game at the free throw line, but the Yugoslavian national team star Žarko Paspalj, only made one of two free throws, and the \"La Penya\" club held on for the win.\nThe title stayed in Spain after the 1995 Final, but that time with Real Madrid. Arvydas Sabonis, led Real Madrid to victory over Olympiacos Piraeus in the final, and he won the only major European club honor that had eluded him up to that point, before going on to play in the NBA.\nThe 1996 Final proved to be one of the most controversial finals of any European club competition. The Greek Basket League club Panathinaikos Athens, pulled off the coup of the offseason, by signing former NBA star Dominique Wilkins, but it was the Croatian center Stojko Vranković, who decided the outcome of that season's EuroLeague Final Four.\nVranković, a 2.18 m (7'2\") tall center, ran the length of the court, to block FC Barcelona's Jose Antonio Montero's lay-up attempt, in the last second, to seal the finals win for Panathinaikos Athens. Although the block looked like a possible goal-tend, no call was made, and Panathinaikos Athens became the first ever champions from the Greek League. Although this would seem to indicate that a goal tend call should have been made, the situation is less than clear. In fact, numerous violations occurred in the last seconds of the game, none of which were called by the referees. Panathinaikos had possession of the ball, and with 8 seconds remaining on the game clock, Panathinaikos point guard Panagiotis Giannakis lost possession of the ball (possibly after being fouled, though no foul call was made). As players from both teams struggled to gain possession of the ball, the shot clock was renewed illegally (since the ball was in possession of neither team, a shot clock violation should have been called against Panathinaikos, meaning that the game clock should have been stopped, and Barcelona should have been given the ball, with an upcoming inbound pass). The situation was further exacerbated, by the fact that the game clock stuck at 4.9 seconds for about 6 seconds, thus allowing Barcelona nearly 10 seconds of play.\nOlympiacos Piraeus continued Greek supremacy over the EuroLeague the following season, after they won the 1997 Final. Olympiacos had previously lost in the finals in both 1994 and 1995, but their 1996 summer signee David Rivers, proved to be the difference in the 1997 Final Four. Rivers averaged 27 points in the two games of the Final Four, and Olympiacos beat FC Barcelona and it's stars Sasha Djordjević and Artūras Karnišovas in the final, to win their first ever EuroLeague title.\nIn the first ten years after the EuroLeague Final Four format had been re-introduced with the 1988 EuroLeague Final Four, the club with the best record of each regular season had never gone on to won the title. That finally changed with the 1998 Final, when Kinder Bologna accomplished the feat. That same year, a Greek team, AEK Athens, came in second place; their head coach was Giannis Ioannidis, who had reached the EuroLeague Final Four three times previously with another Greek team, Aris Thessaloniki, in 1988, 1989, and 1990."

During the Yugoslavian era, Kosovo had its own Superleague and lower divisions, in both genders. In the 1990s, Kosovo declared political and sports independence from the Yugoslav system, organising its own league, based on different teams from seven major cities of Kosovo. Some basketball players from Kosovo, especially Kosovo Serbs and Gorani, participated as part of the Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia national teams.\nAfter independence.\nKosovo were not allowed to play international matches, not even friendlies by FIBA, until 2015, when the Basketball Federation of Kosovo became an official member of FIBA and FIBA Europe. Kosovo took part in EuroBasket qualification for the first time in 2017. On 31 August 2016, Kosovo played their first official international match against Slovenia during the EuroBasket 2017 qualifiers.\nA year later, the national team achieved their first ever win on 2 August 2017 by defeating Macedonia 72–68 in their first match during the 2019 FIBA World Cup European Pre-Qualifiers. After the win, Kosovo would pick up one more victory during the Pre-Qualifiers, against Estonia 75–69 to finish with a (2–2) record to advance to the first round of World Cup qualifying. In the next round, Kosovo would eventually see their World Cup hopes vanish, as the team went winless before being eliminated. Despite all of that they maintain to reach the second qualifying round in their debut participation, reaching the round of 32 best Basketball teams in Europe.\nAfter missing out on reaching the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Kosovo went through pre-qualifiers in order to reach EuroBasket 2022. However, the team would only compile a (2–8) record during the pre-qualifying process to be unable to advance.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nThe following is the Kosovo roster called up for the 2027 FIBA World Cup pre-qualifiers first round matches against Ireland and Azerbaijan, on 22 and 25 February 2024."

        "title": "Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball team represents the University of Minnesota in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. The Golden Gophers competes in the Big Ten Conference and play their home games at the Williams Arena.\nThe Gophers had great success in the early years of basketball, but have been largely overshadowed by other programs since the end of World War I. In total, the Gophers have won nine Big Ten championships, but only four since 1919. College basketball research organizations have retroactively awarded Minnesota national championships in 1902, 1903, and 1919.\nThe team has also had several instances of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting. In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets. Still more severe was the mid-1990s academic scandal under then-coach Clem Haskins that resulted in the forfeit of a Final Four appearance.\nCoaches.\nInitially, the Gophers team formed without any organized coach. L. J. Cooke took over the team in 1897. Cooke was put on the university payroll on a part-time basis in early 1897 and full-time by the fall; this made him one of the earliest professional coaches.\nCooke remained the coach of the Gophers for 28 seasons, and his .649 winning percentage is the second highest in school history. Dave MacMillan, who coached the team from 1927 to 1942 and 1945 to 1948, had the second longest tenure as coach at 18 seasons. John Wooden almost succeeded McMillan as Gophers head coach; Wooden claims that a dispute over retaining McMillan as an assistant coach and a delayed phone call led him to accept the job at UCLA instead.\nThe Gophers have had several NBA coaches grace the sidelines. John Kundla took over as Gophers head coach after the Minneapolis Lakers departed for Los Angeles. George Hanson was assistant coach under both Kundla and Fitch and was head coach for the 1970–71 season. Bill Fitch and Bill Musselman both coached the team for a couple seasons before departing for the NBA and ABA respectively, where each had success and coached for many years.\nThe program has had a fair degree of stability with their coaching staff. Tubby Smith became the 16th head coach in Gopher basketball history when hired in 2007; this total includes interim coaches Jim Molinari and Jimmy Williams. Five coaches led the team for more than 10 seasons: Cooke, McMillan, O. B. Cowles, Jim Dutcher, and Clem Haskins. On March 25, 2013, Tubby Smith was fired after failing to reach the Sweet Sixteen again. The Gophers hired Richard Pitino on April 3, 2013. He was fired on March 15, 2021, after eight seasons, and replaced the following week by former assistant coach and seasoned recruiter, Ben Johnson.\nPlayers.\nThe Golden Gophers have had many successful players come through the program throughout its history. In the early years of basketball, when the Gophers had success, they recruited some of the best players in the country. George Tuck was a dominant center, and the first All-America for the Gophers in 1905. Frank Lawler was another early star: he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All-America team, and helped the Gophers to a contested conference title.\nIn 1950, Lawler was named the greatest player in Gopher basketball history, but the subsequent decades of Gopher basketball have largely forgotten his legacy. Hall of Fame coach John Kundla was also a Gophers star and helped lead the team to its 1937 Big Ten Championship.\nWith the decline of the stature of the Gophers program, fewer elite players have joined the team. The diminished reputation has not, however, prevented some superior athletes from coming to the Minneapolis campus. Lou Hudson played 13 years in the NBA and had his number retired. Baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield played for the Gophers in the early 1970s, and he played at the same time as star post player Jim Brewer. Mychal Thompson was a Gophers star and was the first overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft. Among Thompson's teammates were former Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards head coach Flip Saunders, as well as Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame forward Kevin McHale. Trent Tucker led the 1982 squad to the Big Ten Championship. Voshon Lenard was a key player for the Gophers in the early 1990s and went on to play more than a decade in the NBA. Willie Burton once scored 53 points in an NBA game with the Philadelphia 76ers. Other former Gophers with long NBA careers include Randy Breuer, Mark Olberding, Archie Clark, Jim Petersen, and Ray Williams. Five players from the 1997 Final Four team played in the NBA: Bobby Jackson, Sam Jacobson, Quincy Lewis, John Thomas, and Trevor Winter. Currently Amir Coffey (LA Clippers) is a former Gopher who plays in the NBA. Jamal Abu-Shamala, a Palestinian-American, played internationally for the Jordan national basketball team in 2008 and the Palestine national basketball team since 2011, and Marcus Carr plays overseas in the Israeli Basketball Premier League.\nCurrent roster.\nThis roster is current for the 2021–22 men's basketball season.\nHistory.\nProgram establishment (1895–1927).\nThe precise founding of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The university's student newspaper at the time, the \"Ariel\", reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport was introduced to the campus from a rival school, Minnesota A&amp;M in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new place to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke was one of the first full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.\nCooke began to improve the team significantly and was responsible for shifts in the Gophers' scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to come. The team never played a YMCA team after the 1903–04 season, and beginning in 1900, began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join Minnesota in Big Ten competition. This shift to playing similar competition helped the Gophers to become one of the premier programs in the nation. From the 1899–1900 to 1903–04 seasons, the Gophers had a 59–6 record. The 1901–02 squad has been retroactively named the national champions by both the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; the Premo-Porretta poll also names the 1902–03 Gophers as national champions. When the Big Ten established basketball in 1905, the Gophers won the first two conference titles.\nAfter 1907, Cooke's dominance of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner that it was in the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.\nDave MacMillan and beyond (1927–1959).\nFollowing the firing of Harold Taylor as coach, the program underwent a national search for a successor. Many of the candidates for the job were high-profile coaches of other conference foes. The team opted, however, to hire Dave MacMillan, who had been coaching the University of Idaho for the previous seven seasons and had previously played for the Original Celtics during the 1910s. MacMillan would dominate the program for the next 30 years, coaching the team from 1927 to 1942 and again from 1945 to 1948.\nMacMillan's teams in 1928 began to play in the University of Minnesota Field House, a new on-campus arena. Basketball had been off-campus for several seasons when the team moved downtown. MacMillan's teams had middling success. His 1930–31 and 1931–32 teams competed near the top of the Big Ten, but his teams dropped off again until 1936. John Kundla joined the team for the 1936–1937 season and helped the team to the Big Ten Championship, which was ended up being its last until 1972. MacMillan's squad also competed in a tournament in 1936 to represent the United States in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin; the team advanced several rounds before being ousted by DePaul. Many Gophers players in this era were recruited from Minneapolis public high schools, and in some seasons this even constituted a majority of the roster. McMillan resigned in 1942, but returned in 1945 after three poor seasons for the Gophers in the interim. When he resigned for the second time in 1948, he was replaced by O. B. Cowles.\nCowles was known for playing slower tempo basketball like was most common in the 1920s and 1930s and was known as a defensive-minded coach, especially early in his career. His squads were led by two-time All-American Jim McIntyre and three-time NBA Champion Whitey Skoog for the early years of his career and Big Ten MVP Chuck Mencel for the middle ones. Another notable Gophers star from the era was Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bud Grant. Cowles had a .612 winning percentage at the school. The Gophers were unable to win a Big Ten title, however, despite a solid nucleus in Cowles's early seasons. The team finished fourth or better in the conference seven times in Cowles's 11 seasons as Gopher head coach.\nKundla and Fitch (1959–1971).\nIn 1959, John Kundla stayed behind in Minneapolis as the Lakers prepared to leave town and succeeded O. B. Cowles as head coach of the Golden Gophers. Kundla remained head coach until 1968. In 1963, he broke the color barrier in the Minnesota program and recruited three African-American players to come to the school. One of these first three players was Lou Hudson, who played in the NBA and was the first Gopher to have his number retired by the school. The other two players recruited by Kundla, Archie Clark and Don Yates, also were both drafted by NBA teams. That trio helped the Gophers to a third place Big Ten finish in 1963–64 and a second-place finish in 1964–65, but those were the high points for Kundla's collegiate career. Kundla's personal assessment of his Gophers career was that his personal weaknesses in recruiting were marring the team by the end of his tenure.\nKundla was succeeded by Bowling Green head coach Bill Fitch. Fitch remained with the Gophers for two seasons before being hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as their first head coach in 1970 to make the leap to the NBA, where he later won an NBA title as coach of the Boston Celtics. Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer before he left, laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title. George Hanson, a longtime assistant coach at the school, was hired as his replacement, but resigned after only one season.\nMusselman and NCAA sanctions (1971–1975).\nThe Gophers under Athletics Director Marsh Ryman hired Cal Luther away from Murray State to coach the team in 1971, but he changed his mind and turned the team down after accepting the position. Instead, Bill Musselman took over the program. Musselman was a defensive minded coach and designed his team around Brewer, recruiting several junior college players. University of Minnesota baseball star Dave Winfield also joined the team in 1971. The starters on the 1971–72 squad after the Ohio State game became known as the \"Iron Five.\" Musselman's strategy succeeded, and the team took the Big Ten title, the first since 1937. The other Big Ten coaches did not approve of Musselman's recruiting posture as they all had gathered and agreed not to recruit Ron Behagen into the Big Ten because he was known as a troublemaker. Musselman had not been named Head Coach of Minnesota at that time and therefore was unaware of the internal agreement and therefore recruited what he thought were the best players available.\nIn 1973, former player Greg Olson accused Musselman of having attempted to strike him in a practice. It was also revealed that Olson had sold complimentary season tickets to a booster named Harvey Mackay, which prompted NCAA investigations. Musselman's coaching style also brought about significant transfers away from the Minnesota program to other schools. In 1975, Musselman resigned and was named the head coach of the San Diego Sails of the ABA. After his resignation, Musselman admitted to giving money to players for rent and transportation. These charges, coupled with the earlier ticket selling scandal and other transgressions regarding payments and aid revolving around Harvey Mackay, resulted in a list from the NCAA of more than 100 rule violations in Musselman's four seasons at the school. The extent of the consequences would not be known until early in Jim Dutcher's eleven season tenure as Gophers head coach.\nThe Jim Dutcher era (1975-1986).\nDutcher took over the Gophers program in 1975 following the departure of Bill Musselman. The highlight of his time at Minnesota was 1982, a season in which he led the Gophers to the Big Ten Championship — to date, the last \"official\" conference title for the Gophers — and a Sweet 16 appearance. He was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year in 1982.\nProminent players coached by Dutcher at Minnesota included Ray Williams, who later played for the New York Knicks; Mychal Thompson, who played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers; Kevin McHale, who played for the Boston Celtics; Trent Tucker, who played for the New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls; Randy Breuer, who played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings; Flip Saunders, who became an NBA coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, and Washington Wizards; Osborne Lockhart, who played for the Harlem Globetrotters; Jim Petersen, who played for the Houston Rockets; Darrell Mitchell, who was named first-team All-Big Ten, and Tommy Davis, also a first-team All-Big Ten player.\nOn January 25, 1986, three Gopher players were arrested on rape charges in Madison, Wisconsin. A Madison woman claimed the players raped her at their team hotel hours after the Gophers played the Wisconsin Badgers. After the arrests, U of M officials canceled the Gophers' next scheduled game, against Northwestern, citing the arrests and a series of less serious incidents prior to the arrests. Not agreeing with the university's decision to forfeit the game, Dutcher resigned as head coach, Jimmy Williams served as the interim coach the rest of the season. All three players were ultimately acquitted of all charges.\nSuccess, and scandal, under Haskins (1986–1999).\nClem Haskins was hired as the Gopher basketball coach in 1986, expected to clean up and rebuild the Gopher program which had been torn apart by the Madison sexual assault allegations (of which the players were later acquitted) during the final year of coach Jim Dutcher. Though wins did not come easily in the first couple years of Haskins regime, by the 1988–89 season he had the Gophers in the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a #11 seed, and directed a Cinderella run into the Sweet 16. In the 1989–90 season Haskins led the Gophers on another cinderella run in the 1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This time as a No. 6 seed, the Gophers went all the way to the Elite Eight, and came within a basket of reaching their first ever Final Four. Though Haskins led the Gophers to post-season success in his first three seasons, the 1990 Elite Eight appearance would be the last time under Haskins the Gophers would \"officially\" appear in the NCAA tournament, due to their future tournament results being vacated as a result of NCAA violations.\nProminent players coached by Haskins at Minnesota included Minnesota native Sam Jacobson, who went on to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, and hometown Minnesota Timberwolves, Sharp-shooter Voshon Lenard, who spent 5 seasons with the Miami Heat and won the 2004 Three-Point Contest, Quincy Lewis, who was a 3rd Team All American and played for the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves, and Bobby Jackson who under Haskins was a Consensus All American and Big Ten Player Of The Year, before going on to play 12 seasons in the NBA, most prominently for the Sacramento Kings, where he won the 2003 Sixth Man of the Year Award, and now serves as an assistant coach. Big men John Thomas, Joel Przybilla, and Trevor Winter (the latter two both Minnesota natives), also flourished under Haskins and went on to have careers in the NBA.\nAcademic fraud scandal.\nOn March 10, 1999, the day before the #7 seed Gophers were to open the NCAA tournament against #10 Gonzaga, the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" ran a story detailing allegations of massive academic fraud in the men's basketball program. Former basketball office manager Jan Gangelhoff had gone to the newspaper claiming she had written over 400 papers for at least 20 Gopher men's basketball players over a period of several years, ending in 1998. When the Gophers played Gonzaga on March 11, the university suspended players Antoine Broxsie, Kevin Clark, Jason Stanford, and Miles Tarver since they allegedly had papers written for them by Ganglehoff in previous seasons. With their roster depleted, the Gophers lost to Gonzaga, the season came to an end, and an internal investigation at the university began.\nBy June 1999 and in the midst of their investigation, the university had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999–2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA. In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.\n After the details of Haskins' ever-growing involvement became more clear, the university initiated legal action to recover the buyout money. A judge ultimately ruled that Haskins must return just over half of the original $1.5 million buyout.\nDuring this time an NCAA investigation was also underway. Ultimately, it revealed that Minnesota was guilty of massive violations under Haskins' watch. The NCAA stripped the Gophers of all postseason awards, titles, personal records, and statistics dating back to the 1993–94 season citing a \"lack of institutional control.\" Haskins was also slapped with a seven-year \"show-cause\" order, which effectively banned him from coaching at any level in the NCAA until 2007. Besides lying about the $3,000 payment, he had also told several of his players to lie to the NCAA. Later, the Big Ten forced the Gophers to vacate their 1997 conference title, as well as all regular season games dating to 1993–94. As a result, Minnesota's official record from 1993–94 to 1998–99 is 0–0. If not for the vacated games, Haskins would be the second-winningest coach in school history.\nIn addition, the NCAA docked the Gophers an additional five scholarships over the following three seasons, and also imposed recruiting limitations and department-wide probation lasting four years.\nIn addition to Haskins, Athletic Director Mark Dienhart, Vice President for Athletics, Student Development McKinley Boston, Associate Athletics Director Jeff Schemmel and academic counselor Alonzo Newby also resigned. The university also agreed to return 90% (approximately $350,000) of the profits earned by the basketball program during their appearances in the NCAA tournament, including the 1997 Final Four run.\nThe Monson era (1999–2006).\nFollowing Haskins' departure, the university hired Gonzaga's Dan Monson to be their next head coach, who coincidentally had just beaten the Gophers in the NCAA Tournament the previous March. Monson was the coach for part of eight seasons. However, during his tenure the scholarship reductions took their full effect, making it difficult for him to recruit on the same level as the rest of the Big Ten. His Gopher teams only made the NCAA tournament once, in 2004–05. Monson almost left the Minnesota program for the University of Washington following the 2001–02 season, but was thought of highly by the athletics department under Tom Moe and was persuaded to stay despite limited success. These trends did not reverse after he remained at the program. \nDuring his final full season the Gophers were 5–11 in Big Ten play, and after a 2–5 start to open the 2006–07 season, Monson and Athletics Director Joel Maturi announced Monson's resignation on November 30, 2006. Despite Monson's inability to field a consistent winner, he was lauded by University officials for bringing integrity and cleanliness back to the program. Assistant coach Jim Molinari was named head coach on an interim basis and, after a 3–13 Big Ten record to finish the season, was not retained as head coach. Maturi began an extensive search for a new permanent head coach at season's end.\nThe Tubby Smith era (2007–2013).\nOn March 23, 2007, Maturi made a move that surprised many when he hired Tubby Smith after he resigned from the University of Kentucky to be the next head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism, something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.\nSmith's coaching had an immediate impact on the previously unsuccessful Gophers squad. The team went from 8–22 in 2006–07 to 20–13 in 2007–08. Smith also led the Golden Gophers to the Big Ten tournament semi-finals after defeating 2nd seeded Indiana. Coach Smith also signed a top 25 recruiting class, the best in years for the program. Smith returned Minnesota to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 in the 2008–09 season. Smith's team struggled throughout the 2009–10 season with off-court issues, but advanced to the championship game in the Big Ten tournament for the first time in school history (losing to regular season co-champion Ohio State) and made the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive season.\nOn March 25, 2013, Smith was relieved of his coaching duties at Minnesota.\nThe Richard Pitino era (2013–2021).\nOn April 3, 2013, Richard Pitino, son of Louisville coach Rick Pitino, verbally agreed to coach the Golden Gophers. On April 3, after missing out on the NCAA tournament, the Gophers responded by winning the 2014 NIT championship trophy by defeating SMU. Austin Hollins was named the NIT MVP. As a result, Pitino claimed his first championship with the team. Following the success of an NIT championship, the Gophers hoped to qualify for the NCAA tournament the following year. However, the team struggled and finished with only six wins in the conference and did not qualify for any major tournament.\nThe 2016 season was a disaster for the Gophers as they only managed to win two conference games. The lone bright spot came during a late season upset against ranked Maryland to give the Gophers their first conference win on the season. Despite the lack of success on the court, the Gophers were able to get Amir Coffey, a highly ranked player from Hopkins to commit to the men's basketball program. Coffey, along with other recruits Eric Curry and Michael Hurt, were able to help lift the Gophers to a 23-8 regular season record in the 2016–2017 season, and a birth to the 2017 NCAA tournament, where they attained a 5 seed and lost to 12-seed Middle Tennessee State to finish with a 24–10 record. Expectations were high coming into the 2017–2018 season, as they only lost one rotational player, Akeem Springs, from the year before. This was evident as Minnesota received its highest preseason ranking in the AP poll since 1993, coming in at 15th. Before the season, things started to unravel for Pitino's team. Sophomore Eric Curry tore his ACL and MCL in late August, forcing him to miss the entirety of the 2017–2018 season. During the beginning of the season, sexual assault allegations came out against senior center Reggie Lynch, which resulted in Lynch's suspension and eventual expulsion from the University of Minnesota. Later in the season, sophomore Amir Coffey suffered a shoulder injury and ended up missing the last 12 games of the season. The Gophers ended the season 15–17, with a 4–14 record in conference play and a first round loss to Rutgers in the 2018 Big Ten tournament. The 2018–2019 season went much better for the Gophers. They finished with a record of 22–13, although they only went 9–11 in conference play. Still, after strong wins over No. 20 Wisconsin, and No. 11 Purdue twice, the Gophers finished 4th in the 2019 Big Ten tournament and returned to post-season play as a 10 seed in the East Region of the 2019 NCAA tournament. In the tournament, the Gophers beat the 7 seed Louisville Cardinals in the first round 86–76. In the Round of 32, the Gophers lost to the Michigan State Spartans 70–50, who would end up the champions of the East Region.\nThe Ben Johnson era (2021–present).\nOn , the University of Minnesota welcomed a former player and former assistant coach Ben Johnson to helm the Men's Basketball program for its next era. \nAwards.\nBig Ten MVP\nBig Ten Coach of the Year\nHenry Iba Award (National Coach of the Year)\nBig Ten Defensive Player of the Year\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\nConsensus All-Americans\nAcademic All-American\nPost-season.\nThe Gophers enjoyed fairly regular post season appearances under former coach Clem Haskins, making the post season in 10 of his 13 seasons as coach (6 NCAA tournament, 4 NIT), including all of his last 8 seasons. The team advanced to one Final 4, one Elite 8, one Sweet 16, one second round appearance, and suffered two first round losses. However, after the academic fraud scandal in 1999, the last 6 years of post season records were wiped out. So officially, the Gophers made 2 NCAA Tournament and 2 NIT appearances in the 13 years Haskins was coach. They advanced to the Elite 8 in 1990, the Sweet 16 in 1989, and were NIT champions in 1993.\nThe Gophers saw some moderate success in the early 1980s, appearing in the 1980, 1981, and 1983 NITs and the 1982 NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the Sweet 16.\nMultiple problems plagued the Gophers during the 1976–1977 season, Jim Dutcher's 2nd as head coach. Heading into the season the team knew they would not be eligible for the post season because of sanctions from the Bill Musselman era. Even so, this turned out to be one of the best teams in Gopher history, with the team finishing at 24–3. But if not being post-season eligible was not punishment enough, it was later found out that Mychal Thompson had sold two complimentary tickets to Gopher home games. When it was discovered, the profits were donated to University of Minnesota scholarship funds. The school and several prominent supporters, including Senator Wendell Anderson attempted to back Thompson and the team. Nevertheless, when the NCAA discovered Thompson's act, Minnesota's record for the season was forfeited and the accomplishments of that season are considered unofficial and not included in NCAA records.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Golden Gophers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 14 times. Their combined record is 15–13. However, their tournament appearances from 1972, 1994, 1995 &amp; 1997 have been vacated making their official record 9–10.\n Vacated by the NCAA\nNIT results.\nThe Golden Gophers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 16 times. Their combined record is 34–14. They were NIT Champions in 1993, 1998 and 2014. However, their tournament appearances in 1996 and 1998 have been vacated, including their 1998 title, making their official record 28–13.\n Vacated by the NCAA\nFacilities.\nWhen the Gophers first organized, they played games in the on campus YMCA. In 1896, the team moved into the campus Armory, a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use, even if basketball was not its primary purpose. They remained in the Armory for almost 30 years. Halfway through the 1924–25 season, coach Harold Taylor moved the team from the University Armory to the Kenwood Armory in downtown Minneapolis. This significantly increased the attendance; capacity at the University Armory was 2,000, and it was 6,500 at Kenwood. The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons, however, as the University of Minnesota Field House — later known as Williams Arena — opened partway through the 1927–1928 season. The team moved in on January 31, 1928.\nThe Field House increased attendance capacity further, to 9,500. It was named after Henry L. Williams, the former Minnesota Golden Gophers football coach in 1950, and was named after him when it was remodeled and expanded in 1950, bringing the arena to a capacity of 18,025, which was the largest in the country for 20 years and significantly larger than the capacity of Williams Arena today. Gophers fans refer to Williams Arena as the Barn. Consequently, the student section is known as The Barnyard. Williams Arena was remodeled in 1993 again, to create a new facility for the women's team to use. The team continues to play there to this day, making it one of the longest used arenas of any college basketball team and the oldest arena in the Big ten. Williams Arena is also one of the few remaining arenas with a raised court, in which players have to go up stairs to reach the playing surface.\nRivals.\nIn the early years of the program, the Gophers had several rivalries that have not extended into the modern era. Among them was a rivalry with Hamline University, now a Division III school in St. Paul. Hamline had one of the earliest college basketball programs in the country and it was several years before Minnesota competed on equal footing with them; they played as late as 1935. The greatest rival of the early years of the program was the Minnesota Aggies, representing the Minnesota School of Agriculture and Mining, which has since been incorporated into the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as the St. Paul campus. Minnesota A&amp;M dominated the Gophers, winning ten consecutive games; Minnesota did not get its first win against the Aggies until 1899. This rivalry expired especially early, and the two teams did not meet after 1901.\nThe Gophers were also an active participant in the early rivalry between Eastern schools and Midwestern schools for basketball preeminence. Minnesota broke up a stretch of Ivy League dominance from 1901 to 1906 with their successful 1902 season. The Eastern teams – Yale, Columbia, and Dartmouth were early powers – played with a more physical approach, while Midwestern teams used a different method. Wisconsin coach Walter Meanwell used the motion offense and \"stress[ed] finesse.\" W.C. Hyatt, who played for Yale, claimed that \"The Minnesota and Wisconsin men played in the style prevalent among most of the girl colleges in the East, that is, the 'no contact' game.\"\nIn the modern era of the program, as is the case with most Big Ten sports, Minnesota's primary rivals are the Iowa Hawkeyes and Wisconsin Badgers. In recent years, the rivalry with Wisconsin has become more intense than that with Iowa, primarily due to Wisconsin's rise to basketball powerhouse on the court. Minnesota and Wisconsin's games together count towards the Border Battle, an annual trophy given to the points winner of several sports played between the two schools throughout the year.\nThe Gophers also have a less heralded rivalry with Ohio State. The two teams have very little history together, outside of the 1972 brawl between the teams at Williams Arena. That incident still lingers in the hearts of many long-time Buckeye fans."

        "title": "Ken Rice (American football)",
        "text": "Kenneth Earl Rice (September 14, 1939 – October 14, 2020) was an American professional football player who was an offensive tackle in the American Football League (AFL) for the Buffalo Bills, Oakland Raiders, and the Miami Dolphins. Rice played college football for the Auburn Tigers, where he was named a two-time All-American.\nEarly years.\nKen Rice was born in Attapulgus, Georgia on September 14, 1939, and moved to Bainbridge before high school. At Bainbridge High School, Rice played football, basketball, baseball, and took part in track and field. In track and field, Rice was a three-time state champion in shot put, a state champion in the discus throw and participated in relay races.\nRice received offers from FSU, Tennessee and Georgia Tech. Eventually, Rice chose to attend Auburn.\nCollege career.\nRice attended Auburn University from 1957 to 1960, playing for the Tigers on both the offensive and defensive lines. As a sophomore in 1958, Rice was named to the SEC's All-Sophomore Team as the Tigers posted a 9–0–1 record. Rice was named an All-American in 1959 and was voted the best offensive lineman in the SEC. In his senior season, Rice was once again named an All-American and was once again voted the best offensive lineman in the SEC. Rice was also voted the best defensive lineman in the conference that year.\nIn 1992, Rice was elected into Auburn's Team of the Century by fans. Rice also lent his name to the Ken Rice Award, an annual award given to the best offensive lineman at Auburn.\nProfessional career.\nRice was drafted in the first round in both the 1961 NFL Draft and the 1961 AFL draft. Rice played for seven years for the Buffalo Bills, Oakland Raiders, and the Miami Dolphins, playing in 79 games total. In 1961 during his rookie season, he was selected to the 1961 AFL All-Star game. He was also named a second-team All-AFL lineman that season.\nIn 1964, Rice was traded to the Oakland Raiders. In 1966, the Miami Dolphins drafted Rice from the Raiders during the 1966 AFL Expansion Draft. Rice retired from football after the 1967 season due to a back injury. He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.\nPersonal life.\nRice resided in Big Canoe, Georgia, where he had been involved in real estate development since the early 1970s. Rice met Billie Ann Perrin while attending Auburn and the two married on June 20, 1959. The couple purchased the summit of Mount Oglethorpe, the original southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, in 1995, and opened the summit to the public in 2014. Billie Ann Rice died on June 7, 2014, at age 77."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in the artistic gymnastics discipline contested in the gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The qualification and final rounds took place on August 14 and August 18 at the Olympic Indoor Hall. There were 98 competitors from 31 nations. Each nation could enter a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 2 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Paul Hamm of the United States, the nation's first victory in the men's all-around since the 1904 Games in St. Louis and second overall. It was the first medal of any color for an American in the men's all-around since the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. South Korea took two medals (the maximum possible under the new rule limiting finalists to two per nation), a silver for Kim Dae-Eun and a bronze for Yang Tae Young. The scoring of the final was disputed; Olympedia calls this \"the most controversial men's gymnastic event ever.\"\nScoring controversy.\nThe Korean team contested Yang Tae-Young's parallel bars score after judges misidentified one of the elements of his routine. The effect of this misidentification was that the start value was recorded as 9.9 rather than 10. Had the start value been assigned correctly—with no other changes to any scoring—Yang's score would have resulted in his winning the gold medal. However, as noted by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, as with many other sports controversies, (i) scoring the routine correctly initially may have affected the remainder of the competition and (ii) there were potentially other scoring errors that may have affected the results as well; thus, assigning who \"would have won the event\" but for the error is \"something in the realm of speculation, not of certainty.\"\nThe judges on the \"A\" panel were responsible for determining the start value of the routine. This value is determined during (not before) the routine, as a gymnast may change their routine at any time (and may fail to perform elements intended to be part of the routine). The three judges on the panel were Oscar Buitrago of Colombia, Benjamin Bango of Spain, and head judge George Beckford of the United States. The panel assigned Yang a start value of 9.9 after misidentifying a \"Belle\" element as a \"Morisue\" element.\nKim Dong Min of South Korea, one of the judges on the \"B\" panel (responsible for determining execution scores), spoke to Buitrago about Yang's start value immediately following the parallel bar rotation. Buitrago explained how the value had been reached and thought Kim was satisfied. Kim later said that he was not satisfied; however, at the time, did not ask Buitrago to pursue the matter further.\nAfter Kim informed the Korean head coach Lee Joo-hyung of the issue, Lee raised the issue with the \"A\" panel and Adrian Stoica of Romania, the President of the Men's Technical Committee. Stoica presided over the Superior Jury, empowered to correct judging errors and control judges' scores. The precise timing of this discussion (during or after the medal ceremony) is disputed but was certainly after the competition had ended.\nThe next morning, the Korean delegation sent written requests via fax to Stoica and to the President of FIG (Bruno Grandi) for a correction in the start value. That afternoon, Grandi responded that the rules did not allow a protest against the judges' marks, but that FIG was analyzing the marks and would take action against any judge who had made a serious mistake. The next day, the Technical Committee analyzed the routine and determined that the correct start value was 10. The FIG Executive Council temporarily suspended Bango, Buitrago, and Beckstead.\nOn 22 August, the National Olympic Committees for the United States and Korea met with the IOC and proposed that gold medals be awarded to both Hamm and Yang. The IOC responded that it would not issue two gold medals, but would defer to FIG regarding re-allocation of medals if the scoring error was corrected.\nOn 26 August, Grandi sent a letter, via the United States Olympic Committee, addressed to Hamm and requesting that he return the medal, including commenting that Yang was \"the true winner\" of the event. Hamm had allegedly made comments in the press stating that he would return the medal if requested to do so by FIG. The USOC, however, objected to the letter and refused to forward it to Hamm, responding that under FIG rules (including finality of judges' scores) that Hamm was \"the Olympic gold medalist\" in the event; the USOC demanded that FIG retract the \"unacceptable request.\"\nYang formally appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on 28 August. The CAS held a hearing on 27 September, receiving oral evidence and considering written submissions. On 21 October, the CAS dismissed the Korean Olympic Committee's appeal on the grounds that the appeal, coming after the end of competition, was made too late, and insufficient evidence of corruption or bad faith on the part of the judges was presented to overturn a strong preference for a \"field of play\" judgment rather than one made after the fact.\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSix of the top 10 gymnasts from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, silver medalist Yang Wei of China, fourth-place finisher Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, sixth-place finisher Blaine Wilson of the United States, seventh-place finisher Alexei Bondarenko of Russia, and eighth-place finisher Yordan Yovchev of Bulgaria. The reigning (2003) World Champion was Paul Hamm of the United States; Yang had finished second and Hiroyuki Tomita of Japan was third.\nColombia, Malaysia, and Tunisia each made their debut in the event. France made its 22nd appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition generally followed the 2000 format, though with a significant change: the number of finalists was reduced from 36 to 24, with the maximum per nation cut from 3 to 2. The competition continued to use a preliminary (qualifying) round and a final round, with scores cleared between rounds (no carryover). The preliminary round used one optional exercise for each apparatus rather than requiring both a compulsory and optional exercise (as was done pre-2000). The team event scoring used a 6–5–4 format (each team had 6 gymnasts, selected 5 per apparatus, with 4 scores counting), a reduced version of the 1996 7–6–5 system, which reduced the number of gymnasts competing in every apparatus. Total scores and an overall rank were still used for all gymnasts, however. 2000 had also been the year where the tie-breaking rules came into effect, which resulted in far less tie rankings or duplicate of medals than at the Games before that. Each exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus the total preliminary score was from 0 to 60. The final total, with six exercises, was from 0 to 60.\nResults.\nNinety-eight gymnasts competed in the individual all-around event in the artistic gymnastics qualification round on August 14, by performing on at least one apparatus. Forty-seven competed on all six apparati. The twenty-four highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 18."

Having been established in December 1872, Harvard has the oldest rugby college program in the United States.\nHarvard's first involvement with the sport can be traced to 1874, when Harvard played a two-game series vs Canadian McGill University. As the second game was played under the rules of rugby football, Harvard embraced the game and continued until the establishment of American football rules that introduced concepts such as line of scrimmage or the system of downs.\nIn past years, the team traveled to Berkeley, California for the National Tournament (Top 16) after having taken the Ivy League title.\nHistory.\nEstablished in December 1872 for former players of defunct Oneida Football Club, \"Harvard University Football Club\" started to play the \"Boston game\", an hybrid between association and rugby football established by the Bostoners.\nIn 1873 when the Harvard team received an invitation from the McGill University football club. The McGill team was then in a similar situation as Harvard, as they sought some team with which to play rugby football and no other club wanted to play that game. Harvard boys agreed to a rugby match with McGill under the condition the Canadians played the Boston Game. \nAs McGill accepted, a two-game series was scheduled for May 1874 in Boston. The team captains sent letters detailing their respective game's rules and it was agreed that the first game would be played under Boston rules and the second under rugby rules.\nThe first Harvard vs Yale contest was held in 1875, two years after the inaugural Princeton–Yale football contest. Harvard athlete Nathaniel Curtis challenged Yale's captain, William Arnold to a rugby-style game. The next season Curtis was captain. He took one look at Walter Camp, then only 156 pounds, and told Yale captain Gene Baker \"You don't mean to let that child play, do you? . . . He will get hurt.\"\nOn 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations, so the \"Intercollegiate Football Association\" was established.\nCompetition.\nThough Harvard NCAA athletic teams compete in the Ivy League, since 2009 Harvard Rugby team has competed in the Ivy Rugby Conference. Predating the formation of Ivy Rugby Conference (where each of the eight men's rugby teams played each other over the course of a semester), each spring, from 1969 through 2004, Brown University rugby team hosted the Ivy League Rugby Tournament Championship at their campus. \nHarvard has won the Ivy League Tournament Championships in 2007, 2003 and 1994 and were National Champions in 1984, as well as National Championship runner-up to Cal-Berkeley in 1981 and to Air Force in 2003.\nIn 2009, the men joined a newly established Ivy Rugby Conference that kicked off as a separate collegiate conference that operated as its own union (replacing the need to be part of a 'local area union' or 'territorial union' within the national rugby union organization, USA Rugby, such that Harvard no longer was required to be part of New England Rugby Union except for the use of referees certified by a group related to the New England Rugby Union. The Harvard Men's Team, along with the Princeton and Yale Rugby teams, began the tradition of U.S. college students going on Spring Break to the Caribbean.\nRecently, the Harvard Rugby Football Club released a film, \"Just a Club\".\nHarvard Business School.\nThe Harvard Business School RFC is a rugby union team based at Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts.

It competed on the Division I level in the Atlantic Sun Conference. The 2002 team became the first in school history to clinch a Regional championship and earn an appearance in the NCAA Super Regionals, by defeating Alabama in the Regional Championship game, 6-5.\nRegionals.\nThe 2002 season saw FAU receive its third bid to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament; its first since 2000. As an at-large selection, FAU was placed in the Regional bracket with the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Auburn Tigers, and the Southeast Missouri State Indians. The top seed of the Regional was the national #3 seed, Alabama, who hosted in Tuscaloosa, AL. FAU pulled off an impressive win in the opening game against Auburn, as both underdogs in FAU and SE Missouri State, won their first games. Beating the Indians of SE Missouri State in the second round allowed FAU to roll right into the Regional championship game free of losses and avoiding the \"Loser's Bracket\" of the Regional. Host Alabama played itself back into the Regional by defeating Auburn and SE Missouri State, eliminating both en route to the Regional championship game. The Regional Final was set as the FAU Blue Wave and the top-seeded Alabama Crimson Tide. FAU, winning its first two games, dropped the first meeting to Alabama, 7-2, forcing a second game in the Regional Final for the championship. FAU pulled off the upset and clinched its first-ever Regional championship by defeating Alabama, 6-5.

        "text": "The Formula One Monaco Grand Prix has had a support race in many of its editions, the longest running of which was the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three, held each year from 1964 to 1997, and again in 2005. It replaced the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Junior. The Formula Three race was replaced by Formula 3000 for 1998, which would then become the GP2 Series and then the Formula 2.\nThe Coupe Prince Ranier was held once in the 1930s, and the Prix de Monte Carlo held twice in the 1950s.\nHistory.\nCoupe Prince Ranier.\nThe first support race for the Monaco Grand Prix was held in 1936 as a race for 1.5 litre voiturettes, and was won by Prince Bira in an ERA. The Coupe Prince Ranier was repeated the next year but for sports cars instead, won by Laury Schell in a Delahaye. With the Monaco Grand Prix not held in 1938 and the interruption of World War 2, the Coupe Prince Ranier was not held again.\nPrix de Monte Carlo.\nAfter the first Monaco Grand Prix after the War in 1948, a motorcycle race was held, but this was never repeated. At the next Monaco Grand Prix, in 1950, was the first Prix de Monaco held for 500cc Formula Three cars, and was won by Stirling Moss. After another one-year hiatus the Monaco Grand Prix returned in 1952 now as a sports car race, with the Prix de Monte Carlo held for sports cars up to 2 litres. The Monaco Grand Prix was placed on hiatus again until 1955, but the Prix de Monte Carlo would not return.\nMonaco Grand Prix Formula Junior/Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three.\nThe race became a permanent event first as a Formula Junior race in 1959. Formula Junior was replaced by Formula Two and Formula Three in 1964 and the support race was now held with Formula Three cars. A European Formula Three Championship was introduced in 1974 but the Monaco race was not part of it and instead attracted drivers from the various national and international F3 series held in Europe.\nAfter the end of the European Championship it was one of the two unofficial European F3 races along with the Masters of Formula 3. The F3 race was cancelled after 1997. The F3 race was resurrected once again in 2005 as a part of the Formula Three Euroseries, but this championship never returned as it had mostly followed the DTM calendar.\nThree drivers have won the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race twice: Peter Arundell for Lotus in 1961 and 1962, Alain Ferté for Oreca in 1981 and 1982 and Gianantonio Pacchioni for Tatuus in 1993 and Prema Powerteam in 1995.\nThe most successful team in the event is Oreca, who have won the event six times: Alain Ferté in 1981 and 1982, Michel Ferté in 1983, Pierre-Henri Raphanel in 1985, Yannick Dalmas in 1986 and Laurent Aïello in 1990. The next most successful is Martini with four wins (1973, 1977, 1979 and 1980), while Lotus have three (1961, 1962 and 1971). Matra, Prema Powerteam and Bertram Schäfer Racing each have two wins.\nMartini chassis won the event ten times between 1973 and 1986, the most of any manufacturer. Dallara have taken eight victories since 1988, while Lotus have four, Cooper have three, and Matra, Tecno, March, Ralt and Reynard all have two.\nFormula 3000/GP2/Formula 2.\nFormula Three was replaced by an International Formula 3000 race in 1998. This was held until 2004, with Formula 3000 replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005. The GP2 Series would itself become the FIA Formula 2 Championship in , and Monaco has had a round every year, as of 2019.\nOther races.\nFormula Renault has held rounds at the Monaco Grand Prix since 2003, first with the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup, which was replaced by the Formula Renault 3.5 Series from 2005–2015. More recently the more junior 2 litre Formula Renault series have held races at Monaco. In 2021 this was rebranded as the Formula Regional European Championship.\nThe GP3 Series made a one-off appearance in 2012.\nThe Porsche Supercup has supported all Monaco Grands Prix since its inception in 1993.\nThe FIA Formula 3 Championship made its debut in 2023, replacing the Formula Regional European Championship.\nWinners.\nMonaco Grand Prix Formula Three (and Formula Junior).\n\"Note: A pink background denotes a Formula Junior race.\""

        "text": "Tharon Leslie \"Pat\" Collins (September 13, 1896 – May 20, 1960) was an American baseball catcher who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the St. Louis Browns, New York Yankees and Boston Braves from 1919 to 1929. Collins batted and threw right-handed and also played five games at first base.\nCollins played minor league baseball for the Joplin Miners until 1919, when he signed with the Browns. After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one-year sojourn in the minor leagues before he was traded to the Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 Murderers' Row lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Braves, with whom he played his last major league game on May 23, 1929. A two-time World Series champion, he is famous for being the only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game.\nPersonal life.\nCollins was born on September 13, 1896, in Sweet Springs, Missouri. His mother, Sarah, ran a boarding house, and he had three siblings: Ola, Mildred, and Rathal. He attended school in Sweet Springs before moving to Kansas City, Kansas, to play sandlot ball. He was married to Daisy C. Collins. During his time with the Yankees, his teammate Babe Ruth – who usually called everyone \"Kid\" due to his inability to remember people's names – mockingly gave Collins the nickname \"Horse Nose\". After his major league career ended, he went on to run a restaurant in Kansas City, then operate a tavern in Lawrence, Kansas, until 1952.\nIn April 1952, the state of Kansas took Collins to court over alleged unpaid federal income tax from 1945 to 1950. Although he was convicted in December of evading $4,037 ($ today), a federal judge ordered a new trial after evidence emerged showing his friend had deposited $48,300 ($ today) in a safety deposit box for him. After being treated for a heart condition, Collins died in his sleep on May 20, 1960, in Kansas City at the age of 63 and was interred at the city's Memorial Park Cemetery.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nCollins began his professional baseball career in 1917 with the Joplin Miners, a minor league baseball team that were members of the Class A Western League. In 1919, his last season with the Miners, he had a breakthrough year, posting a batting average of .316 and amassing 100 hits, 19 doubles and 10 home runs in 96 games played. This caught the attention of the St. Louis Browns, who signed him near the end of the season.\nSt. Louis Browns (1919–24).\nCollins made his major league debut for the Browns on September 5, 1919, at the age of 22, entering the game as a pinch-hitter for pitcher Bert Gallia and drawing a walk in a 12–3 loss against the Detroit Tigers. Between 1920 and 1922, he never played more than 31 games nor started more than 20 games a season as catcher, and his role was limited to occasional pinch-hitting appearances.\nDuring the season, Collins played 47 games (37 starts) and had the fifth highest caught stealing percentage in the American League (AL) at 44.4%. During a June 8 road game at Shibe Park, he became the first and only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game. His teammate Homer Ezzell reached base in the third inning, but needed to use the restroom. Collins was inserted into the game as a pinch runner until Ezzell returned. In the ninth inning, Collins returned to pinch hit for pitcher Ray Kolp after the Philadelphia Athletics' manager Connie Mack agreed to drop the no free substitution rule and allowed Collins to pinch hit. However, the official box score lists his pinch hit appearance only.\nIn , there were two factors which limited Collins to just 20 games (11 starts) as catcher. Firstly, he dislocated the joint in his left thumb during spring training after splitting the finger. Then on June 22, Collins—along with Browns manager George Sisler and coach Jimmy Austin—were suspended indefinitely after arguing balls and strikes with the umpire. Sisler lodged a formal protest to AL president Ban Johnson, and the suspensions were rescinded four days later. After the season ended, Collins was not re-signed by the Browns, so he spent the season with the St. Paul Saints, a minor league baseball team that competed in the American Association (AA). There, he batted .316 and hit 19 home runs in 132 games.\nNew York Yankees (1926–28).\nThe Saints traded Collins to the New York Yankees on August 30, 1925, in exchange for $25,000 ($ today) and three players to be named later (the Yankees later sent Pee-Wee Wanninger to St. Paul on December 16). During his years with the team, he developed a reputation of being slow-footed and having a throwing arm that was described as \"terrible\" and \"weak\". However, his steadiness behind the plate and his bat kept him in the lineup. He became the starting catcher \"by default\" after Benny Bengough—who was Miller Huggins' first choice for the job—suffered from a sore arm before spring training commenced. In his first season with the organization, Collins had the fourth highest on-base percentage (.433) and tenth best at bats per home run ratio (41.4) in the AL, though he also recorded the fifth highest number of strikeouts in the league with 57. Defensively, he played the fourth highest number of games at catcher (100), during which he finished second in errors committed by a catcher (14), fifth in passed balls (6) and fourth in stolen bases allowed in the AL. However, he compensated for this by turning the most double plays (14) and recording the second highest range factor (4.75) as catcher, while finishing fourth in putouts (401) and fifth in assists (74) at his position and catching the fifth highest number of baserunners stealing (34). On July 20, in the final game of a series against the Browns (his former team), Collins injured a side ligament while attempting to run down catcher Wally Schang, who was also facing his former team. This, along with Bengough's recurring problems with his arm, prompted the Yankees to buy Hank Severeid from the Washington Senators. In the postseason, the Yankees advanced to the 1926 World Series, where they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Collins did not receive much playing time throughout the series, appearing in just three games and getting no hits and one strikeout in two plate appearances.\nThe season saw Collins split catching duties with Johnny Grabowski and Bengough. He appeared in the most games behind the plate out of the three players – 89 games caught by Collins versus 68 by Grabowski and Bengough's 30. He was usually placed near the bottom of the Yankees lineup, which was given the nickname \"Murderers' Row\". Many sports analysts, baseball writers and fans consider the 1927 team the greatest baseball team of all time. Although Collins was labelled an \"offensive afterthought\", he still managed to bat a respectable .275 and drove in 36 runs in 311 plate appearances. Defensively, he once again finished fourth in the AL in number of games (89) and putouts (267) at catcher, while also recording the fourth highest fielding percentage at the position (.976). At the end of the year, the Yankees once again advanced to the World Series, where they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games. Collins played in Games 1 and 4; in the first game, he was hitless in two at bats but garnered two walks, while in the latter game he went 3-for-3 with a double. His series average of .600 was the highest among his teammates.\nAfter the Yankees purchased Bill Dickey from the Jackson Senators before the start of the season, the team now had four catchers on their roster. The increase competition restricted Collins to 45 starts and 70 games in total. In the 1928 World Series, the Yankees achieved a second consecutive Fall Classic sweep, this time against the Cardinals in a rematch of the series from two years before. However, he played just one game in the series, entering the 7th inning of Game 4 as a defensive substitute and hitting a double two innings later. The catching situation—along with his dismal .221 batting average that year—made Collins redundant, and at the end of the season, he was sold to the Boston Braves.\nBoston Braves and back to the minors (1929–32).\nCollins managed to play just seven games for the Braves during the season, making his final major league appearance on May 23. During his brief tenure with the team, he was hitless, but drove in 2 runs, drew 3 walks and had 3 sacrifice bunts in 11 plate appearances. After the Braves acquired several younger catchers, he was released and sent to the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AAA International League There, he batted .122 and had 5 hits in 16 games played before manager Bill Clymer cut him loose after the season ended. He promptly signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Indians, a minor league team that played in the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He batted .244 during his stint with the team and was traded midway through the 1930 season to the Kansas City Blues, thus returning to the AA. His numbers improved tremendously—he recorded a .358 batting average, amassed 39 hits and slugged 7 doubles and 3 home runs in 109 at bats. The season saw Collins play just 27 games with the Blues and his average dipped to .182. He was scheduled to be traded to the Omaha Packers in July, but the deal fell through and he remained with the team through to the season. That year, he played 105 games and batted .268, collected 78 hits with 14 doubles, 3 triples and 4 home runs before retiring from professional baseball at the end of the season.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter playing his final major league season in , Collins returned to minor league baseball and played for several teams until . In 1936, he teamed up with former minor league pitcher Van Hammer in attempting to establish a new Western League franchise in St. Joseph, Missouri, after the St. Joseph Saints moved to Waterloo, Iowa, and became the Waterloo Hawks. However, the plan fell through after a court injunction was issued barring him from using the stadium in St. Joseph for professional baseball. Because of this, Collins forfeited the St. Joseph franchise and subsequently bought the Western League's Rock Island Islanders instead."

        "title": "Powder surfing",
        "text": "Powder surfing, also known as powsurfing and often spelled as one word e.g. \"powdersurfing\", is the act of surfing on snow free of any form of bindings and without the aid of ropes, hooks or bungee cords. Powdersurfing is performed on \"powsurfer\" which is a specially designed board engineered to be controlled using only the rider's feet and balance. This birth of style of riding was inspired by powder snowboarding, surfing and skateboarding. The lack of any bindings or bungee ropes along with the design of the boards allow riders to bring movements and tricks from surfing and skateboarding onto the snow. Much like surfing, the only connection between the board and the rider is a leash to prevent runaway equipment should the rider fall. Powder surfing is closely related to snowskating in its fundamentals, style and required skill. Powder surfing was sometimes confused with Noboarding while in its infancy but the two are quite different both in fundamentals, equipment used, and the skill required to ride them. Noboarding is performed on a typical snowboard using a kit that includes a rubber pad and bungee cords that are anchored to the board and held in the hand of the rider to hold the board to the riders feet and make the board turn. Noboarding and the kit called the \"noboard pad\" was pioneered by Greg Todds. In contrast, powdersurfing and snowskating are performed completely binding free and hands free on specially crafted boards that are designed to be ridden without the aid of any ropes or binding. \nThe terms \"powdersurfer\" and \"powdersurfing\" were coined by Jeremy Jensen in 2007 to describe, name and market the bindingless boards that he was handcrafting specifically to be ridden without any forms of binding, bungee, rope or hooks. Jensen founded Grassroots Powdersurfing, the first company specializing in the creation of powdersurfers and the act of riding powder completely hands free and binding free. Following the advent of powdersurfing and snowskating the act of riding completely binding free and hands free has gained popularity and acceptance worldwide. "

        "title": "MG Maglificio (cycling team)",
        "text": "MG Maglificio was an Italian professional road cycling team in the 1990s. The team started racing in 1992, under the management of Belgians Roger De Vlaeminck and Patrick Lefevere and Italians Enrico Paoloni and Paolo Abetoni. After a one-year co-sponsorship with Riso Scotti in 1998, MG Maglificio withdrew from cycling as a sponsor.\nHistory.\nGB–MG Maglificio.\nMG Maglificio was already a co-sponsor in the 1991 season of the Del Tongo team by Abetoni. This team had riders such as Fabio Baldato, Franco Ballerini, Franco Chioccioli, Dag Erik Pedersen and the young sprinter Mario Cipollini. In 1992, under the guidance of Flemish team management, and with GB and Bianchi as co-sponsors, the team was expanded and included such Belgian talents as Carlo Bomans and Andrej Tchmil, as well as neo-prof Davide Rebellin.\nThe team was immediately successful, with four Giro stage wins by Mario Cipollini, who was also victorious in Gent–Wevelgem. Chioccioli won a stage in the Tour de France and finished third overall in the Giro.\nMore Belgians arrived in 1993 with Wilfried Peeters and Johan Museeuw. Baldato won two Giro stages. Polish rider Zenon Jaskuła won a stage 16 and finished 3rd overall in the Tour de France. Mario Cipollini was especially successful in the Flemish spring classics, winning E3 Prijs Vlaanderen and Gent–Wevelgem, among other races. To top that off, Museeuw was victorious at the Tour of Flanders.\nThe team saw many new riders in 1994 as many old Ariostea riders joined the team, along with its manager, Giancarlo Ferretti. Davide Cassani, Alberto Elli, Rolf Järmann, Pascal Richard and Marco Saligari now joined the ranks of GB-Maglificio-Bianchi. Danish rider Rolf Sørensen and British time trial specialist Max Sciandri also joined the team. Cipollini and Chioccioli left the team however. GB-MG won many one-day races in this year, including the Amstel Gold Race (Museeuw), but also the final classifications of the Swiss stage races Tour de Romandie and Tour de Suisse (Richard). Sørensen was the best at Paris–Brussels, among other races.\nMG Maglificio–Technogym.\nIn 1995, former World Champion Gianni Bugno was signed by the team, now called MG Maglificio–Technogym. Head sponsor GB and manager Patrick Lefevere left the team, taking Johan Museeuw with them to Mapei–GB. Peeters, Bomans and Ludwig Willems joined them, removing the Belgian influence in MG Maglificio, which was now a team with many Italians, a few Swiss and one rider from Denmark and Great Britain each.\nLike previous years, Italian specialists like Cassani and Richard won many major one-day races in Italy. Baldato also won a Tour de France stage.\nIn 1996, Michele Bartoli joined the team from Mercatone Uno. He won the Tour of Flanders and Giro dell'Emillia, among many other races. Baldato was again victorious in the Tour de France with a stage win, but also in the Vuelta a España where he won two stages. Pascal Richard won a special race in Atlanta, where he became Olympic Champion in the road race, where he won in front of former teammates Sorensen and Sciandri, who had left MG-Technogym earlier in 1996.\nIn 1997, MG signed then 22-year-old Paolo Bettini and Matteo Tosatto, who made their professional debuts. Gilberto Simoni and Mauro-Antonio Santaromita were other new riders at the team in what would be its last under the MG-Technogym name. In this final success year, Bartoli won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Coupe du Monde and Alessandro Bertolini won Paris-Brussels.\nMG Maglificio remained a sponsor in cycling for one more year, co-financing the Riso Scotti team of Alberto Volpi, with only a few riders from the old MG Maglificio team (among them Baldato). This team wasn't nearly as successful as the old Technogym team, although a young Danilo Di Luca did win the Baby Giro of 1998, after which he scored an internship with Riso Scotti in September."

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors of the artistic gymnastics discipline contested in the gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The qualification and final rounds took place on August 14 and August 23 at the Olympic Indoor Hall. There were 79 competitors from 29 nations, with nations competing in the team event having up to 5 gymnasts and other nations having up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Igor Cassina of Italy, the nation's first victory in the horizontal bar and first medal of any color in the event since 1928. Paul Hamm took silver, the United States' first horizontal bar medal since 1992. Bronze went to Isao Yoneda of Japan, the once-dominant nation's first medal in the event since 1984 (the last of Japan's six gold medals in an eight-Games stretch). \nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the eight finalists from 2000 returned: gold medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, fourth-place finisher Alexei Bondarenko of Russia, and sixth-place finisher Ilia Giorgadze of Georgia; eighth-place finisher Naoya Tsukahara competed in other apparatus events in Athens but not the horizontal bar. The reigning (2003) world champion was Takehiro Kashima of Japan, with Igor Cassina of Italy the runner-up and Nemov third. The other two world championships since the 2000 Games, in 2001 and 2002, had been won by Vlasios Maras of Greece.\nColombia, Malaysia, and Tunisia each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar. The United States made its 19th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 event and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format; the 2004 competition kept this format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, in 2000 and 2004 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition had also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 79th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.\nResults.\nQualification.\nSeventy-nine gymnasts competed in the horizontal bar event in the artistic gymnastics qualification round on August 14. The eight highest scoring gymnasts, limited to two per nation, advanced to the final on August 23. Because of a seven-way tie for sixth place that was not broken by any of the tie-breakers, a total of 10 gymnasts ended up advancing. Japan had four gymnasts in the top 12 (including the seven-way tie), so the two-per-nation rule excluded Takehiro Kashima and Hisashi Mizutori.\nFinal.\nAfter performing a routine with six release skills in the high bar event final (including four in a row – three variations of Tkatchev releases and a Gienger), taking a big step on landing which was a two tenths deduction, the judges posted a score of 9.725, placing Nemov in third position with several athletes still to compete. The crowd became unruly on seeing the results and interrupted the competition for almost fifteen minutes. Influenced by the crowd's fierce reaction, the judges reevaluated the routine and increased Nemov's score to 9.762, but this did not improve his placement and he finished without a medal."

Williams is most proud that its graduating artist-athletes leave school as professional artists, working in “applied art” for top ad agencies, film production, design, and animation companies.\nWilliams served as the associate athletic director of diversity and leadership initiatives at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, for three years, before refocusing on entrepreneurial pursuits. He quickly joined an American team of business/tech advisors to establish the Bulgarian Entrepreneurship Center, where he taught graduate leadership at Varna Free University in Varna, Bulgaria.

McGinley, Matthew Modine, and LL Cool J to develop the professional football movie. He also started a small production company that created a slate of content of varying genres for future development, which includes 51 Dons, Between Fire and Ice, Jungle Love, Roth, and Renegade Hoops."

        "text": "The men's rings competition was one of eight events for male competitors of the artistic gymnastics discipline contested in the gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The qualification and final rounds took place on August 14 and August 22 at the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall. There were 77 competitors from 28 nations, with nations competing in the team event having up to 5 gymnasts and other nations having up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Dimosthenis Tampakos of Greece, the nation's first victory in the rings since 1896 and second overall. Yordan Yovchev of Bulgaria took silver, while Jury Chechi of Italy earned bronze. All three men had previously won a medal in the event; they were the 9th, 10th, and 11th men to win multiple rings medals.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Five of the eight finalists from 2000 returned: silver medalist Dimosthenis Tampakos of Greece, bronze medalist Yordan Yovchev of Bulgaria, fourth-place finisher Yang Wei of China, fifth-place finisher Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, and eighth-place finisher Roman Zozulya of Ukraine. Also returning was 1996 gold medalist Jury Chechi of Italy, who had missed the 2000 Games due to injury and was attempting a comeback at the age of 35. Yovchev had won the world championship in 2001, finished second in 2002, and shared the championship with Tampakos in 2003.\nColombia, Malaysia, and Tunisia each made their debut in the men's rings. The United States made its 19th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 rings and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format; the 2004 competition kept this format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, in 2000 and 2004 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition had also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 80th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nSeventy-seven gymnasts competed in the rings event in the artistic gymnastics qualification round on August 14. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 22."

        "title": "John Jones (American football executive)",
        "text": "John Jones (born February 6, 1952) is an American former football executive who briefly served as president of the Green Bay Packers. Jones, who was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, attended Loyola University of the South for his undergraduate studies and the University of Wisconsin–Madison for his post-graduate studies, both in the field of journalism. For 11 years, he served as a teacher of journalism at Loyola and as a journalist for \"New Orleans Times-Picayune\". During his career as a journalist, Jones covered the National Football League and the New Orleans Saints. He transitioned from his journalism career to an executive of American football, first with the NFL Management Council and then with two NFL teams: the Jacksonville Jaguars and then the Packers. \nDuring his tenure with the Packers, he was identified by then-team president Bob Harlan as his chosen successor. In 2006, Jones was promoted from vice president and chief operating officer (COO) to president and COO, with Harlan retaining ultimate executive power over the Packers organization as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for another year until Harlan's planned retirement in May 2007. During this transition period, Jones experienced health complications and complaints about his leadership style. Shortly before the planned hand over to Jones, the Packers put him on an indefinite leave of absence and then ultimately severed ties with him. The Packers presidency officially remained vacant, with Harlan staying on as CEO, until the Packers elected Mark Murphy as the team's 11th president at the end of 2007.\nEarly life and college.\nJohn Jones was born on February 6, 1952, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Loyola University of the South, where he received his undergraduate degree in journalism in 1973. He then moved to Wisconsin to attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison to complete his master's degree in journalism.\nProfessional career.\nTeacher and journalist.\nAt the conclusion of his master's degree, Jones was hired as the editor of the \"Ray Nitschke's Packer Report\", a newspaper dedicated to coverage of the Green Bay Packers and named after Ray Nitschke, a former Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker for the Packers. Jones served in this position for two years until he took a position in 1976 as an instructor of journalism at his alma mater, Loyola. In 1978, he began working for the \"New Orleans Times-Picayune\" as a journalist. For the next 9 years, Jones became an award-winning journalist, recognized by the Louisiana Sports Writers' Association for his writing and editing. During his time at the newspaper, he covered the National Football League (NFL) and the New Orleans Saints in depth.\nNFL Management Council.\nAs a journalist, Jones wrote a number of articles covering the negotiations between the NFL and the NFL Players Association, which Jack Donlan, then the director of the NFL Management Council, read. Impressed by his coverage, Donlan hired Jones in 1987 as the Council's director of public relations. In this role, Jones served as a spokesperson for the NFL during the 1987 NFL strike. In 1989, he was promoted to the director of operations. Jones left the Council in 1994, returning two years later in 1996 as the director of administration and information, a position he would hold until 1999. During his first stint with the Council, Jones helped develop a collective bargaining agreement that initiated a salary cap system for the NFL. He also assisted on settling all player anti-trust lawsuits that had been levied against the NFL. In his second stint, he continued his work related to the salary cap by working closely with NFL teams on its administration and management.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nIn between his two stints with the NFL Management Council, Jones was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars, who were a newly formed expansion team. He served as their executive director of administration from 1994 to 1996. Jones, who worked under the team's vice president for football operations, was initially hired to manage the Jaguars' salary cap and player contracts.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nPackers president Bob Harlan hired Jones as the team's senior vice president of administration in 1999. He served in that role until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president and chief operating officer (COO). Harlan had been grooming Jones to succeed him as president and CEO. Based upon an agreed plan reviewed by the Packers board of directors, Jones was elected as the 10th president of the Packers, although Harlan retained the position of chief executive officer (CEO) until the latter's planned retirement in May 2007. The goal was to provide Jones a transition period to continue to assume additional responsibilities before taking over completely. Just days before Harlan's planned retirement, Jones was placed on an indefinite leave of absence from the organization. In July 2007, the Packers announced Jones' departure from the organization and that Harlan would continue leading the organization as CEO with the presidency remaining vacant until a replacement was selected. The Packers ultimately reached a financial agreement with Jones that led to his formal resignation from the team. Although his health and recent heart operation were noted as the official reasons for leaving the team, numerous articles reported on Jones' management style as a major contributor to his resignation. Mark Murphy was elected in December 2007 and assumed the presidency and CEO roles in January 2008.\nDuring his time with the Packers, Jones worked in almost every area of the organization with a focus on financial management, facilities and other non-football team operations. Immediately after being hired in 1999, Jones worked closely with Harlan on a $295 million plan to renovate Lambeau Field. Funding for the plan came primarily from a half-cent sales tax of Brown County, Wisconsin. Harlan and Jones advocated strongly across the state for the passing of the referendum necessary to authorize the tax, noting the necessity of the redevelopment of Lambeau Field for the long-term financial stability of the Packers. After the tax was authorized, Jones worked to secure additional funding sources, including securing a loan from the NFL. The redevelopment project began in 2001 and was completed in 2003. The redevelopment helped make Lambeau Field a year-round destination by expanding the atrium to provide space for events, retail and a larger Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. In the subsequent years, the Packers saw a windfall in profits that helped grow the team's emergency fund and keep the team financially competitive with larger-market NFL teams. Based on his past experience on the salary cap, stadium and other facility development and his roles in the non-football side of the business, Jones was named to numerus boards and committees, including the NFL Stadium Committee, the NFL Business Ventures board of directors and the NFL's Revenue Sharing Committee.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1973, Jones married his wife, Cindy, whom he met in college. They have two children, who both also graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Jones' hobbies include long-distance running, cycling, reading and watching movies. He has been active in the Green Bay and Milwaukee communities, serving on various boards of directors for local organizations and businesses. In June 2006, Jones had an emergency surgery to repair an aortic dissection; during the surgery he also had a stroke. After surviving these health issues, Jones became an advocate for men's health, giving presentations, hosting talks and blogging about preventative medicine and the importance of routine health check-ups."

The team competes regularly in the African Championship and is administered by the Fédération Ivoirienne de Basket-Ball.\nWith two AfroBasket titles and six overall finals appearances, the country is traditionally home to one of the continent's finest basketball national teams. The Elephants have played at the FIBA Basketball World Cup four times and also played in the 2023 edition.\nHistory.\nIvory Coast reached the final of the FIBA Africa Championship for the first time in 1978, but they were defeated by Senegal in the final. They reached the final again in the following tournament, in 1980, but again had to settle for silver, as Senegal took the gold. Another run the following year, in 1981, saw Côte d'Ivoire finally break through and win their first title, as they defeated Egypt for the championship. Four years later, Côte d'Ivoire won their second championship, as they hosted the tournament in 1985, and beat Angola, to win the championship. Côte d'Ivoire finished second at the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship, for their first podium finish since their victory in 1985. They participated in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, which was their first FIBA World Cup appearance since 1986. The team went 1–4 at the tournament, finishing last in Group C. On 2 September 2010, In their final group game, the Ivorians defeated Puerto Rico 88–76, for their first ever FIBA World Cup win, but they came up just short in the tiebreaker to see which team would advance to the knockout stage.\nIvory Coast qualified for the 2019 FIBA World Championship in dramatic and extraordinary circumstances. After only narrowly avoiding elimination in the first qualifying round (they finished 3rd in their group and only qualified because they held the tiebreaker to Mozambique), they needed to win their last three games in the final group by a combined margin of 66 points in order to qualify as the best-ranked third-placed team. They remarkably did so (actually, they won by a combined 73 points), dispatching even African powerhouses and already-qualified Nigeria by a score of 72–46 in the process. Combined with a loss for the Central African Republic against Nigeria, Ivory Coast finished third in the group and qualified for the World Championship by virtue of a better total points difference than Cameroon.\nCompetitive record.\nFIBA Africa Championship.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place  \nFIBA AfroCan.\n Runners-up\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nNotable players.\nOther current notable players from Ivory Coast:\nPast rosters.\nTeam for the 2013 FIBA Africa Championship.\nKit.\nManufacturer.\nPeak"

He started his professional baseball career in 1902 with the New York State League's Schenectady Electricians. He stayed in the NYSL for the next two seasons and then moved to the Pacific Coast League in 1905. In 1906, he had \"one of the greatest minor-league seasons of the Deadball Era\", winning the batting title and also leading the PCL in hits, home runs, total bases, and slugging percentage.\nMajor league career.\nMitchell went to the major leagues the following season with the Cincinnati Reds. He made an immediate impact as a rookie, finishing seventh in the batting race and leading the National League in outfield assists, with 39. The assists mark set a record that was not broken until 1930. According to Bill James, Mitchell had the best outfield arm of his era.\nMitchell slumped in 1908, but he rebounded in 1909 with a career-high .310 batting average and a career-high 152 OPS+. He led the league in triples, with 17, and finished second in batting average and slugging percentage. Mitchell then hit 18 more triples in 1910 to lead the league again. From 1909 to 1911, he scored over 70 runs, drove in over 80 runs, hit over 15 triples, and stole over 30 bases each season.\nMitchell's power numbers went down slightly in 1912, and in December he was traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played for the Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Washington Senators over the next two seasons before retiring from the game.\nMitchell died in 1961 in Phoenix, Arizona."

        "text": "Radio Wimbledon was the official radio station to the annual Wimbledon Tennis Championships at the AELTC in Wimbledon. Their contract finished in 2011. It has now been replaced by the similar Live@Wimbledon station.\nAbout.\nRadio Wimbledon broadcasts daily on 87.7FM between 8 am and approximately 10 pm during the Championships at Wimbledon. Broadcast from specially designed studios near the Press Centre at the AELTC, it is available in an area approximately within a 5-mile radius of the AELTC under a Restricted Service Licence, as well as online at www.wimbledon.org. Launched in 1992 it provides extensive commentaries for matches using a team of reporters around the ground. More recently, the service has been extended to provide dedicated commentaries for Centre Court on 96.3FM and No. 1 Court on 97.8FM. Due to the use of lower powered frequencies, these services are only available by radio for visitors in the stadiums, but are also available online. Radios are available in the grounds, though visitors are asked to use headphones at all times.\nSince the station has been available online, the number of listeners has increased dramatically around the world to a peak of 600,000. It is perhaps the only station with such extensive ball by ball coverage that is available internationally, particularly as the BBC doesn't own the rights to broadcast through radio worldwide. However, a good relationship between BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio Wimbledon has meant that material is sometimes shared between the two stations. Radio Wimbledon's reporting style is more impartial than the BBC, but there is still some patriotic support shown for British players such as Tim Henman and Andy Murray. In the United States, Radio Wimbledon coverage is distributed nationally via Sirius XM Satellite Radio.\nWimbledon was the first Grand Slam tournament to offer radio coverage of this type. Other events have followed such as the Australian Open which launched a radio station in 2000.\nContent.\nRadio Wimbledon broadcasts live commentaries from matches all around the ground, as well as frequent updates of scores, results and news. The reporters often report from the \"Crow's Nest\" or from other locations around the ground. It plays popular music, provides local travel news, weather reports and holds competitions. The presenters are often joined by guests to discuss the tennis. These regular guests have included Nick Bollettieri and Judy Murray.\nRadio Wimbledon often asks for listeners to contribute interesting questions which can be discussed on air. These can be sent through e-mail or, in 2007, SMS. Listeners can also send comments using these methods.\nIn the evenings, press conferences are often broadcast as well as a summary of the day's play. The order of play for the following day is often announced when it becomes available.\nWhen the station is off-air, a repeated \"loop\" containing a summary of the day's matches is played along with Radio Wimbledon's distinctive theme tune. From 2007, these summaries have been available on www.wimbledon.org as downloadable podcasts.\nOn Middle Sunday, the 9:30 am Sung Eucharist service is usually broadcast from the nearby St Mary's Church. The church has also been the location of the radio mast used by Radio Wimbledon.\nFrom the Monday before the Championships begin, a similar loop is used to bring coverage from the Qualifying rounds and a review of the previous year's tournament. The draws are also broadcast on the station when they are announced. In 2007, Radio Wimbledon was launched on 18 June and stopped broadcasting on 9 July.\nTheme Tune.\nRadio Wimbledon's theme tune is called \"Purple and Green\" and has been used since 1996 when it was composed by a British Composer called Tony Cox. It has also been used in the past by the BBC Television Coverage.\nFor the 2008 Championships, the theme tune was slightly altered.\nCatchphrases.\nSome of the following catchphrases are used whilst Radio Wimbledon is broadcasting:\nPopular tennis players occasionally also announce a message. These have included Tim Henman, Rafael Nadal and Amélie Mauresmo.\nPresenters and Commentators.\nRadio Wimbledon's main presenters are Nick Dye and Sam Lloyd (freelance sports presenter and broadcaster).\nPresenting Schedule.\nIn 2007 and 2008, the schedule for presenters was generally the following:\nCommentating Team.\nThe commentating team include:"

        "text": "Horsham Cricket Club is one of the oldest cricket clubs in the world and represents the Sussex market town of Horsham in the Sussex Cricket League, along with Roffey Cricket Club.\nAlthough cricket was played in Horsham before 1768, the first recorded game of a town side was on 8 August 1771, and Horsham Cricket Club was created soon after 1806. The club has played various locations over the years, before settling at their present ground in 1851.\nCricketfield Road.\nHorsham is on 'Cricketfield Road' and the Ground is known as the Cricketfield Road Ground. This ground is the only ground to host both the MCC Spirit of Cricket U13 Regional Finals and the Portman Cup U15 Regional Finals. The two ends are called the Town End and the Railway End. Horsham's second ground is named after former President Dr. John Dew, which lies adjacent to the main square.\nFirst XI.\nHorsham is a very successful club which has played home to many first class cricketers. It runs four Saturday men's teams, one Sunday men's and two women's teams. Arguably one of the strongest club sides in the south, Horsham have won the Sussex League title a record eight times and the Cyril Snell trophy a record 11 times (including six times in seven years between 2001 and 2006); most recently in August 2010 where Horsham beat Stirlands CC to win a tight match by four runs, with two balls remaining. The club's crowning achievement came in 2005 when they won the Cockspur Cup for the first time in their history. They were captained to victory by Luke Marshall in a tight thriller against Barnt Green of Birmingham, in which Marshall bowled Horsham to victory by three runs off the final ball, in which Chris Nash was Man of the Match.\nSussex CCC.\nHorsham CC annually hosts a week of cricket for Sussex County Cricket Club, being one of three official Sussex outgrounds. A first-class match and a domestic limited overs match is usually part of the week, known as the Horsham Cricket Festival.\nNotable Horsham cricketers.\nPlayers with first-class caps who have represented Horsham are:"

        "title": "List of Kent County Cricket Club first-class cricket records",
        "text": "This is a list of Kent County Cricket Club first-class cricket records; that is, record team and individual performances in first-class cricket for Kent County Cricket Club.\nAs of March 2021, Kent have played over 3,000 first-class matches since the official formation of the club in 1842. Over 2,800 of these have been in the County Championship which Kent have been a member of since its inaugural season in 1890. Before August 1842 the county was represented by a number of first-class teams who competed against county sides and other representative teams.\nTeam records.\n\"All records last updated 27 June 2023\"\nKent's highest score in an innings was achieved in 1934 against Essex at Brentwood. Their highest score at a home ground was set in 2017 at Beckenham with Northamptonshire as the opposition. This surpassed the score of 633/8 made in 2015 at Tunbridge Wells against Essex. The county's lowest innings totals all date from the 19th century.\nHighest partnerships.\nThe highest partnership in Kent's history was 423 runs scored by Jordan Cox and Jack Leaning, set in 2020 at Canterbury against Sussex. This surpassed the previous highest partnership of 382 runs set in 2017. Cox and Leaning's partnership was unbroken when Kent were forced to declare their innings after 120 overs.\nThe stand of 235 achieved by Woolley and Fielder in 1909 remains, as of 2023, a record for the 10th wicket in the County Championship.\nAppearances.\nFive men have made more than 500 appearances for Kent in first-class cricket.\nIndividual batting records.\nFrank Woolley holds the records for most runs scored for Kent as well as most runs in a season and most centuries in a career with 122, the only player with more than 100 centuries for the county. He made 10 centuries for the county in both the 1928 and 1934 seasons. Arthur Fagg scored two double centuries in a match against Essex at Colchester in 1938, a feat unique in first-class cricket until February 2019.\nThe highest individual score for the county is 332 runs, achieved by Bill Ashdown against Essex at Brentwood in 1934. Ashdown is one of only three men to have scored more than 300 runs in an innings for the county, doing so twice in his career. Sean Dickson and Daniel Bell-Drummond are the only other triple-centurions for Kent. Dickson scored 318 runs against Northamptonshire in 2017, part of a new record partnership for any wicket for Kent with Joe Denly. The innings was Kent's highest score since the Second World War. Bell-Drummond made 300 not out in 2023, also against Northants, in a match at Northampton.\nIndividual bowling records.\nSpin bowlers Tich Freeman and Colin Blythe dominate Kent bowling records. Freeman is the leading wicket taker in Kent's history and holds the records for the most 5-for and 10-for innings in first-class cricket. Blythe has the best known figures in an innings for the county, taking 10/30 against Northamptonshire in 1907.\nFreeman took 10 wickets in a match for Kent 128 times with Blythe achieving the same feat 64 times. Doug Wright took six first-class hat-tricks for the county during his career as well as one for MCC in 1938/39. His seven hat-tricks is a world best total in first-class cricket. Dean Headley took three hat-tricks in the 1996 season for Kent, equalling the world best. Joseph Wells became the first recorded bowler to take four wickets in four balls for any team when playing for Kent against Sussex in 1862.\nNote: The most wickets taken in a season for Kent by a bowler other than Freeman is 185, by Colin Blythe in 1909. Freeman (14 times), Blythe (eight times), Arthur Fielder (twice) and Frank Woolley (once) are the only men to take 150 wickets or more in a season for Kent.\nEdmund Hinkly took ten wickets in an innings against England at Lord's in 1848, the first time that the feat of taking all ten wickets in a first-class innings is known to have been achieved in first-class cricket. It is not known how many runs he conceded in doing so. These are the only occasions on which a Kent bowler has taken all 10 wickets in an innings.\nHinkly took 16 wickets in the match against England in 1848 but, again, it is not known how many runs he conceded.\nAs of November 2017, only three players have taken a wicket for Kent with their first ball in first-class cricket for the county: George McCanlis in 1873, Colin Blythe in 1899 and Gerald Hough in 1919. Hough's wicket was the only one he took in his first-class career.\nFielding records.\nFrank Woolley holds the Kent record for the most catches by a non-wicket-keeper with 773 taken during his long career with the county. James Seymour is the only other man to take more than 500 catches with 659. Chris Tavaré holds the record for the most catches in a season for Kent with 48 taken in 1978. Seymour took 40 or more catches for the county six times during his career.\nWicketkeeping records.\nKent are known for having produced a line of top-class wicketkeepers. The long-serving Fred Huish, who played for the county between 1895 and 1914, holds the record for the most career dismissals for the county. Huish's nine stumpings in one match in 1911 are a world record, and prior to the 2022 season he and Jack Hubble held the club record for the most dismissals in a match with 10. This was beaten by Sam Billings who took 12 dismissals, setting a new record for the most dismissals in a County Championship match in the process."

There were a total number of 27 participants in the Olympic Vélodrome.\nCompetition format.\nThe individual pursuit competition consisted of a qualifying round and a 4-round knockout tournament (increased from three rounds in previous Games), including a bronze medal race. Each race, in both the qualifying round and the knock-out rounds, consisted of a pair of cyclists starting from opposite sides of the track. The cyclists raced for 4,000 metres, attempting to finish with the fastest time and, if possible, catch the other cyclist. For the qualifying round, the 16 fastest times overall (regardless of whether the cyclist finished first or second in his heat, though any cyclist who was overtaken was eliminated) earned advancement to the knockout rounds. In the knockout rounds, the winner of each heat advanced to the next round."

        "text": "The World Cricket League Africa Region or Africa World Cricket League is a one-day cricket tournament organised by the African Cricket Association for non-Test national cricket teams in Africa. As well as providing opportunity for national teams to play international matches against others of a similar standard, it also provides qualification into the ICC World Cricket League.\nThe league contains three divisions played once every two years with promotion taking place between divisions. As yet, there has not been a Division One tournament played and so there are no current champions. Currently, there is no date set for this to take place.\nHistory.\nThe Africa regional tournament of the World Cricket League was introduced in 2006. Two divisions were played with the teams being distributed according to the final placings of the 2004 ACA Championships. The upper division, designated as Division Two, contained the associate African nations at that time with the exception of Kenya, Namibia and Uganda who were already embedded in the World Cricket League. It is assumed that these three teams are expected to participate in Africa Division One alongside promoted teams from Division Two. Division Three was made up of eight affiliate African nations.\nAt present, there has been no relegation for teams finishing bottom in the divisions though this may change if the first division is played in the future.\nTournaments.\n2006.\nDivision Three.\nThe 2006 Division Three tournament featured eight African affiliate members of the International Cricket Council. Pool 1 featured Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho and Malawi whilst Pool 2 featured Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. It was hosted at the Willowmoore Park cricket complex in Benoni, South Africa and was won by Mozambique, who qualified for Division Two later in the year.\nDivision Two.\nThe 2006 Division Two tournament was played in Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania. It was a round-robin tournament, featuring Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia who were joined by Mozambique from the Division Three tournament. Tanzania topped the points table, thus qualifying for Division Three of the World Cricket League. Botswana were runners-up and qualified for Division Five of the World Cricket League, with third placed Mozambique later being invited to join them.\n2008.\nDivision Three.\nIn April 2008, the Division Three tournament was again held at the Willowmoore Park cricket complex in Benoni, South Africa. Due to the late withdrawal of Morocco, the tournament featured seven African affiliate members of the International Cricket Council and a South African Invitational team. Pool 1 featured Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. Whilst Pool 2 featured Gambia, Ghana, Swaziland and the South African Invitation XI. Although the SA Invitation XI won Pool 2 without losing a match, the tournament rules did not allow them to participate in the semi-finals and their place was taken by Swaziland (third in Pool 2). After Ghana easily accounted for Rwanda in the first semi-final, they beat Swaziland (who had defeated Sierra Leone in the other semi-final) in the final to win the tournament.\nDivision Two.\nIn October 2008, the Division Two tournament was held at the Willowmoore Park cricket complex in Benoni, South Africa. The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in September 2008 in Lusaka, Zambia but was rescheduled to South Africa just before the original tournament started due to the death of the Zambian President. The tournament featured three African associate members of the ICC; Botswana, Nigeria and Zambia and three affiliate members; Ghana, Mozambique and Swaziland in a round robin format.\nThe three associate members proved stronger than their three affiliate competitors, with the final group table reflecting the associate / affiliate split. Botswana were the overall winners after going through the tournament undefeated with Nigeria emerging as the second best and both the teams have been rewarded with promotion to Africa Division One. Due to their performance in the tournament, Nigeria qualified for Division Seven of the World Cricket League.\n2009-10.\nDivision Three.\nThe 2009 Africa Division Three was played from 1–7 October in Malawi. The hosts were joined by four other teams who remained from the previous playing the year before. Morocco were intending to take part as well, but had to pull out as their visas were not accepted. The winners were Malawi who were promoted to Africa Division Two alongside the runners-up Sierra Leone.\nDivision Two.\nAfrica Division Two took place from 24–29 April 2010. The competition was held in Benoni, South Africa and included Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Swaziland and Zambia. The winners, Zambia gained entry into 2010 WCL Division Eight.\nDivision One.\nThe Division One tournament which includes Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda was to be held in 2010. However, due to the busy schedule the tournament was shelved."

        "text": "The 1991 Giro d'Italia was the 74th edition of the race. It began on May 26 with a mass-start stage that began and ended in the Italian city of Olbia. The race came to a close in Milan on June 16. Twenty teams entered the race, which was won by the Italian Franco Chioccioli of the Del Tongo-MG Boys Maglificio team. Second and third respectively were the Italians Claudio Chiappucci and Massimiliano Lelli.\nThe race was first led by Frenchman Philippe Casado who won the first stage into Olbia. Casado lost the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () after stage 2a that contained a mountainous course. Éric Boyer took the race lead from Chioccioli after winning the event's fourth stage. However, he lost the lead back to Chioccioli the following day. Chioccioli protected his lead and built upon his advantage by winning three stages of the race before the race's finish.\nIn the race's other classifications, Massimiliano Lelli of the Ari-Ceramiche Ariostea team finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification, finishing in third place overall; rider Claudio Chiappucci won the points classification, Iñaki Gastón of the CLAS–Cajastur team won the mountains classification, and CLAS–Cajastur rider Alberto Leanizbarrutia won the intergiro classification. Carrera Jeans-Tassoni finished as the winners of the team classification.\nTeams.\nTwenty teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1991 edition of the Giro d'Italia, ten of which were based outside of Italy. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. Italy (84), Spain (30), and France (18) all had more than 10 riders. Of these, 76 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 27.03 years, ranging from 22–year–old Eleuterio Anguita () to 36–year–old Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle (). The team with the youngest average rider age was (25), while the oldest was (28). The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on 25 May. From the riders that began the race, 133 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the previous year's winner Gianni Bugno. Claudio Chiappucci was believed to be in great form coming into the race. According to Paolo Viberti of \"El País\", Bugno came in as the odds on favorite to win the race. Going into the race, it was widely believed that the winner would be either Chiappucci or Bugno. Despite being favored to win the race, Bugno entered the race with no victories to his name that season. American Greg LeMond told the press he planned to be more competitive at this Giro than he had in years past. Other favorites to win the race were Laurent Fignon, Pedro Delgado, and Marino Lejarreta. Mario Cipollini, despite a poor showing that Tour de Romandie, was viewed as the sprinter to watch for the estimated ten stages that could result in a bunch sprint. Notable absences included 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten, Dutch rider Erik Breukink, and Maurizio Fondriest.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1991 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani, on 1 December 1990. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. There were twelve stages containing thirty-nine categorized climbs, of which five had summit finishes: stage 12, to Monviso; stage 13, to Sestriere; stage 15, to Aprica; stage 16, to Selva di Val Gardena; and stage 17, to Passo Pordoi. The organizers chose to include one rest day, which was used to transfer the riders from Cagliari to Sorrento. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained one more rest day, and the same number of individual time trials and split-stages. The race covered in time trail stages. In addition, this race contained one more stage. The race started on the island of Sardinia for the first time in race history and stayed on the island for three days of racing.\nCapodacqua of \"La Repubblica\" believed that the route favored a rider that could defend well and put in a good time during the uphill time trial. \"La Stampa\" writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The \"Cima Coppi\" – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Stelvio Pass, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new \"Cima Coppi\". The queen stage was thought to be twelfth leg from Savona to Pian del Re as the final climb was at an average gradient of 7.5%. The Pordoi Pass in the seventeenth stage was the highest climb and was crossed twice. A writer for \"l'Impartial\" wrote that shorter stages might contain more attacks and general classification impact, specifically the writer stated that the fifteenth stage would be an important stage as it climbed the Mortirolo Pass from the harder side, from Valteline.\nRace overview.\nDuring the first stage, Alberto Leanizbarrutia attacked on his own and led the race for before being caught by the chasing peloton within the final ten kilometers. It then came down to a bunch sprint finish that was so close that it required a photo to determine the winner, Philippe Casado. The next day of racing consisted of a mass-start stage in the morning and an individual time trial in the afternoon. Reigning winner Gianni Bugno won the trans-alpine morning stage ahead of other main contenders. This stage saw the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () switch from Casado to Franco Chioccioli. Gianluca Pierobon of ZG Mobili team won the afternoon time trial by five seconds over Spaniard Marino Lejarreta. The following day of racing was the last on the island of Sardinia before the race was transferred to mainland Italy. The day of racing ended with a bunch sprint contested by Adriano Baffi, Mario Cipollini, and Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, of which Cipollini got the best and won.\nThe fourth leg of the event consisted of five laps on a set circuit of . The stage saw several attacks on the final lap of the course with most being caught by the peloton. Éric Boyer attacked with fifteen kilometers to go in the stage and was able to establish a solid gap between himself and the peloton. Boyer went on to win the stage by twenty-three seconds over the chasing peloton, gaining enough time to earn the race lead. The following day saw the general classification contenders reach the final climb of the day, Mount Godi, together. Chioccioli attacked on the climb and only Lejarreta was able to mark his move. The two rode to the finish together as Boyer led the group of chasing riders to the finish fifty seconds later. Lejarreta won the stage and Chioccioli regained the race lead.\nThe sixth day of racing was marred by poor weather. General classification contenders Pedro Delgado and Laurent Fignon lost time due to crashing on the descent of Monte Terminillo, while Greg LeMond lost over two minutes. On the final climb of the day, Iñaki Gastón and Leonardo Sierra attacked with eight kilometers to go but were caught by the chasing riders. Gaston attacked again with a kilometer remaining, but was robbed of the stage win as Vladimir Poulnikov overtook him three meters before the finish. Cipollini won the event's seventh leg by means of a field sprint.\nThe following stage saw a group of nine riders form off the front of the peloton with under twenty kilometers remaining. Despite the best efforts of the chasing peloton, the breakaway group survived and saw Ari-Ceramiche Ariostea's Davide Cassani take the stage by edging out Mario Mantova. Massimo Ghirotto of team attacked with about fifty kilometers to go in the ninth stage. He rode solo and wound up winning the stage, while the general classification remained largely unchanged. The next stage was a individual time trial that was won by Bugno. He won by margin of eight seconds and moved up into second place overall, a second off the leader Chioccioli.\nThe eleventh stage was contested in rainy conditions on a winding course. After an unsuccessful breakaway attempt by fifteen riders, Maximilian Sciandri, LeMond, and Michele Coppolillo attacked and formed a group off the front. Sciandri and LeMond crossed the line in first and second, respectively, while Coppolillo was caught by the peloton in the closing meters of the stage. The next day saw the race's first mountain-top finish, to Monviso. The group of main contenders reached the final climb together, with 's Jean-François Bernard launching the first attack which saw him gain a maximum advantage of around thirty seconds. The next to make a serious effort was Lejarreta, who was followed by Chioccioli, Massimiliano Lelli, and Sierra, who attacked with ten kilometers left in the stage. The trio caught up to Bernard and rode as a group to the finish. Lelli took the stage as Chioccioli defended his lead. Bugno lost almost two minutes during the day.\nThe thirteenth leg of the race featured two ascents of the Alpine mountain Sestriere, the second of which served as the finish for the day. The day began with a breakaway of twelve\nthat was caught before the final climb to Sestriere. The first rider to launch a serious attack on the climb was Pedro Delgado, who was quickly followed by Chioccioli, Lejaretta, Eduardo Chozas, and Chiappucci, meanwhile Bugno was unable to follow their wheels. Chozas managed to win the stage as the group of four finish within four seconds of each other. With twenty kilometers to go in the fourteenth leg, Franco Ballerini, Casado, Juan Martínez Oliver, and Brian Peterson formed a breakaway group. The group managed to stretch out an advantage of almost two minutes as they entered the closing kilometers. Ballerini took the stage victory after he and Casado had managed to distance themselves slightly from the two other breakaway riders. LeMond abandoned the race following the conclusion of the fourteenth stage. The next day, on the ascent of the Mortirolo, race leader Chioccioli attacked and formed a solo attack. He rode the remaining fifty kilometers on his own to the stage victory, with his lead expanding to at most two minutes thirty seconds. He managed to put over a minute into each of his rivals.\nThe sixteenth saw no major shifts in the general classification. The top five riders in the general classification formed a leading group on the final climb but there were no major moves to create time gaps. Lelli took the stage win after ahead of Bugno. The following day was the last in the Dolomites and saw the ascension of five major climbs, including the \"Cima Coppi\" Passo Pordoi. On the second climbing of Pordoi, Chioccioli attacked and rode to the top of the climb to win the stage by thirty-eight seconds. Lejaretta crashed on the day and lost over six and a half minutes, putting him out of contention for the podium and overall victory. Midway through the stage, Fignon abandoned the race. The eighteenth day of racing was a transition stage. Several attempts were made to form a breakaway group before a group of eight were successful in creating a gap. The group was caught with five hundred meters to go by the chasing peloton which was setting up for a field sprint. Silvio Martinello managed to outsprint the likes of Cipollini and Abdoujaparov to win the day.\nThe nineteenth leg featured only one categorized climb, which Iñaki Gastón won to seal his victory in the mountains classification. The stage saw no major time disparities in the general classification contenders as they finished together, with Bugno taking the stage win. The penultimate stage of the race was a individual time trial that contained one un-categorized climb within the route. Race leader Chioccioli took the course and at the first time check at he had already put thirty seconds into Bugno. He ended up winning the stage by fifty-seconds over Bugno, thereby extending his lead over the rest of his competitors. The final stage culminated with a bunch sprint that was won by Cipollini. Chioccioli had won the Giro d'Italia for the first time by almost four minutes over the second-place finisher Chiappucci.\nFour riders achieved multiple stage victories: Cipollini (stages 3, 7, and 21), Bugno (stages 2a, 10, and 19), Lelli (stages 12 and 16), and Chioccioli (stages 15, 17, and 20). Stage wins were achieved by eight of the twenty competing squads, six of which won multiple stages. Del Tongo-MG Boys Maglificio collected a total of seven stage wins through three riders, Cipollini, Ballerini (stage 14), and Chioccioli. Carrera Jeans-Tassoni earned three stage wins through Poulnikov (stage 6), Ghirotto (stage 9), and Sciandri (stage 11). Ari-Ceramiche Ariostea achieved the same feat through Cassani (stage 8) and Lelli. Chateau d'Ax-Gatorade garnered three stage victories through Bugno. Z amassed a total of two stage victories through Casado (stage 1) and Boyer (stage 4). ONCE gained two stage victories through Lejaretta (stage 5) and Chozas (stage 13). ZG Mobili and Gis Gelati-Ballan each won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Pierobon (stage 2b) and the second through Martinello (stage 18).\nClassification leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1991 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. The time bonuses for the 1991 Giro were twelve seconds for first, eight seconds for second, and four seconds for third place on the stage. The winner of the general classification received 1.7 million francs.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. It was crossed twice by the riders, for the first climbing of the mountain, Italian Franco Vona was the first over the climb, while Franco Chioccioli was first over the second passing. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1967 were eligible for it.\nThe intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

The organization was founded in 1983 by television producer Lenny Shabes who felt there was no recognized educational system in place to learn the sport of sailing. Today there are over 400 affiliate schools that teach the American Sailing methods via the many textbooks and other educational aids the organization creates and publishes. Over one million sailors have come through the American Sailing learning system.\nIn administering this educational structure that includes on-water and written testing, American Sailing certifications are now recognized at charter companies and maritime employers all around the world. They have published textbooks for beginners, coastal cruising sailors, bareboat charterers, dinghy pilots and those looking to buy or charter cruising catamarans. In addition to textbooks, American Sailing has produced educational videos, smart-phone apps, countless webinars, and an interactive digital game that aims to teach and drill rudimentary sailing skills while off the water.\nAmerican Sailing is also an avid promoter of the sport of sailing – they are an active contributor in social media and sponsor an app called GO SAILING that enables sailors to connect anywhere they happen to be in the world.\nContributors.\nOne of American Sailing's most renowned and esteemed contributors is Peter Isler who has been part of five America's Cup campaigns, authored two sailing books of his own and is known as one of the most distinguished sailors in the world.\nThrough the years American Sailing has formed bonds and partnerships with publications and manufacturers. Two of the most prominent are Cruising World Magazine and Beneteau Yachts. Cruising World is arguably sailing's most recognized publication with a large domestic and international circulation. They co-sponsored ASA's Docking Made Easy video series and other projects through the years.\nBeneteau Yachts joined forces in 2010 with ASA in creating a small keelboat specifically designed for teaching.

        "title": "Brad Smith (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Bradley Allan Smith (born April 13, 1958) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 222 games over nine National Hockey League seasons with the Vancouver Canucks, Atlanta Flames, Calgary Flames, Detroit Red Wings, and Toronto Maple Leafs. He was also a member of the Central Hockey League's Adams Cup winning Dallas Blackhawks, 1978–79. After retiring Smith became a scout, and since 2016 has been the Director of Scouting for the Colorado Avalanche. Smith's nephew, Hunter, was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly career.\nDescribed as a heady, defensive forward known for his physical play in William Houston's book, \"The Rise and Fall of the Toronto Maple Leafs\", Smith led his hometown Windsor Spitfires in scoring with 37 goals and 90 points during his rookie OHA season, 1976–77. The following year, he was traded to the Sudbury Wolves for Wes Jarvis. Registering 80 goals and 172 points in 136 OHA games, Smith was selected by Vancouver 57th overall in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft. During his first intrasquad game, he scored twice and got into a fight with Dennis Kearns. Sent to the CHL's Dallas Blackhawks where he scored 17 times in 60 games in 1978–79, Smith earned a two-game call-up to the parent club.\nNHL career.\nThe following year, 1979–80, Smith spent 19 games with Vancouver, scoring his first NHL goal against the Colorado Rockies on December 14, 1979, tying the game at 3-3 (as noted in a Vancouver Sun report by Arv Olson the following day). Minutes later, Smith set up the game-winning goal.\nSmith also played for Vancouver in the 1979-80 Super Series, in which nine NHL teams played a series of games against the top two Soviet clubs. In the opening game of the international series on December 26, 1979, Smith led the Canucks to a 6–2 victory, scoring twice within 17 seconds (both slapshots) against HC Moscow Dynamo goaltender, Vladimir Myshkin (who shut out the NHL All-Stars the previous year to win the 1979 Challenge Cup for the Soviet national team before winning Olympic Gold in 1984). It was the only game the Dynamo lost against the four NHL teams faced. As reported by Canadian Press the following day and published in The Leader Post, Smith's outburst is thus described.\n\"Smith scored his first goal...when he was allowed to skate in from the corner and blast a rising 30-footer over Myshkin's shoulder,\" CP reported. \"Just 17 seconds later, Smith broke in on a two-on-one with Gary Lupul and blistered a 35-footer into the far corner.\"\nOn February 8, 1980, Smith and Don Lever were traded to Atlanta for Darcy Rota and Ivan Boldirev, as reported in The Montreal Gazette the following day. Smith played four games for Atlanta before the team relocated for the 1980–81 season, where he became an original member of the Calgary Flames. On December 27, 1980, Smith scored the game-winning goal on a two-on-nothing, give-and-go breakaway with fellow journeyman Alex McKendry to beat Philadelphia 2–1, as the Associated Press noted in reports published the following day. In all, Smith scored seven goals over 45 games with Calgary before he was sent down to the Birmingham Bulls of the CHL. There, he registered 11 points in 10 games before the Bulls folded abruptly on February 20, 1981. Eight days later, Smith was on the move again, this time to Detroit, where he was traded for Rick Vasko, scoring 5 goals in 20 games for his highest NHL season total of 12.\nSplitting the next four years between Detroit and its farm team, Smith was named an American Hockey League All-Star after registering 72 points with the Adirondack Red Wings in 1984–85. Playing the final game of the season with Detroit, Smith scored, then suited up for the playoffs, setting up a goal by John Ogrodnick and fighting Al Secord.\n\"Though he spent much of last season in the minors,\" wrote The Toronto Star's Wayne Parish on Nov 6, 1985, \"he was magnificent in playing every single Red Wing playoff game.\"\nAfter five years in the Detroit organization, The Windsor Star's Jim McKay reported on July 6, 1985, that Smith had turned down a one-year contract offer to test the free-agent market. Signed instead by Toronto for two years, \"Motor City Smitty\", as he was nicknamed by then Leafs' radio man Bill Waters, enjoyed his most productive years on hockey's biggest stage, Maple Leaf Gardens. During the 1985–86 season, Smith registered a career NHL high 17 assists to go along with his five goals over 42 games. As reported by Rick Fraser of The Toronto Star on March 19, 1986, Smith was nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL player best exemplifying perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to the game. He also had an excellent playoff showing, scoring twice (one of which involved a lesson in geometry as he shot from the corner, banking the puck off St. Louis Blues goaltender Greg Millen's pads and into the net for Toronto's only goal in the game seven Norris Final 2–1 loss) and adding an assist in six post-season games.\nIn game two of that second-round series, Smith chased an errant puck and Blues' defenceman Lee Norwood into the corner, taking Norwood hard into the boards. Norwood responded by sucker punching Smith from behind, and essentially poking Smith in the eye with the thumb of his glove. As Smith felt for blood, looking at his hand, Norwood punched Smith from behind again. The gratuitous clip made \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and today remains something of a cult classic on YouTube. More importantly, Toronto scored the tying goal on the ensuing power play, then the winner, and got back into the series. Smith's shiner, meanwhile, became the local rallying point on the front page of The Toronto Sun, while \"Hockey Night in Canada\" began coverage of game three with a live close-up of Smith's eye under the harsh studio lights. Historically, the incident is seen as a key momentum shift in what would now turn into a seven-game series.\nCoached in Toronto by Dan Maloney and John Brophy respectively, Smith's skills were best utilized with the Maple Leafs, where his key role was to \"change the pace of the game\". The Toronto Star's Frank Orr deemed Smith \"an adrenalin player\" while Brophy saw Smith as \"a whirling dervish\" who could stray from a disciplined checking role at the flip of a switch, leaving his wing, generally skating all over the ice, and playing what Brophy termed a \"helter-skelter\" style designed to throw the opposition's systems into chaos—an infuriating trait that would eventually get Smith's name on the Stanley Cup.\nIn a \"Toronto Star\" article dated, January 27, 1986, Don Cherry described Smith as \"one of the best cornermen in the league\". Cherry also liked the fact that fights were a big part of Smith's game. And while one of hockey's last 11 helmetless warriors seldom won, he seldom lost, holding his own against the likes of Clark Gillies, Stan Jonathan, \"Mad Dog\" Bob Kelly, Joey Kocur, Lindy Ruff, and Glen Cochrane. As a Maple Leaf, Smith faced his former team, the Red Wings, on November 15, 1986, in Toronto, fighting Gerard Gallant on the opening face-off, then going on to drop the gloves three more times that game. So distracted were the Wings by their former teammate that Toronto was up 6–0 by the time Smith was ejected and served with 57 minutes, etching his name in Maple Leaf records as the most penalized Leaf in a single game. It was also Toronto's most penalized game in franchise history, as noted in team records. Smith was again a stalwart playoff performer in 1986–87, scoring a game-winning breakaway goal to clinch Toronto's 1987 opening-round series win over the St. Louis Blues on April 16 of that year. At that point, the Leafs had not won a best-of-seven playoff series since 1978, and they would not win another playoff series period until 1993, making Smith's goal, arguably, the most important over a span of 15 years in Toronto Maple Leafs history. More recently, the goal is celebrated in the Hockey Night in Canada DVD box set, Ten Great Leafs and Their Most Memorable Games.\nWhile in Toronto, Smith also set up goals for Wendel Clark to both tie and surpass the Leafs' rookie goal-scoring mark on March 3, 1986, against the Winnipeg Jets, a game in which Smith deployed a remarkable behind-the-back pass to set up Clark's second goal of the game, an open-netter to break the record. The following day, \"Toronto Star\" columnist Wayne Parrish thus described the play: \"Smith's behind-the-back pass to set up Clark's second goal was vintage Gretzky.\" Earlier, Smith picked an errant pass out of the air with his stick (which Parrish deemed \"a pretty piece of work\") to set up the drive in which Clark tied the rookie mark.\nPost-playing career.\nSmith's playing career ended in the fall of 1987 following a hit by Clark during an intrasquad training camp game. Having just signed a three-year contract, Smith eventually retired as a result of the back injury, running a charter-fishing business before returning home to Windsor in 1989 to coach the Spitfires for years. After returning the Spitfires to respectability, Smith joined the Edmonton Oilers' scouting staff in 1991, serving under Glen Sather.\nAt the start of the 1995–96 season, Smith became a scout for the Colorado Avalanche. There, he enjoyed perhaps his finest moment, deconstructing Scotty Bowman's left-wing lock during the 1996 playoffs and neutralizing it as Colorado beat the favoured Red Wings and went on to win the Stanley Cup. \"Smith noticed the Red Wings' left wingers, who stayed back to help the defense, were small,\" \"The Sporting News\" reported, \"so the Avalanche made sure to softly dump the puck into the right corner, where the Avs' forwards pounced. This wore down Detroit's left wingers.\" Colorado won the series, and by the time the Avalanche swept the Florida Panthers in the finals, Detroit general manager Ken Holland was publicly crediting Smith with that key assist in Colorado's successful run. The Avalanche won another Cup in 2001, and Smith's name is now engraved on the Stanley Cup. He currently serves as the Avalanche's director of player personnel.\nIn October, 2009, Smith was inducted into the Windsor-Essex County Sports Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Howard Glenn Richards, Jr. (born August 7, 1959) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks. He played college football for the Missouri Tigers.\nEarly years.\nRichards was born on August 7, 1959, in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1969, Richards had to be bussed (because of desegregation) to be a part of the St. Louis Public School's gifted program at Wade Elementary School, which he previously began at Walnut Park Elementary School.\nHe attended Southwest High School, where as a freshman he practiced baseball, basketball and football. Richards limited his playing time on football and basketball in his sophomore and junior seasons. As a senior, he just focused on football.\nCollege career.\nRichards accepted a football scholarship from the University of Missouri. He started 4 games as a true freshman, which was the beginning of a 40 consecutive games starts streak at right tackle, under head coaches Al Onofrio (1977) and Warren Powers (1978-80).\nHe became a standout offensive tackle and was named to the All-Big Eight team as a junior and senior. In his last year in 1980, he was named offensive co-captain and received second-team All-American honors. He played in the Senior Bowl and the Hula Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn the 1981 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys were targeting cornerback Bobby Butler with their first round selection, but settled on Richards (26th overall) after Butler was taken by the Atlanta Falcons. This was only the third time in franchise history that the Cowboys used a first round pick on an offensive lineman, with John Niland and Robert Shaw being chosen before.\nIn Richards' second season, he was the starter at left guard, but split time the next year with All-Pro Herb Scott.\nIn 1984, Richards had a chance to replace the retiring Pat Donovan at left tackle, but was replaced by Phil Pozderac after suffering a torn groin muscle. He eventually started four games at left tackle, before missing the last four games of the season due to a torn quadriceps injury, that required season-ending surgery. He was the recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award at the end of the season.\nRichards had three solid years, before injuries caused him to miss time over the next two seasons. He began 1985 on the physically unable to perform list and was not activated until October 24. Richards was named the starter at right guard for the 1986 season, but injuries stalled his progress again and he only appeared in nine games (two starts).\nRichards was waived on June 18, 1987, along with many other well-known Cowboys veterans, after the franchise's first losing season in 22 years. Although he was a part of two NFC East division championships and two consecutive NFC championship game appearances, Richards' career was marred by injuries and struggles to regain his top form.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nIn 1987, after the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Richards was signed on October 7 to be a part of the Seattle Seahawks replacement team.\nHe played in two games, before suffering a knee injury against the Detroit Lions and being placed on the injured reserve list on October 20. He retired at the end of the season.\nPersonal life.\nRichards served for 13 years at the Central Intelligence Agency.

        "title": "Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing",
        "text": "Evander Holyfield's \"Real Deal\" Boxing is a boxing video game that was developed by ACME Interactive and published by Sega in 1992, released for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Game Gear consoles. It was followed by a sequel in 1993, \"Greatest Heavyweights\", which featured a number of improvements.\nOverview.\nThe game features Evander Holyfield, and over 28 imaginary fighters. It uses 2D sprites seen from a side-on view, combined with a top-down map of the ring, to allow boxers to move 360 degrees about the ring. The cartridge utilises battery-backed RAM to save a player's progress.\nGameplay.\nDuring a fight, each boxer has an energy meter that decreases whenever they are hit. When the energy meter reaches zero, that player's boxer will suffer a knockdown. The meter is not affected by how much physical activity the boxer engages in (apart from getting punched). In addition, there is a meter for the boxer's head and body, which shows how much damage each of these areas has sustained. When the head or body meters reach zero, that boxer will take much more damage when hit in that area. Regardless of how much damage a boxer receives, punches reduce a fighter's energy bar by a consistent amount (unlike in many boxing games, where punches sometimes vary by how likely they are to knock a boxer down, causing serious damage in the process).\nIf a boxer has received large amount of damage to either their head or their body, and they continue to be punched in that area, the fight will soon end in a TKO. Large amounts of punishment to the head will also result in visible cuts. A TKO will also result if a boxer is knocked down three times. However, unlike in real-life boxing matches, a boxer can be pummelled for an entire fight without throwing one punch in return, but unless they are knocked down three times, or suffer extreme damage to either their head or body, the fight will be allowed to continue. Similarly, fight judges will not score a round as 10-8 unless a fighter is knocked down. The only exception to this is if the scoring of a round as 10-9 would result in a draw. In such an instance, the round will be scored 10–8 to the fighter who won the round. This system of scoring is unrealistic, because in real boxing matches, a round is sometimes scored 10-8 if one boxer has been badly pummelled. It is also possible for boxers to pause and hurl insults during a fight, such as \"come on and fight you wimp!\".\nCareer mode.\nIn career mode, the player fights their way through the 28 selectable imaginary boxers in the game, with the last of these being against Holyfeld himself, for the World Heavyweight Title. Following the attainment of the title, the player then fights in a number of 'challenge' matches, against high-ranked contenders. Some of these fights include imaginary fighters who were previously unseen in the rankings. After a certain number of fights (usually 20-25) the player's boxer will weaken and it will be increasingly more difficult to keep his attributes at a high level. Once the career of the player's boxer reaches 40 fights, he will have to retire. This prevents gamers from repeatedly fighting the same low-ranked, low-quality boxers in order to receive more training (and thus better attributes, making the game easier) at an early stage of their career. If the player beats Holyfield he will also decline and fall down the rankings until he eventually retires as well. Only resetting the internal memory of the game can bring Holyfield back to his optimum form.\nIn career mode, the player must create their own boxer; they cannot use any of the game's pre-created boxers. Options to edit are: name, body size, handedness, skin colour and short colour - with selectable colours including: red, green, gold, purple, dark blue, cyan and yellow. An unlockable boxer named \"The Beast\" (unlocked by entering that as his name) wears silver. Each boxer in the game also has four attributes: power, speed, stamina and defense. These attributes all vary widely between the 30 boxers featured in the game (Evander Holyfield has the maximum rating on all of them). During career mode, all of the attributes can be increased by selecting various training activities, such as free weights sessions or a protein diet. Many of these portray somewhat unusual ways for a fighter to attempt to improve their boxing ability; for example, taking Karate lessons, paying a visit to a health club, or obtaining an iron gum shield.\nIn exhibition mode, the player can choose to pit any boxer against any other, with the option to make each fighter controlled by either a player or the console.\nThe game gradually replaces aging or low-ranked boxers (including Holyfield) with new ones as Career Mode progresses.\nOther boxers.\nThe 28 fictional boxers are (at factory default settings):\nPresentation.\nThe visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers, and a simple 3D rendering of the ring. A small, overhead map of the ring, featuring both fighters' positions, is also visible during fights. Thus, using this as a navigation aide, it is possible to move boxers 360 degrees around the ring. However, the boxers' lateral movement appears somewhat unusual, due to their sprites being drawn from one side-on point of view.\nDigitized speech is used to:\nIt is also used for the taunts that computer-controlled boxers will sometimes say during a fight. There are also grunts and groans that emphasize the impact of some punches. There are also audible crowd effects; if a boxer lands a damaging punch, the crowd will cheer in approval, whereas if there is a lack of action, they will make evident their disapproval with boos and jeers. As a boxer's rank advances, more spectators appear in the crowd.\nReception.\nMean Machines (UK) awarded the Mega Drive version 52%, saying: \"Some good ideas and some impressive graphics ruined by awful gameplay and in-game logic.\" Glenn Rubenstein of Wizard magazine gave the genesis version a score of A− praising the graphics, the realistic gameplay and the feature to customize your boxer. The only criticism he had was some of the characters movements are too choppy concluding: \"This game is a must have for boxing fans of all ages and anyone who likes sports games.\" the four reviewers of Mega Play gave the genesis version posistive reviews praising the graphics, sound effects, animation and the ability to customize your characters. One reviewer felt the gameplay was robotic and lacks variety in punching and techniques."

He later became an executive with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Morrison was born in Toronto, Ontario.\nMorrison is the son of longtime NHL defender Jim Morrison, who appeared in three All-Star Games in the 1950s.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Morrison played in the 1975 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mississauga.\nMorrison played his junior hockey for the Peterborough Petes and was selected in the second round, 34th overall, in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. He was the second Pete taken by the Kings, who had also drafted Morrison's junior teammate and future Hall of Famer Larry Murphy with their first selection.\nMorrison spent two more seasons in Peterborough before turning pro, although his solid development saw him receive brief callups to the NHL in both the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons, appearing in a total of 7 games for the Kings. He was also selected to play for Canada in the 1982 World Junior Championships, where he helped his country win their first-ever Gold Medal in that tournament.\nIn 1982–83, Morrison turned pro and split the season between the Kings and the New Haven Nighthawks of the American Hockey League. He registered 3 goals and 6 points in 24 games in Los Angeles, and added a respectable 23 goals in 59 games on the farm. However, after a slow start to the 1983–84 season, Morrison was released by the Kings and was signed by the Vancouver Canucks. Morrison spent the majority of two seasons playing in the minors in Vancouver's system, playing just 8 games for the club in the 1984–85 season without scoring a point.\nFollowing his release by the Canucks in 1985, Morrison signed on with a German club and would spend the next 14 seasons playing in leagues in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Britain. His most successful stint was with the Kassel Huskies of the DEL, where he served as team captain from 1994 through 1997. He also served as captain of the Manchester Storm in England from 1997 until 1999.\nMorrison retired as a player in 1999 to take a job as a scout with the Vancouver Canucks. In his career, he appeared in 39 NHL games, recording 3 goals and 3 assists for 6 points along with 4 penalty minutes.\nScouting career.\nMorrison was hired by the Vancouver Canucks as an amateur scout in 1999 and served in that position until 2004. He joined the Toronto Maple Leafs as an amateur scout in 2004 and served in that role for the team until 2006, when he was promoted to Director of Amateur Scouting. On July 28, 2015, the Leafs announced that Morrison had changed jobs from Director of Amateur Scouting to Director of Pro Scouting, which he held for two years before becoming Director of Player Personnel."

There were 183 participants from 57 nations in the race over 221.85 km, with 116 cyclists finishing. For the first time, the event was open to professionals. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was five, up from three in previous editions of the event. The event was won by Pascal Richard of Switzerland, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race and first medal in the event since a bronze in 1936. Rolf Sørensen earned Denmark's third medal in the event, silver just as in 1964 and 1968. Max Sciandri similarly matched Great Britain's best result: a bronze, as in 1896 and 1956.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; with the re-introduction of the time trial in Atlanta, this was the first time that both events were held at the same Games. The 1996 Games were also the first to allow top professional riders to compete; this also resulted in lengthening the distance of the course and increasing the number of riders per nation (to increase teamwork opportunity). There was no clear favorite in the race. Miguel Induráin of Spain was the most prominent cyclist competing, but his skills were far more suited to the time trial—in which he would take gold three days later.\nAlbania, Armenia, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Oman, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 15th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 221.85 kilometre course over the Buckhead Cycling Course in Atlanta. The distance had been increased from previous Olympic road races to be more consistent with professional races.\nResults.\nA three-man breakout occurred with 33 kilometres to go, with Richard, Sørensen, and Sciandri getting clear o the peloton. The final sprint went to Richard. A second group of three formed as well, this time with the home-nation cyclist Andreu winning the sprint for fourth place."

        "text": "The 1974 Giro d'Italia was the 57th running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Vatican City, on 16 May, with a stage and concluded in Milan, on 8 June, with leg. A total of 140 riders from fourteen teams entered the 22-stage race, that was won by Belgian Eddy Merckx of the Molteni team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Gianbattista Baronchelli (Scic) and Felice Gimondi (Bianchi), respectively.\nAmongst the other classifications that the race awarded, Roger De Vlaeminck () won the points classification and José Manuel Fuente of KAS won the mountains classification. KAS finished as the winners of the team points classification. Merckx's victory in the 1974 Giro was his first step in completing the Triple Crown of Cycling–winning the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the World Championship road race in one calendar year–becoming the first rider ever to do so.\nTeams.\nA total of fourteen teams were invited to participate in the 1974 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 140 cyclists. Three riders from Rokado did not start the race after enrolling, which reduced the starting field to 137. From the riders that began this edition, 96 made it to the finish Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nReigning champion and four-time winner Eddy Merckx () returned to the race in 1974 to defend his crown and to claim fifth victory and join the likes of Alfredo Binda and Fausto Coppi who also had five Giro victories. He arrived to the race the day before after racing in the Four Days of Dunkirk. Merckx came into the Giro d'Italia after not having won a single spring classic for the first time since 1965. In March, he was forced to take a rest from cycling due to a respiratory ailment. Merckx gradually returned to racing after beating the illness in late March, and writer Giuliano Califano stated that several experts found him to be in great form coming into the Giro. \"La Stampa\" writer Gianni Pignata felt Merckx's form and his poor performances in the early season would provide motivation for this race. In particular, he referenced Merckx's poor sprinting in the early season and how the Giro was his first race longer than seven stages this season. Merckx himself told a radiohost \"After my long illness, I am now in an increasing form and I estimate myself already for 80 hundred of my means,\" before the race started.\nJosé Manuel Fuente (Kas) was thought to have entered the Giro in good form after winning the Vuelta a España weeks earlier. Pignata commented that Fuente would provide Merckx a stiff opposition through his ability to attack in the mountains, but his poor time trialing ability was his weakness. \"l'Unita\" interviewed several of the riders and many named Merckx as the favorite to take the victory. The third main contender to win the race named by the media was reigning world champion Felice Gimondi (Bianchi). Gimondi was viewed to have a strong team for support which included former world champion and sprinter Marino Basso, Antoine Houbrechts, and Martín Emilio Rodríguez, among others. Gimondi downplayed his chances stating that he was not 20 year-old anymore and \"... it takes me a long time to get into action.\"\nScic's Gianbattista Baronchelli, Tour de l'Avenir winner Giovanni Battaglin (Jolly Ceramica), and Francesco Moser (Filcas) as three young riders who have the potential to become stars during the race. Despite suffering an accident early in the season, Pignata believed Battaglin's participation in the Tour de Romandie provided a great lead-up into the Giro. Moser was thought to have a strong season and showed a sprinting prowess as evidenced by his second place in Paris–Roubaix. Pignata ultimately concluded that these younger riders should not be cautious during the race as it would play into the hands of Merckx, who then would only have to react to Fuente's attacks. Amid rumors of not participating, Luis Ocaña confirmed his absence due to bronchitis three days prior to the start. \"La Stampa\" columnist Maurizio Caravella gave Merckx a 60% chance to win, while giving Gimondi, Fuente, and Battaglin at 10% chance and Baronchelli and Moser a 5% chance at victory. The peloton also featured 1971 winner Gösta Pettersson (Magniflex).\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1974 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public by race director Vincenzo Torriani on 29 March 1974. It contained one were individual time trial. There were eleven stages containing twenty three categorized climbs, of which four had summit finishes: stage 11a, to Il Cioccio; stage 16, to Monte Generoso; stage 18, to Borgo Valsugana; and stage 20, to Tre Cime di Lavaredo. In total the race route contained of official climbing across the twenty-three climbs. The organizers chose to include two rest days, in Capri and Sanremo. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, lacked a prologue, and had the same number of rest days and individual time trials. In addition, this race contained two more stages, as well as one more set of half stages. In Italy, the race was televised daily in thirty-minute segments at during the evening on the second channel of RAI. The race, however, was still to be broadcast normally over radio.\nUpon the release of the route in March, \"La Stampa\" writer Gianni Pignata believed that the first leg of the split eleventh stage, to Il Cioccio, along with stages 20 and 21, which featured eight total climbs in the Dolomites, would be decisive in determining the race's winner. Pignata believed this edition of the Giro d'Italia was geared towards climbers. He added that if a rider wanted to best Merckx, he would need to make his move earlier in the race and not wait for the Dolomites, as Merckx would likely be in top form by then. After looking over the race route, Italian rider Basso stated that there were few opportunities for sprinters to try and win a stage. Two-time winner Gimondi felt the race started off hard and agreed with Pignata and Basso, in that the race favored climbers and lacked chances for sprint finishes. He stated that the route suited the riding styles of Ocaña, Merckx, and Jose Manuel Fuente. In addition, Gimondi criticized Torriani for placing a rest day in after the third day of racing, stating that there was no justification for it there. The route did not enter the high mountains until 27 May, which was thought to work against Fuente's chances to win the race and take advantage of Merckx's unknown condition.\nRace overview.\nThe first day of racing was gearing up to finish with a bunch sprint, when neo-professional cyclist Wilfried Reybrouck attacked with 400 meters to go. Reybrouck managed to hold off the chasing sprinters Roger De Vlaeminck and Basso, among others to win the stage. A strike had been rumored to happen on the race route near Naples, which caused the riders to stick together and not attack. The pack of riders finished together, with Belgian Patrick Sercu taking the stage victory. The third stage featured a late climb of Mount Faito, where José Manuel Fuente attacked ten kilometers from the summit and rode 25 kilometers solo to the finish. Merckx, Baronchelli, Gimondi, Moser, and other general classification hopefuls remained behind and attacked each other within the group until the finish. The group finished 33 seconds after Fuente, but Merckx, who had been dropped, lost 42 seconds to Fuente, along with some other riders. Race leader Reybrouck lost the lead to Fuente upon finishing thirty minutes behind and ultimately being eliminated from the race because he finished outside the time limit. This was the first time a rider had gone from leading the race to being disqualified after the next stage in the race's history.\nThe following stage was interrupted 102 kilometers into the day for five minutes because of a strike conducted in response to a dam built. Pierino Gavazzi won the first stage of his career upon beating the likes of De Vlaeminck and Franco Bitossi. During the sprint, José Gonzales Linares and Jos Huysmans led out their teammates respective teammates Fuente and Merckx, but were found guilty of illegally boosting their teammates during the sprint. The four riders were fined 50,000 lire each and relegated to 37th position on the stage. The sixth leg had little action until the final twenty kilometers, when the headwinds picked up and splintered the peloton into several groups just hundreds of meters apart. Giacinto Santambrogio made a move closer to the finish line and rode solo until Bitossi joined him. Eventually Bitossi dropped Santambrogio and then held off the charging sprinters in order to win the day, which was his 100th career victory.\nUgo Colombo won the race's seventh leg after telling race leader Fuente he was riding up the road to greet some family - as is custom - although none of his family lived anywhere near the region. Colombo was allowed a maximum advantage of around thirteen minutes before the peloton closed the gap to within one minute. The race for second place brought out the general classification contenders as there was a slight incline near the end of the stage. In particular, Francesco Moser, Merckx, and De Vlaeminck attacked several times and Fuente could not counter, allowing the riders to gain seven seconds on the race lead. The eighth leg of the race was a rather flat stage that featured heavy winds throughout the stage. During the stage a dog ran in the road and caused a reaction in the peloton, but no injuries or falls were reported. As the main field rode under the kilometer to go banner, they had just caught the leading rider Zilioli who had made a last ditch solo effort to win the stage. Merckx opened up the sprint as the group made the final bend into the final 200 meters. His wheel skidded out and forced him to ride and graze the barriers, which hindered several sprinters who had been using his slipstream. Bitossi and Martín Emilio Rodríguez (Bianchi) contested the sprint the best, with Bitossi taking the day after coming of Rodríguez' wheel.\nDoping.\nThere were doping controls.\nClassification leadership.\nThere were three main individual classifications contested in the 1974 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Three of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was denoted by the green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. The first rider to cross the Tre Cime di Lavaredo was Spanish rider José Manuel Fuente.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the neo-professional competition. The classification was determined in the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing).\nAftermath.\nThis victory in the race gave Merckx five career victories at the Giro d'Italia, equaling the record of Binda and Coppi. In July, Merckx entered the Tour de France. He emerged victorious, winning eight stages en route to his fifth career Tour victory, again equaling the record for career Tour victories. He won the Tour by a margin of eight minutes and four seconds over the second-place finisher and thus became the only cyclist to win the Giro and Tour in the same year three times in a career. In August, he won the men's road race at the 1974 UCI Road World Championships and became the first rider to achieve the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. For his career successes in the Giro d'Italia, Merckx became the first rider inducted into the race's Hall of Fame in 2012. When being inducted, Merckx was given the modern-day trophy with the winners engraved until 1974, the last year he won the race."

        "text": "The 1973 Giro d'Italia was the 56th running of the Giro, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in Verviers, Belgium, on 18 May, with a prologue and concluded with a mass-start stage, on 9 June. A total of 140 riders from fourteen teams entered the 20-stage race, that was won by Belgian Eddy Merckx of the Molteni team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Felice Gimondi and Giovanni Battaglin, respectively.\nIn addition to the general classification, Merckx won the points classification. Amongst the other classifications that the race awarded, José Manuel Fuente of KAS won the mountains classification. Molteni finished as the winners of the team points classification.\nTeams.\nA total of fourteen teams were invited to participate in the 1973 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 140 cyclists. From the riders that began this edition, 113 made it to the finish on the Trieste.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nReigning and three-time champion Eddy Merckx (Molteni) announced he would race both the Vuelta a España and Giro. The break between these two races was only five days. Despite this, and coming off a victory at the Vuelta, Merckx entered the race favorite. Juan Del Bosque of \"El Mundo Deportivo\" stated that with the easy route, it won't make Merckx exert much effort to win for a fourth time. Merckx was believed to have a very strong team supporting him at the race, including the likes of Roger Swerts, Victor Van Schil, and Jos Deschoenmaecker, among others.\nFelice Gimondi (Bianchi), who won the race in 1967 and 1969, was not viewed to be in good condition entering the race. Despite this he was still viewed as a contender for the overall crown. Molteni director Giorgio Albani felt Merckx's strongest competitor would be Gimondi. Albani elaborated that the Spaniards José Manuel Fuente, Francisco Galdós, and Santiago Lazcano were all dangerous riders in the mountains, but not threats for the overall crown. The KAS team was regarded as a strong opponent to the Molteni squad because of their climbing prowess. Specifically, the writer felt Fuente had performed very little during the 1973 campaign. One writer found Roger De Vlaeminck (Brooklyn) to be a dark horse for the general classification, while another source felt he would be Merckx's biggest threat. Fuente ordered a bike from Faliero Maso (who made bikes for Fausto Coppi) which was said to be a very light bike which should give him more stability. Former winner Gianni Motta (Zonca) also competed in the race and was viewed as a capable rider, but noted that his performances were irregular and his season had been lackluster up to that point. 1971 winner Gösta Pettersson (Ferretti), was viewed as a challenger for the general classification, but one writer felt he lost his \"punch.\" Italo Zilioli (Dreher), Franco Bitossi (Sammontana), and Michele Dancelli (Scic) were other Italian riders that had chances to place high in the general classification.\nMarino Basso (Bianchi), Gerben Karstens (Ovest Rokado), Rik Van Linden (Ovest Rokado), Patrick Sercu (Brooklyn), and Bitossi were thought to be the riders that would contend for the stages that finished in bunch sprints. Van Linden and Sercu had beaten the reigning world champion Basso several times during the season so far and one writer stated that he \"will have a lot to do if he wants to be worthy of his rainbow jersey.\"\nFrench filmmaker Claude Lelouch announced he would be making a film that centered around Merckx, which would incorporate footage from the Vuelta a España earlier in the year, along with this Giro d'Italia.\nRoute and stages.\nPrior to 1973, there were rumors that the race would be starting in Belgium. Race director Vincenzo Torriani revealed the race route on 5 March 1973. The route was announced to be over the course of twenty stages that included one individual time trial, while it began with a prologue around Verviers, Wallonia. The race was regarded to have six flat stages and eight \"wavy\" stages. There were eleven stages containing twenty categorized climbs that awarded points for the mountains classification, with no summit finishes in the race. In total, the race climbed , less than the previous year. The average length of each stage was . The route did feature two rest days, on 23 May in Aosta and 4 June in Forte dei Marmi. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, included a prologue, two less individual time trails, four less summit finishes, and had the same number of rest days.\nThe route was announced to start in Verviers, before heading towards Italy, passing through The Netherlands, West Germany, Luxembourg, France, and Switzerland. It was branded the \"Tour of Europe.\" It was reported that roughly 50 million liras were paid to the Giro d'Italia from Verviers, Cologne, and the European Economic Community. The transfer from Strasbourg to Geneva was over . The route notably finished in Trieste, rather than in Milan, the normal finish for the race. In addition, the route did not visit the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, to which Squibbs from \"L'Impartial\" stated that \"no one will complain\" with regards to Sardinia, while Sicily he felt made the \"tifosi\" in various areas of the region \"scream.\" The route as a whole does not venture into the southern half of Italy. It was believed to be that the reason for the avoidance of Milan and other larger cities in the 1973 route came from their large unruly crowds and recent social unrest. The Dolomites were featured in the last two stages of the race.\nUpon release of the route in March, some thought it was not a difficult route and Torriani did not want to give Merckx an advantage. Gino Sala of \"l'Unita\" wrote following the route's initial reveal that Torriani may throw in some obstacles before the race started that were not in the presented route in March. With the announcement of the route that traveled through so many European nations, Sala speculated that Tour de France organizer Félix Lévitan would try to one-up the Giro for their 1974 race. Squibbs felt the route was well balanced and intelligently designed and thought the harder portions reserved for the very end would make the race garner more interest. \nClassification leadership.\nThere were three main individual classifications contested in the 1973 Giro d'Italia, as well as a team competition. Three of them awarded jerseys to their leaders. The general classification was the most important and was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Giro. The rider leading the classification wore a pink jersey to signify the classification's leadership.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top positions in a stage finish, with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points. The rider leading this classification wore a purple (or cyclamen) jersey. The mountains classification was the third classification and its leader was designated by a green jersey. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. Most stages of the race included one or more categorized climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo di Giau. The first rider to cross the Passo di Giau was Spanish rider José Manuel Fuente.\nThe final classification, the team classification, awarded no jersey to its leaders. This was calculated by adding together points earned by each rider on the team during each stage through the intermediate sprints, the categorized climbs, stage finishes, etc. The team with the most points led the classification.\nThere were other minor classifications within the race, including the neo-professional competition. The classification was determined in the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). The combination classification was a points classification that was tabulated by adding the ranks of a riders position in the general, points, and mountains classifications.\nAftermath.\nThe race is documented in Jørgen Leth's 1974 film \"Stars and Watercarriers\" (\"Stjernerne og Vandbærerne\")."

The season started despite the expiration of MLB's previous collective bargaining agreement at the end of 1993. It was the first season played under the current three-division format in each league. It was also the first with an Opening Night game involving two National League teams, which did not become permanent until 1996.\nStrike.\nAs a result of a players' strike, the MLB season ended prematurely on August 11, 1994. No postseason (including the World Series) was played. Over 260 players were scheduled to exceed $1 million in compensation in 1994. The Minor League Baseball season was played in its entirety.\nTelevision coverage.\nThis was the first season of The Baseball Network, the joint venture between MLB, ABC, and NBC. Meanwhile, ESPN renewed its contract for \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and \"Wednesday Night Baseball\".\nUnder The Baseball Network's original plan, the All-Star Game would alternate between NBC in even-numbered years and ABC in odd-numbered years. After the All-Star Game was complete, ABC took over coverage with what was to be their weekly slate of games under the \"Baseball Night in America\" banner. ABC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Saturdays or Mondays in prime time. NBC would then pick up where ABC left off by televising six more regular season Friday night games. Every \"Baseball Night in America\" game was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (or 8 p.m. Pacific Time if the game occurred on the West Coast). A single starting time gave the networks the opportunity to broadcast one game and then, simultaneously, cut to another game when there was a break in action. \nThe networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service (such as ESPN or superstations like Chicago's WGN-TV or Atlanta's WTBS) or over-the-air broadcaster was allowed to telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. \"Baseball Night in America\" (which premiered on July 16, 1994) usually aired up to fourteen games based on the viewers' region (affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional coast-to-coast format. Normally, announcers who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were paired with each other. More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-\"national\" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.\nPostseason coverage would have also alternated between the two networks. In even-numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series.\nWhen the player's strike began on August 12, ABC had only aired games on four of its six scheduled dates, while NBC's slate was supposed to begin on August 26. \nMovies.\nThe following are baseball movies released in 1994:"

        "text": "Mike Stevens (born December 30, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 23 games in the National Hockey League with the Vancouver Canucks, Boston Bruins, New York Islanders, and Toronto Maple Leafs. Stevens spent the bulk of his career in the minor American Hockey League, and also spent time in the International Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He is the younger brother of Scott Stevens, who was also played in the NHL and inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nStevens played his junior hockey with the Kitchener Rangers, the same team as his brother Scott, and was selected 58th overall in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks. While still playing in Kitchener in 1984–85, he received a surprise six-game callup to the Canucks, recording three assists. However, he would have a difficult transition to pro hockey, struggling to produce in two seasons in Vancouver's farm system with the Fredericton Express of the American Hockey League. He did, however, make himself a physical presence, recording over 200 penalty minutes both years.\nPrior to the 1986–87, Stevens was sold to the Boston Bruins. He broke through offensively in the AHL scoring 30 goals, and was called up to the Bruins for seven games, recording an assist. However, he was released by the Bruins after the season and signed with the New York Islanders for the 1987–88 campaign. He would appear in nine games for the Islanders, recording his only NHL goal.\nHe played one final NHL game for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1989–90, and played in the minor league systems of the New York Rangers and Calgary Flames during the mid-1990s. His best professional season came in 1992–93, when he recorded 92 points in 68 games for the Binghamton Rangers. In 12 seasons of minor-pro hockey, he recorded 2668 penalty minutes, an average of over 220 per year. He signed at Adler Mannheim 1997, and spent seven seasons there before retiring in 2004.\nStevens appeared in 23 NHL games, recording 1 goal and 4 assists for 5 points."

        "title": "1989 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 1989 Giro d'Italia was the 72nd edition of the race. It started off in Taormina on 21 May with a flat stage that ended in Catania. The race concluded in Florence with a individual time trial on 11 June. Twenty-two teams entered the race, which was won by the Frenchman Laurent Fignon of the Super U team. Second and third respectively were the Italian Flavio Giupponi and the American rider, Andrew Hampsten.\nIn the race's other classifications, Vladimir Poulnikov of the Alfa Lum-STM finished the Giro as the best neo-professional in the general classification, finishing in eleventh place overall; Café de Colombia rider Luis Herrera won the mountains classification, Giovanni Fidanza of the Chateau d'Ax-Salotti team won the points classification, and rider Jure Pavlič won the inaugural intergiro classification. Fagor - MBK finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nThere were 22 teams that were invited to compete in the 1989 Giro d'Italia. Each team consisted of nine riders, so the Giro started with 198 riders. Of the 198 riders that started the race, 141 of them reached the finish line in Florence. The peloton featured for the first time Soviet riders as a ban on cyclists becoming professional. These Soviet cyclists competed for Alfa Lum, a team of nine Soviets.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nMany expected the winner of the race to be a foreign, non-Italian rider. Several riders were seen as contenders for the overall crown. \"La Liberté\" named the following contenders: Hampsten, Greg LeMond, Luis Herrera, Erik Breukink, Laurent Fignon, Phil Anderson, Urs Zimmermann, and Claude Criquielion. \"De Telegraaf\" listed the three favorites to be Breukink, Hampsten, and Roche. Former winner Stephen Roche returned to the Giro following a year absence and recently visited a doctor in Munich to treat one of his knees. Roche was anticipated to receive a poor welcome due to how he won the Giro in 1987 by taking the lead from Italian and teammate Roberto Visentini. Reigning champion Hampsten entered the Giro after showing good forming in the early calendar races. Hampsten himself stated he felt good entering the race and stated the route did not offer many opportunities to recover. In addition, Hampsten had been specifically training for the individual time trial in his home in Boulder, Colorado in the weeks preceding the race's start. When asked about the inclusion of the Passo di Gavia – which was crossed the previous year in blizzard conditions on a day where Hampsten secured the race lead – Hampsten hoped to \"... cross that mountain when the sun shines.\" Breukink was seen as the best hope for a Dutch rider to win the Giro due to third and second-place finishes in 1987 and 1988, respectively. Fignon and Zimmmermann were seen as strong contenders to compete for the victory following their joint attack on the Col de la Croix in the Tour de Romandie. Fignon, a two-time winner of the Tour de France, entered the Giro for the first time since his controversial loss to Francesco Moser in 1984. In the years after his first Tour victory in 1984, Fignon's seasons were plagued by poor performances due to a variety of injuries. He had returned to form starting in 1988 with a win in Milan–San Remo, which he repeated as champion in 1989. Fignon's teammates were regarded as a weak point for his title hopes as they were felt to be weaker than his previous teams in the early 1980s.\nUrs Freuler was seen as a rider to contend for his fourteenth Giro stage win, while Dutch sprinter Jean-Paul van Poppel was seen as a prominent challenger for Freuler in the sprint stages. Zimmermann was seen as a candidate to win if he could limit his losses in the time trials. Herrera, Criquielion, and Maurizio Fondriest all rode their first Giro. \"Limburgsch dagblad\" felt the race attracted most top tier riders to participate except for Pedro Delgado, Charly Mottet, and Steven Rooks, among others. Luis Gómez of \"El País\" felt the main novelty of the race was the presence of the Alfa Lum team rostered with Soviet riders, including the likes of 23-year old Dimitri Konyshev whom they hoped would finish high overall. He also felt LeMond's form was poor. Herrera came to the Giro hoping for success as the stages were shorter than the Tour's and the general pace of the Giro is slower than the Tour. Lejaretta hoped to challenge for stage wins in the mountains due to the toughness climbs. Fondriest was seen as the main Italian hope as he was an all-rounder who was only 24-years of age.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1989 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani, on 21 January 1989. It contained four time trial events, three of which were individual and one a team event. There were fourteen stages containing thirty-five categorized climbs, of which three had summit finishes: stage 2, to Mount Etna; stage 8, to Gran Sasso d'Italia; and stage 13, to Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 18, which consisted of a climbing time trial to Monte Generoso. The organizers chose to not include any rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained the number of rest days and time trials, and had one more stage. In addition, this race contained one less set of half stages. After the route had been announced in January, former winner Francesco Moser – who joined the race organizing staff – received criticism as the route was thought to be very difficult and \"heavy.\" This criticism was due to Moser's history of complaining routes were too difficult in the past, when many viewed them not as such.\nThe sixteenth day of racing was thought to be the queen stage of the race as it featured several categorized climbs, including the \"Cima Coppi\", the Passo di Gavia. Due to harsh weather the day of the sixteenth stage and beforehand, much snow had been deposited along the roads that were to be used. Organizers made the choice to cancel the stage because of the conditions that also included sub-freezing temperatures. Riders primarily agreed with the decision as it was best for rider safety, but Hampsten believed that the stage could have provided some chances to attack then race leader Fignon. A \"L'Impartial\" writer described how race organizer Torriani had been creating race routes that favored sprinters and average climbers like Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni in the early 1980s and late 1970s, but had made the race more exciting as of late.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1989 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. There were no time bonuses awarded for stage placings.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. \"The Cima Coppi\" for this Giro was the Passo di Gavia, but due to inclement weather, the stage containing the Gavia was cancelled. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing).\nThe intergiro classification was introduced as a means of making the race more interesting and its leader was denoted by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. The first three to cross the sprint line would receive five, three, and two second time bonuses towards the general classification. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

The IWCC was subsumed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2005, and all other editions have been known simply as the World Cup Qualifier. The number of teams and qualifying places has varied at each tournament – in 2003, six teams competed for two qualifying spots, while at the next edition (in 2008) eight teams contested two qualifying spots. The 2011 event, as well as 2021, saw ten teams compete for three qualifying places, and the 2017 tournament featured ten teams and four qualifying places.

He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, and Milwaukee Brewers from 1965 to 1973.\nEarly years.\nGardner originally signed with the Minnesota Twins in 1963 upon graduation from Binghamton High School in Binghamton, New York. He went 17–11 with a 2.46 earned run average his only season in their farm system. Following the season, he was drafted by the New York Mets in the 1963 first-year draft.\nNew York Mets.\nGardner went 20–10 with a 3.51 ERA over two seasons in the Mets' farm system to earn a call up to the majors in September 1965. He lasted just three innings in his first major league start, giving up seven runs (five earned) in an 8–5 loss to the Houston Astros. However, his most memorable start of the season was his final, in which he pitched fifteen innings of shutout ball against the Philadelphia Phillies in a game that was eventually declared a 0–0 tie after eighteen innings.\nAfter getting off to a 2–0 start in 1966, Gardner lost his next six decisions, and was moved into the bullpen. He earned his first major league save July 26 against the Astros, and finished the season at 4–8 with a 5.12 ERA. He started the 1967 season in the minors, and was shipped to the Chicago Cubs on June 12 with a minor league player to be named later for Bob Hendley.\nCubs and Indians.\nGardner spent one season in Chicago, going 0–2 with a 3.98 ERA for the Cubs. Just prior to the start of the 1968 season, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Bobby Tiefenauer. He went 9–6 with a 4.32 ERA for the Portland Beavers, and made five appearances for the Indians that September.\nGardner was 0–6 with Portland in 1969 when the Indians struck a deal with the New York Yankees for John Orsino.\nTwo trades for two Alou brothers.\nGardner finished the 1969 season with the Yankees' triple A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs. He went 16–5 with a 2.53 ERA for Syracuse in 1970, and appeared in one game for the Yankees that September.\nGardner was traded along with Ron Klimkowski from the Yankees to the Oakland Athletics for Felipe Alou on April 9, 1971. He was sent back to the Yankees with Darrell Osteen for Curt Blefary on May 25, 1971.\nGardner appeared in twenty games and pitched 97 innings for the Yankees in 1972, which was the most he'd pitched since 1966 with the Mets. Following the season, the Yankees traded him back to the A's with a player to be named later for Matty Alou.\nGardner appeared in three games for the A's in 1973 when his contract was purchased by the Milwaukee Brewers. He appeared in ten games for the Brewers, the last of which, he lasted just a third of an inning and gave up four runs to the A's. Following the game, he was returned to the A's. He spent 1974 in the Detroit Tigers' organization at Triple-A, then in 1975 was back in the Yankees' farm system with the Syracuse Chiefs as pitching coach for manager Bobby Cox and even appeared in 10 games before announcing his retirement as an active player.\nLater life and death.\nGardner returned to Binghamton where he worked as a fireman and paramedic. \nHe died in Binghampton, New York, on October 21, 2023, at the age of 78, and was survived by his two children, three grandchildren, sister, niece and great nephew."

        "text": "The 1969 AFL playoffs was the postseason of the American Football League for its tenth and final season in 1969. For the first time, the ten-team league scheduled a four-team postseason, consisting of the top two teams from the two divisions. The division champions hosted the second place teams from the other division; both Western division teams won and advanced to the league championship game, with the winner advancing to play the NFL champion in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans on January 18, 1970.\nPreviously, the only scheduled postseason contest was the AFL Championship Game, between the two division winners, with the host site alternating between the divisions. Ties for a division title were resolved with an unscheduled tiebreaker playoff game (1963: East, 1968: West), while the other division's winner was idle.\nEastern runner-up Houston (6–6–2) had the league's fifth-best record; San Diego (8–6) was fourth, but finished third in the West and did not qualify for the postseason. Oakland (12–1–1) and Kansas City (11–3), both from Western division, had the best records and both advanced to the AFL title game.\nThe opening round of the AFL postseason was played December 20–21, the final week of the regular season for the NFL; they played the first round of their postseason the following weekend (December 27–28), while the AFL was idle. Both league championship games were held on January 4; Super Bowl IV was on January 11.\nPlayoffs.\nDivisional playoffs.\nKansas City, favored by three points, had defeated the Jets 34–16 five weeks earlier on the same field. They knocked off the defending Super Bowl champions in dominating form, holding them to just 234 yards and forcing four turnovers.\nThe heavy winds at Shea Stadium wreaked havoc on the kicking of Chiefs kicker Jan Stenerud, who missed three field goals throughout the game, including an early 47-yard attempt in the first quarter. New York quarterback Joe Namath then completed 4/4 passes on the way to a 27-yard Jim Turner field goal that put the home team in front, 3–0. Kansas City responded with Len Dawson's completions to Otis Taylor, Fred Arbanas, and Wendell Hayes for gains of 13, 12, and 17 yards moving the team into position for a 23-yard Stenerud field goal to tie the game. This was the only score of the second quarter, as neither team had much success moving the ball for the rest of the half. Stenerud's missed 44-yard field goal attempt was close as either team came to changing the scoreboard.\nDefense continued to dominate the game in the second half, starting with Namath's interception to defensive back Emmitt Thomas. However, this result in another missed field goal try from Stenerud, a 44-yard attempt. The next time New York got the ball, Namath was intercepted again, this time by Jim Marsalis. Kansas City was forced to punt, but a running into the punter penalty against New York allowed them to keep possession. Dawson then threw a 27-yard completion to Arbanas that set up Stenerud's 25-yard field goal, giving the Chiefs a 6–3 lead.\nNew York responded with a drive deep into Chiefs territory. A pass interference penalty against Thomas in the end zone gave them a first down on the Chiefs 1-yard line, but Kansas City's defense made a crucial stand. On the first two plays, runs by Matt Snell and Bill Mathis were stuffed for no gain by linebacker Willie Lanier. New York attempted to pass the ball for a touchdown on 3rd down, but with all his receivers covered and facing a blitz from linebacker Jim Lynch, Namath was forced to throw the ball away. Rather than attempt a 4th down conversion, the Jets tied the game, 6–6, on Turner's 9-yard field goal.\nKansas City's goal line stand seemed to fire up their offense. On their ensuing drive, Dawson completed a 61-yard pass to Taylor. Then he found Gloster Richardson in the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown pass, giving the Chiefs a 13-6 fourth quarter lead.\nThere was still time for New York to come back, but Namath completed only 6 of his next 20 passes, while the team was unable to score despite drives to the Chiefs 16 and 13-yard lines. On the drive to the 13, after Namath misfired on two passes to the end zone, Marsalis recorded his second interception of the game.\nDawson completed 12 of 27 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown. Chiefs running back Mike Garrett was the top rusher of the game with 67 yards. Namath completed only fourteen of forty passes for 169 yards and was intercepted three times. The Jets did not return to the postseason for a dozen years, in 1981.\nOakland was favored by thirteen points, and quarterback Daryle Lamonica tied a playoff record with six touchdown passes as the Raiders racked up 412 yards and 56 points, while holding Houston to just 197 yards and forcing five turnovers.\nAfter the game started with a punt from each team, Oakland suddenly scored four consecutive times to take a 28–0 first quarter lead. First, Lamonica's 40-yard completion to running back Larry Todd set up his 10-yard touchdown pass to Fred Biletnikoff. Then on the first play of the Oilers ensuing drive, Raiders defensive back George Atkinson intercepted a pass from Pete Beathard and returned it 57 yards for a touchdown. After Houston got the ball back, they lost another turnover, this time a fumble by running back Hoyle Granger that Atkinson recovered on the Oilers 24-yard line. Lamonica then threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to Rod Sherman, giving the Raiders a 21–0 lead with over 6 minutes left in the first quarter. Houston managed to pick up a first down for the first time in the game on their next drive, but on the next play, Beathard fumbled the snap, and Tom Keating recovered it for Oakland on the Oilers 31. Lamonica then threw his third touchdown pass of the quarter, a 31-yard completion to Biletnikoff, giving the Raiders a 28–0 lead as the first quarter mercifully came to an end.\nOakland's defense continued to dominate in the second quarter, as Beathard threw another interception, this one to Willie Brown. However, this time Houston managed to prevent a score when Lamonica threw a pass that was intercepted by defensive back Miller Farr. This would be the only bright spot of the quarter for Houston, who soon had to punt again. After an Oilers punt, running back Charlie Smith scored on a 60-yard touchdown reception from Lamonica to give the Raiders a 35-0 lead going into halftime.\nEarly in the third quarter, Houston managed a drive deep into Raiders territory, but lost the ball again when Beathard was sacked for a 9-yard loss on 4th and 10 from the Raiders 16-yard line. Oakland then drove 75 yards to score on Lamonica's 23-yard touchdown pass to Sherman, giving them a 42-0 lead. Following a punt, Oakland drove 62 yards to Lamonica's 6th touchdown pass of the day, a 3-yard toss to tight end Billy Cannon, increasing their lead to 49-0 going into the 4th quarter.\nHouston finally scored a touchdown in the final period, driving 95 yards to an 8-yard touchdown pass from Beathard to tight end Alvin Reed. Meanwhile, Lamonica sat out the rest of the game. His replacement, George Blanda, completed just 1 of 5 passes, but his completion was a 33-yard gain to running back Marv Hubbard that set up the final score of the day on Hubbard's 4-yard touchdown run.\nLamonica completed 13/17 passes for 276 yards and 6 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Smith caught 4 passes for 103 yards and a score. Beathard completed just 18/46 passes for 209 yards and touchdown, with 3 interceptions. Reed caught 7 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown.\nAFL Championship Game.\nThe Chiefs edged Oakland 17–7 in a hard fought defensive struggle; the teams combined for just 440 yards (233 for Oakland, 207 for KC) and had four turnovers each. It was a very satisfying win for Kansas City, who had lost to the Raiders twice during the season and in seven of their last eight, including a 41–6 loss in the previous year's postseason.\nThe Raiders opened up the scoring with a 66-yard drive, featuring Daryle Lamonica's 24-yard completion to Warren Wells on the Chiefs' 3-yard line. Running back Charlie Smith ran the ball across the goal line on the next play, giving Oakland a 7-0 lead. Both defenses would take over the majority of the rest of the half, but with 3:24 remaining in the second quarter, Kansas City, who had only gained two first downs up to now, drove 75 yards to tie the game. Quarterback Len Dawson started off the drive with a 14-yard completion to Otis Taylor, while Robert Holmes' 8-yard run moved the ball into Raiders territory on their 42 for the first time in the game as the clock ran down to the 2-minute warning. On the next play, Dawson threw a 41-yard completion to receiver Frank Pitts. Then Wendell Hayes scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game at 7 going into halftime.\nOakland seemed primed to respond in the third quarter with a drive to the Chiefs 33-yard line, but in what turned out to be a crucial play, Lamonica jammed his thumb and fingers when his throwing hand struck the helmet of Chiefs defensive end Aaron Brown, and had to miss the rest of the drive. Backup George Blanda took over and tried to take the team the rest of the way to the end zone, but a few players later, defensive back Emmitt Thomas made a clutch interception on the Chiefs' 5-yard line. Kansas City then drove 95 yards for a go-ahead score. The key play on the drive was a 35-yard reception by Taylor through triple coverage with the team facing 3rd and 13 from their own 2-yard line. Dawson later completed a 23-yard pass to Holmes on the drive, and defensive back Nemiah Wilson's pass interference penalty eventually gave Kansas City a first down on the Raiders' 7-yard line. Holmes carried the ball three straight times after that, the last a 5-yard touchdown run to put the Chiefs up 14-7.\nLamonica returned to the game in the 4th quarter, but was unable to lead the Raiders to any points, despite numerous opportunities. A promising drive into Kansas City territory was eliminated when Jim Kearney intercepted Lamonica's pass on the Chiefs' 18-yard line. Two plays later, defensive end Carlton Oats recovered a fumble from Holmes on the Chiefs' 24. But on the next play, Oakland gave the ball right back with an interception to rookie cornerback Jim Marsalis. Amazingly, Oakland got the ball back on another Holmes fumble, this one recovered by linebacker Dan Conners on the Chiefs' 31. Still, the only result would be another Lamonica interception, this one to Thomas, who returned it 62 yards to the Raiders' 18-yard line, setting up Jan Stenerud's 22-yard field goal that increased Kansas City's lead to 17-7. Oakland had one last chance to get back in the game when defensive end Ike Lassiter recovered a fumble from Dawson on the Kansas City 13 with two minutes left. But Lamonica threw four straight incompletions and the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock.\nNeither quarterback had a particularly good day. Dawson completed only 7 of 17 passes for 129 yards, while Lamonica finished 15/39 for 167 yards and three interceptions. Charlie Smith was the sole offensive star of the game, with 31 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 8 receptions for 86 yards."

        "text": "The 1968 AFL season was the ninth regular season of the American Football League, and its penultimate season prior to the AFL–NFL merger.\nThe season ended when the New York Jets (11–3) defeated the Oakland Raiders (12–2) in the AFL championship game on December 29 at Shea Stadium in New York City. Two weeks later, the Jets defeated the National Football League's Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in one of the biggest sports upsets in history.\nThe season was also notable as the inaugural season of the Cincinnati Bengals, which expanded the AFL to ten teams.\nIn anticipation of the merger, all AFL on-field officials wore uniforms similar to those used in the NFL.\nDivision races.\nWith the addition of the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFL's ten teams were split equally into two divisions. Each played a home-and-away game against the other four teams in its division, one game against each of the five teams in the opposite division, and a second game against one of the other division's teams.\nAs with the previous eight seasons, the best record in the Eastern Division played the best in the Western Division in the AFL championship game, with the site alternating between the divisions; the Eastern division hosted in even-numbered years. If there was tie at the top of either division standings (as happened when Oakland and Kansas City both finished at 12–2), a one-game playoff was held to determine the division winner. The Jets, with the third-best record in the league in 1968, had a week off and hosted the title game.\nRegular season.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals joined the league as an expansion team.\nPlayoffs.\nSuper Bowl.\nIn an upset, the New York Jets, defeated the Baltimore Colts, 16–7, at Orange Bowl in Miami, on January 12, 1969."

        "text": "1968 AFL playoffs.\nWestern Division playoff.\nOn a five-game winning streak with sizable victory margins of late, Kansas City was favored by 3½ points; the Raiders had won their last eight, but had close calls in the last three. The teams had split the season series, each winning at home.\nOakland quarterback Daryle Lamonica torched the Chiefs for five touchdown passes, while the Raiders defense intercepted four passes from Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson and held KC to a pair of field goals in the second quarter.\nAfter forcing Kansas City to punt from their 47-yard line, Oakland drove 80 yards for a touchdown, aided by a controversial third down pass interference call against Kansas City after the ball had already hit the ground. After the penalty, Lamonica completed two passes to Fred Biletnikoff, the first for 18 yards, and the second a 24-yard touchdown pass. A terrible punt into the rain by Jerrel Wilson inside his own goal line enabled the Raiders to start their next drive on the Chiefs 25-yard line, and they scored another touchdown with Lamonica's 23-yard pass to Warren Wells. After some punting from both teams, Oakland got the ball with 1:02 left in the quarter. Lamonica started the drive with a short pass to rookie running back Charlie Smith, who turned it into a 26-yard gain. On the next play, Lamonica hooked up with Biletnikoff for a 44-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders a 21–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, Kansas City got a golden opportunity to get back in the game when Dawson completed a 55-yard pass to receiver Otis Taylor, who managed to drag defensive back George Atkinson nearly twenty yards before he finally went down on the Raiders eight-yard line. But despite six plays after that as a result of a Raiders penalty, Kansas City could not get into the end zone and had to settle for Jan Stenerud's 10-yard field goal. Kansas City later blew another big opportunity after a Wilson punt pinned the Raiders back on their own one-yard line. On the next play, Lamonica threw a pass right into the hands of Chiefs DB Bobby Bell, only to see him inexplicably drop the ball. Kansas City still managed to force a punt and got the ball back with great field position on the Raiders 38. On the next play, Dawson completed a 31-yard pass to receiver Frank Pitts, but once again Kansas City could not dent the goal line and settled for another Stenerud field goal, making the score 21–6. Kansas City seemed to be inching their way to a comeback, but it was snuffed out with twelve seconds left in the half, when Lamonica completed a long pass to Biletnikoff, who evaded three Chiefs defenders on the way to a 54-yard touchdown reception, giving the Raiders a 28–6 halftime lead.\nIn the first half alone, Lamonica had completed nine passes for 220 yards and four touchdowns.\nBoth teams blew scoring chances in the third quarter, as Stenerud missed a 39-yard field goal, while Lamonica threw an incomplete pass on fourth and goal from the Chiefs 1-yard line. However, the period ended with Oakland driving into Chiefs territory, a drive that ended with Lamonica's 5th touchdown pass, throwing a 35-yard scoring pass to Wells after the man covering accidentally fell down. He had a chance to tie Daryle LaMonica's postseason record of six touchdown passes later on, but Wells ended up dropping a potential touchdown catch on the 3-yard line. However, they did get to score two more times on field goals by veteran kicker George Blanda, which were set up by interceptions from defensive backs Willie Brown and Nemiah Wilson.\nLamonica finished the game with 19 of 39 completions for 347 yards and 5 touchdowns. His top receiver was Biletnikoff, who caught 7 passes for 180 yards and three touchdowns, while Wells added four receptions for 93 yards and two scores. Smith was the leading rusher of the game with 13 carries for 74 yards, while also catching five passes for 52. Dawson finished the day 17/36 for 254 yards with four interceptions. Taylor caught four passes for 117 yards.\nAFL Championship Game.\nAfter Jets quarterback Joe Namath threw an interception that enabled Oakland to take a 4th quarter lead, he led the Jets 68 yards in just 55 seconds to score a go-ahead touchdown pass to Don Maynard with 7:24 left in the game. Then New York's defense stopped Oakland on their three remaining drives to hold on to victory, avenging their regular season loss to the Raiders in the infamous Heidi Game.\nA 28-yard punt by Oakland's Mike Eischeid gave New York the ball on the Raiders 44-yard line on their first possession, and they took advantage of the short field with a 4-play scoring drive. Namath completed two 14-yard passes to Maynard on it, the second one a touchdown to give the Jets an early 7-0 lead. Meanwhile, Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica completed just one of his first 13 pass attempts. His first completion was a 36-yard pass to Billy Cannon, but the Raiders ended up with no points on that drive when George Blanda hit the cross bar attempting a 45-yard field goal. New York then drove to a 33-yard field goal by Jim Turner, giving them a 10-0 lead in the final minutes of the first quarter.\nAfter being completely dominated up to this point, the Raiders offense finally got into gear as Lamonica completed passes to Pete Banaszak and Fred Biletnikoff for gains of 11 and 15 yards. Then he hit fullback Hewritt Dixon for a 23-yard gain on the last play of the first quarter. As the second quarter opened up, Lamonica finished the 80-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Biletnikoff, making the score 10-7. The rest of the quarter would result in nothing but field goal attempts, with Turner missing one from 44 yards, but connecting from 35, while Blanda kicked a 26-yard field goal right before halftime to make the score 13-10.\nLamonica opened the third quarter with a 37-yard completion to Biletnikoff. Then his 40-yard pass to receiver Warren Wells gave Oakland a first down on the Jets 6-yard line. However, rush attempts over the next three plays resulted in just 5 yards. Faced with 4th and goal on the 1, coach John Rauch decided to play conservative and had Blanda kick a 9-yard field goal that tied the game at 13. New York responded by driving 80 yards in 14 plays to retake the lead, 20-13, on Namath's 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pete Lammons with one minute left until the 4th quarter.\nOakland responded to the touchdown with Lamonica's 57-yard completion to Biletnikoff setting up a 20-yard Blanda field goal, cutting the score to 20-16. Then Raiders defensive back George Atkinson intercepted a pass from Namath and returned it 32 yards to the Jets 5-yard line. On the next play, Banaszak ran the ball into the end zone, giving Oakland their first lead of the game at 23-20 with 8:18 remaining on the clock.\nHowever, this turned out to be very short lived. After starting out the ensuing drive with a 10-yard completion to George Sauer, Namath completed a 52-yard pass to Maynard at the Raiders 6-yard line. On the next play, he connected with Maynard in the end zone, giving the Jets a 27-23 lead at the 7:47 mark. Oakland had three more drives with the time remaining, but failed to score each time. Oakland took the ball after Maynard's touchdown and drove to New York's 26-yard line, where they ended up faced with 4th down and 10. Even though more than 5 minutes remained in the game, Rauch decided to try to go for a first down rather than kick a field goal, but this did not pay off as Lamonica was sacked by New York lineman Verlon Biggs on the next play. Following a punt, Oakland drove to the New York 24-yard line, only to lose the ball again when Lamonica's intended swing pass to Charline Smith sailed behind him, resulting in an accidental fumbled lateral that was recovered by linebacker Ralph Baker. The next time the Raiders got the ball, it was on their own 22-yard line with 42 seconds left in regulation. The Jets defense manage to stop the drive at midfield as time expired to preserve their lead and win the game.\nNeither quarterback distinguished himself with his passing accuracy. Namath completed 19 of 49 passes for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Lamonica completed 20 of 47 passes for 401 yards and a touchdown. Biletnikoff was the leading receiver of the game with 7 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown, while Maynard caught 6 passes for 118 yards and two scores. Jets running back Matt Snell was the top rusher of the game with 71 yards on 19 carries, along with a 15-yard reception, while Emerson Boozer chipped in 51 rushing yards for New York. In addition to his 32-yard interception return, Atkinson returned 4 kickoffs for 112 yards. Oakland lost despite outgaining the Jets in total yards, 443-400."

        "title": "2003 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2003 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2002–03 season, and the culmination of the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. The second-seeded Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils defeated the seventh-seeded Western Conference champion Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games and were awarded the Stanley Cup for the third time in franchise history. It was New Jersey's first appearance since 2001 and third in four years. It was Anaheim's first-ever appearance. The Devils defeated the Mighty Ducks in seven games to win their third Stanley Cup in less than a decade. For the first time since 1965, all seven games were won by the home team. To date this is the last Stanley Cup Finals in which this happened.\nThe Devils' win was the last in a series of wins they, along with the Colorado Avalanche and the Detroit Red Wings, established in the era from 1995 to 2003. The three teams won a combined eight of nine Stanley Cups during that time. The Devils won in 1995, followed by the Avalanche in 1996, then the Red Wings in 1997 and 1998. The Dallas Stars win in 1999 would be superseded by the Devils in 2000, Colorado in 2001 and Detroit in 2002.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe New Jersey Devils were in the Stanley Cup Finals for their fourth time in franchise history, as well as their third appearance in four years. En route to the finals, New Jersey defeated the Boston Bruins and Tampa Bay Lightning in five games, and the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference Finals in a seven-game series. Strong goaltending from future Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Martin Brodeur, and strong defense from future Hockey Hall of Fame captain Scott Stevens and future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Scott Niedermayer led the Devils to the finals. Niedermayer and forward Jamie Langenbrunner led all NHL players in points during the entire playoffs. Forwards John Madden and Jeff Friesen, the latter of whom had been traded to New Jersey from Anaheim during the off-season, also finished among the top scorers in the league during the playoffs.\nThe Mighty Ducks of Anaheim entered their first Stanley Cup Finals in franchise history after upsetting two heavily favored teams: sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings and defeating the Dallas Stars in six games. Anaheim also swept the Minnesota Wild in the Western Conference Finals, largely due to the stellar goaltending of Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who only allowed one goal during the entire series. Supporting Giguere were future Hockey Hall of Fame members Paul Kariya and Adam Oates as well as forwards Petr Sykora and Rob Niedermayer, brother of then-Devils star defenseman Scott Niedermayer.\nThis series was considered memorable as two brothers on different teams competed against one another for the Stanley Cup. Carol Niedermayer, the mother of Rob and Scott, said she hoped Rob would win because Scott had already won Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000. Scott said of his mother's statement: \"That made sense to me.\"\nGame summaries.\nThe 2003 Stanley Cup Finals pitted the second-seeded Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils against the seventh-seeded Western Conference champion Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Devils, who finished the season with 108 points, defeated the Mighty Ducks in seven games to win the Stanley Cup. The series opened at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nGame one.\nIn game one Martin Brodeur held the Ducks off the scoreboard while the Devils players continually dominated the Ducks. Sergei Brylin scored the winning goal in the second period and the Devils went on to shut out the Mighty Ducks 3–0.\nGame two.\nIn a virtual repeat of game one, Patrik Elias scored the winning goal in the second period and the Devils shut out Anaheim 3–0 again.\nGame three.\nDown 2–0 after two games, the series shifted to the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim in Southern California. Game three was remembered for the clumsy mistake from Martin Brodeur when he accidentally dropped his stick when the puck came to him; the puck deflected off his fallen stick and into the net to give the Ducks a lucky break and a 2–1 lead. The Devils would later tie the game, only to lose in overtime. Over the mistake with his stick, Brodeur later claimed, \"It was just one of those once in a lifetime things.\"\nGame four.\nGame four had no scoring throughout regulation and was a battle between goaltenders Brodeur and Giguere. But Anaheim again came out on top in overtime, winning 1–0 and tying the series 2–2.\nGame five.\nGame five, returning to the Meadowlands, saw a continual battle for the first half of the game. With the game tied 3–3 in the second period, the Devils took the lead with a deflection goal by Jay Pandolfo that was initially waved off by referees due to an apparent kicking motion with the skates. Video replays, however, showed that there was no distinct kicking motion from the skates, and thus the referees' call was reversed, resulting in a goal. This would prove to deflate the Ducks for the rest of the game, as Jamie Langenbrunner scored two more goals for the Devils to give New Jersey a 6–3 win and a three games to two series lead.\nGame six.\nWith New Jersey looking to clinch the series, game six in Anaheim saw the Mighty Ducks return the favor of game five to the Devils with complete dominance throughout the game. Quite possibly the most remembered moment of the entire series came when the Ducks were winning 3–1 in the second period. Ducks captain Paul Kariya failed to see Devils captain Scott Stevens approaching after he passed the puck, and he was subsequently checked by the defensemen in a hit similar to the check that knocked out Eric Lindros during the 2000 playoffs and caused Lindros to miss the next season. Kariya was lying motionless for a few minutes, where he was then escorted to the locker room. Kariya, however, unexpectedly returned to the bench minutes later. About 11 minutes after the hit, Kariya fired a slapshot that got past Brodeur. This helped the Ducks win the game 5–2 and sent the series to a seventh and final game.\nGame seven.\nGame seven in New Jersey saw the Devils once more completely dominate the Ducks. The game-winning goal was scored by Michael Rupp. Rupp became the first player in Stanley Cup history to have his first playoff goal be the Stanley Cup winner. Additionally, Jeff Friesen dominated his former Mighty Duck teammates, scoring the game's final two goals to solidify the victory. The 3–0 win gave the Devils their third Stanley Cup victory, as Anaheim could not complete their Cinderella run. The Mighty Ducks, however, didn't leave empty-handed; for his stellar play throughout the playoffs and Finals, goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player, and fourth goaltender, in NHL history to have won the trophy as a member of the losing team, joining Detroit's Roger Crozier (), the St. Louis Blues' Glenn Hall (), and the Philadelphia Flyers' Reggie Leach (, a right winger) and Ron Hextall (). He is also the most recent such Smythe winner to date.\nThis was only the third time in NHL history, after and , that the home team won every Finals game.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2003 Stanley Cup was presented to Devils captain Scott Stevens by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Devils 3–0 win over the Mighty Ducks in game seven\nThe following Devils players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2002–03 New Jersey Devils\nThree Stanley Cups with New Jersey.\nNew Jersey won three Stanley Cups in short succession: 1995, 2000 and 2003.

Gary Thorne, and Bill Clement called the entire series, with John Davidson joining them for the ABC games. ESPN aired the first two games while ABC broadcast the rest of the series. \nThis was also the only year that ABC broadcast both the Stanley Cup and the NBA Finals that involved teams playing in the same arena during each series. During ABC's broadcast of game 7, Thorne thanked Brad Nessler, ABC's lead NBA voice, for promoting the game after he stated during game 3 of the NBA Finals that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both game 7 and their game the night before. \nIn Canada, Bob Cole and Harry Neale were in the broadcast booth for CBC. One of the CBC's owned and operated Station's in New Brunswick (CBAT-TV) decided to preempt game seven of the Final in order to broadcast the New Brunswick general election returns. This would also be the first finals televised by RDS, replacing SRC as the Canadian French-language broadcaster.\nFor the radio coverage, Devils team broadcaster John Hennessy called the series on WABC–AM 770 in New York City. In Anaheim, Steve Carroll called the series."

        "text": "The 1976 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament was the sixth annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of men's college lacrosse among its Division I programs at the end of the 1976 NCAA Division I lacrosse season.\nUndefeated Cornell—led by coach Richie Moran and players Mike French and Eamon McEneaney—defeated Maryland in the championship game, 16–13 after one overtime.\nThe tournament championship game was played at Brown Stadium at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\nOverview.\nThroughout the 1970s Cornell University was dominant in lacrosse with four national championship appearances to go with three titles. The 1976 and 1977 Big Red teams are generally considered to be among the best of all time.\nThe Big Red's 1976 NCAA championship team featured Hall of Fame players, Eamon McEneaney, Mike French, Robert Henrickson, Dan Mackesey, as well as Hall of Fame coaches, Richie Moran and Michael Waldvogel.\nIn the matchup that lacrosse fans wanted to see, for the first time in NCAA tournament history two undefeated teams, #1 Maryland and #2 Cornell met in the championship game. The game did not disappoint, as Cornell, down 7–2 at halftime, outscored Maryland 6–2 in the third period to pull within one goal entering the final period. The Terps opened the fourth period with a goal to go up 10–8, but the next four goals belonged to Cornell who led 12–10 with three minutes to play. Maryland, however, would not back down and got back-to-back goals including a buzzer-beater to knot the game and send the contest into overtime.\nThis tournament finals was not a sudden death, first goal to win the game. This overtime consisted of one OT with two four minute periods, with the teams swapping ends between periods. After an initial goal by Maryland's Terry Kimball, Cornell would score four unanswered goals to claim the crown with a 16 to 13 victory.\nCornell earlier in the tournament recorded the only shutout in NCAA tournament history when they blanked Washington and Lee 14–0 in the first round. In a game that featured both snow and pouring rain, the Big Red did the improbable with goalie Dan Mackesey pitching a shutout making 13 saves. The number 7 seed Generals, who had been national semifinalists the previous year, had an impressive offensive unit coming into the contest having outscored its regular season opponents 147 to 89.\nIn a 22-11 semifinal win against Navy, Maryland's Ed Mullen had 7 goals and 5 assists to set a tournament record of 12 total points in one game.\nIn the finals, Mike French tied the then-NCAA tournament single-game scoring record, finishing the day with seven goals and four assists, while Dan Mackesey matched the then-tournament record for saves in a single-game with 28 stops.\nOutstanding players.\nThe NCAA did not designate a Most Outstanding Player until the 1977 national tournament."

        "title": "1961 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1961 AFL Championship Game was a rematch of the first American Football League title game, between the Houston Oilers and the San Diego Chargers. It was played on December 24 at Balboa Stadium in San Diego, California, and the Oilers were three-point favorites.\nBackground.\nThe defending champion Houston Oilers were headlined in 1961 by remarkable turnaround. Lou Rymkus started the season as head coach, but an opening day victory against Oakland was their last victory for a month. They lost three in a row (including one to San Diego) before a 31–31 tie to the Boston Patriots saw Rymkus fired by owner Bud Adams in favor of Wally Lemm, who had been an assistant coach with the team in 1960 before being coaxed back from the sporting goods industry to serve the same position in 1961. The Oilers pulled off nine straight wins that started with a 38–7 victory over Dallas and finished with wins over San Diego to finish with a record of one game ahead of Boston, the only other team with a winning record in the AFL. Lemm was named AFL Coach of the Year for his nine-game tenure. They scored 513 points over the season (which was 100 more than the next best team) with an offense that was the best in the league, particularly in passing. Quarterback George Blanda threw 36 touchdowns on 3,330 yards passing to be selected as the AFL MVP; the 36 touchdowns thrown by Blanda would stand as the all-time record for the existence of the league.\nAt the end of the 1960 American Football League season, the Chargers elected to move down the California coast from Los Angeles to San Diego due to attendance problems. San Diego had a tremendous start as the defending Western champion, winning their first eleven games of the season and clinching the division with room to spare (finishing ), doing so on \nthe efforts numerous AFL All-Stars on both sides of the ball in players such as quarterback Jack Kemp and defensive end Earl Faison (who won AFL Rookie of the Year that year); the Chargers forced 66 turnovers on the season while ranking first in overall defense by allowing just 15 points per game.\nGame summary.\nThe 1961 AFL championship game was the \"sixth\" meeting between the two teams during the calendar year. The previous season's title game, won by Houston 24–16, had been played on January 1, 1961. The Chargers had won two exhibition contests with the Oilers in the summer, and they had split during the regular season, with the home teams winning.\nThe second AFL title game kicked off at 1:30 pm PST and scoring was held down by sloppy play and turnovers: Houston had seven and San Diego had six. The only score of the first half came on a 46-yard George Blanda field goal, coming after a nine-yard San Diego punt.\nIn the third quarter, the Oilers had the only sustained drive of the game, which went for 80 yards. With a third-and-five at the San Diego 35, Blanda rolled to his right and found Billy Cannon open at the 17. Cannon jumped to make the catch, shrugged off a would-be tackler, and scampered into the end zone for a touchdown, his second in two straight low-scoring championship games. Blanda's extra point put Houston up 10–0. The Chargers scored early in the fourth quarter on a 12-yard field goal by George Blair, but they could not score again, and the Oilers won 10–3. Blanda went 18-of-40 for 160 yards with a touchdown and five interceptions. Blanda was the fifth quarterback to throw five interceptions in a playoff game but became the first (and as of 2024, only) quarterback to throw five interceptions in a winning effort for a postseason game. Chargers counterpart Jack Kemp went 17-of-32 for 226 yards for four interceptions.\nSan Diego head coach Sid Gillman was involved in a heated post-game discussion at mid-field with an official, field judge John Morrow, who was wrestled to the ground by Charger safety Bob Zeman.\nThe game was not a sellout; the attendance of 29,556 was several thousand under Balboa Stadium's capacity."

        "text": "The 1960 AFL season was the inaugural regular season of the American Football League. It consisted of 8 franchises split into two divisions: the East Division (Buffalo Bills, Houston Oilers, Titans of New York, Boston Patriots) and the West Division (Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos, Dallas Texans, Oakland Raiders).\nThe season ended when the Houston Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 24–16 in the inaugural AFL Championship game.\nDivision races.\nThe AFL had 8 teams, grouped into two divisions. Each team would play a home-and-away game against the other 7 teams in the league for a total of 14 games, and the best team in the Eastern Division would play against the best in the Western Division in a championship game. If there was a tie in the standings at the top of either division, a one-game playoff would be held to determine the division winner.\nThe Denver Broncos, who would not have a winning season until they went 7–5–2 in 1973, were the Western Division leaders halfway through 1960. They won the AFL's first game, played on Friday night, September 9, 1960, beating the Boston Patriots 13–10. The Patriots' Gino Cappelletti scored the AFL's first points with a 35-yard field goal. Other results in \"Week One\" were the Los Angeles Chargers 21–20 win over the Dallas Texans, the Houston Oilers 37–22 win over the Oakland Raiders, and the Titans of New York 27–3 win over the Buffalo Bills. In the Raiders game, J. D. Smith caught a pass from Tom Flores to score the first two-point conversion in pro football history.\nIn \"Week Eight\" (October 30), Denver lost to the visiting Texans, 17–14, and did not win any of their last eight games, finishing with the AFL's worst record at 4–9–1. The Chargers, still in Los Angeles, pulled ahead the next week with a Friday night win over the Titans of New York, 21–7, and finished at 10–4–0. The Eastern Division lead was held by Houston, except for a setback from a 14–13 loss to Oakland on September 25.

        "title": "1960 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1960 American Football League Championship Game was the first AFL title game, played on New Year's Day 1961 at Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, Texas. With New Year's on Sunday, the major college bowl games were played on Monday, January 2. This was the first time that a major professional football league's playoff game was played in January rather than December.\nBackground.\nDue to the geography set up for the eight teams in the AFL, Houston was put in the Eastern Division with the Boston Patriots, the New York Titans, and the Buffalo Bills, while Los Angeles was paired with the Dallas Texans, Denver Broncos, and Oakland Raiders. Houston, as owned by Bud Adams, made the first big-name deal for a player when they signed Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon for a contract worth $33,000 a year for three years with a $10,000 signing bonus that held up despite a dispute from the Los Angeles Rams, who had signed him a few months prior. To quarterback the team would be George Blanda, who had retired from the Chicago Bears in 1958 at the age of 31 rather than play as only a placekicker. He would start 11 of the 14 games (while going 15-of-32 on field goals) while Jacky Lee started three games. Cannon rushed for 644 yards and five touchdowns that season for Houston. The Oilers won five of their first six games, which included a 38–28 victory over the Chargers in the second week. They lost the rematch 24–21 to fall to 6–3 on the season before winning four of their final five games of the year to finish three games above New York at 10–4 while being the best team in total offensive yards (4,936) on the strength of their passing, which saw over 3,000 yards.\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Chargers were owned by Barron Hilton, who made his first big signing with Frank Leahy hired to be general manager of the team. Not long after, Hilton went through a variety of considerations, such as Bob McBride, a Notre Dame assistant who changed his mind within hours of announcement, to Lou Rymkus, the offensive line coach of the Los Angeles Rams before he elected to go with Houston before Sid Gillman was hired in early 1960. He had been fired by the Rams after being their head coach for the past five seasons, which included a loss in the 1955 NFL Championship Game. The coaching staff would be assembled in the winter of 1960 that included the likes of Al Davis and Chuck Noll. Control of management was ceded to Gillman when Leahy resigned in the summer due to health. Players acquired after the draft included Ron Mix, who traded for his rights from Boston and successfully wooed him away from signing with Baltimore and Jack Kemp, who went from backup quarterback on a handful of NFL teams to starting quarterback. Paul Lowe had been working in the mailroom for the Carte Blanche Corporation, owned by the Hilton family before a successful tryout got him on the team as a running back. The Chargers beat Dallas on opening day but struggled in the first six weeks with a split record, but they quickly got on a roll to win eight of their next nine games to win the Western Division by two games over Denver with a 10–4 record. Los Angeles ranked third in total offense (which saw Kemp throw for over 3,000 yards) for 379 total points, six less than Houston. They were also third in total defense, but they allowed an average of 24 points per game, narrowly more than Houston (20.4).\nThe AFL established a format in which the right to host Championship Games would be alternated each year between the Western Division winners and the Eastern Division. This matched the tradition the established National Football League had adhered to for decades. In the NFL, which the AFL was directly competing against, the Eastern champion hosted title games in even-numbered years. To preclude the possibility of having to compete with an NFL title game in close proximity for an audience, AFL owners initially agreed that its Western champions would host in even numbered years, with Eastern champions hosting in odd numbered years. Thus, the first game was originally scheduled to be played in the 103,000 capacity Los Angeles Coliseum. However, the Chargers had drawn less than 10,000 fans per home game. With the still-fledgling league fearing the prospect that ABC would pull its contract because of very poor ticket sales, the Chargers, the Oilers and the League mutally agreed to move the game to the smaller Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, where it drew a near-capacity 32,183. The game was the last the Chargers would play as a Los Angeles team until the 2017 season, with the team playing the next 56 years in San Diego. Ultimately, the league opted to reverse its initial format, as such the Chargers (who repeated as Western champions) would host the next championship game in San Diego. Ultimately, the AFL's initial fear of having to locally compete with an NFL title game host for an audience and gate revenue never realized, since although the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders later hosted AFL championship games during the league's ten year run their local NFL rivals did not qualify for the postseason in any of those years.\nGame summary.\nIt rained for five days straight prior to the game. The host Oilers were favored by 6-6½ points.\nOilers quarterback George Blanda threw three touchdown passes and kicked a field goal and three extra points to lead Houston to the AFL Championship by a score of 24–16.\nThe Chargers led 6–0 in the first quarter on two field goals by Ben Agajanian, one of only two players (Hardy Brown) who played in the AAFC, the NFL and the AFL. In the second period, Houston scored on a 17-yard George Blanda pass to All-AFL fullback Dave Smith, then answered a 27-yard Agajanian field goal with a 17-yard kick by Blanda.\nIn the final quarter, Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon caught a short toss from Blanda and went for an 88-yard touchdown scamper. The Chargers, down by eight points, tried to reach the end zone on their final possession. Had they scored they could have gone for the two-point conversion, but the clock ran out with the Chargers at the Oilers' 22-yard line. The Oilers won the first American Football League championship, 24–16."

        "text": "The 1973 NCAA lacrosse tournament was the third annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of college lacrosse among its members in the United States.\nUndefeated Maryland, led by coach Bud Beardmore and Hall of Fame midfielder Frank Urso, defeated Johns Hopkins in the championship game, 10–9 after two overtimes, with Urso scoring the winning goal one minute and 18 seconds into the second overtime.\nThe final was played at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in front of a crowd of 5,965 fans.\nOverview.\nThe top eight teams in the season-ending lacrosse coaches poll were selected to play in the 1973 tournament.\nJohns Hopkins defeated Virginia 12-9 and Maryland beat Washington and Lee 18–5 to reach the national championship game. The win represented Maryland's eighth overall men's lacrosse National Title, but first under the newly instituted NCAA lacrosse tournament format. Bud Beardmore was named USILA Coach of the Year.\nPrior to the Hopkins overtime win, the Terrapins closest game was a five-goal victory against UMBC. Maryland had beaten Hopkins 17 to 4 in the regular season about a month prior to the finals. In the Terps' ten games, they averaged 17 goals per game and held opponents to 6 goals per game.\nJohns Hopkins used a possession game to counter the Terrapins' top rated offense, which resulted in over fifteen minutes of limited-shooting possessions by the Blue Jays in the first half. Maryland countered with patient and mistake-free defensive play to offset the stall tactic though Frank Urso was able to get free to score three goals. Hopkins held the ball for the first 10:45 of the game with the first shot of the game not being taken until over eight minutes had passed. Hopkins' tactics worked initially as the Blue Jays took a 5–2 lead at halftime.\nMaryland overcame Johns Hopkins' possession game in the second half, outscoring the Jays 8–4 in the second half. However, the Jays still had a 9-7 lead with just under 5 minutes to play in the game. The winning goal came in the second overtime for the 10–9 victory. Urso scored the goal taking a solo run and converting a 15-yard bounce shot. Since this was not a sudden-death overtime period, Maryland held for the final three minutes to win the contest.\nThe Terps had encountered little resistance on their way to the title as they downed Brown 16-4 and Washington and Lee 18–7 in the first two rounds. Johns Hopkins had disposed of Army 11-5 and the defending national champion Virginia 12–9.\nWashington and Lee goalie Skeet Chadwick had 55 saves in two tournament games. Washington and Lee, a recent addition to the top tier of teams, beat Navy in a three overtime marathon 13–12 in the first round. The two teams each scored two goals in the non-sudden death first overtime period with Washington and Lee scoring the winning goal 16 seconds into the 3rd sudden-death overtime period. Washington and Lee was undefeated coming into the semifinals, with regular season wins over North Carolina, Towson and Princeton.\nJack Thomas of Johns Hopkins had 11 tournament assists and was the tournament leading scorer.\nMaryland was the first Undefeated Division I national champion, and also the last, accomplishing this as well in 2022.\nOutstanding players.\nThe NCAA did not designate a Most Outstanding Player until the 1977 national tournament.\nSee also.\nUndefeated Division I National Champions"

The first edition was contested in 1989.\nHistory.\nThe first Women's European Championship was held in Denmark in July 1989. The teams that took part were England, Ireland and the Netherlands in addition to the hosts Denmark. England won all three of their matches, with the other teams winning one match each. England thus won the tournament. All matches were official Women's One-Day Internationals and Denmark's match against Ireland was their first such game.\nThe second edition was held in Leicester, Nottingham and Northamptonshire in England in July 1990. The same teams as 1989 again competed, and England again won all their games. Ireland won two matches, the Netherlands one and Denmark lost all three of their games. After the initial group stage, England and Ireland played in a final, which England won by 65 runs.\nThe third Championship, again featuring the same four teams, was played in Haarlem in the Netherlands in July 1991. Like the 1989 event, England again won all three of their games, with the other three teams winning one each. Denmark finished second on run rate and met England in the final, which was won by England by 179 runs.\nAfter a four-year break, the Championship returned in July 1995 in Dublin. The same teams took part as in the previous three tournaments, with England and Ireland topping the points table for the group stage. England beat Ireland by seven wickets in the final.\nIn 1999, the tournament returned to the venue of the first edition, again with the same four teams. England topped the table after the group stage, winning all three of their games, winning the tournament as no final was played. Denmark's game against the Netherlands is their last Women's ODI to date.\nThe 2001 tournament, played at Bradfield College, England saw an England Under-19 team replace England. Despite England being represented by their Under-19 team, their matches still counted as official Women's ODIs for England. Scotland replaced Denmark in the event, and their match against England was their first Women's ODI. Ireland won the event, winning all three of their games, the first time England had not won the tournament.\nThe 2005 event was held in Wales, and saw the first appearance of the Welsh women's team. An England development squad replaced the England Under-19 team. Only the match between Ireland and the Netherlands was an official women's ODI. England won all four of their matches, thus winning the tournament.\nThe tournament became biannual in 2007, when was held in Netherlands. England sent a Development team, which won the championship. Also participated Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland.\nThe 2009 Tournament was held in Dublín, Ireland in three grounds, in this event took part Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland. Ireland won the championship after won their two games. Also will play the first T20 European championship."

        "text": "Nils Erik \"Dubbel-Nisse\" Nilsson (8 March 1936 – 24 June 2017) was a Swedish ice hockey forward and footballer. Between 1954 and 1967 he played 205 international matches and scored 131 goals, which is the second-best scoring result, behind that of Sven Tumba. He won the world title in 1957 and 1962, finishing second in 1963 and 1967 and third in 1958 and 1965. He competed at the 1956, 1960 and 1964 Winter Olympics, and finished in fourth, fifth and second place, respectively. He was the best forward of the 1960 tournament and was selected to the all-star team at the 1962 World Championships. In 2002, he was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.\nNilsson won only one national title, in his last season (1969). Yet he was awarded the Guldpucken award in 1966 as the best Swedish player and the Rinkens riddare award in 1967 for sportsmanlike behavior, and was selected to the Swedish all-star team in 1959, 1960, 1962, 1965 and 1967.\nNilsson also played football with Djurgårdens IF, IK Göta and Karlstad BK, and won the national title with Djurgården in 1959. After retiring from competitions he worked as a product developer with Jofa, a Swedish manufacturer of sporting equipment."

Adjacent to the Rose Bowl stadium in the city's Arroyo Seco Natural Park, the 36-hole facility offers the C.W. Koiner Course (#1) and the shorter E.O. Nay Course (#2), divided by the concrete-channeled Arroyo Seco.\nBoth courses were designed by architect William P. Bell and the complex features a restaurant, banquet facilities, meeting rooms, pro shop, two practice putting greens, a chipping area, a practice bunker, and a driving range. The course hosted the Los Angeles Open on the PGA Tour in 1968, won by Billy Casper in late January.\nC.W. Koiner Course.\nThe par-72 C.W. Koiner Course (#1) measures over , and is centrally run along the western and southern ends of the complex. Relatively flat, it has many strategically placed bunkers, long rough, and tricky greens to place a premium on accuracy. This course is more open than the E.O. Nay Course and also appeals to the better player looking for a challenge.\nE.O. Nay Course.\nThe E.O. Nay Course (#2) is the shorter of the two courses, measuring just over , and is centrally run along the northern end of the complex. Similarly featured, this par-70 course is relatively flat, the key difference between the courses is the smaller hitting areas of the E.O. Nay Course, and this course usually serves those of a lesser ability.\nAlternate uses and availability.\nThough these courses are beautiful and stretch for a mile in green beauty, during football season and for special events, the courses are used as a parking lot for fans. The Rose Bowl (located next door) uses the course for extra parking during home games for the UCLA Bruins football team (since 1982) and for the annual New Year's Day Rose Bowl Game. In 2010 and 2014, it was used for the BCS National Championship Games. This has not proven detrimental to the quality of the course. It does, however, impact availability of the course during UCLA home games and other special events.\nOn December 30, 2009, the clubhouse hosted the twentieth anniversary of the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame induction ceremony, which was hosted by the Pasadena Quarterbacks Club, with Keith Jackson as the master of ceremonies."

        "title": "1995 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 1995 Major League Baseball season was the first season to be played under the expanded postseason format, as the League Division Series (LDS) was played in both the American and National leagues for the first time, since the 1981 strike-split season. However, due to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike which carried into the 1995 season, a shortened 144-game schedule commenced on April 25, when the Florida Marlins played host to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Atlanta Braves became the first franchise to win World Series championships for three cities. Along with their 1995 title, the Braves won in 1914 as the \"Boston Braves\", and in 1957 as the \"Milwaukee Braves\".\nRegular season.\nAfter the 1994 season was ended due to the players' strike, there was still a deal that had to be worked out. However, it wasn't until major league owners parlayed plans to have replacement players play in 1995 that the players got into serious negotiations. Due to the strike, there was no official defending champion for the year. However, the negotiations pushed the start of the season back to late April, already 18 games into a regular season.\nDespite the strike, which alienated many fans, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. surpassed Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played streak when he played in his 2,131st straight game on September6. Games during the playoffs were also broadcast simultaneously, meaning that games were broadcast only regionally. Despite the oddities, the 1995 season is now considered a financial success where the two best teams in baseball (in their leagues) met up in the World Series, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves. For the first time since 1954, the Indians were the AL representatives in the World Series. This came on the heels of dominating the AL Central (beating second place Kansas City by 30 games).\nThey met the Boston Red Sox, who had AL MVP Mo Vaughn (39 home runs, 126 RBI) and got to start the series at home. Regardless, Cleveland swept the Red Sox. Meanwhile, in the other ALDS series between Seattle and Yankees, the Yankees stormed out to a quick 2–0 series lead at Yankee Stadium, winning game2 on a 15th inning walk-off home run by Jim Leyritz. However, as the series shifted to The Kingdome in Seattle, the Mariners, who had made a 13-game comeback on the California Angels to force a one-game playoff (which Randy Johnson got the win), the Mariners won games3 and4 to cause a classic game5, in which the Mariners came back three times to win on Edgar Martínez's famous double that scored Joey Cora and Ken Griffey Jr. In the ALCS, the Mariners surprised the Indians by taking game1, however, on the power of pitchers Dennis Martínez and Orel Hershiser, the Indians managed to knock off Seattle in 6.\nIn the NLDS, it was the near-opposite to the New York/Seattle series. The Cincinnati Reds, who'd run away with the NL Central, swept the Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves took both games vs. Colorado at Coors Field before the Rockies finally won a game in game3. However, the Braves finished off the Rockies at home in game4. Then, in the NLCS, after taking both games at Riverfront Stadium, the Braves finished the sweep of the Reds at home.\nIn the 1995 World Series, the Braves took the first two at home vs. Cleveland. Then, during the three games at Jacobs Field, the Indians won games3 and5 but those games sandwiched around the Braves 5–2 game4 victory. In game6, the Braves, on the power of an 8-inning, one-hitter thrown by Tom Glavine and David Justice hitting a solo home run in the sixth inning, won 1–0 and won the World Series. The victory made the Braves the first team to win World Series in three home cities (Boston (1914), Milwaukee (1957), and Atlanta (1995)).\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nTelevision coverage.\nThis was the second and final season of The Baseball Network, the joint venture between MLB, ABC, and NBC. Meanwhile, ESPN continued to air \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and \"Wednesday Night Baseball\".\nThe long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike began on August 12, 1994, forcing the cancellation of the rest of the 1994 regular season, the postseason, and that year's World Series, Both networks elected to dissolve the partnership with Major League Baseball on June 22, 1995. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Under the terms of the agreement, it could be voided by any party if the venture did not produce a minimum of $330 million in revenue over the first two years.\nABC and NBC were able to air their full respective slates of 1995 \"Baseball Night in America\" regular season games. To salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC and NBC elected to share coverage of the 1995 postseason including the World Series. MLB would then replace The Baseball Network with new deals with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996."

        "text": "Patrick Patterson (born March 14, 1989) is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the NBA for the Houston Rockets, Sacramento Kings, Toronto Raptors, Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Clippers.\nEarly life.\nPatterson, born in Washington, D.C., grew up in Huntington, West Virginia and graduated from Huntington High School in 2007. During his high school career, Patterson helped lead Huntington High School to three straight state championships. Patterson won his third state championship during his senior season with help from O. J. Mayo.\nConsidered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Patterson was listed as the No. 3 power forward and the No. 17 player in the nation in 2007, and was named a McDonald's All-American.\nCollege career.\nPatrick Patterson played college basketball for the University of Kentucky (UK). He chose to play for Kentucky rather than Duke or Florida in a highly publicized recruiting battle. He was recruited by Kentucky coach Tubby Smith and his replacement Billy Gillispie. Later, in the 2009–10 season, he played for former Memphis coach John Calipari who became Gillispie's replacement in April 2009.\nFreshman season.\nDuring Patterson's freshman All-American 2007–08 season, he averaged 16.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 0.8 steals, while shooting 57% from the field. After a Kentucky victory over the Ole Miss Rebels, Patterson missed the remainder of the 2007–08 season with a stress fracture in his left ankle. He also claimed he planned on staying at Kentucky rather than participating in the NBA draft.\nSophomore season.\nFor his sophomore season at UK during the 2008–09 season, he and teammate Jodie Meeks became one of the most successful duos that season, and also became the most productive duo at Kentucky, since the days of Dan Issel and Mike Pratt. Patterson scored a career-high 33 points, on 15-of-17 shooting, on December 22, 2008, against the Tennessee State Tigers. During Patterson's sophomore 2008–09 season, he averaged 17.9 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.1 blocks and 0.6 steals, while shooting 60% from the field. On April 18, 2009, Patterson decided to enter his name into the 2009 NBA draft. However, on May 8, 2009, he decided he would return to Kentucky for the third season.\nJunior season.\nPatterson continued to play a crucial role for the team during his junior season. However, with the addition of freshman players John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Bledsoe, Patterson was no longer required to be the main option for scoring and rebounding. Patterson also improved his outside shot, shooting about 35% from the three-point line all season (compared to no three-pointers made in the previous seasons). During this season, Patterson helped the team win the SEC tournament and achieve a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2004. On April 23, 2010, Patterson entered the 2010 NBA draft; by the time of the draft, he had completed his coursework and earned a degree from UK.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Rockets (2010–2013).\nOn June 24, 2010, Patterson was selected in the NBA draft by the Houston Rockets with the fourteenth overall pick. On November 10, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League. In nine games with the Vipers, Patterson averaged 18.3 points, and 10.3 rebounds in 35 minutes per game. Two days after being recalled by the Rockets, he made his NBA regular season debut on December 15, 2010.\nWith Luis Scola injured, Patterson had his first NBA start with the Rockets on March 14, 2011, scoring 2 points and grabbing 5 rebounds.\nAfter the Rockets used the amnesty clause to waive Scola, Patterson became the starting power forward for the 2012–13 season.\nSacramento Kings (2013).\nOn February 20, 2013, Patterson was traded to the Sacramento Kings along with Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich in exchange for Thomas Robinson, Francisco García and Tyler Honeycutt.\nToronto Raptors (2013–2017).\nOn December 9, 2013, the Kings traded Patterson, along with Greivis Vásquez, John Salmons and Chuck Hayes to the Toronto Raptors for Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray.\nOn July 12, 2014, Patterson re-signed with the Raptors to a reported three-year, $18 million contract.\nOklahoma City Thunder (2017–2019).\nOn July 10, 2017, Patterson signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. On August 10, 2017, he underwent a successful arthroscopic procedure on his left knee. On August 1, 2019, Patterson and the Thunder agreed to a buyout, allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2019–2021).\nOn August 16, 2019, Patterson signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nOn September 23, 2021, Patterson signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. However, he was waived on October 16, after two preseason games.\nFilm career.\nOn October 19, 2021, Patterson and Joel Reilly launched Undisputed Pictures, a film company."

        "text": "Robert M. Gibson (April 6, 1927 – April 10, 2015) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Bowling Green University 1965 to 1967. Gibson played college football as a quarterback at Youngstown State University, from which he graduated in 1950. Coaching for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) as offensive coordinator in 1978, Gibson most famously called the play that resulted in the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\".\nThe Miracle at the Meadowlands.\nPlaying their archrival Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants were leading 17–12 and had possession of the ball with only 30 seconds left. They had only to kneel the ball to end the game, as the Eagles had no timeouts. Gibson ordered Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik to run play \"Brown right, near wing, 65 slant\", which called for Pisarcik to hand the ball off to fullback Larry Csonka. The handoff was botched and Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards picked up the loose ball and ran in for the game-winning score.\nGibson's reasoning was governed by what happened a play earlier. Pisarcik had taken a knee, only to be knocked over when the Eagles' Bill Bergey charged into Giants' center Jim Clack. This violated an unwritten rule that defensive players do not rush in a situation when the quarterback kneels down. Gibson didn't want to risk getting Pisarcik injured or expose his players to penalties or fines for fighting. However, he didn't explain this to the players, and it came across as a power trip. Head coach John McVay's headphones weren't working, and he later said that he would have overruled Gibson had he known what was happening.\nWith angry Giants fans demanding someone be held responsible for the debacle, owner Wellington Mara and operations director Andy Robustelli met and decided Gibson had to go. He was fired the next morning. So great was the stigma of having called the play that he never worked in football at any level again. He refused to speak about the incident up until his death in 2015; when ESPN reached him by phone in 2008, he said, \"I haven't talked about the game for 30 years, and I'm not about to start now.\"\nGibson left New York and opened a bait shop and general store on Florida's Sanibel Island, where he raised cattle on his ranch. Gibson still stayed in contact with McVay and another member of the 1978 staff, Lindy Infante, but otherwise largely moved on from his time in the NFL. Gibson died at age 88 on April 10, 2015."

        "title": "History of the Tonga national rugby league team",
        "text": "This is a history of the Tonga national rugby league team.\nFoundation years.\nRugby league first gained attention in Tonga when the Pacific Cup competition would be partially held in the country during 1986. After this initial exposure to the Tongan people several clubs began to form or switch from rugby union to rugby league and by 1988 the nation had enough depth in their player pool to begin playing national fixtures and would decide to enter the 1988 Pacific Cup competition held in neighbouring Samoa in their capital Apia.\nDuring that Pacific Cup the Tongans would play in three fixtures winning a sole match against the American Samoans 38-14 that would double as their first international victory; the team would however fail to win their other two matches against Western Samoa 40-30 and the New Zealand Maori 42–16.\nRoad to maiden Pacific Cup title.\nOver the next two years the national side sporadically played international fixtures but it would not be until the 1992 Pacific Cup when they would again begin playing with some regularity. At the 1992 Cup competition the side would show significant improvement on their previous inaugural cup effort with victories over Niue, Cook Islands, Fiji and the New Zealand Maori. This run of victories would earn them a place in the final of the 1992 Pacific Cup against the Western Samoan side but they would eventually lose a close fought match by four points 18–14. The following tournament two years later would see the Tongan side show further improvement with several comfortable victories again earning them a spot in final of the Pacific Cup this time against the Fijians who had never defeated the Tongans at that time. The final would be a tough affair but the \"Mate Ma'a\" would again be victorious over Fiji 34-11 and would claim their maiden Pacific Cup title.\n1995 World Cup.\nDuring 1995 Tonga qualified for their first World Cup that year and were seeded in the strong group B with both New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. While Tonga failed to win a match at the World Cup they earned copious amounts of respect after they only narrowly lost to the New Zealand team by a single point and earn a draw against Papua New Guinea.\nBetween World Cups.\nThe next four years saw the Tongan side appear in a further Pacific Cup in 1997 and then qualify for the 2000 World Cup with comfortable victories over the Cook Islands, Tokelau and American Samoa. Prior to appearing at the 2000 competition the Tongans arranged a friendly fixture against the New Zealand side that they had come so close to defeating during the previous World Cup but this time sustained their heaviest defeat to date going down 74-0 and suffering a large dent in confidence prior to the competition.\n2000 World Cup.\nAfter the heavy defeat to New Zealand their next international fixture would be during their second World Cup where the Tongans would again be placed in another tough group with France, Papua New Guinea again and the South Africans. Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament where they would be comfortable victors in a 66-18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament would not be so kind to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again fail to make it past the first stage of the tournament.\nSecond Pacific Cup title.\nWith a disappointing World Cup behind them the \"Mate Ma'a\" regrouped and again entered the Pacific Cup four years later in 2004. The tournament saw the Tongans again qualify for the tournament final with victories over both the Cook Islands and Fiji but the side would suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of neighbouring Samoa 51–18. 2006 saw the Tongan side re-enter the Pacific Cup where again they performed strongly qualifying for their second consecutive final where this time they reversed their previous effort with a strong victory over Fiji 22-4 giving them their second Pacific Cup title.\nFederation Shield, World Cup Qualification.\n2006 would continue to be a busy year of international fixtures for the Tongans which saw them gain qualification into the 2008 World Cup after they would finish top of their Pacific group ahead of the Cook Islands, Fiji and Samoa and then defeat the Samoans 18–10 in the qualifying final. They would also enter the inaugural Federation Shield competition along with England, France and Samoa and eventually finish second to the English in a tough final which would eventually end 32-14 and saw several Tongan players sin binned. During the tournament they also achieved a good victory over neighbouring Samoa and a surprising victory over the French that also saw them take their fourth place world ranking.\nWar Cry.\nThe Tongan war cry, the Sipi Tau is accompanied by a traditional dance similar in style to the New Zealand Haka.\nMate Ma'a Tonga War Cry\nHii\nMate Ma'a Tonga War Cry (FULL)"

It aims to provide a training aid and unbiased scoring for the sport of Amateur Boxing and potentially other Combat and Martial art sports.\nDevelopment organisations.\nPrevious involvement in the project:\nOverview.\nThe system uses wireless communication, micro sensors, smart integration, and computer scoring in an attempt to encourage accuracy and safety in the sport of amateur boxing based on a concept initially developed at Griffith University by Kurt Pope. The \"boxing suit\" also aims to provide a powerful training aid for coaches and sports scientists.\nThe system allows monitoring of performance in real-time and is able to indicate the location of hits, display basic statistics on hit locations, and the show current score of each boxer. The advanced software package allows further analysis and playback of recorded bouts which allows the boxing coach and sports scientists to analyse and compare bouts blow-by-blow. The system comprises two suits, each of which includes a pair of standard boxing gloves, head guard protector, and thin light weight vests. Each suit has been instrumented to allow detection of impacts.\nA new sport derived from boxing but modified for safety, called Box'Tag, is now using the system to score competitions."

In his fifth year as head coach, Ben Howland led the team to its third straight Final Four appearance. The Bruins also set a new record number of wins for the regular season, eclipsing the 26 wins of 2006–07. Though the team was composed of many standout players, freshman center Kevin Love garnered much of the media's and school's attention with his .565 shooting percentage, 10.7 rebounds per game, 5.3 blocks, and 17.6 points per game.\nThe only losses the Bruins incurred during the regular season were to No. 8 Texas, and Pac-10 rivals USC and Washington, though the USC victory was later vacated upon discovery that USC player O. J. Mayo received illegal benefits while playing for USC. After becoming the Pacific-10 regular season champions and winning the Pacific-10 tournament, the Bruins were seeded No. 1 in the West Regional bracket of the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Bruins held Mississippi Valley State to 29 points, the lowest total ever allowed in the first or second round of the tournament. After reaching the Final Four for the third year in a row, the Bruins lost to Memphis, the South Regional Champions. On August 20, 2009, Memphis' 38 wins during the 2007–2008 season and Final Four appearances were vacated by the NCAA Committee on Infractions for the team's using an ineligible player, Derrick Rose.\nRoster.\nThirteen scholarships were available to the team, and there were sixteen players on the roster.

He umpired in four World Series and five All-Star Games. Stevens also refereed college basketball.\nBiography.\nBorn in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, he officiated in the World Series in 1951 (outfield only), 1954, 1960 and 1967, serving as crew chief in 1967, and in the All-Star Game in 1950, 1953, 1957, 1960 (both games) and 1965, working behind the plate in 1965 and for the second half of the 1957 game; he also worked behind the plate for Game 1 of the 1970 American League Championship Series during a labor strike, after having begun working primarily as an assistant league supervisor and substitute umpire in 1968.\nStevens was behind the plate on August 20, when Bob Keegan of the Chicago White Sox pitched a 6–0 no-hitter against the Washington Senators, missing a perfect game only due to walks in the fifth and sixth innings. Stevens was again behind the plate on April 30, when Steve Barber and Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles combined on a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers, only to lose 2–1 after issuing ten walks and hitting two batsmen. Detroit won with two runs in the ninth inning, tying the game on a Barber wild pitch after he had issued two walks, and then bringing in the lead run on an infield error by normally sure-handed second baseman Mark Belanger, who dropped a perfect throw from shortstop Luis Aparicio. It was the first time in Major League Baseball history multiple pitchers combined on a nine-inning no-hitter only to lose.\nStevens was also working the plate on September 10, 1967, when Joel Horlen threw his no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against the visiting Detroit Tigers at Comiskey Park before a crowd of 23,625. \nStevens also worked as a basketball referee, officiating in the NIT and NCAA tournaments. He was the godfather of National Basketball Association referee Steve Javie. Stevens died at age 69 in Philadelphia."

        "text": "The European Bowling Tour (EBT) is one of three tenpin bowling tours (Europe, Americas, Asia) that form part of the ranking system of the World Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA).\nThe tour is run by the European Tenpin Bowling Federation. In all the tournaments, men and women compete alongside each other, with women receiving a handicap per game. In these tournaments there is only one prize fund (not split for men &amp; women), however some tournaments offer additional bonuses for the highest placed woman, which is often in addition to any of the regular prize money.\nHistory.\nDuring the 1990s, there had been several attempts to develop Ten-pin bowling tours in Europe but these were usually limited to one country (The Danish Masters Tour and the German Golden Bowling Ball Tour). It wasn't until 2000 that the European Bowling Tour was launched initially holding 9 tournaments in 8 countries. It has since expanded over the course of 19 years and now consists of 13 events in 2019. The Brunswick Ballmaster Open in Helsinki is the only tournament having joined the tour since the beginning in 2000.\nTour.\nThe format varies from tournament to tournament, but generally most tournaments on the EBT take the form of 6 games re-entry qualification, with the top 50–60 bowlers (depending on the tournament) bowling a further set of games (most commonly 4), before a final cut to either single elimination matchplay or stepladder finals.\nPrevious Ranking Winners.\nRanking winners of the European Bowling Tour, since 2000\nEBT Masters.\nThe EBT Masters is played at a different host centre each year, usually before/after the EBT event in the same location.\nPreviously, qualification for this event is the top 12 men and top 12 women from the previous year's EBT ranking. Now its top 8 and top 8 women from previous years EBT ranking.\nPreviously, the format was a Round Robin consisting of 11 rounds of one game matches. 20 bonus points are awarded for each match won, 10 for drawn matches. The top 3 bowlers after the round robin qualify for a 3-person stepladder to determine the winner of the masters.\nIn 2019, top 8 men and top 8 women after conclusion of the European Bowling Tour 2018 qualified for the 2019 EBT Masters. The format is 8 games total pinfall, top 4 advance to bowl another 4 games, pinfall carrying over. Total pinfall after 12 games determined the EBT Masters champions.\nThe 2022 edition was the final of the EBT 2020+2021 combined. Eight men, ranging from rank 1 to 15 and seven women competed due to prior commitments."

J. Sterling hired a detective who discovered that Benson and teammate Haldor Halderson received C$6,500 to play amateur hockey. The Amateur Athletic Union of Canada voided Halderson's registration card and he was suspended from the 1921 Allan Cup playoffs, although the Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association allowed him and his Saskatoon team to continue in the league playoffs."

        "text": "Richard M. Moran (January 18, 1937 – April 24, 2022) was an American Hall of Fame lacrosse player and coach.\nPlaying career.\nHis playing career began as an All-County midfielder at Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, New York, from 1951–1955 and helped his team to four consecutive undefeated seasons before heading to the University of Maryland where he was a key performer on the 1959 Terrapins National Championship team.\nHead coaching career.\nMoran's head coaching career began in 1961 at Manhasset High School, where he compiled a 67-5 record over five seasons, winning the Long Island Championship from 1962 to 1964. In 1966, Moran became the first lacrosse coach at Elmont Memorial High School and promptly posted a 29-3 record and won two league championships in two seasons. He was also the head coach of the Long Island Athletic Club from 1966–1968, leading the team to a 31-4 record and capturing the 1968 club championship, the first-ever United States Club Lacrosse Association (USCLA) club title won by a northern team. In 1969, he succeeded the legendary Ned Harkness as the head men's lacrosse coach at Cornell University and went on to lead the Big Red for 29 seasons, winning three national championships (1971, 1976, 1977). His teams won 15 Ivy League championships, including ten straight from 1974 to 1983, and turned in three national runner-up performances, losing in the title game in 1978, 1987 and 1988. Moran also set an NCAA record as he guided his teams to 42 consecutive victories from 1976–78 and an Ivy League record 39 straight conference wins from 1973-1979.\nDuring his tenure with the Big Red, Moran was named the USILA Coach of the Year three times (1971, 1977, 1987) the USILA Man of the Year (1975), and served as the head coach of Team USA in the 1978 World Lacrosse Championship. He served as the President of the Irish Lacrosse Foundation and coached Team Ireland in the World Lacrosse Championships in 2010 in Manchester, England, finishing 9th, in 2006 in London, Ontario, where the team took a seventh-place finish, in Perth, Australia in 2002, where the team went undefeated (5-0) en route to winning the Green Division title. Richie has also been involved in two European Lacrosse Championships with Team Ireland and prepared the team for the 2014 World Lacrosse Championships in Denver, CO.\nPost-coaching career.\nMoran was inducted into the Manhasset, Long Island and Upstate New York Lacrosse Halls of Fame, as well as the Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame and most recently, the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. His 1976 and 1977 Cornell teams featuring players Mike French and Eamon McEneaney are frequently cited as among the top college lacrosse teams in NCAA history. Moran is also considered a lacrosse innovator by introducing the game to a greater pool of talented lacrosse players, specifically by recruiting box lacrosse players from Canada as well as high school talent from upstate New York.\nIn 2012, Richie Moran received the \"Spirit of Tewaaraton\" award which is presented to an individual involved in the sport of lacrosse, who nobly reflects the finest virtues exemplified in the game, and who, over the course of his life, has made a significant contribution to society and to the lives of others.\nIn May 2016, Moran was inducted into the inaugural class of the Intercollegiate Men's Lacrosse Coaches Association (IMLCA) Hall of Fame.\nIn 2017, Moran published his autobiography \"It's Great to Be Here\", detailing his birth during the Great Depression, his family's great sacrifice during World War II, his years as an elite player and years as a revered and successful coach.\nMoran died on April 24, 2022, at the age of 85. At the time, his family included his wife Pat, their three children, Kevin, Jennifer and Kathy, and their eight grandchildren, Kylie, Ryan, Chase, Lindsay, Adrienne, Eamon, Quinlan, and Finn."

        "title": "Kingston Heath Golf Club",
        "text": "Kingston Heath Golf Club is one of the premier golf clubs in Australia, located in Cheltenham, Victoria. The course is situated on the sandbelt region in the southeast suburbs of Melbourne famed for its golf courses, with Kingston Heath consistently ranked in the top 3 courses in Australia and top 20 courses in the world.\nThe club has hosted many major events, including 7 x Men's Australian Opens, 1 x Women's Australian Open, 7 x Victorian Opens, 2 x Australian Masters and the 2016 World Cup of Golf. The Men's Australian Open was scheduled to return to Kingston Heath in 2020 but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKingston Heath will host the Presidents Cup in 2028.\nHistory.\nElsternwick Park (1909–1925).\nKingston Heath was originally formed as the Elsternwick Golf Club in 1909, and was based at present day Elsternwick Park. In 1920, the committee discussed a relocation to the South-Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. This area would become world famous as the Melbourne Sandbelt.\nCheltenham (1925–present).\nThe club relocated to its present location in Cheltenham in 1925. This move included the complete dismantling, moving and re-assembling of the original clubhouse to the new site. The club officially opened in April 1925, and was renamed Kingston Heath 5 months later.\nCourse.\nThe current course was designed by Dan Soutar and was constructed by M.A Morcom. Originally, it played as a par 82 and at the time was the longest course in Australia. Its founders were of the opinion that it was easier to shorten the course rather than to lengthen it. The original scorecard read as below:\nAdvice was sought from Alister MacKenzie during his visit to Australia in 1926, who provided a suitable bunkering strategy for the course. Although many link MacKenzie to the actual design of Kingston Heath, his only course routing input was to change the 15th hole. This was a short par 4 (222 yards) which played as a blind tee shot over a hill before descending to the green. MacKenzie's recommendation was to shorten the hole, bringing the green to the top of the rise and becoming a tricky, uphill par 3. Work commenced soon after, with the newly rated par 3 15th becoming one of the most recognisable holes in Australian golf, and Kingston Heath's signature hole.\nOver the years, the par of the course has gradually dropped, now playing as a par 72 for Men and 74 for Women.\nIn 2002, the club constructed a 19th hole - a par 3 positioned between the 1st green and 2nd tee. This hole was designed to championship specifications, allowing the club to insert it into the course rotation during times of required maintenance of another hole. The 19th has since become a fixture in the club's \"Tournament\" course, often replacing the 10th hole in major events.\nAn interesting feature of the course is the adaptability in producing different layouts. Given it does not allow a traditional \"9 out, 9 in\" layout as many courses of its stature do, an alternative was required for the hosting of major events. The introduction of the 19th hole assisted in allowing the club to produce a more tournament friendly layout, known as the \"Inner and Outer\" course, routing players through the 9 inner most holes of the property as the front 9, returning them to the clubhouse after 9 holes. They then play the 9 outer most holes of the property as the back 9, allowing them to finish on the 18th hole.\nChampionships.\nThe Open Championship International Final Qualifying.\nKingston Heath was the preferred Australian venue of the R&amp;A for the staging of International Final Qualifying for The Open Championship, which was held each January from 2004 to 2013.\nCourse ranking.\nThe course is consistently ranked within the top 3 courses in Australia. It also regularly features in publications such as \"Golf Digest\" and \"Golf Magazine\" in their \"World's Top 100 Golf Courses\" lists, which has seen Kingston Heath hold a position in the top-20 for a number of years."

        "text": "The 1957 Ice Hockey World Championships were held between 24 February and 5 March 1957 at the Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium in Moscow, USSR.\nThis was the last World Championships played on natural ice; and were the first World Championships held in the Soviet Union and they are remembered for the political circumstances surrounding the games. Hungary had been recently occupied by the Soviet Army (to suppress a revolution in October and November 1956), and as a result, the United States and Canada boycotted the World Championships in protest. Joining them were Norway, West Germany, Italy and Switzerland. East Germany participated at the top level for the first time.\nCompetition.\nWith the boycott, the home team USSR was heavily favoured to win the tournament, but Sweden surprised the world by pulling off an upset. The first step was taken in their third game, when they beat Czechoslovakia 2-0. This important victory was saved by the head of Leksands IF defenseman Vilgot Larsson. He literally headed the puck away from the Swedish net to save a goal, and in the days before mandatory helmets, received several stitches for his heroics. In the final game, Sweden opened with two goals, but the dynamic Soviets responded with four goals of their own. Down by two in the third period, goals by Eilert Määttä and Erling Lindström tied the game, and the goaltending of Thord Flodqvist and play of Sven \"Tumba\" Johansson guaranteed the final draw. The USSR had previously only tied Czechoslovakia, so all Sweden needed was one point, or a tie, for gold.\nKarel Straka of Czechoslovakia was named best goaltender. Nikolaï Sologubov of the USSR was best defenceman, and Sven \"Tumba\" Johansson of Sweden was best forward. Konstantin Loktev of the USSR led all scorers with 18 points (on 11 goals and 7 assists), followed by Nils Nilsson and Ronald Pettersson of Sweden, both with 16 points. Vsevolod Bobrov of the USSR led all scorers with 13 goals. Japan competed for the first time since 1930, and finished last with one point in the standings.\nThe Soviets did not have the Swedish national anthem ready for the gold medal ceremony. To compensate for this, the Swedish players decided to sing the anthem over the stadium's PA system. However, few players knew the anthem by heart so they decided to play a little prank on the Soviets and instead sang the Swedish drinking song \"Helan Går\". Swedish captain Lasse Björn later recalled the story of Marshal Zhukov, the Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union, standing to attention for a simple Swedish drinking song.\nAttendance record.\nThe final game (USSR versus Sweden for the championship) was played on the football field of the Grand Sports Arena of the Luzhniki Stadium. It is reputed that over 50,000 fans (or 55,000, depending on sources) saw the game, the most ever for an international hockey game. This stood as the world record until 6 October 2001, when 74,544 fans saw Michigan State University and the University of Michigan play an American NCAA Hockey game outdoors at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Michigan.\nEuropean Championship medal table.\nGames played against Japan did not count for the purposes of determining the European champion. Since six of the seven European participants defeated Japan, and since the only opponent that did not defeat Japan (Austria) also lost to each of their European opponents, finishing order for the European championship table was the same as it was for the main championship table."

        "text": "James Allen Dickey (born April 2, 1954) is an American college basketball coach and current Senior Advisor of men's basketball at West Virginia University. He was most recently an assistant coach at Oklahoma State University. He previously served as the men's head coach at Texas Tech University from 1991 to 2001, where he led the Red Raiders to the NCAA tournament in 1993 and again in 1996, and at the University of Houston from 2010 to 2014.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nDickey attended Valley Springs High School, where he played basketball from 1970 to 1972. He later played for Central Arkansas from 1972 to 1976.\nCoaching career.\nDickey's best team was the Texas Tech's 1996 unit, which finished 30–2, including an undefeated record in the final season of Southwest Conference play. They won the SWC conference tournament and advanced all the way to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Raiders moved to the Big 12 for the 1996–97 season, and appeared to pick up right where they left off with a solid 19–9 season. It was discovered during the inaugural Big 12 basketball tournament, however, that two players had played the entire season while academically ineligible. Hours after the team's first-round game, Texas Tech announced that it was withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won.\nA subsequent investigation revealed massive violations dating back to 1990 in men's basketball and nine other sports (though Dickey himself was not personally implicated). As a result, the NCAA stripped Tech of its two NCAA tournament wins in 1996 and docked it nine scholarships over four years. The lost scholarships were too much for Dickey to overcome, and he tallied four straight losing seasons before being fired in 2001.\nHe was announced as the head coach of the Houston Cougars on April 1, 2010.\nAfter four seasons and a 64–62 record, Dickey resigned his position as head coach."
