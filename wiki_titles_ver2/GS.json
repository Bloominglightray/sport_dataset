In turn, no champion was crowned.\nThe NAIA had pre-determined that this would be the final edition of a separate Division II tournament, planning to consolidate its two divisional tournaments back into a single event for 2021. With the cancellation of this event, the 2019 event was the last completed edition of the tournament.\nThe completed games of the tournament were played at the Sanford Pentagon in Sioux Falls, South Dakota."

        "text": "David McLean (born 5 October 1977) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played for the Balmain Tigers and the Penrith Panthers in the NRL.\nPlaying career.\nA Parramatta junior, McLean was graded by the now defunct Balmain Tigers in 1997. He made his first grade debut from the bench in his side's 30−16 loss to the Newcastle Knights at Leichhardt Oval in round 23 of the 1998 season. This was his only game of first grade for Balmain. The Tigers finished the season in 13th position and folded at the end of following the season. McLean remained at Balmain during the 1999 season, but did not make any appearances in first grade. Balmain controversially merged with rivals the Western Suburbs Magpies to form the Wests Tigers as part of the NRL's rationalization strategy. McLean was not offered a contract to play with the newly formed team for the 2000 NRL season and subsequently left the club at season's end.\nHe later joined the Penrith Panthers, making his club debut for Penrith coming off the bench in his side's 31−12 loss to the Cronulla Sharks at Penrith Stadium in round 6 of the 2001 season. This was his only first grade appearance in the 2001 season. His opportunities in the top grade would be limited in the coming seasons, with solitary appearances in both 2003 and 2004 and in the meantime being captain of the St. Marys-Penrith Cougars in the NSWRL Premier League.\nIn 2005 however he earned some more consistent time in the NRL, making 7 appearances that were spaced out throughout the season. Although primarily a forward his one starting appearance for the Panthers that year was at . His final game of first grade came in his side's 38−22 victory over the Wests Tigers at Stadium Australia in the final round of the 2005 season. At season's end he left the Panthers, taking up the role of captain-coach of Berkeley Eagles in the Illawarra competition. In 2007 he was crowned the player of the year by the Country Rugby League, and later joined Ourimbah Wyoming Magpies in the Central Coast competition where he played out his career. Post-career he stayed on at the Central Coast and was involved with coaching with a number of clubs."

He was previously the Special Teams Coordinator and Tight Ends coach for Duke University. His previous coaching stops include Defiance College, Lindsey Wilson College, Northwestern University, and nine seasons at Ball State University.\nPlaying career.\nDougherty was a four-year letterman at linebacker, starting for two seasons, at Ohio Dominican from 2004 to 2007. He earned Academica All-Conference honors three times.\nCoaching career.\nDefiance College.\nImmediately following his playing career, Dougherty joined the staff at Defiance College coaching the defensive line for two seasons in 2008 and 2009. While there, he tutored four all-conference defensive linemen.\nLindsey Wilson.\nIn 2010, Dougherty joined Chris Oliver’s staff at Lindsey Wilson. Oliver had been the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach during Dougherty’s playing days at Ohio Dominican. As the special teams coordinator and defensive line coach, Dougherty helped lead the Blue Raiders in their first two seasons playing football and coached six all-conference players, including the conference player of the year.\nBall State (First stint).\nIn 2012, Dougherty served as an offensive graduate assistant working with the offensive line for Pete Lembo and the Ball State Cardinals football team. He helped guide the Cardinals to a 9-4 record.\nNorthwestern.\nFor the 2013 season, he served as a defensive quality control coach Pat Fitzgerald and the Northwestern Wildcats. He helped coach the linebackers.\nBall State (Second Stint).\nIn 2014, Dougherty earned his first full-time opportunity at the Division 1 level when he returned to Ball State as the tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator. The hired was a key piece in quieting rumors of Lembo’s departure, as he continued to fill out his staff. Following the 2015 season, Lembo resigned, and Ball State hired Mike Neu as the new head coach. Dougherty was retained by Neu, and promoted to special teams coordinator. He was promoted again, to assistant head coach, in February 2020.\nOver the course of Dougherty’s time at the Muncie, Indiana University, he developed over 20 all-conference players, helped guide the Cardinals to their first Mid-American Conference title inover 20 years, achieve their first ever bowl victory, and their first ever year-ending rankings in the AP and coaches polls.\nBall State led the MAC in kickoff returns in 2017 and finished in the top three in the conference two other times, as well as 21st nationally in return efficiency in 2019. The kickoff coverage unit has consistently been at the top of the league, finishing among the top 20 in the country in 2019, while the punt return unit has finished in the top three of the MAC multiple times.\nDougherty's special teams on the 2020 championship squad ranked second in the MAC in kickoff average, featured all-conference return specialist Justin Hall and punter Nathan Snyder, and registered a blocked field goal in the MAC Championship Game and blocked punt in the Arizona Bowl.\nThe special teams units also contributed on the scoreboard with two touchdowns via kick returns and one coming from a blocked punt. Dougherty helped kick returner Malik Dunner earn All-MAC honors three straight years in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and guided kicker Morgan Hagee to a new Ball State PAT record in 2018 (129). Hagee finished his Ball State career ranked third in program history in points (282).\nDuke.\nDougherty joined Mike Elko’s inaugural Duke staff as the special teams coordinator and tight ends coach in January 2022.\nTexas A&amp;M.\nOn December 30th, 2023, it was announced that Dougherty would join Mike Elko's staff as Special Teams Coordinator. It would be the first special teams coordinator that the Aggies would have employed since 2018, as they did not have a full time assistant for the position for 5 seasons under former head coach Jimbo Fisher. \nPersonal life.\nDougherty and his wife, Emma, have a son named Griffin."

        "text": "The 2023 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2023 Cazoo World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 15 April to 1 May 2023 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 47th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship was staged at the venue. The qualifying rounds took place from 3 to 12 April 2023 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The 15th and final ranking tournament of the 2022–23 snooker season, it was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the first time by car retailer Cazoo. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, in Europe by Eurosport, and elsewhere in the world by Matchroom Sport and other broadcasters. The total prize fund was £2,395,000, of which the winner received £500,000.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having defeated Judd Trump 18–13 in the 2022 final. He made a record 31st Crucible appearance, surpassing the 30 appearances by Steve Davis, and reached a record-extending 21st quarter-final—also becoming the first player to compete in 100 matches at the Crucible—but lost 10–13 to Belgian player Luca Brecel. Fan Zhengyi, Jak Jones, Pang Junxu, Si Jiahui, and Wu Yize all featured at the main stage for the first time. Si, aged 20, became the first debutant to reach the semi-finals since Andy Hicks at the 1995 event and the youngest player to do so since O'Sullivan at the 1996 event. Brecel came from 5–14 behind in the semi-finals to defeat Si 17–15, the first time a player had won a match at the Crucible after trailing by nine frames. Brecel went on to defeat Mark Selby 18–15 in the final, winning his first world title, first Triple Crown title, and fourth ranking title. He became the sport's first world champion from mainland Europe.\nThe event's main stage produced 90 century breaks, including two maximum breaks, one by Kyren Wilson in his first-round match against Ryan Day, and the other by Selby, who became the first player to make a maximum in a World Championship final. O'Sullivan made both his 1,200th century in professional competition and his 200th Crucible century at the event. The qualifying rounds produced another 135 centuries, including a 115 break by Ng On-yee, the highest by a woman in the tournament's history. \nBackground.\nThe first World Snooker Championship final took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Staged annually until 1940, the tournament was put on hiatus during World War II and went into decline in the post-war era; the 1952 World Snooker Championship was contested by only two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was also discontinued in 1957. Revived on a challenge basis in 1964, the World Snooker Championship reverted to an annual knockout tournament in 1969. In 1977, the tournament was first staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, where it has remained since. \nThe 2023 event (officially known as the 2023 Cazoo World Snooker Championship) was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the first time by British car retailer Cazoo. It marked the 47th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 55th successive year that the World Championship was contested through the modern knockout format. It also marked the 40th anniversary of the first maximum break at the tournament, achieved by Cliff Thorburn at the 1983 event. Ronnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having defeated Judd Trump 18–13 in the 2022 final to win his seventh world title, equalling Stephen Hendry's modern-era record. O'Sullivan made a record 31st Crucible appearance at the 2023 event, surpassing the 30 appearances by Steve Davis. \nTen Chinese players, including 2021 UK Championship winner Zhao Xintong and 2021 Masters winner Yan Bingtao, were ineligible to compete in the 2023 event, having been suspended from professional competition and charged with match-fixing violations earlier in the season. Disciplinary hearings for the suspended players began on 24 April, midway through the tournament, resulting in lifetime bans for two players—Liang Wenbo and Li Hang—and lengthy bans for the others.\nFormat.\nThe qualifying stage took place from 3 to 12 April 2023 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, featuring 128 players, 16 of whom qualified for the main stage. World Championship qualifiers from 2020 to 2022 had comprised three rounds played as the best of 11 and a final round played as the best of 19 frames, with higher-ranked players seeded through to the second or third rounds. The 2023 event reverted to a best-of-19 format for all four rounds of qualifying, as had been the case before the COVID-19 pandemic, but seeded draws remained in place. Qualification rounds were broadcast by Discovery+ in Europe; Liaoning TV, Superstar online, , Youku and Huya Live in China; and by Matchroom Sport in all other territories. The final qualifying round was also streamed on the World Snooker Tour's Facebook page and YouTube channel. \nThe first-round draw took place on BBC Radio 5 Live on 13 April, during which the 16 successful qualifiers were drawn at random against the top 16 players in the snooker world rankings. The draw was hosted by Rob Walker, with reactions from Shaun Murphy. The main stage took place from 15 April to 1 May at the Crucible Theatre. First-round matches were played from 15 to 20 April as the best of 19 frames. Second-round matches were played from 20 to 24 April as the best of 25 frames. Quarter-finals were played on 25 and 26 April as the best of 25 frames, and the semi-finals were played from 27 to 29 April as the best of 33 frames. The final was played over two days, 30 April and 1 May, as the best of 35 frames. \nThe main stage of the tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, Eurosport, and Discovery+, and elsewhere in Europe by Eurosport and Discovery+. Other international broadcasts were provided by Superstar online, Migu, Huya Live, Youku, and CCTV in China; by NowTV in Hong Kong; by FastsportsHD in Pakistan; by Astro SuperSport in Malaysia and Brunei; by TrueVisions in Thailand; by Premier Sports in the Philippines; by StarHub in Singapore; by Sportcast in Taiwan and Indonesia; and by DAZN in the United States and Brazil. In territories where there was no other coverage, the event was broadcast by Matchroom Sport. The BBC coverage of the last session of the final attracted an average of 2.7 million viewers, with a peak of 3.6 million.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nA bonus of £40,000 was on offer for a maximum break made at the Crucible, and £10,000 for a maximum made in the qualifying rounds. These bonuses were in addition to the £15,000 highest prize and were shared in the case of multiple maximums. No player achieved a maximum in the qualifying rounds, but both Kyren Wilson and Mark Selby made maximums at the Crucible; they each received £27,500, representing half of the combined highest break and maximum break prizes.\nSummary.\nQualification.\nFirst qualification round.\nThe first qualifying round featured players ranked 81 to 112 against players seeded 113 to 144, including selected amateurs. The tournament featured five female players, the most in 31 years, although all five lost in the first qualifying round. Mink Nutcharut lost 7–10 to Dechawat Poomjaeng, but made her first century break in professional competition, becoming the first woman since Kelly Fisher in 2002 to make a century in a World Championship match. The following day, Ng On-yee made a 115 break, the highest by a woman in the event's history. However, Ng lost 8–10 to Michael Holt, while Reanne Evans lost 5–10 to Ken Doherty. The reigning women's world champion Baipat Siripaporn lost 3–10 to Aaron Hill, and Rebecca Kenna lost by the same score to Alfie Burden. \nThe seven-time champion Hendry lost 4–10 to James Cahill, his ex-wife's nephew, but stated that he still had \"a very distant dream\" of one day reaching the Crucible again. Stan Moody, aged 16, had recently earned the right to play on the professional tour as he won a two-year tour card to begin in the 2023–24 season by winning the WSF Junior Snooker Championship. He defeated Andres Petrov 10–7 to win his first World Championship match. The 2022 Hong Kong Masters finalist Marco Fu lost 5–10 to Martin O'Donnell. Ukrainian player Iulian Boiko defeated Muhammad Asif 10–2. Austrian player Florian Nüßle defeated Michael Judge by the same score. Evans, Fu, Judge, Ng, and Dean Young all lost their professional tour cards after their first-round defeats. However, Evans secured a new two-year tour card by ending the season at number one in the World Women's Snooker rankings, following her performance at the 2023 British Women's Open. Fu was awarded a two-year invitational tour card. Young later secured a new two-year tour card through 2023 Q School.\nSecond qualification round.\nThe second qualifying round featured the first-round winners against players ranked 49 to 80. Sean O'Sullivan was on course for a maximum break when he two in one shot, leaving him unable to complete the maximum; he finished on a break of 140. Matthew Stevens defeated Poomjaeng 10–8, despite having in the final frame. Poomjaeng posed for a selfie with Stevens after the first session while trailing 3–6. Jimmy White, who had last reached the Crucible in 2006, had predicted that he was \"playing too well\" not to reach the main stage in 2023. However, he lost 4–10 to O'Donnell, a defeat he blamed on tweaking his technique late in the season, calling it a \"huge mistake\" and a \"schoolboy error\". Si Jiahui led Nüßle 9–1, but Nüßle narrowed his deficit to two frames before Si won the match 10–7. Hill defeated Michael White 10–3 and Zhang Anda beat Moody by the same score. \nWelsh player Jackson Page defeated Scotland's Ross Muir 10–2. Doherty made a 137 break as he defeated Hammad Miah 10–6, but broached the possibility of retirement at the end of the 2023–24 season if his overall form did not improve. Ben Mertens defeated fellow Belgian player Julien Leclercq, also by a 10–6 scoreline, while Scott Donaldson defeated 16-year-old Liam Davies 10–1. Stuart Carrington, Gerard Greene, Louis Heathcote, Duane Jones, Mitchell Mann, Miah, Jamie O'Neill, Fraser Patrick, Craig Steadman, and Alexander Ursenbacher all lost their tour cards after their second-round defeats. However, Miah qualified through the one-year ranking list for a new two-year tour card. Carrington, Heathcote, and Ursenbacher later secured new two-year tour cards through 2023 Q School.\nThird qualification round.\nThe third qualifying round featured the second-round winners against players ranked 17 to 48. The 2006 champion Graeme Dott reached the final round with a 10–6 victory over Andy Hicks. From 7–9 behind against John Astley, world number 21 Anthony McGill made breaks of 136 and 98 to force a deciding frame, which he won. Thepchaiya Un-Nooh made four centuries, including a 145, as he defeated Mark Joyce 10–5. Ricky Walden beat Ian Burns 10–6. The 2013 runner-up Barry Hawkins played in the qualifying rounds for the first time since 2012 after falling to number 20 in the world rankings. He defeated David Lilley 10–4, despite failing to make a break over 50 in the contest. Two-time semi-finalist Stephen Maguire, who had reached the last 16 of only one tournament during the season, defeated Burden 10–4. Fan Zhengyi defeated Boiko 10–8, while the 2023 Snooker Shoot Out winner Chris Wakelin beat Hill 10–2 and Northern Irish player Jordan Brown defeated Dominic Dale 10–7. Si advanced to the fourth round with a 10–5 victory over the 2023 German Masters runner-up Tom Ford.\nJoe Perry trailed Sanderson Lam 4–5 after the first session, but recovered to win 10–8, his first victory in the qualifiers in four years. World number 23 Hossein Vafaei, who made his Crucible debut the previous year, defeated Andrew Pagett 10–4. Page defeated Martin Gould 10–6. David Gilbert advanced with a 10–3 win over Barry Pinches, and Stevens defeated fellow Welsh player Jamie Clarke by the same score. Cahill and Zhou Yuelong played just six frames in their opening session, which ended level at 3–3. Cahill scored only 15 points over the next six frames as Zhou took a 9–3 lead; Zhou went on to win the match 10–4. The 2022 British Open winner Ryan Day took an 8–4 lead over 2022 Crucible debutant Ashley Hugill. Hugill narrowed Day's lead to 8–7, but Day secured a 10–8 victory in a 30-minute final frame. After the match, Day expressed frustration with his recent form and said he was considering retirement. Pang Junxu, runner-up at the previous month's 2023 WST Classic, lost the first four frames against Doherty, but won the match 10–6. Anthony Hamilton defeated Oliver Lines in a deciding frame, and Elliot Slessor also won a deciding frame against Liam Highfield. Burden, Burns, Peter Lines, Pagett, and Pinches all lost their tour cards after their third-round defeats. However, Burns qualified for a new two-year tour card through the one-year ranking list, while Burden and Pagett later secured new two-year tour cards through 2023 Q School.\nFourth qualification round.\nThe fourth and final qualifying round, billed as \"Judgement Day\", featured the 32 third-round winners facing each other, with the 16 victors advancing to the main draw at the Crucible. The 2020 semi-finalist McGill lost the first three frames against Cao Yupeng but won the match 10–6 to reach the Crucible for a ninth consecutive time. Walden led Un-Nooh 4–1, but Un-Nooh recovered to lead 5–4 after the first session. The match, which featured four centuries and 10 other , went to a deciding frame, which Walden won with a 69 break, helped by a on the penultimate red. Dott lost 6–10 to Matthew Selt, the fourth consecutive year Dott had exited in the final qualifying round. Fan lost the first four frames against Maguire, but recovered to secure his Crucible debut with a 10–6 victory; Maguire's loss meant that he failed to reach the Crucible for the first time since 2003. Si and Wu Yize both reached the Crucible for the first time after Si defeated Brown 10–7 and Wu recovered from 1–5 behind to defeat Wakelin 10–8. Welsh player Jak Jones secured his Crucible debut with a 10–8 victory over Hawkins, who failed to reach the main stage for the first time since 2005. Noppon Saengkham's match against Zhang came down to a duel on the . A lax from Zhang allowed Saengkham to pot the black in a corner pocket, winning 10–9. \nDonaldson lost the first four frames against Day and then withdrew, citing health reasons. Day, whose 146 break in the opening frame was the highest of the qualifying rounds, won the match 10–0 by default. Gilbert defeated Stevens 10–7, making three centuries in the match, while Jimmy Robertson defeated Hamilton 10–2 to reach the Crucible for the first time since 2018. David Grace, who had earlier avoided relegation from the tour by winning his second-round qualifying match, beat Andrew Higginson 10–5 to secure his second Crucible appearance. Vafaei defeated Page 10–6 to reach the Crucible for a second consecutive year. Slessor defeated Zhou 10–5, also reaching the Crucible for a second time, while Pang won five of the last six frames to defeat Xu Si by the same score and become the fifth Crucible debutant. Perry recovered from 8–9 behind to defeat his friend Mark Davis on the final black in the deciding frame, after Davis had missed a pot on the pink to win the match. Davis's qualifying loss left him outside the top 64 in the world rankings at the end of the season, implying that he would lose his tour card after 32 years as a professional. Perry, who won three frames in the match on the final black ball, reached the Crucible for the first time since 2019, but stated that he felt \"physically sick\" afterwards because of Davis's presumed relegation. However, after the tournament concluded, the World Snooker Tour announced that the top 68 players on the two-year ranking list would remain on tour for the 2023–24 season, rather than the usual 64, due to some players' suspensions. This change meant that Davis, ranked 68th at the end of the season, remained on the tour.\nMain stage.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played as best-of-19-frame matches, held over two sessions, from 15 to 20 April. Ronnie O'Sullivan began his title defence by winning the first five frames against 23-year-old debutant Pang. However, Pang reduced O'Sullivan's lead to 6–3 after the first session, and came within two frames at 9–7 before O'Sullivan clinched a 10–7 victory. Stating afterwards that he had felt \"shaky, heavy and desperate\" during the match due to illness, O'Sullivan praised his opponent, calling Pang a \"phenomenal player, a joy to watch.\" The 2015 champion Stuart Bingham, who had reached only one ranking quarter-final that season, arrived at the Crucible needing to reach at least the semi-finals to retain his top-16 ranking. He trailed Gilbert 1–3 but won nine of the next ten to clinch a 10–4 victory, extending his head-to-head record against Gilbert to 12–0. Facing 19-year-old debutant Wu, the 2010 champion Neil Robertson made four centuries on his way to a 10–3 victory, including 146 breaks in both the 11th and 13th frames. This marked the first time Robertson had made a 146 break in professional competition, and the first time any player had made two 146 breaks in a professional match. Luca Brecel made his sixth Crucible appearance after five previous first-round losses. He led Walden 6–3 after the first session, and preserved his lead at 9–6 in the second session. Walden tied the scores at 9–9 to force a decider, but Brecel, who had lost deciding frames to Fu in 2017 and Gary Wilson in 2019, made an 84 break to secure his first Crucible victory. Saying that, at 9–9, he was having flashbacks to his loss against Fu, Brecel commented: \"I needed this win, because if I didn't win today maybe I would never have won a game here.\"\nThe 2023 German Masters champion Ali Carter faced Welsh debutant Jones. Carter made a 143 total clearance in frame five, but Jones won the first session 5–4, and went on to clinch the match 10–6. The first seeded player eliminated from the event, Carter called the loss \"a disappointing end to a good season\". Ding Junhui led Vafaei 5–4 after the opening session, but Vafaei made back-to-back centuries of 117 and 122 and three further half-centuries in the second session as he won his first match at the Crucible 10–6. Afterwards, Vafaei made disparaging remarks about his second-round opponent O'Sullivan that stoked a widely publicised fued between the players. Making his 25th Crucible appearance, three-time champion Mark Williams faced Jimmy Robertson, who had lost in the first round on each of his four previous Crucible appearances. Robertson led 5–4 after the first session, but Williams won all six frames played in the second session for a 10–5 victory. Four-time champion John Higgins made his 29th Crucible appearance, 25 years after winning his first world title in 1998. He led Grace 7–2 after the first session and wrapped up a 10–3 win in the second session with breaks of 114, 97, and 124. Noting that he had recently changed his technique, he commented: \"I feel as if I'm playing better stuff than ever.\"\nMark Allen, who had won ranking titles during the season at the 2022 Northern Ireland Open, the 2022 UK Championship, and the 2023 World Grand Prix, won the first five frames against debutant Fan. Although Fan won the next three with breaks including 122 and 110, Allen took the last of the session to lead 6–3. Fan and Allen resumed on table two on the evening of 17 April, as Perry and Robert Milkins began their match on table one. The sessions were disrupted by Just Stop Oil protesters, one of whom climbed on table one and spread orange powder on the cloth. Referee Olivier Marteel restrained another protester who attempted to glue herself to table two. South Yorkshire Police arrested both protesters. Tournament officials halted play on table two for 45 minutes while event staff cleaned the area, and rescheduled Perry and Milkins's first session to the following evening after table one was deemed unplayable. Despite the interruption, Allen completed a 126 break that he had started before play was suspended, and went on to defeat Fan 10–5. The cloth on table one was replaced in time for the first session between Jack Lisowski and Saengkham the following morning, which also saw tighter security measures at the venue. Lisowski took a 6–3 lead in a fast-paced session where only two frames lasted longer than 15 minutes, and moved 9–4 ahead in the second session. However, Saengkham won three consecutive frames, making a 130 clearance in frame 16, narrowing Lisowski's lead to two frames. Lisowski later said he was \"panicking a bit\" before he secured a 10–7 victory. Former semi-finalist Gary Wilson, who had won his first ranking title earlier that season at the 2022 Scottish Open, made a highest break of 131 as he took a 7–2 lead over Slessor. However, Slessor reduced Wilson's lead to 8–5 and then 9–8 in the second session, before Wilson clinched a 10–8 victory with a century break. Wilson said afterwards that Slessor's comeback had made the scoreline \"too close for comfort.\"\nThe 2019 champion and 2023 Masters winner Trump won the first two frames against McGill, but his opponent won six of the next seven to end the first session 6–3 in front. When play resumed, Trump narrowed his deficit to one at 7–6, but McGill won the last three frames for a 10–6 victory. After losing in the first round for the first time since 2017, Trump expressed frustration with his performance, saying he had \"felt very rusty\" and \"missed too many easy balls\", commenting: \"You can't expect to play like that and win the World Championship.\" Perry won the first five frames of his rescheduled tie with Milkins, and finished the session 7–2 ahead. However, when the match resumed, Milkins won seven of the first eight frames played to lead 9–8. Perry forced a decider, but Milkins secured a 10–9 victory with a 63 break, completing the biggest first-round comeback since Fu had recovered from 1–7 down to defeat Brecel in 2017. Milkins said he had tried to play more positively and aggressively in the second session, while Perry called his own performance a \"shambles\". The 2020 runner-up Kyren Wilson made a maximum break in the fifth frame of his match with Day, the fourth of his career and the 13th in Crucible history. He called the maximum \"one of the greatest achievements of my short career.\" Wilson made additional centuries of 133, 120, 108, and 102 as he defeated Day 10–5, becoming only the third player, after O'Sullivan and Allen, to make five centuries in a first-round match at the Crucible.\nFour-time champion and number two seed Mark Selby led Selt 6–3 overnight and extended his lead to 8–4. Selt won four of the next five frames, reducing Selby's lead to one at 9–8, before Selby won the match 10–8 with a 112 break. Selby said afterwards that his concentration during the match had been \"non-existent\" but commented: \"I was glad my game managed to hold up under the pressure.\" Selt's loss meant that all four of his Crucible appearances had ended in first-round defeats. The 2005 champion Shaun Murphy, who had won the season's 2023 Players Championship and 2023 Tour Championship, faced debutant and world number 80 Si, the lowest-ranked player to reach the event's main stage. Si had previously defeated Murphy 6–5 in the first round of the 2021 UK Championship while competing as an amateur, provoking Murphy to complain that amateur players should not be permitted in professional tournaments. Although Murphy took a 3–1 lead, Si won four of the next five frames to end the first session 5–4 ahead. In the second session, Si opened with a 120 break and moved one frame from victory at 9–6, but Murphy won three consecutive frames to tie the scores at 9–9. In the deciding frame, Si made a 56 break, and later snookered Murphy on the last red while leading by 23 points. Murphy failed three times to escape from the snooker, leaving Si a pot on the red after his last attempt. Si cleared to the black, closing out a 10–9 victory to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for only the fourth time. Afterwards, Murphy said Si had been \"fabulous from start to finish\", saying: \"I threw everything at him, I tried my absolute best and I still lost.\" Murphy predicted that Si would become the sport's first Chinese world champion.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played as best-of-25-frame matches, held over three sessions, from 20 to 24 April. Twelve of the sixteen seeds reached the second round, along with four qualifiers, Jones, McGill, Si, and Vafaei. Tied 4–4 with Williams after the first session, Brecel led 9–7 after the second session, and extended his lead to 11–8 in the third session. Although Williams tied the scores at 11–11, Brecel won the last two frames with breaks of 84 and 67 to clinch a 13–11 victory, having made four centuries and eight more half-centuries in the match. Williams said afterwards that Brecel was \"potting balls from everywhere and thoroughly deserved the win\". Allen led Bingham 5–3 after the first session, and won seven consecutive frames in the second session to lead 12–3. Even though Bingham took the 16th frame with a century to avoid losing with a , the third session lasted just 16 minutes as Allen wrapped up a 13–4 victory, having made 13 half-centuries in the match. During play, Allen wore a colourful bracelet with the word \"dad\", given to him by his five-year-old daughter Harleigh, which he said helped keep his mind at rest. Bingham, who dropped out of the top 16 after his defeat, promised to \"come back fighting next season.\" After his first session with Neil Robertson ended level at 4–4, Jones won six consecutive frames in the second session to move 10–6 ahead, and won three of the four frames played in the final session, ending with a 138 total clearance, to clinch a 13–7 victory. Robertson praised his opponent, calling his safety play \"incredible\".\nVafaei made further critical comments about O'Sullivan before their second-round match, but the seven-time champion cautioned Vafaei that such remarks only motivated him to perform, saying: \"Don't rattle my cage.\" The media widely described the encounter as a \"grudge match\". After O'Sullivan won the first frame with a 78 break, Vafaei smashed the pack of reds open on his , in retaliation for O'Sullivan having done the same during their 2022 German Masters qualifying match, which Vafaei had found insulting. Speaking as a pundit for the BBC, Steve Davis called the shot \"disrespectful to the game of snooker and the people who come along to watch,\" while Hendry in commentary called it \"obviously premeditated\" and \"silly\". O'Sullivan made another frame-winning 78 break from Vafaei's break-off, and went on to take a 6–2 lead, making his 200th Crucible century during the session. He won all seven frames played in the second session, finishing with back-to-back centuries, including his 1,200th century break in professional competition in the penultimate frame. In defeating Vafaei 13–2 with a session to spare, O'Sullivan equalled his largest winning margin in a best-of-25-frame match, having beaten Milkins by the same scoreline at the 2002 event. Afterwards, the players embraced and appeared to reconcile. Vafaei said that he had \"lost to the greatest ever\", while O'Sullivan said: \"There are no hard feelings from me. I love Hossein [Vafaei], he is a great guy and a brilliant player.\"\nHiggins made centuries of 136, 137, and 134 and three half-centuries as he took an 8–0 lead over Kyren Wilson, the first time Higgins had recorded a session whitewash at the Crucible since playing Lisowski at the 2018 event. He went on to win the match 13–2 with a session to spare, calling the scoreline \"an incredible result\". Wilson, who had dropped his cue between sessions while signing autographs, dislodging a weight in the butt, said that the cue was not the reason for his defeat. He called Higgins's performance \"awesome\". Although McGill moved into a 10–1 lead over Lisowski, his opponent won seven of the next eight frames, narrowing his lead to 11–8, before McGill took the last two for a 13–8 victory. Commenting on Lisowski's comeback, McGill said: \"We are in a theatre and snooker is drama. It's the best kind of drama. I love it.\" Selby, winner of the 2022 English Open and 2023 WST Classic during the season, faced Gary Wilson. After the first four frames were shared, Wilson won a 53-minute fifth frame after a prolonged tactical battle while the pink was lodged in the jaws of the green pocket behind the last two reds. Selby won three consecutive frames to finish the session 5–3 ahead, and moved 10–6 in front in the second session, before completing a 13–7 victory. Afterwards, he called it a \"tough game\" and \"scrappy\", but said he was \"happy to get through\". Si won four consecutive frames in each of the first two sessions as he took an 11–5 lead over 2023 Welsh Open winner Milkins. Si went on to win 13–7, reaching only the second ranking quarter-final of his career. Afterwards, he said he was \"so surprised\" to progress to the quarter-finals, but was \"honoured\" to have reached that stage.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25-frame matches over three sessions, on 25 and 26 April. Five seeds, Allen, Brecel, Higgins, O'Sullivan, and Selby, and three qualifiers, Jones, McGill, and Si, reached the quarter-final stage. For the first time since Tony Drago and Steve James in 1988, two Crucible debutants—Jones and Si—reached the last eight of the tournament. O'Sullivan played in the quarter-finals for a record-extending 21st time, also becoming the first player to compete in 100 matches at the Crucible.\nO'Sullivan faced Brecel, who took two of the first three frames before O'Sullivan won five in a row to end the first session 6–2 in front. In the second session, Brecel twice narrowed O'Sullivan's lead to two frames, at 6–4 and 8–6, but O'Sullivan won the last two frames of the session to maintain a four-frame advantage at 10–6. However, in a final session that lasted just 75 minutes, Brecel took all seven frames to win the match 13–10. O'Sullivan failed to win a frame in a Crucible session for the first time since losing 11–17 to Dott in the 2006 semi-finals. Afterwards, O'Sullivan called his opponent \"phenomenal, brilliant, amazing\" and said: \"I've never seen a talent like that before. No one plays like that, it's impossible.\" Brecel remarked that it was \"amazing to beat someone like Ronnie [O'Sullivan] from so far behind.\" Allen, playing in his first quarter-final since the 2018 event, made a 137 break against Jones in the third frame, and recovered from 1–3 behind to tie the scores at 4–4 after the first session. Allen moved 7–5 ahead in the second session, but Jones won three of the last four to draw level at 8–8. In the third session, Jones made a 124 break to tie the scores at 10–10, but Allen won the next two frames to lead 12–10. In the hour-long 23rd frame, Jones required two snookers. Even though Jones secured the foul points he needed, Allen won a safety battle on the brown and clinched a 13–10 victory, after which he promised to \"give it everything\" for the rest of the tournament. Jones said he had missed too many easy shots in the match, but had learned a lot from his debut.\nHiggins contested his 17th quarter-final at the event, while Selby played in his 10th. The players, who had faced each other in the 2007 and 2017 finals, both made 67 breaks in the opening frame, which was decided on a . Higgins potted the black after a lengthy safety battle, and went on to lead 4–1, but Selby won three consecutive frames to finish the session level at 4–4. The players completed just six frames in the second session, of which Selby won five to lead 9–5. In the final session, Selby won three of the first four frames to move one from victory at 12–6. Higgins made a century break in frame 19, but Selby closed out a 13–7 victory. Higgins's defeat meant he had failed to reach the semi-finals of any of the season's ranking events for the first time since the 2011–12 season. He praised Selby's tactical play, calling him \"an animal on the table\" and \"a master at the game of snooker\", but stated that he needed to play to a higher standard the following season to retain his top-16 ranking. Si, aged 20, was the event's youngest quarter-finalist since Stevens in 1998. He faced McGill, who reached his third quarter-final in four years. Si won four of the first five frames, but McGill won the last three of the session to tie the scores at 4–4. McGill moved 8–6 ahead in the second session, but Si made breaks of 80 and 86 to tie the scores again at 8–8. In the final session, McGill took an 11–9 lead, but Si won three consecutive frames to move one from victory at 12–11. Although McGill tied the scores at 12–12 with a 130 total clearance, he missed a pot while playing left-handed in the deciding frame, and Si made a 41 break. Unable to obtain the snookers he required, McGill conceded the frame to give Si a 13–12 victory. Si commented afterwards that he \"used to tremble because of nerves in deciding frames\" but had become \"mentally stronger\". McGill said: \"Overall I played badly throughout the match, my game just wasn't there.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as best-of-33-frame matches over four sessions, between 27 and 29 April. Three seeds, Allen, Brecel, and Selby, and one qualifier, Si, reached the semi-final stage. Selby played in the World Championship semi-finals for the eighth time. Allen contested his second semi-final, 14 years after his previous semi-final appearance at the 2009 event. Brecel was the first player from mainland Europe to reach a World Championship semi-final. Si played in his first semi-final at any ranking tournament; his previous best performance at a ranking event had been reaching the quarter-finals of the 2022 European Masters. The first Crucible debutant to reach the semi-finals since Hicks in 1995, Si was also the youngest semi-finalist since O'Sullivan in 1996. He became the second World Championship semi-finalist from mainland China, after Ding.\nFacing Brecel in the first semi-final, Si made consecutive breaks of 125, 102, and 97 and won the eighth frame on the black to lead 5–3 after the first session. He made a century and five half-centuries in the second session as he took an 11–5 lead. Brecel, who made just one half-century in the session, flipped the cue ball off the table with his cue while conceding the opening frame, and was told to calm down by referee Rob Spencer. Si began the third session with consecutive breaks of 90, 132, and 97 as he took a nine-frame lead at 14–5. However, Brecel responded with breaks including 108, 60, and 66 as he took the next four frames. Brecel clinched the final frame of the session after Si missed the green, reducing Si's lead to 14–10 overnight. The crowd gave the players a standing ovation after the session, which Rob Calladine in \"The Guardian\" described as \"one of the most exciting\" ever seen at the Crucible. In the final session, Brecel won the first six frames, for a total of 11 consecutive frames in the match, to lead 16–14. Even though Si won the 31st frame with a 90 break, Brecel clinched a 17–15 victory, becoming the first player to win a match at the Crucible after trailing by nine frames. The previous record for a comeback win at the Crucible had been set in the 1985 final, when Dennis Taylor recovered from eight frames behind to defeat Steve Davis. Brecel, whose girlfriend Laura Vanoverberghe was issued an expedited passport so she could travel from Belgium for the final session, stated that he was \"shaking so much\" in the final frame, adding that \"to win means so much in such a tough game and in such a big tournament.\" Si, who advanced from 80th to 36th in the world rankings after his performance in the tournament, said of the final session that: \"I really wanted to win and I felt really nervous and couldn't really get going.\"\nFacing Allen in the other semi-final, Selby made a 123 break in the opening frame, and moved 3–2 ahead. However, he scored just one point in the remainder of the session as Allen won three consecutive frames with half-century breaks to lead 5–3. Allen won the opening frame of the second session, but Selby won the next four to lead 7–6. Only five of the eight scheduled frames were played, as the session ran long, featuring three frames lasting longer than 40 minutes, and there were two . The eight frames in the third session were shared, leaving Selby one frame ahead at 11–10. In the final session, Selby took five consecutive frames to move one from victory at 16–10, but Allen also won five consecutive frames, reducing Selby's lead to 16–15. However, Selby made breaks of 64 and 28 in the 32nd frame to clinch a 17–15 victory. The match ended at 00:46 BST on 30 April 2023. Of the final frame, Selby said that Allen had the momentum after winning five frames in a row, but he \"managed to hold [himself] together\" to make a frame-winning break. Allen said he had \"underperformed\" in the match and was \"disappointed\", but commented that he \"never gave up\".\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-35-frames match, held over four sessions on 30 April and 1 May, between Brecel and Selby. Brecel competed in his first World Championship final, while Selby contested his sixth, having won four and lost one previously. Brendan Moore, who had officiated the 2014 and 2018 finals, took charge of his third world final, his last match before retiring as a snooker referee. Brecel won five of the first six frames for a 5–1 lead, and finished the first session 6–2 ahead. Selby began the second session with a 134 break, the first century of the final, but Brecel responded with a 99 clearance in frame 10. Selby made a 96 break in frame 11, and also won frame 12, reducing Brecel's lead to 7–5 at the mid-session interval. Brecel won two of the next three frames to lead 9–6. In the 16th frame, Selby made a maximum break, the fifth of his career, the 14th in Crucible history, and the first time a player had achieved a maximum in a World Championship final. It was the second time, after the 2008 event, that two maximums had occurred at the main stage of the tournament. Kyren Wilson and Selby were the ninth and tenth players respectively to make maximum breaks at the Crucible, following Thorburn, Jimmy White, Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Williams, Carter, John Higgins, and Neil Robertson. Selby later called the maximum an \"amazing achievement\" and \"something I will remember for the rest of my life.\" Selby won the last frame of the session, reducing Brecel's lead to 9–8 overnight.\nIn the third session, Brecel won six of the eight frames played, four of them with century breaks of 113, 101, 141, and 119, to lead 15–10. Brecel began the final session with a 67 break, extending his lead to six frames, but Selby then won five consecutive frames, making a 122 century in frame 29 and recording a cumulative 315 points without reply as he reduced Brecel's lead to 16–15. After Selby missed a black in the 32nd frame, Brecel potted his first ball in 54 minutes and went on to make a 51 break. Selby had another chance to win the frame and tie the scores when he fluked a red, but Brecel moved 17–15 ahead after Selby missed the brown. A safety error from Selby in the 33rd frame allowed Brecel to make a 112 century, win the match 18–15, and secure his first world title and fourth ranking title. He became the first world champion from mainland Europe and the fourth world champion in the sport's modern era from outside the United Kingdom, following Canada's Cliff Thorburn in 1980, Ireland's Ken Doherty in 1997, and Australia's Neil Robertson in 2010. Afterwards, Brecel called Selby \"such a fighter\" and said he did not expect to win at 16–15 because he was \"missing balls by a mile\" after losing five frames in a row. He called his first world title \"a dream come true\" and \"the best moment of my life.\" Selby said he \"battled\" in the final and \"gave everything\", but congratulated Brecel on his victory, calling him a \"great talent\". Ending the season at a career high of second in the world rankings, Brecel predicted that snooker would \"explode\" in mainland Europe after his success. Of Brecel's playing style, Steve Davis commented that: \"It's great to see somebody play swashbuckling snooker but with balance as well and push the game to even more new limits than we thought possible.\"\nMain draw.\nThe numbers in brackets after the players' names show their seedings.\nQualifying draw.\nThe results from qualifying are shown below.

        "title": "2022 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon.\nQualification.\nParticipation in the Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. As such, all participants in the 2022 race were foaled in 2019, and most originated from the 2019 North American crop of 20,433 foals. This was the smallest North American foal crop since 1966, in which 20,228 Thoroughbreds were foaled. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is also open to European and Japanese Thoroughbreds, but foreign participation is rare. The field is limited to the top 20 horses on the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby leaderboard; these points are distributed to the top-four finishers in designated races. The Road to the Kentucky Derby system was introduced in 2013; previously, qualification was tied to a horse's earnings in previous graded stakes races, which were affected by variables such as the presence of casinos at a particular race track.\nIn 2022, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby consisted of 36 races in North America plus one in Dubai, taking place between September 18, 2021, and April 16, 2022. It featured the addition of one race from previous years: the newly created Gun Runner Stakes, which took place at Fair Grounds Race Course on December 26. Additionally, no horse trained by Bob Baffert was eligible for points in any qualification race; if a Baffert-trained horse were to finish in the top four of a qualifying race, no points would be awarded for that position. This rule was put into place as part of a larger series of sanctions against Baffert, whose 2021 Kentucky Derby runner Medina Spirit finished first but was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for betamethasone. In response to this ban and Baffert's subsequent suspension, owners of several Baffert-trained Derby contenders transferred them to trainers Tim Yakteen and Rodolphe Brisset. Two of these horses, Taiba and Messier, eventually started in the Derby after earning qualifying points after the transfer.\nThe eight major prep races for Derby qualification are, in chronological order, the UAE Derby, Louisiana Derby, Florida Derby, Arkansas Derby, Jeff Ruby Steaks, Wood Memorial Stakes, Blue Grass Stakes, and Santa Anita Derby. All of these races provide 100 points to their first-place finisher. The major preps began on March 26, when Epicenter won the Louisiana Derby and Crown Pride, a Japanese horse who entered with 16–1 odds, won the UAE Derby. The next three major races were held on April 2, with White Abarrio, Cyberknife, and Tiz the Bomb winning the Florida Derby, Arkansas Derby, and Jeff Ruby Steaks, respectively. On April 9, the final day of major preps, Mo Donegal won the Wood Memorial, Zandon the Blue Grass, and Taiba the Santa Anita Derby. While a Derby invitation is extended to the winner of the European and the Japan Road to the Derby, none of the top finishers from either circuit were nominated for the Triple Crown, and the offers were not accepted. The one Japanese horse who participated in the Derby, Crown Pride, did so by qualifying on the main Road.\nField.\nThe field for the 2022 Kentucky Derby was considered to be one of the most competitive in recent memory, with no clear favorite in the weeks leading up to the race. The morning line front runners were Zandon and Epicenter, with 3–1 and 7–2 odds respectively. Zandon, the Blue Grass Stakes winner, had a 2–1–1 record (two wins, a second and a third-place finish) in four career starts and finished second in the Road to the Kentucky Derby with 114 points. Epicenter, meanwhile, was 4–1–0 in six lifetime starts with wins in the Risen Star Stakes and Louisiana Derby. He led the Road to the Derby with 164 points. Prior to the race, Epicenter drew post 3, an historically difficult starting post due to its close proximity to the rail. The last Kentucky Derby winner to break from the third post was Real Quiet in 1998. Zandon, breaking from the 10th post of 20, was also figured to run into traffic from his competitors as he had a late-running style.\nAlso considered strong contenders for the Derby were Messier, Taiba, and White Abarrio. Messier, originally trained by Baffert, was transferred to Yakteen in order to qualify for the Triple Crown. He was 14th in qualification with 40 points and entered the race with a 3–3–0 record in six starts, including a second-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby. Taiba, the winner of the Santa Anita Derby, had also been transferred from Baffert to Yakteen and was undefeated in two starts. His 100 points were eighth among Kentucky Derby qualifiers. White Abarrio was trained by Saffie Joseph Jr., while his 112 points were third among all Derby contenders. White Abarrio had a 4–0–1 record in five lifetime starts, including a first-place finish in the Florida Derby. Messier drew the sixth post before the race, with Taiba drawing twelfth and White Abarrio fifteenth.\nIf any of the 20 Derby entries is withdrawn from the race before betting begins, the next-highest ranked horse on the leaderboard draws into their place. On the day before the race, Ethereal Road, who was set to race from the 20th post, was scratched from the Derby. Rich Strike drew into the Derby as a result of the scratch. He had a record of 1–0–3 in seven lifetime starts and earned his qualifying points by finishing in third place at the Jeff Ruby Steaks. His only win came in a maiden claiming race on September 17, 2021.\nRace description.\nThe Kentucky Derby takes place annually at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May, where it began in 1875. Participating horses run a distance of , or 10 furlongs. The Derby is a Grade I event with a purse of $3,000,000 in 2022. Predicted rain and thunderstorms in Louisville, Kentucky suggested that the Derby could be raced in muddy or sloppy conditions. Only three horses in the Derby had previously raced on an \"off\" track, and such precipitation had the chance to alter the race dynamics. However, the rain held off. By the time horses reached the post, the weather at Churchill Downs was with cloudy skies and winds. The track condition was listed as fast.\nThe listed attendance for the 2022 Kentucky Derby was 147,294. This was an increase over the previous year, when ticket sales were restricted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but below the expected crowd of 170,000. Coverage of the Derby was broadcast on USA Network from noon to 2:30 p.m. (ET) and then moved to NBC until 7:30 p.m. (ET). The race was also broadcast online through Peacock, NBCSports.com, and the NBC Sports app.\nSummer is Tomorrow took an early lead out of the gates, setting a Derby record by running the first quarter-mile in 21.78 seconds. Crown Pride kept apace with Summer is Tomorrow through the first half-mile, run in 45.36 seconds, with Messier following close behind. Messier took the lead at the -mile mark but was soon overtaken by Epicenter at the head of the stretch. Meanwhile, Rich Strike, who had been well back early, was still in fifteenth place after the first mile and in heavy traffic. Rich Strike moved to the rail, weaved around a tiring Messier and closed steadily in the final furlong to win the race with a time of 2:02.61. Epicenter finished in second place, of a length behind. Another of a length behind him was Zandon, with Simplification finishing a further two lengths back in fourth. Messier finished the race in fifteenth while Summer is Tomorrow finished last among all 20 participants.\nGoing off at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike recorded the second-highest upset in Derby history behind Donerail, who won the 1913 race with 91–1 odds. He was also the second horse in Derby history to win the race from the 20th post, following Big Brown in 2008. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win of any kind for jockey Sonny Leon.\nResults.\nTrack: Fast\nTimes: mile – 21.78; mile – 45.36; mile – 1:10.34; mile – 1:36.96; final – 2:02.61\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23:58) (24:98) (26:62) (25:65)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayouts.\nThe table below provides the Kentucky Derby payout schedule.\nAftermath.\nOn May 12, Rich Strike's owner Rick Dawson announced that the horse would not participate in the 2022 Preakness Stakes. Dawson and Reed told reporters that the decision was made to give Rich Strike time to recover from his \"tremendous effort\" in the Derby. His next start would instead be the 2022 Belmont Stakes, giving the horse five weeks between major races instead of two. It was the first time that a healthy Derby winner did not race in the Preakness since Spend a Buck in 1985. Instead, Early Voting won the Preakness, while Epicenter became the first horse since 2012's Bodemeister to finish second in both races."

Hooker Tom Stewart was leading try scorer with 17, and won the URC Top Try Scorer and Next-Gen Player of the Season awards.\nEvents.\nPersonnel changes.\nUlster appointed a new defence coach, Jonny Bell, returning to his home province from a spell at Worcester Warriors, in place of the departing Jared Payne.\nNew signings include Irish-qualified flanker Sean Reffell, from Saracens, lock Frank Bradshaw Ryan from French club Nevers, out-half Jake Flannery from Munster, former All-Black tighthead prop Jeffery Toomaga-Allen from Wasps, and fullback Shea O'Brien from City of Armagh RFC, on a development contract. Hooker Declan Moore, who was signed as temporary injury cover from Munster last season, made his move to Ulster permanent. Academy centre Jude Postlethwaite signed a development contract, to be upgraded to a full senior contract after a year.\nAfter the collapse of Worcester Warriors, Scotland and Lions international loosehead prop Rory Sutherland joined until the end of the season.\nHooker Bradley Roberts, now a Wales international, left for the Dragons, prop Ross Kane and lock David O'Connor left for Ealing Trailfinders, and lock Mick Kearney, prop Jack McGrath and flanker Sean Reidy were released.\nFive new players joined the Academy: last season's Ulster Schools Player of the Year, Campbell College lock Joe Hopes; QUB flanker Lorcan McLaughlin; Cambridge House Grammar flanker James McNabney; Coleraine Grammar fullback Rory Telfer; and Wallace High School prop Scott Wilson.\nSummer internationals.\nSeven Ulster players were selected for Ireland's tour to New Zealand: hooker Rob Herring, prop Tom O'Toole, locks Iain Henderson and Kieran Treadwell, flanker Nick Timoney, centres Stuart McCloskey and James Hume, and fullback Michael Lowry. Treadwell, Herring and O'Toole made test appearances. Hume, Timoney, Lowry and McCloskey appeared in non-test matches against the Māori All Blacks. Henderson injured his knee before the opening match, and Hume injured his groin in the opening match against the Māori All Blacks.\nJames McCormick, Adam McNamee, Reuben Crothers, Josh Hanlon, Charlie Irvine, Lorcan McLaughlin, James McNabney, Reece Malone, Scott Wilson \nand Joseph Mawhinney all appeared for Ireland U20s in the summer.\nPre-season.\nUlster's pre-season campaign opened on 2 September with a home friendly against Exeter Chiefs, which they won 31-12. Jacob Stockdale scored a try on his return from injury, and new scrum-half Michael McDonald was named man of the match.\nA second friendly, away to Glasgow Warriors, arranged for 9 September, was cancelled following the death of Queen Elizabeth II the day before.\nEmerging Ireland tour.\nTen Ulster players were selected for the Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa for the Toyota Challenge at the end of September: wings Robert Baloucoune and Ethan McIlroy; centre Stewart Moore; out-half Jake Flannery; scrum-halves Nathan Doak and Michael McDonald; loosehead prop Callum Reid; hooker Tom Stewart; lock Cormac Izuchukwu; and flanker David McCann.\nFirst block.\nThe team opened the season with a 36-10 home victory over Connacht in the URC. Hooker Tom Stewart made his first senior start, scored a try and was named Player of the Match. After a high-scoring away win against Scarlets, in which John Cooney scored 30 points, Ulster lost at home to Leinster in heavy rain. There followed a 47-17 win over Ospreys, in which Luke Marshall and Sam Carter scored two tries each. Ulster then became the first northern hemisphere team to win in South Africa this season, beating the Lions in Johannesburg. Their next match, against the Sharks in Durban, was postponed after an outbreak of E. coli and norovirus meant they were unable to field a team. Ulster narrowly beat Munster away, with Rory Sutherland making his debut and John Andrew making his 100th appearance for the province, both off the bench, and went into the international break second in the URC table.\nAutumn international break.\nEight Ulster players were called up to the Ireland squad for the 2022 end-of-year internationals: Robert Baloucoune, Rob Herring, Michael Lowry, Stuart McCloskey, Tom O'Toole, Jacob Stockdale, Nick Timoney and Kieran Treadwell. Two more, James Hume and Marty Moore, were selected for the panel for Ireland 'A' to play a New Zealand XV.\nSecond block.\nAfter the international break, Ulster had a comfortable home win over Zebre Parma, with Tom Stewart scoring two tries. They then travelled to Leinster, and led the league leaders at half time, before Leinster fought back to win the game 38-29. This began a three-game losing streak, as Ulster lost their opening two games in the Champions Cup. After poor weather caused travel disruption, they capitulated 39-0 away to Sale Sharks. A frozen pitch at Ravenhill meant Ulster's home game against reigning champions La Rochelle had to be relocated to Dublin's Aviva Stadium at the last minute, with the match played behind closed doors. La Rochelle built a 29-0 half-time lead, but Ulster improved enough in the second half to earn two bonus points in a 29-36 defeat. Returning to the URC, Ulster halted their losing streak with a close away win against Connacht, featuring another two-try display from Tom Stewart. After last-minute defeats to Munster (during which flanker Sean Reffell made a URC record 42 tackles, and tighthead prop Marty Moore's season was ended by an anterior cruciate ligament injury) and Benetton in the URC and La Rochelle in the Champions Cup, Ulster secured qualification for the last 16 of the Champions Cup with a home win over Sale. They reached the Six Nations break with a bonus point home win against the Stormers, sitting at third in the URC table and second in the Irish shield.\nAcademy lock Harry Sheridan made his senior debut in the away defeat to La Rochelle.\nSix Nations international break.\nFive Ulster players were called up to the initial Ireland squad for the 2023 Six Nations Championship: Iain Henderson, Rob Herring, Tom O'Toole, Stuart McCloskey and Jacob Stockdale.

This left Ulster in third.\nCentre Jude Postlethwaite made his senior debut in the away win against Cardiff.\nThird block.\nUlster finished the URC regular season with three home games. In the first of these three, they defeated the Bulls, with Tom Stewart scoring a hat-trick. This result made them the first European team in the URC to beat all four South African sides in the same season. The following week they went out of the Champions Cup in the round of 16, losing 30-15 to Leinster at the Aviva Stadium. Back in the URC, they moved into second with a bonus point win against the Dragons 40-21, with Tom Stewart scoring another hat-trick. The following week they secured second place with a home win over Edinburgh, earning a home quarter-final against Connacht, which they lost 10-15. Wing Jacob Stockdale made his 100th appearance for the province, and hooker Rob Herring equalled the all-time appearance record with 229, alongside Andrew Trimble and Darren Cave.\nURC awards.\nTom Stewart was the URC's Top Try Scorer with 16, a record for the competition - beating the 14 scored by Edinburgh's Tim Visser in 2010-11 and the Cheetahs' Rabz Maxwane in 2018-19, and the Next-Gen Player of the Season award for players under 23 who have fewer than five international caps.\nUlster Rugby Awards.\nThe 2023 Ulster Rugby Awards were announced online on 1 June.

As with the bank, it succeeds Midland Bank and therefore Midland Bank Rowing Club, which was founded in 1878.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe club's forebear was founded by 1900 as London City &amp; Midland Bank rowing club as the name of the bank had not simplified. In June 1901, those racing the already \"annual event\" that faced the London Joint Stock Bank and the Union Bank, side-by-side, were G. Webb, E.A. Briscombe, R. H. Baker, J. C. McTurk, F. H. Ward, C. A. S. Locking, T. G. Burt, A. Bugler and B. J. Buckhurst (cox). The bank's most senior official there was Colonol Pollock also of Leander Rowing Club. The race was watched by \"a full complement\" of passengers of the \"Queen Elizabeth\" sailing from London Bridge to watch the Hammersmith-to-Putney race. This bank's club won the \"very handsome\" prizes and the evening was serenaded by the Tudor Orchestra.\nThe premises, known as HSBC clubhouse or boathouse interchangeably, is that of Barclays Bank Boat House, which was that of the (defunct) Barclays Bank rowing club. It has a few later additions and alterations. Its façade is white paint/unpainted woodwork and brickwork that has black boathouse doors – it has a flag but unusually has no major signs or brand-linked paintwork.\nThe bank was taken over by HSBC in 1992 and the old name, in rowing, was phased out by 1999.\n20th century overview.\nAn ARA reply of 1903 was, also approved and affirmed, addressed to The London City and Midland Bank Rowing Club's honorary secretary. The club became ARA-affiliated in June of that year.\nIn the summer of 1925 the Midland Bank eight \"crew\" had an \"unbeaten record\" – though perhaps this refers to the Tideway, or the summer versus Oxford and Cambridge events, only.\n20th century social scene.\nIn 1935 the annual club dinner was held at The Windsor Castle, Victoria (Westminster) with performers: Bertha Willmott, Elisse Remah, Frank Hagley and Fred Hugh. Willmott also starred in the 1932 dinner performances."

        "title": "Romania national bobsleigh team",
        "text": "The Romanian national bobsleigh team represents Romania in international bobsledding competitions.\nThe team made its debut with the five-man bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz.\nAt the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble the Romanian selection won a historic bronze medal with the two-man bobsleigh team led by Ion Panțuru and Nicolae Neagoe, which is the only medal won by Romania at the Winter Olympics. At the same Olympics, Romania was also close to a bronze medal in the four-man competition, placing fourth.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe practice of bobsleigh in Romania dates back to around 1909, when sporting activity was limited to a few days a year, around the winter holidays; from 1910 \"winter sports competitions\" were organised, with modest participation. Until 1916, bobsleigh races were regularly held in Sinaia, along with sledging and skeleton races, but without precise rules. The first winner of a bobsleigh race in 1910 was N. Filiti, and the first winner of a multi-team race was a generic \"Romanian Sports Club\" (Cercul Sportiv Român). In 1911, the presence of women in bobsleighing was very active: competitions were organised in three events (two-woman bobsleigh, two-man bobsleigh and team competition of 2-5-6 persons), whose winners included Natalia Darvari (women), Jean Costinescu (men) and the mixed crew of the \"Societatea Săniutza\". In 1912, the competition programme was the same: in the women's category Mihaela Ghyka won, and in the men's category a (male) crew led by Mihaela Ghyka herself won.\nIn 1912, the Federation of Romanian Sports Societies (Federației Societăților de Sport din România - FSSR) was founded, within which a Winter Sports Commission was established, with the task of coordinating and promoting the practice of bobsleigh. In 1914, for the first time, a national inter-school bobsleigh competition was organised, which was won by the \"Gh. Lazăr\" High School in Bucharest. Also in 1914, a team of German tourists participated in the \"National bobsleigh competition\", coming third, while the competition was won by the team from the Evangelical School of Bucharest.\nAfter World War I, bobbing activity was resumed from 1920, in localities such as Brașov, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Slatina, and Iași. Bobsledding was generally practised along mountain roads and on the ski slopes of Postăvaru and Poiana Brașov. In 1922, the first national winter sports championships were held: the bobsled championship was held in Sinaia, with the title in the \"club teams\" event going to the Râmnicu Vâlcea Centre, whose driver was Iorgu Arsenie. The rise of the bobsleigh began in 1923, when several competitions with prizes were held: the title of national champion went to the team of the Club \"Colțea\" from Bucharest. In 1924, the crew of the \"Societatea Politehnica București\" won.\nInternational activity.\nThe organisation of the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix (France) aroused the interest of Romanian bobbists, but the lack of state funds to support participation in the Olympics was widely discussed in the press at the time. Iorgu Arsenie built a bobsleigh christened Avalanșa (avalanche) and together with Tita Rădulescu reached Chamonix, where they participated in the races with a borrowed bobsleigh (Bachmann type) and won three cups; however, they were unable to participate in the Olympic competition because the rules required the entire crew to be from the same country, a condition they were unable to meet. Iorgu Arsenie, as a representative of the Commission for the Constitution of the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) in Chamonix in 1924, obtained Romania's affiliation to this international sporting body.\nIn 1925, the first bobsled track was built in Sinaia according to the design of engineer Sângiorzan, on a western slope of the Furnica hill, with a length of 2,100 m and ten curves. The first bobsleighs were made of wood with an iron bottom, were guided by ropes or a steering wheel and had 2, 4, 5 or 6 seats. At the national bobsleigh championship in 1927 in Sinaia, the student crew of brothers Grigore and Mircea Socolescu and major Mihai Mihail from Slatina distinguished themselves; on this occasion, a cup for \"the most daring and skilful bobsleigh\" was awarded to 21-year-old Alexandru Papană, who would dominate the bobsleigh races in the following years. The recognition of his skill was confirmed in 1928, when, together with Dumitru Hubert, they won the title of national champions in the two-man race. The \"Aeronautica\" club (to which the two competitors belonged) had two crews: Alexandru Papană (driver), Alexandru Ionescu, Tiberiu Stătescu, Puffi Popescu, Gheorghe Moțoi (brakeman). From these, the bobsledders who would bring fame to Romanian sport would be selected later.\nPerformances in 1926-1928 stimulated interest and led to the presence of the Romanian five-man bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, although the expenses were borne by the athletes from their own savings. The Romanian crew finished in a commendable 7th place, 4.3 seconds behind the champions.\nThe first famous Romanian bobber was Alexandru Papană, national bobsleigh champion in 1928 and 1931 and winner of the FIBT World Championships 1933 in Schreiberhau, Germany (now Szklarska Poręba, Poland), along with Dumitru Hubert. The Romanian crew used ropes instead of a steering wheel and made a \"flying start\" (one of the first at the time), for which they had patented a special push handle on the bobsleigh.\nThe FIBT World Championships 1934 saw the domination of Romania, who won the gold medal in the four-man bobsleigh and gold and bronze medals in the two-man bobsleigh. In November 1934, the Romanian Bobsleigh Federation was formed, however, despite the organisational development, the series of successes was interrupted: the participation in the FIBT World Championships 1935 in St. Moritz (Switzerland), with a 2-man bobsleigh crew, piloted by Papană and two 4-person bobsleigh crews, piloted by Papană and Frim, ended in failure.\nIn 1951, a 1,640-1,530 m long bobsleigh track was built in Poiana Brașov for the organisation of the World University Games.\nThe first Olympic medal.\nFrom 1966, Romanian bobsleigh made a comeback on the international scene, thanks to Ion Panțuru. At the FIBT World Championships 1966, Ion Panțuru and Nicolae Neagoe came 5th in the two-man bobsleigh race, and at the European Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen the same team came 6th. In 1967, at the European Championships in Igls (Austria), the four-man bobsleigh team (Ion Panțuru, Gheorghe Maftei, Petre Hristovici, and Nicolae Neagoe) won the gold medal and the title of European champion. In the two-man bobsleigh, the Panțuru-Neagoe pair came second.\nAt the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, the Romanian selection won a historic bronze medal with the two-man bobsleigh led by Ion Panțuru and Nicolae Neagoe, which is the only Olympic medal won in the history of Romania at the Winter Olympics so far. In the same edition, the Romanian four-man bobsleigh finished fourth, touching the bronze medal by just one hundredth of a second. In the 1969 European bobsleigh championships, the Romanian four-man bobsleigh team finished fourth.\nAt the 1969 European Bobsleigh Championships held on the Blue Lake bobsleigh track in Cervinia the crew Panțuru-Focșeneanu won the silver medal as well as in the four-man bobsleigh with Ion Panţuru, Raimond Țancov, Dumitru Focșeneanu and Nicolae Neagoe. The crew of Ion Panțuru and Dumitru Focșeneanu won silver and bronze medals at the FIBT World Championships 1969 and the FIBT World Championships 1973, both held in Lake Placid.\nAfter 1970, a modern concrete track was built in Sinaia, which entered the circuit of international competitions, organizing the annual \"Carpathian Trophy\" (\"Trofeul Carpați\").\nAt the 1970 European Championships in Cortina, the Romanian four-man bobsled won the bronze medal, while in Igls 1971 they won the title of European champions.\nRomania was designated as the host venue for the 1977 European Bobsleigh Championships, however warm weather melted the snow on the course, preventing the competition from taking place.\nAt the IBSF World Championships 2017 in Schönau am Königssee, bobsledders Maria Adela Constantin and Andreea Grecu rode the two-woman bobsleigh in the team competition, winning the bronze medal with the international team also consisting of three other German athletes."

Although they had neither the equipment nor a coach, they were determined to make their \"Olympic dream\" come true.\nThe four members of the San Marino team, three of whom were already over 40 years old at the time, started bobsleighing in 1991. In January 1994 they managed to qualify for the Olympic Games in Lillehammer, in an unusual way: during the trials in Lake Placid, they had to rent a bobsleigh after leaving theirs in Europe. After three days of slow runs, they discovered three loose bolts on one of the skates, and during one trial the San Marino team's bobsled suffered a serious accident, so much so that the track judges thought Dino Crescentini had died, as his helmet had been ripped off and was in the middle of the track. When the sled was repaired, they finished third in one race and fourth in another, thus earning enough points for a place in the Olympics.\nThe team of San Marino, composed of flag bearer Dino Crescentini and Mike Crocenzi, as well as Jean Pierre Renzi as reserve, ranked 41st place among the 43 teams participating in the two-man event at the XVII Winter Olympic Games, ahead of the second team of the US Virgin Islands, while the Jamaica national bobsleigh team failed to complete the competition.\nThe original San Marino's bobsleigh used in the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games is now on display in the Museum of Sport and Olympism located inside the San Marino Stadium in Serravalle."

        "title": "The Golf War",
        "text": "\"The Golf War\" is the third episode of the second season of the American animated television series \"Gravity Falls\", which was created by Alex Hirsch, and the 23rd episode overall. It was written by Jeff Rowe and Hirsch, and was directed by Matt Braly. The episode features Mabel Pines challenge her arch-rival Pacifica Northwest to a mini golf match, with Mabel hiring small golf ball-headed beings called Lilliputtians to foil Pacifica's game.\nThe episode premiered on Disney XD on August 11, 2014, and garnered 1.27 million viewers when it premiered.\nPlot.\nWhile Dipper watches television at the Mystery Shack, Mabel runs in with a newspaper, excited that she is soon to be in the local newspaper for fashion design. However, Grunkle Stan notices that Mabel's arch-rival, Pacifica Northwest, is instead the front cover. Mabel is saddened by the newspaper. Meanwhile, Soos tries to create a new fashion trend, by creating \"W-neck\" t-shirts.\nWhile downing shots of orange juice, Mabel hears a television advert promoting a mini golf place. Dipper, knowing that Mabel is an expert at mini golf, offers to take Mabel there to cheer her up. The crew agrees, and heads to the mini golf palace.\nDipper is shown to be terrible at mini-golf, while Mabel shows her extraordinary skill at the game. At the last hole, she tries to hit a hole-in-one to beat her all-time record, but fails to do so. Shortly after, the gang spot Pacifica and her parents at the golf course, with Pacifica openly mocking them. After some arguing, Mabel eventually challenges Pacifica to a match. However, the owner of the course announces that the course has closed. As a compromise, Pacifica then offers that Mabel head down to the course at midnight. She accepts the offer.\nAt a restaurant, Mabel is demotivated at the fear of losing; however, Dipper convinces her otherwise. The crew arrive at the course, with Grunkle Stan giving Mabel a sticker that says \"You Da Best\" with a trophy on it. While Mabel is practicing, Dipper notices a strange sound coming from a windmill on the hole after Mabel fails to hit a single shot. Dipper breaks it open, and finds out that inside, there are small golf ball-headed beings known as \"Lilliputtians\" that control the entire golf course. After figuring out that the Lilliputtians also hate Pacifica, different factions argue that their respective hole is the best. After some fighting, the Lilliputtians decide to let Mabel choose who is the best hole, with the reward being her sticker, capturing the attention of the Lilliputtians. Dipper convinces Mabel to force the Lilliputtians to sabotage Pacifica's game, and let whoever sabotaged her the best be the best hole.\nPacifica eventually arrives, with her being pressured to win at all costs from her parents. Pacifica's referee, Sergei, announces an 18-hole match. With the help of the Lilliputtians, Pacifica is shown to have absolutely terrible results, with Mabel cruising to an easy victory. Mabel claims the miner hole as the best faction, to the dismay of the Dutch hole. The Dutch hole decide to kidnap Pacifica, and tie her to the final hole to kill her. Mabel and Dipper think their plan is going too far. The other factions start to fight once again. Mabel, fueled with anger, decides that no one gets her sticker for fighting. Mabel calls rivalries dumb, to the surprise of Pacifica. The Lilliputtians eventually decide to work together to then attempt to kill Mabel. Mabel chases to rescue Pacifica, and eventually rescues her. The two fight off the Lilliputtians, and Pacifica starts to like Mabel. Dipper and the two drive away on a golf cart successfully to Grunkle Stan's car. Once outside, Mabel apologizes for cheating, and gives Pacifica a sticker, to which she accepts. While initially refusing to ride in Stan's car, Pacifica gets in after rain starts to fall. Pacifica is disgusted by the car's condition. Mabel pulls out two tacos, and Pacifica eventually accepts one. The two become friends, and the gang drop her off.\nProduction.\nThe episode was written by \"Gravity Falls\" creator Alex Hirsch and Jeff Rowe. In addition, the episode was directed by Matt Braly,\nCritical reception.\nAlasdair Wilkins of \"The A.V. Club\" awarded the episode a \"B\", saying that while the episode represented \"Gravity Falls\" at its \"absolute weirdness\", the episode did not have the tone to keep up the \"weirdness\"."

        "title": "2022–23 UConn Huskies women's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2022–23 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut (UConn) during the 2022–23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Huskies, led by Hall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma in his 38th season at UConn, split their home games between Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on their campus in Storrs and the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. UConn is a member of the Big East Conference, which it joined in the 2020–21 season; it had been a member of the original Big East Conference from 1979 through 2013, and one of the original women's basketball teams in that conference in 1982.\nThe Huskies finished an injury-plagued previous season with a record of 30–6, losing the championship game of the 2022 NCAA women's basketball tournament to South Carolina. Three graduates from that squad were selected in the 2022 WNBA draft, but with six returning starters including the backcourt of Paige Bueckers, Azzi Fudd, and Nika Mühl, with forwards Dorka Juhász, Aaliyah Edwards, and Caroline Ducharme, UConn was expected to win the much improved Big East again. Bueckers tore an ACL in a pickup game before fall workouts, and five-star recruit Ice Brady suffered a tendon dislocation during an early practice; both players underwent season ending surgeries and sat on the bench all season.\nStarting the season already down two players, UConn played surprisingly well against early opponents, with strong wins against #3 Texas, #10 NC State, and #9 Iowa in the first weeks. In the Texas game, Juhász injured a thumb and was sidelined for several weeks. Aubrey Griffin, who had redshirted the previous season because of injury, and Lou Lopez Sénéchal, a graduate transfer shooting guard from Fairfield University, got some starts and immediately impacted the team with their durability and shooting proficiency. Fudd began the season as a leading scorer, with Mühl leading the country in assists per game, and Edwards seemingly unstoppable in the paint. Fudd was injured in the loss to #7 Notre Dame, and by the end of December the Huskies only had seven players healthy, even after Juhász's return. On January 8, UConn's contest against DePaul was postponed because the Huskies only had six players able to play.\nEven with a short bench, the Huskies continued to win January, dominating most conference opponents and picking up another quality win at Tennessee, the only team to score more than 60 points against the fierce UConn team defense in January. In early February the team matched up against the #1 ranked South Carolina Gamecocks with a sold-out home crowd in the XL Center, but lost 77–81. Three days later, Marquette upset the noticeably worn-out Huskies in a tight defensive battle, UConn's first consecutive loss in 30 years. While UConn was able to twice defeat rival Villanova, several Big East teams strongly tested the still-shorthanded and battered Huskies, St. John's outscoring them by five. UConn finished their regular season with an overall record of 26–5 and a conference record of 18–2. They won the Big East regular season championship and were the top seed in the conference tournament. Azzi Fudd and Caroline Ducharme, who both missed a significant part of the regular season due to injury, returned in time for the Big East tournament, and with the UConn squad healthy for the first time since its first games, the Huskies methodically notched three consecutive wins to emerge as tournament champions, getting the automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball tournament. In the NCAA tournament, UConn advanced to their 29th consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Vermont and Baylor. However, they lost to Ohio St. in the next round, ending their Final Four streak at 14. The Huskies finished their season with a 31–6 record.\nWith most of their roster either injured or in-development during the season, the Huskies relied heavily on several players for the first time. Mühl, the team's new point guard, set a UConn single-season record with 284 assists. Edwards was the team's leading scorer and a third team All-American. Lopez Sénéchal and Juhász, who had both transferred from other schools in the previous two years, put up solid numbers, as did Griffin, who had missed the previous season.\nPrevious season.\nUConn was ranked no. 2 in both the 2021 AP and Coaches pre-season polls. After some early struggles, they finished the regular season with a record of 22–5, including 16–1 in the Big East to win the conference regular season championship. UConn then won the Big East tournament. As a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, they advanced to the championship game, where they lost to South Carolina. UConn finished their campaign with a record of 30–6.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nThe Huskies graduated senior starters Christyn Williams, Olivia Nelson-Ododa, and Evina Westbrook from the 2021–22 roster, each of them being drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association. Sophomore Piath Gabriel chose to enter the transfer portal during the offseason and accepted a scholarship at UMass.\nIncoming transfers.\nThe Huskies added Lou Lopez Sénéchal, a graduate student from Grenoble, France, who transferred from Fairfield University. While at Fairfield, Lopez Sénéchal was the 2021–22 MAAC Player of the Year and was three-time All-MAAC First Team. She had one year of eligibility remaining.\nInjuries.\nUConn lost two players to knee injuries during the 2022 offseason. On August 1, superstar guard Paige Bueckers tore her left ACL during a pick-up game, and UConn announced two days later that she would miss the entire 2022–23 season. Then, during a Huskies practice on October 21, freshman forward Ice Brady dislocated her right patellar tendon; she underwent season-ending surgery on October 25.\nRecruiting.\nThe Huskies had another excellent recruiting class. ESPN ranked Patterson as the fourth-best recruit of the 2022 class and Brady as the fifth-best. Brady would be lost for the 2022–23 season to a knee injury. Bettencourt was recruited just before the start of the season.\nRecruiting class of 2023.\nThe Huskies continued to recruit well. ESPN evaluated UConn's class of 2023 as the fourth-ranked group, behind LSU, South Carolina, and Arizona.\nRecruiting class of 2024.\nOn December 3, 2022, UConn received a verbal commitment from five-star guard Allie Ziebell of Neenah, Wisconsin.\nCoaching.\nHall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma and Hall of Fame associate head coach Chris Dailey returned for their 38th season. Assistant coach Jamelle Elliott was a UConn assistant coach from 1998 to 2009 and returned after a nine-year head coaching stint at Cincinnati. Assistant coach Morgan Valley was the head coach of the Hartford Hawks when hired by the Huskies. Elliott and Valley are both former UConn players.\nGame summaries.\nExhibition.\nKutztown.\nThe Huskies began the season by hosting the Kutztown Golden Bears in an exhibition contest, the first meeting between the two schools. It was not the first time the Golden Bears had visited Storrs, however. On their return from a 2017 exhibition game against UMass, the Kutztown women were invited to tour the UConn campus and attend practice. Katie Lou Samuelson later said the Huskies wanted to show Kutztown \"...what it means to be at this university and what we've been working for.\" In the November 6, 2022 exhibition at the XL Center, the Golden Bears briefly led 7–6 at the start, but the Huskies quickly took over, taking a 30 point lead into halftime. The final tally was 115–42.\nRegular season.\nNortheastern.\nUConn opened the regular season with a 98–39 win against the Huskies of Northeastern. Azzi Fudd led all scorers with 26 points, and Lou Lopez Sénéchal scored 17. Forwards Aaliyah Edwards and Dorka Juhász each recorded double doubles, Edwards with 12 rebounds and 14 points, and Juhász with 11 rebounds and 14 points. Aubrey Griffin, who had redshirted the previous season due to injury, came off the bench to hit six of seven field goal attempts including her only three-point attempt, scoring 13 points.\nTexas.\nAn early season home contest against a top ten opponent is always highly anticipated, but the second game against number three Texas was a rematch for Husky graduate transfer Lou Lopez Sénéchal. After a loss in NCAA tournament play against Texas ended her four-year career at Fairfield University, Lopez Sénéchal found herself with an extra year of eligibility (due to COVID) and through the transfer portal arrived in Storrs. She prepared herself to play Texas, saying \"... losing the last game of your season and then playing them the second game of the season is something I'm looking forward to.\"\nIn a November 14 sell-out of Harry A. Gampel Pavilion, the fifth-ranked UConn Huskies met the third-ranked Texas Longhorns. The first half was a rugged defensive contest; UConn held onto a slim three-point lead at halftime. The Huskies gradually widened the margin in the second half, briefly opening up a 17-point advantage. The final score favored UConn 83–76. Sénéchal scored 12 points, while Azzi Fudd led all scorers with a career-high 32 points. After the game, Texas coach Vic Schaefer said, \"It ain't no different than any other year around here. They are really good.\" Juhász left the game with a hand injury, later determined to be a broken thumb which kept her out for the next five games.\nNC State.\nFor the second time in a week, UConn faced a top ten squad: the 10th rated NC State Wolfpack. The two teams clashed in the previous season's NCAA tournament regional final, dubbed a \"double overtime thriller\" by \"Sports Illustrated\". NC State's Jakia Brown-Turner drilled a three-pointer with 0.8 seconds remaining to tie the first overtime. Paige Bueckers hit her first two shots in the next period and the Huskies went on to win 91–87, sending UConn to its 22nd Final Four.\nThis year's game would not be nearly as dramatic, at least within the confines of the game itself. The teams lined up for the pregame national anthem, and after the anthem was completed, UConn's associate head coach Chris Dailey fainted and was taken off the court on a stretcher. Auriemma reported, \"The players were pretty taken back by it, and I didn't know what to expect going out there.\" The players managed to pull it together and started the game with a 9–0 run. Although the Wolfpack closed within five points late in the second quarter, the Huskies extended their lead to as much as 24 points in the second half and ended up with a lopsided 91–69 win. Fudd again scored 32 points, but the stat of the day was recorded by Nika Mühl, whose 15 assists set an all-time school record.\nDuke.\nUConn was a participant in the Phil Knight invitational tournament, a basketball event held to celebrate the co-founder of Nike. Earlier events in 2017 and 2019 included only men's teams, but the 2022 event was extended to women's teams as well. UConn was one of four teams in the Legacy bracket, along with Duke, their first round opponent, Iowa, and Oregon State.\nThe game was close early on with the score tied at 13 with just under three minutes left in the first quarter, but UConn went on a 10–1 run to finish the quarter and was never threatened again. Lopez Sénéchal was the leading scorer with 23 points, the first time this season she was the leading scorer for the team. Nika Mühl recorded double digit assists with 10, while Edwards had a double double with 11 rebounds and 17 points. The final score was 78—50.\nIowa.\nUConn faced ninth ranked Iowa in the tournament finale, their third top 10 opponent in the last four games. The Huskies had a modest lead in the first quarter, leading by seven, 18–11, with just over three minutes to go. The second and beginning of the third quarters would belong to the Hawkeyes, as they put together a 13–2 run in the second quarter and an 11–2 run in the third quarter to take an 11 point lead, causing Auriemma to call a timeout. The Huskies responded, led by Azzi Fudd who hit seven out of seven field goal attempts in the third quarter for 16 points. Iowa came back in the fourth quarter, turning a four point deficit into a five point advantage, but Lopez Sénéchal and Ducharme threes helped the Huskies recover and go on to win 86–79. Fudd was one of five Huskies with double-digit scoring, and Mühl led the team in assists with 13.\nProvidence.\nLess than four minutes into the game, the Huskies were ahead 10–0. With just under two minutes left in the first quarter, UConn was leading 27–6, inspiring the \"Journal Inquirer\"'s Carl Adamec to comment, \"It took the UConn women's basketball team only eight minutes of playing time Friday night to make all the suspense associated with its game with Providence about individual statistics.\" The final score of 98–53 was decidedly in favor of the Huskies, but Adamec was right about individual statistics. Mühl recorded double-digit assists in her fourth consecutive game, which set a single-season record for the Huskies. Edward recorded a double-double for the fourth consecutive game, a personal best. At the time, Mühl's assists per game average was 11.0, which was the highest in Division I women's basketball.\nNotre Dame.\nNotre Dame was just three days removed from their only loss of the season, a buzzer beater loss to Maryland on a last second shot by Diamond Miller. Now they faced Connecticut on their home court, but they had not beaten UConn at home since 2013. Notre Dame's Olivia Miles started out strongly, scoring the team's first seven points. The score was tied at 13, but then the Irish built and extended the lead. Fudd injured her right knee, left the game early in the second quarter, and did not return. Notre Dame expanded the lead to 17. The Huskies tried to respond and cut the lead to five, but the Irish built the lead back to double digits and coasted to a 74–60 win. Notre Dame hit 50% of the field-goal attempts and 46% of their three-point attempts and held the Huskies to under 37% field-goal shooting.\nPrinceton.\nWinning the game is typically the primary goal, but it is rarely the only goal. In addition to developmental goals — getting more time for some bench players, working on specific offenses or defenses in a real game as opposed to practice, there also are records, both at the individual and the team level that may be at stake in a particular game. This game featured more than the usual number of such records. The Huskies were the holders of a somewhat obscure, but impressively long streak — they had not lost back-to-back games since the start of the 1993–94 season, a streak now at 1,066 games, started long before any player on the current team had been born. It was the first time UConn had ever played Princeton, and the Huskies were on a 93 game winning streak when playing against first-time opponents. They also had a 76 consecutive games streak against an opponent with a former Auriemma player or assistant coach on the staff. Having just lost to Notre Dame, and former UConn player Carla Berube coaching the Tigers, all three of these streaks were on the line.\nThe game was within a point about halfway through the first quarter, but then the Huskies went on a small run, then extended the lead to 31–16, and it seemed the Husky fans could relax. However, Nika Mühl suffered a concussion early in the second half, knocking her out of the game. UConn's lead was still double digits when the fourth quarter started, but the Tigers started clawing their way back and cut the margin to a slim two points, 66–64, with 30 seconds left to go in the game. Inês Bettencourt was a freshman to-be headed to a Florida junior college when Paige Bueckers was injured during the summer, and UConn hastily looked for additional guard help. Bettencourt was persuaded to join the Huskies and now found herself on the court with the game on the line. She ended up hitting three of four free throws in the final 21.7 seconds, including two critical shots with 2.7 seconds left in the game that helped clinch the win. UConn won 69–64 and extended their three streaks.\nMaryland.\nUConn traveled to Maryland with only seven players available to suit up for the game. It wasn't the first time UConn faced Maryland shorthanded — in November 2013, the Huskies only had seven scholarship players available for the game. But it's one thing to have seven players available when five of them will go on to be WNBA first-round draft picks, and it's another thing to be down to seven players because four starters are sitting on the bench. The shorthanded team started out encouragingly, leading 15–7 six minutes into the game. The lead was down to two points at the end of the quarter, and then Maryland outscored UConn by eleven points in the second quarter.\nMaryland extended the lead to 10 in the third quarter, but UConn tied it up at 62 points apiece early in the fourth quarter. The game continued to be relatively close, but Maryland held the lead through the final buzzer, winning 85–78. Abby Myers, who transferred to Maryland from Princeton, was the leading scorer for Maryland with 20 points, hitting four of her eight three-point attempts.\nFlorida State.\nUConn returned Juhász and Mühl to the starting lineup, but minutes before the tip off, the school announced that head coach Auriemma would not be available due to illness. Associate head coach Chris Dailey stepped in for the 15th time in her career. The Basketball Hall of Fame Women's Showcase was played at Mohegan Sun Arena. The Huskies started strongly, scoring 10 consecutive points before Florida State made the first basket about four minutes into the game. UConn extended the lead to 15 points by the end of the first quarter and more slowly in the second quarter, but ended the half with a seemingly comfortable 51–35 lead. The second half was a different story, as Florida State cut into a 20 point lead and reduced the margin to four points with 3:19 left in the game. The Huskies responded and ended up with the win, 85–77. Edwards ended with 26 points, while Lopez Sénéchal has 23.\nSeton Hall.\nAuriemma was again unavailable for the game against Seton Hall. His doctor recommended that he take a few days off to fully recover.\nThe team started out strong as they had against Florida State, ending the first quarter with a 25–10 lead. Unlike the game against Florida State, they did not let up and let the game get close in the second half. Although Seton Hall outscored the Huskies by six points in the fourth quarter, that simply cut a 30 point lead down to 25. Mühl had 16 points and 11 assists and got her first career double double. Juhász also recorded a double double with 10 points and rebounds. The final score in favor of the Huskies was 98–73.\nCreighton.\nUConn traveled to Nebraska to play Creighton in front of a sellout crowd, with only seven players dressed. Amari DeBerry went home for the Christmas break to the Buffalo area and was unable to get a flight to Omaha. Aubrey Griffin tested positive for COVID and was unable to play. The remaining seven held the Blue Jays to their worst offensive performance of the year. Although the Blue Jays recorded more three-pointers than the Huskies, they only hit 10.7% of their attempts. The two point shooting was not much better, with an overall field-goal percentage of under 24%. The storyline was the play of Edwards and Juhász, who each recorded a double double. Edwards had 23 points and 20 rebounds, the first 20 rebound effort for UConn in over a decade. The team combined for 59 rebounds against 27 for Creighton. The final score in favor of UConn was 72–47.\nMarquette.\nEight players dressed for Marquette once DeBerry rejoined the team, but fans held their collective breaths when Juhász has knocked to the ground and had to be helped to the sideline. She received an ovation when she got back into the game and even louder when she nailed a three pointer. The game was a relatively low-scoring game, but UConn prevailed 61–48 behind 22 points for Lopez Sénéchal and 19 for Ducharme.\nButler.\nIn January 2023, the team traveled to Indianapolis for games against Butler and Xavier. Auriemma traveled with the team and attended the morning shootaround but was not feeling well and decided to sit out the evening game, so Dailey took over again as head coach. Ducharme was missing from the lineup due to concussion protocol. UConn scored the first eight points, leading Butler to call a timeout. After Butler scored, UConn went on a 10–0 run. Edwards was dominant for the Huskies, outscoring the Bulldogs herself in the opening quarter. Butler did better in the second quarter, hitting multiple threes and cutting the lead to five points before UConn closed the half leading by 14. UConn was dominant in the third period and coasted to the 33 point victory, 80–47. Daily was now 16–0 as acting head coach.\nXavier.\nDailey filled in for Auriemma once more, as the head coach was unavailable due to illness. Only eight players dressed for the game, and when Edwards crashed into chairs on the sidelines tracking down an errant ball, the team had only seven players for the rest of the game. \"We had enough people to finish the game, so that's a good sign,\" said Dailey. \"We've tried holy water. We've tried sage burning. None of them seem to work. It's just something we have to deal with. Whoever we have, we feel like we have enough.\" UConn started off the game slowly, hitting only one of the first nine shots but then started scoring, opening up a 31 point by halftime. Griffin had 17 points in the first half, while Juhász went eight for 12 in the game, scoring 18 points. Dailey was now 17–0 when filling in for Auriemma.\nSt. John's.\nSo many UConn players were injured or otherwise unavailable by January 7, 2023 that the next day's home game against DePaul was postponed, due to insufficient players to meet the NCAA minimum of seven. UConn's next game was at St. John's on January 11.\nFans anxious for Fudd's return were encouraged when photos of her in the afternoon shootaround emerged with her wearing braids, a hairstyle she reserves for game days. \"I always have my hair in two braids for games,\" Fudd said with a smile. \"The past couple games it's been in a bun.\" The observation proved accurate, as Fudd came off the bench and played 20 minutes, scoring 14 points including two of four three-pointers. Edwards had a good game, hitting more than half her field-goal attempts, and on a night when the team free throw shooting wasn't overly impressive, she hit five of six. Her minutes were a bit limited due to foul problems, but she still managed to play good defense and record 15 points. Juhász hit 8 of her 14 field-goal attempts and recorded a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds and added seven assists. Lopez Sénéchal recorded about as efficient a 20 point output as you can manage. She took nine shots, hitting eight of them, hitting all four two-point shots and all but one of her three-point shots. Griffin helped the team hold St. John's leading scorer to well below her scoring average. The team had 62.3% of the field goal attempts, a season-high, which led to a 30 point margin of victory, 82–52, over the Red Storm.\nGeorgetown.\nUConn followed up its 30 point win against St. John's with a game against Georgetown, a team St. John's beat by 20 points, 68–48, on December 31, 2022. Georgetown came into the game with only a single win in the Big East, having beaten last-place and winless in conference Xavier. On paper it seemed like it should be an easy win. The game didn't start that way. Georgetown led at the end of the first quarter and was down by only a single point at the half. Auriemma explained, \"We didn't have the energy to get us through some of the missed shots... It settled into an ugly scrum kind of a game. We couldn't get any kind of flow.\"\nThe Huskies did better in the third quarter, starting with a 16–2 run and following up with 12 unanswered points to pull out to a 65–41 lead. UConn ended up with a 15 point margin of victory, 65–50. Edwards had a double double with 17 points and 11 rebounds. Fudd banged her previously injured knee in the first half, left the game, and didn't return, sitting on the bench with an ice pack on her knee.\nButler.\nUConn scored twice before the game was a minute old, but then went over five minutes without a single point during which Butler ran off 13 consecutive points. The Bulldogs would score only six more points in the first half, while the Huskies would add 32 to take a 36–19 lead at the half. They then opened the second half with a run of 10 consecutive points and went on to easily win the game by 40 points, 79–39, despite having only seven players available.\nThe win represented the 10th consecutive win for UConn. Before Auriemma took over the coaching duties, the longest consecutive win streak by the Huskies was five games. UConn had now recorded a 10 or more game consecutive win streak in 17 consecutive seasons.\nThree Huskies – Edwards, Griffin, and Lopez Sénéchal – were tied with 17 points apiece with two minutes left in the game. Edwards hit a layup and a foul shot to reach 20 points.\nDePaul.\nUConn played DePaul on January 23, a game originally scheduled for January 8, but on that date, the Huskies were down to six available scholarship players, one fewer than the minimum required by Big East rules. The team had eight players available for this game. DePaul had All-American Aneesah Morrow on their team, who scored 20 points and pulled down 12 rebounds, but UConn's Edwards had 23 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists on 10 of 13 shooting to lead the Huskies to a 94–51 win over the Blue Demons. The Huskies had three other players with double-digit scoring: Griffin with 18, Sénéchal with 20, and Juhász with 19. Mühl had 10 assists, the eighth time she's had double-digit assists this year, setting a school record for a single season.\nTennessee.\nThe Huskies were still shorthanded when they faced Tennessee, with only eight players available to play. One of the available players did not play, one played under two minutes, and one played 10 minutes. All five starters played 36 minutes or more, with Mühl playing all 40 minutes. The crowd of 13,804 was the largest Lady Vols crowd in the arena since 2015.\nThe Huskies opened strong, scoring 33 points in the first quarter and holding the Lady Vols to 17. Tennessee turned the tables in the second quarter, holding the Huskies to only seven points in scoring 19 to cut the lead to four points at halftime. Although Tennessee briefly cut the lead to two points early in the third quarter, UConn dominated the third quarter, outscoring Tennessee by nine and extending their lead to 13. The lead expanded to 19 points at the largest with the Huskies getting the win, 84–67.\nLopez Sénéchal scored a season-high 26 points, while Edwards was close behind with 25. Mühl contributed 14 assists, one off the school record set by her earlier in the season. Connecticut hit 55% of their overall field goals and 57% of their three-point attempts. Tennessee's Jorden Horsten had missed her previous game with an illness but came in off the bench and led all scorers with 27 points.\nVillanova.\nUConn hosted the second place team in the Big East, Villanova, in front of 14,375 fans. After Villanova's leading scorer Maddy Siegrist hit an opening three pointer, the Huskies responded with nine consecutive points. As the first quarter drew to a close, Connecticut appeared to be in charge, leading 25–17. The second quarter was a different story, with the Wildcats defense holding the Huskies to eight points, and the margin was cut to three points at halftime. Husky fans traditionally stand at the beginning of the game and the beginning of the second half and rhythmically clap until the first UConn score. In this game, the crowd stood until Lopez Sénéchal hit a free throw with only 3:33 left in the quarter. By this time, Villanova had taken the lead. The Wildcats were still leading halfway through the final quarter, but UConn went on a 15–4 run to retake the lead. The Huskies were leading by five with 31 seconds left in the game, but a Wildcats steal leading to a three pointer cut the lead to two. Edwards made one of two free throws, and Villanova had two shots in a three pointer which would've tied the game with only four seconds to go. Those shots failed, and Edwards hit two final free throws to seal the win, 63–58.\nProvidence.\nThe game played against Providence in December at Connecticut's campus location was very one-sided, with the Huskies winning by 45 points. The return engagement in Providence was very different. Although the Huskies led the entire game, after opening up a 15 point lead, the Friars cut the lead to six in the third quarter. UConn responded with a 13–2 run to extend their lead to 17, but the Friars cut it back to single digits with just over three minutes to go. Connecticut ended up with a 10 point win, 64–54, thanks to a double double by Juhász with 19 points and 17 rebounds.\nSouth Carolina.\nThe Huskies started strong, opening up a 25–14 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Gamecocks responded in the second quarter, and the game was tied at halftime. A technical foul late in the game gave two foul shots to South Carolina and possession, resulting in four points, extending the six-point lead to 10 points with under four minutes to go. With 1:20 to go, a technical foul was called on South Carolina during a basket attempt by Edwards. UConn hit one of two free throw attempts by Edwards, and one of two free throw shots associated with the technical by Lopez Sénéchal and then scored on the subsequent possession to cut the lead to six. The Huskies would go on to score nine more points in the final minute, but South Carolina scored six from the free-throw line to hang on to the win, 81–77.\nMarquette.\nThe game against Marquette was the second matchup between the two teams this season, with the Huskies beating Marquette at home by 13 points on New Year's Eve. The game at Marquette started out with UConn scoring three consecutive baskets, leading 6–0 three minutes into the game.  Marquette responded, outscoring UConn 16–4 through the next seven minutes, and led by six points at the end of the first quarter. The Golden Eagles continued their dominance in the beginning of the second period, taking a 23–10 lead. UConn managed to tie up the game in the third quarter but never took another lead. A late 6–0 run by Marquette put the game out of reach.\nThis loss to Marquette following their loss to South Carolina meant UConn had lost back-to-back games, something that had not happened to the team since 1993. The AP described this as ending \"one of the most remarkable achievements in college basketball history.\"\nGeorgetown.\nFollowing rare back to back losses, Connecticut faced Georgetown, a team the Huskies had beaten 33 consecutive times. The Hoyas threatened early, opening up a seven-point advantage and leading 17–13 at the end of the first quarter. They were down by only three points down partway through the third quarter. Georgetown cut the margin to four with half a minute left in the game but UConn hit their final four free throws to get the 67–59 win. Juhász and Griffin each had 18 points for the Huskies, while Georgetown's Fauntleroy had 24 points.\nCreighton.\nIn front of a sold-out crowd, the Huskies played the Blue Jays almost even in the first quarter, then gradually opened up a nine point lead with 3 1/2 minutes to go in the half. Creighton cut the lead back to two points at halftime, then took the lead and extended it to 11 points on the opening play of the fourth quarter. Ducharme, who had been scoreless in first three quarters of the game, scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, helping to give the Huskies the lead. UConn was up by two points when Creighton's Lauren Jensen, an 84% free throw shooter, went to the line with 0.7 seconds left in the game and a chance to tie the game. However, she missed the first so deliberately missed the second hoping for a rebound, but the rebound was secured by Edwards to end the game.\nVillanova.\nUConn took on Villanova, ranked number 14 at the time, at their home court. Villanova was led by Maddy Siegrist, who averaged over 29 points a game, leading the Division I in scoring. A week earlier, she had scored 50 points in a game to set a school and conference record for a single game. The game was close through the first three quarters, with UConn holding a five-point lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Huskies outscored the Wildcats 8–1 in the opening minutes of the quarter, pushing the margin to a 12 point lead, but the Wildcats scored 10 consecutive points over the next 4 1/2 minutes to cut the margin to two points. That was as close as Villanova would get, with Lopez Sénéchal scoring a \"crucial rainbow jumper late in the fourth quarter\" to lead the Huskies to a 60–51 win.\nSt. John's.\nUConn played St. John's at their home court in mid-January, beating them by 30 points. This game was at UConn's downtown arena — a win would give UConn a share of the Big East regular-season title. The game unfolded very differently than the game at St. John's. The game was very close at the midpoint of the first quarter, but then St. John's opened up a small lead, which became a nine point lead early in the second quarter. The Red Storm still had a five-point lead at the half. The Huskies came out in the second half with suffocating defense, holding the Red Storm scoreless for almost six minutes, taking a modest 43–35 lead. The Red Storm responded and held the Huskies scoreless for five minutes, a stretch covering the last two minutes of the third quarter and extending into the fourth quarter. St. John's opened up a modest lead of six points, which the Huskies cut to two points, but could not retake the lead, and the Red Storm ended up with the win, 69–64. This marked five consecutive games in which the Huskies did not score 70 points, which was the longest such streak since 1992. Coach Auriemma noted, \"It would have been a sin if they lost that game. They played so well and so hard. They played like they were the better team, and they were.\"\nDePaul.\nConnecticut travel to Chicago to play DePaul in the second of the conference home-and-home series. The earlier game had been rescheduled from January 8 because the Huskies did not have enough players to suit up. When the game was finally rescheduled, UConn beat DePaul by 43 points. This game would be different. The game was very close until late in the third quarter when DePaul opened up a seven point lead. The Blue Demons continued to hold a small lead until the Huskies tied it with just over three minutes to go. A DePaul turnover led to a UConn basket, and then Mühl hit a three pointer to give UConn a five-point lead. DePaul responded with two free throws and a layup to cut the lead to a single point with 17 seconds remaining. DePaul's best player, Aneesah Morrow, who had 25 points in the game, had the ball and raced down the court in an attempt to take the lead but was tied up, and the possession went to UConn. DePaul was forced to foul. The Huskies hit two free throws, and DePaul missed a three point jumper at the buzzer, giving UConn a 72–69 win.\nXavier.\nUConn closed the regular-season portion of the schedule with a game at home against Xavier, a team they had beaten at Xavier by 36 points. Xavier had lost all 19 games against Big East teams that season. The Huskies were up 20–11 early in the first quarter, but Xavier cut the lead to two points at the end of the quarter and took a lead briefly in the second quarter. The Huskies buckled down and extended the lead to 18 points, but the Musketeers did not wilt and cut the lead to single digits late in the game. UConn won the game 60–51, but the single-digit margin of victory represented a \"school-record eight consecutive single-figure games.\" Mühl's seven assists in the game brought her season total to 236 which broke the school record set by Sue Bird in 2002.\nBig East tournament.\nGeorgetown.\nAfter a first round bye, UConn's matchup in the quarterfinals was Georgetown, a team who had played the Huskies within eight points a few weeks earlier. However, the Huskies had Azzi Fudd, who had missed the last 14 games. She did not start but entered the game midway through the first quarter to a roar from the crowd. While she did not hit her opening shots, teammate Edwards expressed how the team felt about her return, \"But Azzi coming back, I think she adds a lot to the team both offensively and defensively and it showed tonight. And even though it took her a couple of shots to get into the rhythm, she did knock them down eventually, which we all knew that she would.\"\nUConn started quickly with a 15–2 run in the first quarter. The Huskies held Georgetown to a single field goal in the second quarter and reached halftime with a 35–12 lead. They ended up winning by 30 points, 69–39, led by Edwards' 19 points and 13 rebounds.\nMarquette.\nUConn faced Marquette in the semifinals of the Big East tournament. In the most recent meeting on February 8, Marquette defeated UConn 59–52, giving UConn back to back losses for the first time since 1993. Neither Ducharme nor Fudd were available for that game, while both were available for the semifinal. UConn opened with a 9–2 run and never relinquished the lead. The Golden Eagles did have and 8–0 run in the second quarter, but that only cut the margin to five points. The Huskies responded with a 12–2 run to take a 15 point halftime lead. Three UConn players – Edwards, Juhász, and Mühl – recorded double doubles as UConn advanced to the Big East tournament final with an 81–52 win.\nVillanova.\nThe Big East tournament championship game featured the top two ranked teams in the conference, UConn at number seven and Villanova at number 10. It is the only conference tournament this season to feature two top 10 ranked teams in the finals. The Huskies beat Villanova in their two regular-season games, but the margin in both games was single digits. Villanova had Maddy Siegrist, the nation's leading scorer. After the final regular-season game, a single-digit victory over Xavier which was the first team in 40 years to go without a win in Big East regular-season play, Auriemma drove home thinking about recent games. The next time he went to practice he challenged the team, \"You guys have exactly three days to fix whatever it is that happened, either internally yourself or team-wise. Take a look at it or the season is going to end in the next two weeks.\"\nThe team responded. The game was close until the middle of the second quarter when UConn ran off nine consecutive points. A few minutes later they scored 12 consecutive points. At the end of the third quarter they had a 22 point margin. Edwards posted her third double double in as many days with 19 points and 15 rebounds. Her three-day performance earned her the most outstanding player of the tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nVermont.\nUConn faced Vermont in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. Fudd scored 11 seconds into the game on an assist by Edwards, and UConn opened up a seven point lead before Vermont scored. Edwards ended up scoring 28 points, a career high, helping the Huskies to a 95–52 when over the Catamounts. The win gave the Huskies a 30 win season, the 26th time this had happened in the last 30 seasons. Every one of the 10 Husky players scored, the first time that happened all season.\nBaylor.\nUConn took on Baylor in their bid for a Sweet Sixteen berth. The Bears had come back from an 18 point deficit to beat Alabama in the first round, connecting with a school record 14 three-pointers in that game. The three point shooting continued against UConn, as Baylor hit six three-pointers in the first quarter and took a 24–18 first quarter lead. The Huskies responded in the second quarter, taking a five-point lead into the half on a Mühl buzzer beating three taken from half-court. In the third quarter, Edwards picked up her fourth foul, but Griffin filled in and grabbed 12 rebounds. Fudd scored 16 points in the third quarter, one more than the entire Baylor team. The Huskies held the Bears to only eight points in the final quarter, ending up with a 77–58 win and their 29th consecutive appearance in the Sweet Sixteen. The second-longest active streak was held by South Carolina with nine consecutive appearances.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| Exhibition \n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA tournament"

        "title": "2022–23 Munster Rugby season",
        "text": "The 2022–23 Munster Rugby season was Munster's twenty-second season competing in the United Rugby Championship, alongside which they competed in the European Rugby Champions Cup. It was Graham Rowntree's first season as head coach following his promotion.\nEvents.\nHead coach Johann van Graan, who joined Munster in November 2017, confirmed in December 2021 that he would be leaving the province at the end of the 2021–22 season to join English club Bath. In addition to this, senior coach Stephen Larkham also left the province to return home to Australia to become head coach of the Brumbies, and defence coach JP Ferreira followed van Graan to join Bath. However, forwards coach Graham Rowntree extended his stay with the province by a further two years, and the province confirmed in April 2022 that Rowntree would be promoted to head coach from the 2022–23 season. Mike Prendergast, a former scrum-half for the province, joined Rowntree's coaching setup as the attack coach on a three-year contract, having most recently fulfilled a similar role for French club Racing 92. Andi Kyriacou, who had joined the province in April 2021 as an elite player development officer with the academy, was promoted to forwards coach with the senior squad on a two-year contract, and former Munster player Denis Leamy returned to the province as defence coach on a three-year contract. Three additions were also made to the academy staff, with former players Brendan O'Connor and Tommy O'Donnell joining as elite player development officers and Matt Brown joining as pathway development coach.\nIn player news, Munster's marquee signing ahead of the commencement of the season was centre Malakai Fekitoa, who won the 2015 Rugby World Cup with New Zealand before reverting his international allegiance to his native Tonga. Irish-qualified hooker Chris Moore joined from Exeter University, and five players were promoted from the academy to the senior squad: hooker Scott Buckley, lock Paddy Kelly, back-rower Alex Kendellen, lock Eoin O'Connor, and scrum-half Paddy Patterson. Centre Antoine Frisch, who is Irish-qualified, also joined the province from English club Bristol Bears. Six players joined year one of Munster's academy programme ahead of the season: props Darragh McSweeney and Kieran Ryan, lock Evan O'Connell, back-row Ruadhán Quinn, scrum-half Jack Oliver and centre Fionn Gibbons.\nHooker Declan Moore left the province to join Ulster on a permanent basis, having spent time on loan at the northern province during the previous season. Fly-half Jake Flannery joined Moore in moving north to Ulster, whilst lock Jason Jenkins moved east to join Leinster after an injury-disrupted season at Munster, and fullback Matt Gallagher and flanker Chris Cloete joined former head coach Johann van Graan at Bath. Veteran prop John Ryan left to join English club Wasps, and hooker Kevin O'Byrne joined English RFU Championship club Ealing Trailfinders. Centre Alex McHenry and back-three Seán French left the province to join English Championship clubs Jersey Reds and Bedford Blues respectively, whilst scrum-half Rowan Osborne and academy back-three Jonathan Wren were both forced to retire due to injury, and South African world cup-winning centre Damian de Allende returned to Japanese domestic rugby with Saitama Wild Knights. Centre Chris Farrell was released from his contract with the province in early March 2023 to join French club Oyonnax, with prop James French and centre Dan Goggin also being released by the province in March 2023 to pursue a new playing opportunities.\nMunster were drawn in pool B for the 2022–23 European Rugby Champions Cup and faced French club Toulouse, who have won the competition a record five times and have knocked Munster out of tournament in the previous two seasons, and English club Northampton Saints, who beat Munster in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final and last faced the province during the 2011–12 Heineken Cup pool stage.\nMunster began pre-season with a 28–19 defeat at home to English club Gloucester on 26 August 2022. The following day, after the GAA Central Council unanimously backed the proposal, Munster confirmed they would face a South Africa XV in a friendly held at Cork GAA's 45,000-capacity Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022. It would be the first time Munster have faced a South African national team in the professional era - their last such meeting was in 1970 - and would also see former Munster coaches Rassie Erasmus and Jacques Nienaber return to the province for the first time since their departure in 2017. Munster's second and final pre-season fixture was a 19–14 defeat to London Irish on 2 September 2022.\nMunster opened their 2022–23 United Rugby Championship season with a 20–13 defeat away to Cardiff on 17 September 2022. Cardiff lead 12–6 at half-time, with Ben Healy scoring Munster's points from two penalties, before a 62nd minute try from Jack O'Sullivan, converted by Jack Crowley, gave Munster a 13–12 lead. Cardiff's lead was restored by a 68th minute penalty from Jarrod Evans and Aled Summerhill's 77th minute try sealed the home sides win. New signings Malakai Fekitoa and Antoine Frisch made their competitive debuts for the province in the fixture.\nAfter a mounting number of injuries sustained prior to round seven of the United Rugby Championship, prop John Ryan returned to the province to provide tighthead prop cover on a three-month contract, having been made redundant following Wasps administration, Irish-qualified centre Oli Morris joined for the remainder of the season following Worcester Warriors administration, and lock Kiran McDonald joined on a three-month contract having also been made redundant at Wasps. After finishing his contract at the end of January 2023, Ryan will move to New Zealand to join Super Rugby team the Chiefs.\nMunster's historic friendly against a South Africa XV went ahead on 10 November 2022. The match was a 41,400 sell-out at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, making it the largest attendance for a rugby match in the province, and saw Munster secure their first ever win against South Africa in a 28–14 victory. Winger Shane Daly opened the scoring in just the 2nd minute, with fly-half Ben Healy converting to give the home side a 7–0 lead. South Africa hit back in the 12th minute through an Aphelele Fassi try that was converted by Johan Goosen to level the score, but Munster struck back with tries from Simon Zebo and Diarmuid Barron, both converted by Healy, to head into half-time with a 21–7. Munster struck early in the second-half, with fullback Mike Haley scoring after just two minutes and Healy's fourth conversion of the night extending their lead to 28–7. South Africa scored their second try in the 62nd minute when Sikhumbuzo Notshe crossed the try-line, converted by Gianni Lombard, but the visitors were unable to mount a comeback and Munster hung on to earn a famous win.\nMunster opened their 2022–23 Champions Cup campaign with an 18–13 defeat at home to French club Toulouse on 11 December 2022. Munster took the lead in the 9th minute through a Joey Carbery try (Munster's 500th in European competitive rugby), which the fly-half also converted, before Toulouse responded with a Matthis Lebel try in the 22nd minute, converted by Thomas Ramos, before a penalty from Ramos in the 29th minute extended the visitors lead, though a Carbery penalty in the 38th minute saw the teams level at 10–10 at half-time. Toulouse struck almost immediately in the second-half, with replacement Lucas Tauzin scoring a try in the 42nd minute. Ramos missed the conversion but scored a 71st minute penalty to extend Toulouse's lead to eight points, but a second successful penalty from Carbery in the 74th minute brought Munster back to within losing bonus-point range, but the province was unable to take advantage of an Antoine Dupont yellow card in the final minutes of the game.\nA huge defensive effort secured a 17–6 away win against Northampton Saints in round two of the Champions Cup on 18 December 2022. Number eight Gavin Coombes opened the scoring for Munster with a 13th minute try converted by fly-half Joey Carbery, before the home side got on the scoreboard with a 19th minute penalty. Carbery scored a penalty of his own in the 26th minute, though Northampton hit back with their second penalty just two minutes later. Coombes crossed for his and Munster's second try in the 35th minute, again converted by Carbery, to leave the score at 17–6 at half-time. Munster had three players sin-binned during the second-half: Jack O'Donoghue, Craig Casey and Joey Carbery, and needed the aforementioned defensive effort to keep Northampton from narrowing the score and earn a hard-fought victory on the road.\nIn the reverse fixture against Northampton Saints on 14 January 2023, Munster raced to a 24–0 half-time lead thanks to two tries from Gavin Coombes and one try from Jack O'Donoghue, all converted by Joey Carbery, who also added one penalty, though O'Donoghue was sent-off for a high tackle during the half. What looked like a comfortable victory turned into a tense finish however, when Northampton mounted a comeback during the second-half, scoring 20 unanswered points to come within a try of winning the game themselves, but a 75th minute penalty from Jack Crowley and some last-gasp defence secured the victory for Munster.\nMunster's fourth and final Champions Cup pool stage fixture was away to Toulouse on 22 January 2023. The French club dominated possession and territory during the opening quarter of the match and were 11–0 ahead before Munster grew into the game. Flanker John Hodnett got Munster on the scoreboard with an unconverted 30th minute try, before a penalty from fly-half Joey Carbery saw the teams head into half-time with the score at 11–8. A superb team try finished by lock Tadhg Beirne in the 48th minute, again unconverted, gave Munster a slender 13–11 lead, but three second-half penalties from Toulouse fullback Melvyn Jaminet secured a closely-fought 20–16 win for the hosts.\nThat result and others meant that Munster faced an away trip to South African side the Sharks in the last 16. The hosts opened the scoring with an early penalty from Curwin Bosch, but Munster hit back with a try from Shane Daly, converted by Jack Crowley, to take the lead. Sharks struck back with a try of their own from Jaden Hendrikse, and each team scored one more try during the first-half - Eben Etzebeth for the Sharks and Dave Kilcoyne for Munster - to leave the score finely poised at 17–14 at half-time, however, the Sharks scored four unanswered tries - two from Bongi Mbonambi and one each from Werner Kok and Curwin Bosch - to storm into the lead. Munster managed three further tries from Diarmuid Barron, Mike Haley and Fineen Wycherley, but with the scoreboard and time against them, the result was beyond doubt and the Sharks advanced to the quarter-finals.\nA 26–24 win against defending champions the Stormers and a 22–22 draw against the Sharks in Munster's final two fixtures of the regular 2022–23 United Rugby Championship season, both away from home, secured fifth place for the province in the league table, and they defeated Glasgow Warriors 14–5 away in the quarter-finals to set up a semi-final away to Leinster, whom Munster defeated 16–15 thanks to a late drop goal from Jack Crowley, setting up a final away to the Stormers on 27 May 2023, which Munster won 19–14 thanks to a late John Hodnett try to secure their fourth league title, their first trophy since the 2010–11 season and the first silverware of head coach Graham Rowntree's reign.\nPlayer movements.\nBelow are the players who joined and left the Munster senior and academy squads ahead of the 2022–23 season. \"Italics\" indicates players that transferred during the 2022–23 season.\nSenior squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nAcademy squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nCoaches and staff.\nSenior squad\nAcademy squad\n2022–23 European Rugby Champions Cup.\nFollowing their sixth-placed finish in the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship, Munster were seeded in tier three for the 2022–23 European Rugby Champions Cup.

        "title": "2021 World Triathlon Championship Series",
        "text": "The 2021 World Triathlon Championship Series was the 13th season of the World Triathlon Championship Series, the top level international series for triathlon, since its establishment in 2009. The season consisted of four pairs of triathlon races for both a men's and women's competition, beginning on May 15 in Yokohama, and concluding on August 21 with the grand final in Edmonton. The series calendar also included the 2020 Summer Olympics individual races on July 26 and 27 and mixed relay event on July 31.\nVincent Luis and Georgia Taylor-Brown began the season as defending champions from the 2020 season. Less than a month after their victories at the Olympics, Kristian Blummenfelt and Flora Duffy were crowned the series champions, becoming the first athletes to earn Olympic gold medals and World Triathlon Championship titles within the same year.\nOverview.\nCalendar.\nThe 2021 World Triathlon Championship Series visited five cities, including Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics.\nBackground.\nOn October 1, 2020, ITU announced that it would take on its new brand identity as World Triathlon, following 31 years as the International Triathlon Union. This included the renaming of every continental triathlon organization and the ITU World Triathlon Series, which became the World Triathlon Championship Series.\nIn addition to the rebranding, World Triathlon introduced a new format- the “Eliminator”- which consisted of multiple races over the super-sprint distance (300m swim, 6 km bike, 1.5 km run). The event would follow a McIntyre system-like format over the course of two days, in which athletes would need to secure a top-10 finish in their respective heat in order to advance to the next round.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple changes to the series calendar. The World Triathlon Championship Series event in Abu Dhabi, traditionally the first race of the world triathlon season, was moved to November 5–6 in order to allow for travel restrictions to ease. Due to it being scheduled after the grand final in Edmonton, World Triathlon later made the decision to designate the event as a race in the 2022 series. The series event in Hamburg was also postponed after the grand final, with new dates of September 18–19 instead of July 10–11. Bermuda was initially set to host eliminator and mixed relay events from October 15–17, and similar to the Abu Dhabi and Hamburg events, would count for 2022 series rankings points. A month before the planned race date, however, the race was cancelled due to a spike in COVID-19 infections.\nPoint system.\nFor every race an athlete finished they were awarded points based on their position across the line. For a World Triathlon Championship Series event and the Olympic Games the winner was awarded 1000 points with every athlete finishing afterwards being awarded with 7.5% less points. For the grand final 1250 points were awarded, and every subsequent place was awarded 7.5% less. If any athlete finished outside of the cut-off time, they would earn zero points regardless of finishing position. The cut-off times for each event was determined by adding 5% to the men's winner's time and 8% to the women's winner's time. An athlete's final score was determined by adding their 3 best scores in the World Series events and/or Olympic Games plus their score in the grand final, for a maximum of 4 scored races.\nSeries.\nYokohama.\nThe 2021 series opener took place in Yokohama over a standard-distance course. The 1500m swim consisted of two 750m laps near the Port of Yokohama before leading into the transition area next to Yamashita Park. Athletes then completed nine laps of 4.45 km each for a total distance of 40 km, and four laps of the 2.5 km course for a 10 km run finishing in the park.\nMen.\nThe start list for the men's race included numerous big names including defending series champion Vincent Luis and 2016 Olympics gold medalist Alistair Brownlee. Luis was the first athlete to finish the swim, followed closely by Marten Van Riel, Richard Varga and several other athletes. With minimal distance between athletes coming out of T1, a huge pack formed on the bike. For the entirety of the cycling segment, major breakaways, and a giant lead group of athletes entered T2. In the early stages of the run, a 4-man group consisting of Jonas Schomburg, Jelle Geens, Kristian Blummenfelt and Alex Yee initiated a breakaway. The group eventually settled down to just Blummenfelt and Geens in the final lap, with Yee and Morgan Pearson battling for the bronze medal. The race was won by Blummenfelt, who unleashed a final surge to take the gold ahead of Geens. Pearson closed out the top 3, climbing 35 places on the run to secure his first WTCS podium and a spot at the Olympics.\nWomen.\nAlthough the first lap of the swim was primarily dominated by Portuguese athlete Helena Carvalho, it was Summer Rappaport who ultimately finished the swim first with Carvalho close behind. Initially, a group of 10 athletes left T1 together to head out on the first lap of the bike, which soon grew to a 15-athlete pack. However, the focus of the race shifted to Maya Kingma and 2018 U23 World Champion Taylor Knibb, who broke away from the rest of the athletes and built a lead over the course of the first few kilometers. Their lead over the peloton increased every lap, eventually granting them a 2-minute advantage over the rest of the athletes in the field. The remainder of the race was dominated by Knibb, while Summer Rappaport overtook Kingma in the final lap to secure the silver medal. Knibb guaranteed her spot at the Olympics with her win, while Kingma secured her first WTCS podium of her career.\nLeeds.\nThe second race of the races was held in Leeds on a standard-distance course. Athletes started by completing two 750m laps in the lake at Roundhay Park before heading on the bike, which consisted of nine laps of 4.21 km each for a total distance of 37.9 km. Unlike previous years, when the bike course lead athletes to the second transition area at the Leeds city center, the 2021 course had a single transition area in the park. The run started with an 800m connection followed by four 2.3 km laps for a total distance of 10 km.\nMen.\nKristian Blummenfelt wore the number one as the series leader and placed himself in the starting to the left of the pontoon, setting himself up for what should have been the shortest path to the first buoy. However, he ended up in a group that swam slightly off course and subsequently lost time. Alistair Brownlee was charged with a ducking penalty during an incident between him and American Chase McQueen, leading to his disqualification. Richard Varga was also disqualified during the swim for not taking the correct path around a buoy. The initial stages of the bike were dominated by a group of eight athletes, which grew to 21 by the third lap. A few athletes made attempts to break away from the lead pack to no avail, retaining 15-20 second gaps over the group before the leads diminished. Although the competitors were clustered together for the first part of the run, Alex Yee broke away and maintained a lead for the rest of the race. With a run split of 29:46, Yee earned his first WTCS win, 25 seconds ahead of Morgan Pearson; and the final podium spot was claimed by Marten Van Riel.\nWomen.\n3-time Ironman World Championship runner-up Lucy Charles-Barclay made her professional short course debut at Leeds, eventually leading the race at the conclusion of the swim segment. She was joined by athletes including Maya Kingma, Jessica Learmonth and Sophie Coldwell, forming a pack of six athletes with a lead of 30 seconds over the rest of the field. The lead group soon whittled down to Kingma, Learmonth and Coldwell, whose lead increased to nearly 90 seconds over the rest of the second pack after the third lap. The gap between the groups kept steadily increasing over the course of the bike, eventually growing to 2 minutes by the end of the bike. Kingma and Learmonth remained close to each other after T2 while Coldwell dropped back, eventually securing a third-place finish. The two leaders remained neck-and-neck until the final 500m, where Kingma broke away uncontested to secure her first WTCS victory, while Learmonth claimed the silver medal.\nTokyo.\nThe triathlon events for the 2020 Summer Olympics took place at Odaiba Marine Park in Tokyo. The men's and women's events would be held over a standard-distance course, starting with a 1500m swim consisting of two laps of 950m and 550m each. The 40 km bike was held over eight laps of 5 km each, with multiple 90- and 180-degree turns on every lap. The race concluded with a four-lap course of 2.5 km per lap, finishing right next to the transition area.\nThe mixed relay event made its Olympic debut at Tokyo, following a female-male-female-male format. Each athlete swam 300m, biked two 3.4 km laps for 6.8 km total, and ran 2 km before handing off to the next athlete or finishing.\nMen.\nThe first triathlon event of the Olympics began with an invalid start caused by a media boat blocking some of the competitors. Approximately 51 athletes dove in before being called back to restart. At the end of the first lap of the swim, Vincent Luis held the lead and continued to do so for the last 550m. A pack of five athletes lead the race exiting T1, eventually growing to nine. Halfway into the race, the chase pack caught up with the leaders, with only 10 seconds separating the top 39 athletes. Andrea Salvisberg broke away from the pack and held a 20-second lead over the peloton with one lap to go, though the lead decreased to 14 seconds after T2. Alex Yee soon took control of the race, followed closely by Hayden Wilde and Kristian Blummenfelt. In the final lap it came down to Yee and Blummenfelt, the latter laying down one final sprint with 1 km to go to secure the Olympic title. Yee finished 11 seconds later, with Wilde closing out the podium.\nWomen.\nIn the hours leading up to the race, heavy rain remained a challenge for the athletes, eventually letting up to a drizzle at the start of the race. Right from the start of the race, Jessica Learmonth held a lead over the rest of the field and maintained it for the rest of the swim. She was joined by six other athletes, forming a pack that had a 60-second lead over the 14-athlete peloton at the end of the first lap. The lead group maintained their gap over the chasers, gradually decreasing in size until the end of the bike segment, with four athletes leading the race to start the run. Flora Duffy separated herself from the rest of the field within the first kilometer, while Georgia Taylor-Brown- who slowed down from a flat tire at the end of the bike- eventually made her way back to the top 3. At the halfway mark Katie Zaferes and Taylor-Brown battled for the silver medal, still 47 seconds behind Duffy. In the end it was Taylor-Brown who claimed the second place spot over Zaferes, while Duffy finished with a 74-second gap to secure the first-ever gold medal for Bermuda.\nMixed relay.\n64 athletes representing 16 countries raced in the mixed relay event a few days after the individual events. At the end of the first swim segment, it was , , , and in the lead, the first four of whom forming a lead pack on the first lap of the bike. They maintained a lead of 26 seconds over the chasers entering T2, with Learmonth and Zaferes in the front. After the first exchange, it was in front, followed by , and . Brownlee's lead over the chasers opened to 10 seconds at the start of the run, maintaining his lead before tagging off to . The chasers consisted of four athletes, though eventually broke away from the pack. After T2 Taylor-Brown remained in the lead 11 seconds clear of Knibb, with four athletes chasing for the last spot on the podium. At the end of the run the lead grew to 14 seconds, while Knibb remained 35 seconds in front of . anchored the British team, with and in pursuit. Luis took the lead on the second lap of the bike, but was subsequently overtaken after T2. Yee's gap over the other athletes grew as Luis held a 5-second gap over Pearson, only for his advantage to diminish. Yee took the win for Great Britain with Pearson securing a silver medal for the United States and Luis earning France the bronze.\nMontreal.\nThe eliminator format made its debut at Montreal, consisting of six total races each for men and women over two days. Two qualifying heats were held on the first day, with the top 10 athletes from each heat automatically advancing to the final. The remaining athletes raced again in a repechage heat, from which 10 athletes qualified for the final. On the second day, three heats were held for the final; 30 athletes started in the first heat from which the top 20 advanced to the second heat, and after the second heat the top 10 athletes competed for a spot on the podium. Each heat consisted of a 300m swim near the Old Port, three laps of 2.4 km each for the bike, and two 1 km laps of running, with the finish line at the port.\nA mixed relay race was held on the third day of the event. Each athlete swam 300m, and biked two laps of 3.3 km each. The first, second and third athletes for each country ran two laps for a total distance of 1.9 km before handing off to the next athlete, while the final athlete ran 1.67 km to the finish line.\nMen.\nDue to the short race distance, athletes remained clustered together for majority of the races, with 10 seconds separating the top 10 in each of the qualifying heats and 5 seconds separating the top 10 in the repechage. An even bigger pack of athletes finished together in the first heat of day two, with the top 20 athletes finishing within 5 seconds of each other. The second heat featured the top 10 athletes finishing in a 6-second span, solidifying the start list for the final heat.\nJacob Birtwhistle, Marten Van Riel, Léo Bergère, Kevin Mcdowell, Dorian Coninx, Vincent Luis, Hayden Wilde, Taylor Reid, Antonio Serrat Seoane and Seth Rider were featured on the start list for the final eliminator heat. The athletes remained within 15 seconds of each other after the swim and formed a single pack on the bike. Five athletes formed a lead group on the run, though Coninx would eventually come out in front, followed by Luis and Bergere, closing out a French podium sweep.\nWomen.\nThe women's qualifiers had a greater spread in comparison to the men's races, with 38 seconds separating the top 10 in the first heat, 15 seconds in the second heat, and 13 seconds in the repechage. 10 seconds separated the top 20 in the first final, while the top 10 in the second final finished within 23 seconds of each other.\nTaylor Knibb, Laura Lindemann, Flora Duffy, Non Stanford, Katie Zaferes, Taylor Spivey, Léonie Périault, Sophie Coldwell, Nicole Van Der Kaay and Verena Steinhauser all qualified for the final heat of the event. Although the athletes finished the swim within 5 seconds of each other, a lead group consisting of Duffy, Knibb and Spivey broke away from the rest of the field on the bike and stayed close together for the entirety of the run. Duffy finished first, while Knibb and Spivey claimed the second and third spots on the podium, respectively. Katie Zaferes completed an American sweep of second through fourth place by finishing behind Spivey.\nMixed relay.\n and exited the water as the early leaders of the race, with 10 seconds behind. During the first lap of the bike, Sakai experienced an issue with her chain and was unable to maintain the lead. The majority of the run was dominated by Spivey and , with right behind. After the first exchange it was , and at the front of the race, their lead increasing over the course of the swim and bike. Rider pulled away from the others to lead the United States before handing over to . and remained 15 seconds off the lead as Kasper reached the midway point of the swim, but eventually caught up during the bike. Betto pulled away during the run and handed over to , who started the last swim segment with right behind and 9 seconds further back. At the end of the swim, the leaders were close together and remained close for the bike portion. McQueen pulled away one last time on the run to secure a win for the United States, while Morgan claiming the silver for New Zealand and Fabian earning the final podium spot for Italy.\nEdmonton.\nThe Grand Final for the 2021 World Triathlon Championship Series was held at Hawrelak Park over a standard-distance course. The 1500m swim consisted of two 750m laps in the lake, followed by eight laps of 5 km each for 40 km of cycling total. The 10 km run was composed of four laps of a 2.5 km course.\nMen.\nOnly 39 points separated Kristian Blummenfelt and Alex Yee, the current leaders of the series before Edmonton, meaning that the faster of the two would be the series champion unless Marten Van Riel, who was third in the overall standings, outperformed them by enough of a margin. Van Riel, along with Vincent Luis and Hungarian athlete Mark Devay, built a lead over the rest of the competitors after the first lap of the swim. After the second lap, the nearest chasers were Taylor Reid and Dorian Coninx 15 seconds behind, Blummenfelt 35 seconds back and Yee 50 seconds. A chasing pack of 17 athletes including Blummenfelt continued to pursue the leaders, closing the gap to 24 seconds with one lap to go. Yee started the run 90 seconds behind Blummenfelt, who made his way to the front over the course of the run. In the final 500m, it came down to Blummenfelt, Van Riel and Léo Bergère; with Blummenfelt winning the final sprint to become the first man to win the World Triathlon Championship Series and Olympics in the same year. Bérgère narrowly won the silver, while Van Riel earned bronze. All three athletes finished within a second of each other.\nWomen.\nFlora Duffy entered the grand final with enough of a gap over nearest competitors in the series standings, with Taylor Spivey in second place and Maya Kingma only 9 points behind in third. Duffy was the early race leader in the swim, although she was overtaken by Taylor Knibb on the second lap. Knibb was joined by Kingma coming into the first transition, while Spivey caught up to them at the start of the bike. However, Knibb broke away from the rest of the field and build a 34-second lead over the chasers at the end of the first lap, and continued to steadily increase the gap over the course of the race. By the time she started the run, Knibb earned a 2:43 lead over the nearest chasers, and held her position all the way to the finish. Léonie Périault, who was in the chase pack for majority of the race, pulled away from the group to claim silver. Duffy only needed to finish in the top eight in order to win the series, and secured her title by earning the bronze. She became the first athlete to win the World Triathlon Championship Series and Olympics within the same year, similar to Blummenfelt, who claimed his series title not too long after.\nOverall standings.\nIn the individual events, the athlete who accumulates the most points throughout the season is declared the year's world champion.

        "title": "Joe Hall (American football)",
        "text": "Joe Luther Hall Jr. (born November 3, 1979) is an American football administrator, coach, and former fullback / running back who is currently the director of football student-athlete development for the Kansas State Wildcats. After attending Artesia High School in California, he played college football at Palomar College and Kansas State, leading the former to the national junior college championship as a sophomore. At Kansas State, Hall spent three seasons, redshirting one, being described at over 300 pounds \"the largest running back to ever rush for 100 yards in an NCAA game\" by \"Sports Illustrated\". Following his time at Kansas State, he spent several seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Chiefs, and Oakland Raiders as well as in NFL Europe with the Rhein Fire.\nEarly life and education.\nHall was born on November 3, 1979, in Compton, California. Weighing 265 pounds by high school, he played football, baseball, and basketball at Artesia High School. He had not played football before joining Artesia, but was able to convince the coaches to allow him to play running back and scored 35 touchdowns on the junior varsity team. \"I was bigger and faster than everybody,\" he said. \"I'd just take the ball and run until someone stopped me. At my size, no one wanted to tackle me.\" As a senior, despite playing in only seven games, Hall managed to run for 1,997 yards and 30 touchdowns.\nIn basketball, Hall was an All-CIF Southern Section player. In baseball, he was an All-American as an outfielder and in 1997, Hall was drafted in the 29th round (865th overall) of the Major League Baseball draft by the Detroit Tigers. He declined the offer to be in the Tigers' farm system, stating he wanted to play college football and baseball. When Hall tried to join a four-year school, he failed to fully qualify academically, which revealed his \"biggest weakness,\" according to the \"North County Times\", which Hall stated was \"staying focused on and off the field. I get bored.\"\nPalomar College.\nRather than sit out for a year at a four-year school, Hall decided to enroll at Palomar College, a junior college and thus two-year institution, in 1997. He was 280 pounds upon joining Palomar, but near the end of his first football season \"got bored\" and began eating, going up to 290 pounds for the team's bowl game. He finished his freshman season with 733 rushing yards, good enough to be named the team's most valuable player.\nHall had his best collegiate season as a sophomore in 1998, leading Palomar to the national championship with an 11–1 record while setting school records for single-season rushing yards (1,647) and single-game rushing yards, being named first-team All-American by the J. C. Grid Wire as well as the California Offensive Player of the Year. What made his rushing totals \"even more impressive,\" according to the \"North County Times\", was the fact that Palomar was a pass-heavy team, although their coach admitted that Hall \"made us adjust.\"\nAmong his notable performances in the 1998 season were games against Mt. San Antonio College, the defending national champion, where he ran 42 times for 187 yards and two scores in an upset victory; City College of San Francisco, where he scored two touchdowns to win the state and national championship; Pasadena Junior College, where he ran for 246 yards and three touchdowns; and Saddleback College, where he set the all-time school record with 261 rushing yards. Hall finished his two-year stint at Palomar as holder of the all-time team record for career rushing, having gained 2,437 yards, a record that still stands.\nKansas State University.\nHall was recruited by many NCAA Division I schools, although some of them wanted to change his position to blocker or the defensive line, each of which he rejected as he said he didn't want to become \"a glorified offensive lineman.\" As signing day approached, Hall narrowed down his offers to the Kansas State University Wildcats, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Rebels, and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Rainbow Warriors. He had verbally committed to Kansas State, but then at the last minute, the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans \"made a hard run\" at him. Although Hall had stated USC was his \"dream school,\" he opted to remain at Kansas State, saying \"I gave my word to Kansas State, and your word has to mean something.\"\nHall later said that the Kansas State coaching staff had promised he would not be a blocker on the football team. When he arrived for practice weighing 310 pounds, he was asked to learn how to become a lead blocker. Believing he was misled (\"I grew up in a house where if somebody told me they were going to do something, they did it,\" he said), Hall \"rebelled\" against the staff and as a result, became the third-string at his position.\nEventually accepting his position as a fullback, Hall made his debut against Temple in the season-opener and ran for 22 yards. He ran for 12 yards in their second game, against UTEP, before recording 39 yards and a touchdown against Iowa State the following week. Following injuries to David Allen and Frank Murphy, Hall became the top back for Kansas State's game against Utah State. In his first game as the main back, Hall ran for 195 yards and scored two touchdowns, helping the Wildcats win and hold Utah State scoreless, 40–0. Afterwards, \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote about Hall and described him as \"the largest running back to ever rush for 100 yards in an NCAA game.\"\nBeing heralded as the \"biggest tailback in America,\" Hall recorded his second consecutive 100-yard game the following week versus Oklahoma State, gaining 112 yards on 27 carries. Against Baylor in their next game, Hall made his third straight 100-yard performance, gaining 109 in the win. Hall ran for 50 yards on 18 attempts against Colorado, but then was ordered to appear in court for municipal alcohol infractions and missed the game against Nebraska.\nBy this point in the season, Hall had run for 603 yards, leading the team. He only ran for 10 combined yards in the final two games, finishing the season with 613 rushing yards and six touchdowns, still good enough to lead the team, in addition to three receptions for 39 yards. In the classroom, Hall reportedly had \"sub-par\" grades, including several classes that were marked as \"incomplete,\" and in January 2000 Hall dropped out and became academically ineligible to play football. Although his coach announced he was \"making progress toward regaining his eligibility\" in April, Hall ended up missing spring practice and in July was ruled out for the 2000 season.\nWhile not playing football in 2000 and early 2001, Hall got into legal trouble multiple times: in June 2000, he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon; in November 2000, he was convicted for falsely reporting a crime; and in March 2001, he was convicted for driving on a suspended license. Later, with the help of coach Bill Snyder, Hall learned \"accountability\" and changed, saying that his past actions were \"a childish act ... [but] I'm not a child anymore ... I'm past it.\" He worked on getting back eligibility and eventually was able to make the team, making his return in the second game of the season, where he ran for 30 yards in a 64–0 win against New Mexico State.\nHall saw limited action as a runner and was mainly used as a blocker in 2001, only rushing for 251 yards on 39 carries (a 6.4 yards-per-carry average) while scoring three touchdowns. He had one of his best games against Louisiana Tech on November 17, running three times for 81 yards and a touchdown, including a 61-yard rush where he was downed at the one-yard-line, the longest rush of the season for Kansas State. He finished his two-season stint at Kansas State with 160 carries for 864 yards, scoring nine touchdowns while averaging 5.4 yards per carry.\nProfessional career.\nAlthough Hall had weighed up to 340 pounds during his time at Kansas State, he dropped his weight down to 277 for the start of his National Football League (NFL) career. He went unselected in the 2002 NFL Draft, but afterwards was signed by the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted free agent. He was released before the start of training camp. Afterwards, Hall decided to re-enroll at Kansas State to finish his studies, as he had not yet received a degree. He was promised that \"if he demonstrated any maturity and finished up his classwork, [coach Bill] Snyder would use his connections to get Hall another NFL tryout.\"\nHall finished his education in April 2003, and immediately after signed a contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. Upon joining the Chiefs, he weighed 318 pounds as a fullback, being described by head coach Dick Vermeil as \"catch[ing] my eye every time I come onto the field.\" Although Hall impressed in training camp and in preseason, he ended up being released at the final roster cuts on September 1. He was later brought back as a member of the practice squad. Hall spent the entire 2003 season as a practice squad player, as the Chiefs went 13–3 in the regular season, before losing to the Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs.\nHall was released by Kansas City in June 2004. He was later brought back in the offseason of . He was assigned to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, where he appeared in four games, each as a starter, and recorded a touchdown and eight receptions for 66 yards. Upon returning to the Chiefs, he was placed on the injured reserve list. Hall was a member of the Oakland Raiders, his final team, in , being placed on injured reserve in August before being released with a settlement in September.\nLater life.\nAfter his playing career, Hall became a coach for the MidAmerica Nazarene Pioneers of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), serving three seasons as wide receivers coach and two as a graduate assistant. Following his time at MidAmerica Nazarene, he began working off-the-field as a counselor and behavior interventionist at multiple northeastern Kansas schools, such as Topeka West High School and Junction City High School.\nIn 2015, Hall was inducted into the California Community Colleges Football Association Hall of Fame. The following year, he was inducted into the Palomar College Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2019, he was hired by his alma mater, Kansas State, to serve as director of football student-athlete development. In this position, Hall \"creates, develops and implements a student-athlete development program,\" which \"fosters an environment of well-being and achievement.\" He is also the liaison of the football team to several school support areas, including the athletic trainers, sport psychologists, and strength and conditioning coaches, in addition to the liaison between the Wildcats and university and community organizations.\nHall received a bachelor's degree from Kansas State in 2012, a master's of science from MidAmerica Nazarene in 2015, and a master's in school counseling from Kansas State in 2017. As of 2022, Hall is working on earning a doctorate in organizational leadership.\nWith his wife, Hollie, Hall has four children, including Joe III, who currently plays at Kansas State. Hall published a book, titled \"Pay for Play: High Stake and Mental State\", which he described as his \"pseudo-autobiography,\" in 2022."

Since they have won three national championships in 1996, 2000, and 2018. The Wildcat Women have also had four individual national champions with Susan Slaughter in (1990), Annika Sörenstam in (1991), Marisa Baena in (1996) and Jenna Daniels in (2000). \nOn August 4, 2023, Arizona announced it would join the Big 12 Conference along with Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah beginning in the 2024-25 academic year.\nMembers of the Wildcat women's program have gone on to success on the LPGA Tour, led by 8-time LPGA Player of the Year Annika Sörenstam and 4-time LPGA Player of the Year Lorena Ochoa. Sörenstam is regarded as one of the best female golfers in history. Before stepping away from competitive golf at the end of the 2008 season, she had won 90 international tournaments as a professional, making her the female golfer with the most wins to her name. She has won 72 official LPGA Tour tournaments including ten majors and 18 other tournaments internationally, and she tops the LPGA's career money list with earnings of over $22 million—over $2 million ahead of her nearest rival while playing 187 fewer events.

Sörenstam also was captain of the 2017 European Solheim Cup team. In 2003, Sörenstam played in the Bank of America Colonial tournament to become the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since 1945.\nLorena Ochoa was the top-ranked female golfer in the world for 158 consecutive and total weeks (both are LPGA Tour records), from April 23, 2007, to her retirement on May 2, 2010, at the age of 28 years old.

Between 2006 and 2014, there was an increase of over 25% in the number of cycle journeys being made in the county's urban areas.\nAs part of the South Yorkshire Active Travel Fund, the four boroughs of Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham have invested in the construction of several new cycling infrastructure projects, including cycle paths, and integrated and segregated cycle lanes.\nCommuter cycling.\nAn increasing number of roads in South Yorkshire are being paralleled by segregated cycle lanes, such as in Penistone Road, Bennetthorpe and Sheffield Road. This is intended to discourage commuters from using private cars, and instead cycle. It is also hoped that it will improve air quality in towns and cities by taking cars off the road.\nLeisure cycling.\nThe Trans Pennine Trail, a 215-mile-long national route for recreation and transport, connecting Southport, Merseyside on the west coast to Hornsea, East Yorkshire on the east coast, passes through South Yorkshire. It is used primarily for leisure cycling rather than commuter cycling as it often does not take direct routes and is unpaved in some stretches.\nThe main east–west route passes through Penistone, Dodworth, Worsbrough, Wombwell, \nManvers, Harlington, Sprotbrough, Cusworth, Bentley, Thorpe in Balne, Braithwaite and Sykehouse. A north–south extension connects Royston, Cudworth, Stairfoot, Elsecar, Wentworth, Tankersley, the Meadowhall shopping centre and Beighton.\nSouth Yorkshire hosts numerous parks, forests, lakes and reserves that can be enjoyed by bike."

        "text": "Jordan Harris (born July 7, 2000) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the third round, 71st overall, by the Canadiens in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nHarris was born on July 7, 2000, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, to Ginny and Peter Harris, a nurse and physical therapist, and is both biracial and Jewish. As of March 2024 he was the only Black Jewish player in the NHL. His father played ice hockey for UMass Lowell, and Jordan almost became a goaltender like his father and older brother Elijah, but he \"liked being able to skate and play out of the net too much\", so he became a defenseman. \nHe attended Haverhill High School for one year before transferring to Kimball Union Academy, a boarding school in New Hampshire. In his three years at Kimball, Harris had 18 goals and 64 assists in 111 games, and he was the team's captain during the 2017–18 season. That season, he had six goals and 29 assists in 37 games and was also a star on Kimball's lacrosse team. Harris also played five games with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League during their 2017–18 season.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nThe Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Harris in the third round, 71st overall, of the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. At the time of the draft, he had committed to playing college ice hockey at Northeastern. He was joined at Northeastern by another prospect in the Canadiens organization, goaltender Cayden Primeau. Harris picked up his first collegiate goal on October 13, 2018, opening the scoring for Northeastern in their 5–0 shutout win over Sacred Heart. Harris had one goal and 12 assists in 39 games during his freshman season with Northeastern, which won both the 2019 Beanpot and the 2019 Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nHarris collected a point at least once in the first four games of Northeastern's 2019–20 season, doubling his goals total from the previous season. By the Huskies' holiday break, he had established himself as a playmaker for the team, with three goals and 13 points through 18 games, fifth among Hockey East defensemen. Harris won the 2020 Beanpot for Northeastern in double overtime, breaking their 4–4 tie against Boston University to give the Huskies their third title in a row. Harris's sophomore season came to a premature end due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Huskies presented him with the Unsung Hero Award for his accomplishments. He finished the season with three goals and 21 points while averaging between 25 and 30 minutes of time on ice per night.\nThe Huskies named Harris an alternate captain for the team's 2020–21 season. His performance in the first half of the season won praise from sportswriters who were impressed by his hockey IQ, and he was named the Hockey East Player of the Week on December 14 after scoring two goals and three assists in Northeastern's opening-weekend sweep of Merrimack. With six goals and 19 points for the season, third in the conference, Harris was a semifinalist for the Walter Brown Award, a Hobey Baker Award finalist, and he was named to the Hockey East Second All-Star Team. Harris declined to sign with the Canadiens after his junior year, fueling speculation that he would attempt to become an unrestricted free agent after graduating, but he told reporters that he was more invested in finishing his degree.\nThe Huskies named Harris their captain for the 2021–22 season. He was named the Hockey East Defender of the Week on November 1 after scoring one goal and recording three assists in a two-game sweep of Maine. In his senior season, Harris scored five goals and 20 points in 38 games. This included five goals and 14 points in 20 conference games, for which Harris was named both a Hockey East First Team All-Star and the conference's Best Defensive Defenseman. He finished his collegiate career with 15 goals and 73 points in 130 games across four seasons.\nProfessional.\nShortly after the end of his college hockey career, Harris signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the Canadiens and joined them for the end of their season. He debuted with the team on April 2, 2022, finishing the game with a plus–minus rating of +1 with three blocked shots in Montreal's 5–4 shootout win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. Playing ten games with the Canadiens to close out the season, he scored his first NHL goal in the April 29 season-ending game against the Florida Panthers. The Canadiens won the game 10–2.\nInternational play.\nHarris represented the United States internationally at the 2020 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in the Czech Republic. He scored his first goal of the tournament on the second day, taking a pass from Trevor Zegras to tie Team USA 1–1 against Germany; the US took the game in a 6–3 victory. The US team was eliminated during the semifinals with a 1–0 loss to Finland, the first time they failed to advance to the medal round since 2015. In five games, Harris scored one goal and finished with a +4 plus-minus.\nPersonal life.\nHarris's brother Elijah is also a hockey player. After goaltending at Austin Preparatory School, he enrolled at Endicott College to play for the Gulls. Harris and his family are Black, and they have spoken about the challenges experienced by Black hockey players. Speaking at a screening of the documentary Black Ice, he said \"I’m really proud of my heritage and the way I grew up. I feel extremely lucky to have been raised the way I was; biracial and Jewish, and raised to love hockey for what it is.\""

        "title": "Cheating in esports",
        "text": "Cheating in esports is a deliberate violation of the rules of an esports governing body or other behavior that is intended to give an unfair advantage to a player or team. At its core, esports are video game competitions in an organized, competitive environment. Tournaments often pay out prize money to the highest placing teams in these events, giving players an incentive to cheat. Commonly cited instances of cheating include the use of software cheats, such as aimbots and wallhacks, exploitation of bugs, use of performance-enhancing drugs, such as Ritalin and Adderall, and match fixing.\nUnlike traditional sports, esports may not be recognized as official sports in many countries, leading to a lack of standardized regulations. Additionally, video game developers and individual tournament organizers may have differing approaches to enforcement, leading to inconsistencies in handling cheating incidents. Several global governing bodies, such as the Esports Integrity Commission, have made efforts to establish and enforce integrity policies, but they have largely been unsuccessful.\nBackground.\nEsports involve professional teams competing in organized, competitive video games. Similar to traditional sports, these professional esports players are often signed by esports organizations to participate in leagues and tournaments. Various video game genres are associated with esports, including first-person shooters, multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), and sports video games. Some esports events attract millions of viewers, with fans having the option to watch live broadcasts on platforms like Twitch and ESPN, or attend the events in person at arenas. Substantial prize money is awarded to the top-performing teams in these tournaments. For instance, in 2021, \"Dota 2\" The International featured a prize pool exceeding . Given the potential for significant financial gain, players may be tempted to resort to cheating.\nEsports specific regulation.\nIn contrast to traditional major league sports like FIFA for association football and NFL for American football, esports lacks centralization under a single governing body. Unlike these sports leagues, which are self-regulated and guided by established statutes, case law, and national or state regulations, esports operates with a considerable degree of autonomy. The absence of widespread recognition of esports as an official sport in many countries poses challenges for implementing comprehensive regulation. Consequently, the responsibility of rule-setting in esports tournaments usually falls to the individual organizers, with their guidelines subject to approval from the respective video game developers.\nEsports competitions are regulated by two main types of entities: game-neutral and game-specific organizations. The game-neutral entities, such as the World Esports Association (WESA), the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC), the International Esports Federation (IESF), and the Electronic Sports League (ESL), are responsible for enforcing policies across various esports titles. Despite their efforts to regulate the esports industry, they have faced challenges in achieving comprehensive success. As of 2019, ESIC emerged as the leading regulatory body, dedicated to enforcing ethical standards in esports. However, it is not universally adopted, as participation in ESIC is optional for leagues and organizations. ESIC considers software cheats, online attacks, match-fixing, and doping as the most significant forms of cheating. On the other hand, game-specific entities focus solely on a single esports title and are typically controlled by the respective game's publisher. Prominent examples of such entities include the Overwatch League, the League of Legends Championship Series, and the Call of Duty League.\nTypes of cheating.\nCheating in esports can be broadly categorized into two types: cheating to win and cheating to lose. Cheating to win involves attempting to gain an unfair advantage over opponents through illegitimate means. Common forms include using software cheats, online attacks, and doping. Cheating to lose refers to intentionally underperforming or losing a match, usually for financial gain. It can be achieved through actions like match fixing, corrupting officials, spot-fixing, and manipulating tournament structures.\nCheating to win.\nSoftware cheats.\nOne prevalent form of cheating in esports involves the use of unauthorized software, commonly known as software cheats. These cheats provide players with an unfair advantage over their opponents, compromising the integrity of the competition. One notable type of software cheat is the aimbot, a program designed to automatically target opponents with superior speed and accuracy compared to human capabilities. Esports servers commonly employ built-in anti-cheat software to detect and prevent the use of these illicit practices. However, some sophisticated cheats may still evade detection.\nAn illustrative example of a player utilizing software assistance is the case of \"Counter-Strike\" (\"CS\") player XektoR. During German ESL Pro Series online matches in 2008, XektoR exhibited exceptional performance. However, during in-person events, his gameplay performance significantly declined. Upon reviewing replay data analytics, ESL members discovered evidence of XektoR using an aimbot and wallhacks during the online matches, resulting in a two-year ban for the player. Following this ban, XektoR's team took ESL to the District Court of Cologne. While the court did not make a statement on whether XektoR cheated or not, they deemed the measures taken by ESL as appropriate.\nSoftware cheats are not limited to online play alone. In another instance, during the Extremesland Zowie Asia \"CS:GO\" 2018 tournament in Shanghai, player Nikhil \"Forsaken\" Kumawat was caught using an aimbot. As the tournament administrator approached Forsaken to examine his computer, he attempted to dismiss the administrator and quickly delete the hack to avoid detection. As a result, his team, OpTic India, was disqualified from the event, and the team disbanded entirely. After a comprehensive review of Kumawat's play from a previous tournament, the India Premiership Fall Finals, ESL India found conclusive evidence of cheating in both events, leading to a five-year ban by ESIC.\nHardware cheats.\nTournament organizers often impose restrictions on the type of hardware that players are allowed to use during esports events. While many tournaments permit players to bring their own mouse and keyboard, this allowance creates the potential for unauthorized equipment to be used. \nFor instance, during \"Dota 2\" event The International 2018, the Peruvian team Thunder Predator faced disqualification after it was discovered that one of their players, Atún, had programmed macro commands into his mouse during a qualifying match on June 19, 2018. The tournament organizer, FACEIT, deemed the use of a programmable mouse equivalent to running a software script, leading to the disqualification of Thunder Predator from the competition.\nHardware cheats extend beyond mice and keyboards. In another incident involving \"CS:GO\", a player known as Ra1f was caught using a hardware cheat in 2018. Ra1f used a technique that involved connecting a second computer to his main computer, bypassing the anti-cheat technology employed by the ESEA league. This hardware cheat allowed him to gain an unfair advantage by revealing the positions of all his opponents during matches.\nBug exploitation.\nSoftware bugs are an unavoidable occurrence in most video games. Some individuals or teams may exploit these bugs to gain an unfair advantage over their opponents. While most esports integrity policies strictly prohibit intentional bug exploitation, the unintentional use of a bug may be tolerated under certain circumstances.\n\"CS:GO\" has witnessed several instances of intentional bug abuse. For example, in a match at DreamHack Winter 2014, team Fnatic exploited bugs that enabled them to stand on invisible ledges, see through solid objects, and even become invulnerable to damage. As the latter two exploits were in direct violation of the tournament organizer's rules, Fnatic's actions resulted in the match being forced to replay. However, the team ultimately decided to forfeit instead. Similarly, during the , team BIG utilized a bug that allowed them to peek their heads over a wall without revealing their position on the other side. Although BIG was not penalized by the tournament organizers, the exploit's legitimacy sparked controversy over its sportsmanship. After the match, the remaining teams in the tournament agreed to a gentleman's agreement to refrain from exploiting the bug in future matches.\nBug exploits are typically executed by players, but one of the most significant bug abuse scandals in esports was the \"Counter-Strike\" coaching bug scandal. In August 2020, ESL banned three coaches who had taken advantage of a bug that allowed them to see parts of the map they should not have had access to during matches. Following further investigations, the ESIC imposed sanctions on 37 coaches in September, resulting in bans ranging from five to 36 months. In May 2022, ESIC issued nearly 100 new sanctions, further penalizing individuals involved in the spectator bug exploitation scandal.\nDoping.\nSimilar to doping in traditional sports, the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) has become a concerning issue in esports, particularly involving nootropics such as Ritalin and Adderall. Some countries have regulations that restrict the use of PEDs. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), in compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code (WADA), maintains a list of restricted substances that includes Ritalin, but as of 2019, Adderall was not on the list. India's National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) adheres to the same restricted list as WADA. However, it remains uncertain whether the regulations of USADA or NADA are directly applicable to esports athletes.\nIn 2015, the issue of Adderall use in the professional \"CS:GO\" scene came to light when Kory \"Semphis\" Friesen, a professional \"CS:GO\" player, openly acknowledged that nearly all players were using the drug. In response, the ESL implemented anti-doping policies similar to those in cycling and the Olympics by August 2015. However, questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of these regulations since certain PEDs, like Adderall, may not remain detectable in a player's system for an extended period. In 2016, ESL reported no players testing positive for PEDs, but doubts persist about whether the policies truly deter such practices. A 2020 investigation by the \"Washington Post\" revealed that the use of Adderall had been an \"open secret in the esports community for years\". Despite this knowledge, many leagues neither conduct drug testing nor explicitly prohibit the use of such drugs in esports competitions.\nGhosting.\nGhosting refers to the act of a player or team obtaining external information during a match from sources outside of the official game environment, such as stream viewers or the live audience. One notable incident of ghosting took place during a match between Azubu Frost and Team SoloMid at the 2012 \"League of Legends\" World Championship. In the midst of the match, a player from Frost appeared to glance at the spectator screens, enabling him to gain insight into the positions of his opponents. Riot Games investigated the incident and decided to uphold the match's outcome, stating that the incident did not significantly impact the game's result. However, they imposed a $30,000 fine on Azubu Frost for the infraction. Furthermore, Riot examined four other instances of potential screen watching during the World Championship and determined that none of them affected match outcomes.\nAnother notable occurrence of ghosting transpired at the 2019 \"Fortnite\" World Cup Finals. During the event, player Mark \"Letw1k3\" Danilov was observed looking at the spectator screen, which was strictly forbidden by the World Cup rules. Danilov received multiple warnings before eventually being disqualified and removed from the match.\nOnline attacks.\nWhile some esports events are held in live stadiums with an audience, numerous qualifying matches and knockout stages take place online. During these online competitions, players and teams may encounter online attacks, commonly known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In such attacks, the perpetrator directs a massive influx of traffic to disrupt a player's internet connection, leading to significant lag that renders the game unplayable for the affected player.\nOne notable incident took place in 2015 during a \"League of Legends\" European Challenger Series match between Denial Esports and Dignitas. A player from Denial experienced a DDoS attack during the match, which forced the team to pause the game. Despite the player's efforts to relocate to different locations to resume the match, they were repeatedly targeted with DDoS attacks, making it impossible to continue. Consequently, Denial Esports had to forfeit the match after surpassing the maximum pause duration of ten minutes.\nCheating to lose.\nMatch fixing.\nMatch fixing in esports shares similarities with match fixing in traditional sports and occurs when a team or player intentionally underperforms or loses a match to gain illicit profits, often through betting fraud. This practice is commonly associated with gambling and betting markets. In the United States, several laws and statutes exist to penalize bribery, gambling, and match fixing in traditional sports, such as the Wire Act of 1961 and the Sports Bribery Act of 1964. However, the application of these acts to esports remains uncertain, as the recognition of esports as a sport in the traditional sense varies among different jurisdictions.\nThe first major incident of match fixing in esports occurred in 2010 when the Korea e-Sports Association (KeSPA), an organization managing esports in South Korea, permanently banned 11 \"StarCraft\" players and imposed fines after finding them guilty of match fixing. Some of the players involved also faced legal consequences and were sentenced to jail. Another \"StarCraft\" match-fixing scandal emerged in 2016, where \"StarCraft II\" World Champion Lee \"Life\" Seung-hyun admitted to receiving approximately $62,000 to deliberately lose two matches in May 2015. As a consequence, he received a lifetime ban from KeSPA and faced imprisonment. One of the largest match fixing scandals in esports occurred when South Korean authorities arrested 12 individuals, including three players, involved in five fixed \"StarCraft II\" matches in October 2015.\nThe \"Counter-Strike\" match fixing scandal in 2015 involving iBUYPOWER and NetCodeGuides was one of the most notable instances in esports. It was revealed that iBUYPOWER deliberately lost a match against NetCodeGuides in August 2014. As a result, seven players were banned from participating in future Valve-sponsored events.\nSpot fixing.\nSpot fixing is a form of match manipulation similar to match fixing, but instead of fixing the outcome of an entire match, it involves manipulating specific parts or moments of the game. This is often done in coordination with proposition bet or specific in-game events that can be targeted for illicit gains. In May 2022, allegations of spot fixing emerged against the \"CS:GO\" team PARTY regarding a match that took place during the StarLadder Regional Minor Championship CIS closed qualifier in 2015.\nStructural tournament manipulation.\nStructural tournament manipulation is a form of cheating in esports where teams deliberately underperform or manipulate their performance to take advantage of the specific structure or format of a tournament. The goal is to strategically position themselves for a more favorable outcome in subsequent stages of the competition. This type of cheating is relatively uncommon in esports, but one notable occurrence of structural tournament manipulation took place during the \"Counter-Strike\" match fixing scandal in 2014 involving the teams iBUYPOWER and NetCodeGuides."

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 20th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self. Kansas finished first in the Big 12 in the regular season. The Jayhawks qualified for the NCAA tournament but lost in the 2nd round.\nSeason summary.\nOn November 2, 2022, Kansas announced that Self and assistant coach Kurtis Townsend would serve a four-game suspension for alleged recruiting violations from a 2017 FBI probe. Assistant coach Norm Roberts served as acting head coach during the suspension. Roberts would serve as acting head again during the Big 12 and NCAA Tournaments while Self was out following a procedure on his heart.\nIn January, the Jayhawks lost to Kansas State, TCU, and Baylor for what is only their 4th 3 game losing streak under Self, and only the 11th losing streak of any length. Kansas finished the regular season 25–6, their 33rd consecutive 20+ win season and their 38th in the previous 39 seasons. After defeating Texas Tech on February 28, the Jayhawks clinched the Big 12 title, their 21st regular season Big 12 title and their 64th regular season conference title.

In turn, the Jayhawks were undefeated against unranked teams. They also went undefeated against quadrant 2, 3, and 4 teams with a combined 10–0 record in those quads. They also finished the season with 17 quadrant 1 wins, the most in the nation. Redshirt junior forward Jalen Wilson was named First Team All-American by the AP.\nThe Jayhawks qualified for the NCAA tournament with an at-large bid. It was the Jayhawks NCAA record extending 33rd consecutive and their 51st in program history. They won their first round game over Howard 96–68, extending their first round winning streak to 16 straight. They would lose in the second round to Arkansas 71–72 marking the third time in their last four tournament appearances they failed to make the Sweet 16.\nOffseason.\nPlayers graduated.\nBelow are players who ran out of eligibility or seniors that did not declare intent for a 5th year as allowed by the NCAA due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEntered NBA draft.\nPlayers listed below are underclassmen who have entered the 2022 NBA draft.

On April 5, 2022, the school announced that they were promoting all of their varsity programs to Division I for the 2022–23 academic year.\nHistory.\nStonehill began playing varsity hockey in 1978 joining ECAC 3, the lowest level of college hockey at the time. They remained with the conference through its various rebrandings and member changes for over 30 years. During that time the team was not successful, posting just 4 winning seasons in its first 22 campaigns and never making a single postseason appearance.\nThe program's fortunes began to change in 2000 when former NHL player Scott Harlow was hired to coach the team. During his seven-year tenure, the club recorded three winning seasons, its first postseason victories, and captured its first conference championship. While Harlow was in charge, the program was also going through a transitional phase. After the Division II level of college hockey collapsed in 1984, there was no place for nominally D-II programs to play. When the NCAA began offering automatic bids to the Division III Tournament in 1999, it came with a caveat; programs could not participate in postseason play if their school participated at a higher level. Because Stonehill was a D-II school, they were frozen out of the reformatted ECAC Northeast tournament. However, since they were not alone in their plight, Stonehill banded together with four other programs and began holding a separate D-II tournament at the end of the season. This arrangement continued until 2009 when all of the active Division II programs founded the ice hockey division of the Northeast-10.\nStonehill fell on hard times after Harlow left in 2007. Six years later, upon the arrival of David Borges, the team suddenly shot up the standings and won three consecutive regular season titles. While the Skyhawks weren't able to sustain that pace forever, Borges help steer the program though the lost 2021 season and was behind the bench when the school announced that they were promoting all of their varsity programs to D-I in April 2022.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "The 2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage began on 6 September 2022 and ended on 2 November 2022. A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.\nEintracht Frankfurt made their debut appearance in the group stage, which was their first appearance in the European Cup since their loss in the 1960 final, after winning the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League. This was thus the first time that five German clubs played in the group stage.\nA total of 15 national associations were represented in the group stage. This season was the first since the 1995–96 season in which a Turkish side failed to qualify for the group stage. It was also the first time since the 2007–08 season that two Scottish sides qualified for the group stage.\nThis year's Champions league featured both the eventual Champions league winners; Manchester City and Europa League winners, Sevilla in the same group (Group G)\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 25 August 2022, 18:00 CEST (19:00 TRT), in Istanbul, Turkey. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\nTeams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public. Each team would not play more than two home matches or two away matches in a row, and would play one home match and one away match on the first and last matchdays (Regulations Article 16.02). This arrangement was different from previous seasons, where the same two teams would play at home on the first and last matchdays.\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\nNotes\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\nTiebreakers.\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 17 Equality of points – group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Champions League):\nDue to the abolition of the away goals rule, head-to-head away goals were no longer applied as a tiebreaker starting from last season. However, total away goals were still applied as a tiebreaker.\nGroups.\nThe fixtures were announced on 27 August 2022, two days after the draw. The matches were played on 6–7 September, 13–14 September, 4–5 October, 11–12 October, 25–26 October and 1–2 November 2022. The scheduled kick-off times were 18:45 (two matches on each day) and 21:00 (remaining six matches) CET/CEST.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses)."

        "title": "2022–23 United Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The 2022–23 United Rugby Championship was the 22nd season of the professional rugby union competition United Rugby Championship. It began on 16 September 2022 and ended on 27 May 2023. For sponsorship reasons it was known in South Africa as Vodacom United Rugby Championship or Vodacom URC, while in the Northern Hemisphere it was known as the BKT United Rugby Championship or BKT URC.\nThe final which was held on 27 May 2023 was between defending champions the Stormers and Munster with Munster winning 19–14.\nFormat.\nThe tournament consists of 21 rounds; 18 rounds of regular season play, followed by three rounds of play-offs.\nThere are four regional pools: The Irish Shield pool (featuring the four Irish teams), the Welsh Shield pool (featuring the four Welsh teams), the South African Shield pool (featuring the four South African teams) and the Scottish/Italian 'Azzurri/Blue' Shield pool (featuring the two Italian and two Scottish sides). The pools serve three functions; they guarantee a full slate of derby matches for each team, they are the primary route for qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup, and they award a minor Regional Shield trophy to the top team in each pool, which thereby functions as a national championship in three of the four pools, and a cross-border regional championship in the Scottish-Italian pool.\nTeams play six matches against their regional pool rivals home and away. The remaining twelve matches are made up by a single round robin, consisting of an even number of six home and six away matches against all the sides from the other pools.\nFor the Championship itself, there is only one main league table (the conference system used in previous Pro14 years has been dropped). The top eight sides in the table will qualify for the quarter finals, followed by semi-finals and a grand final, with teams seeded 1 to 4 with home advantage for the lowest seeded side. The Regional Shield pools have no direct link to the play-offs and by extension the Championship itself, and it is technically possible to win a Regional Shield but not contest the play-offs, as the Welsh sides showed in 2023.\nA total of eight sides will qualify for the following season's European Rugby Champions Cup, but by a slightly different distribution method than the play-offs, while the remaining eight sides will qualify for the EPCR Challenge Cup. All points won in the competition contributed to rankings in the regional pools, with the top side in each regional pool automatically qualifying for the European Rugby Champions Cup. The remaining four places then go to (if not already qualified) the winners of the URC, the European Champions Cup and the European Challenge Cup, (if either or both of the European champions is a URC team that is not already qualified as URC Champion or URC Regional Shield winner) followed then by the highest ranked teams in the main table (who haven't already qualified by other means). A similar format was used to determine playoff contenders in the Super Rugby competition.\nRegional Pools and European qualification.\nThe Regional pools of the regular season are the primary mechanism by which teams qualify for European competition, with the 'winner' of each regional pool guaranteed qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup, ensuring at least one South African, one Welsh and one Irish side qualify for the premier European competition. As Scotland and Italy are sharing a single regional pool, at least one team from those two countries combined is also guaranteed entry, but neither country individually is so guaranteed. The remaining four places will be awarded to those with the four best overall regular season records, regardless of which pool they take part in. As such, it is possible that a team will qualify for the ERCC without reaching the URC play-offs by topping its pool, but finishing ninth or lower overall. If the club that wins the URC championship has not qualified for the Champions Cup on the above criteria, it will qualify instead of the last of the qualified teams that did not win its pool. The same will apply if a URC team wins the 2022-2023 Champions Cup or Challenge Cup and qualifies for the 2023-2024 Champions Cup without having qualified by its league position.\nPriority order for European Champions Cup Qualification is therefore :\nIn theory, a team as high as third overall could therefore fail to qualify for the Champions Cup if it fails to win any of the four available titles (URC, its Regional Shield, Champions or Challenge Cup), and they are all won by much lower ranked URC teams, while the team in last place, if it wins a European competition, can qualify for the following year's Champions Cup. In practice, a team may qualify from an overall 9th or 10th position as the shield winner in a weak regional pool, but the emphasis on derby matches, and the points available in them, tend to ensure that the lowest placed shield winner cannot finish lower than tenth.\nAll 16 teams, however, are guaranteed entry into one of the two competitions. The lowest a team can finish overall while winning its URC shield and qualifying for the Champions Cup is thirteenth.\nThe following teams have therefore confirmed their qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2023-24 season as URC Champions:\nThe following teams have confirmed their qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2023-24 season upon winning their URC Regional Shield:\nAs no URC team won a European trophy (Leinster and Glasgow being runners up in the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup respectively), the reserved places for the winners of those competitions is ignored.\nThe overall champion and four shield winners are therefore joined by the following teams, who claim the final three places in the Champions Cup:\nAs Cardiff, the URC Welsh shield winner, sit below eighth in the overall standings, the eighth placed team, Sharks, could not qualify by League standings, despite finishing in eighth place. By losing their URC quarter-final, Sharks were therefore the eighth and final team eliminated from contention for a spot in the 2023-24 European Rugby Champions Cup.\nUlster Rugby, Munster Rugby and Bulls qualified through their league placings at the end of the regular season. Connacht also qualified for the European Rugby Champions Cup by league placing following the elimination of Sharks, the only remaining team that could deny them the final spot by winning the URC Championship.\nMunster 'upgraded' their qualification route by winning the URC Championship itself, which technically takes priority over league placing (or winning the Regional Shield), but as they had already secured the place through league placing, it did not materially alter the overall list of qualifiers.\nZebre Parma, Dragons, Scarlets, Ospreys, Edinburgh Rugby, Benetton, Lions and Sharks have qualified for the European Rugby Challenge Cup for 2023-24. For the second season, only the Welsh Shield winner gains Champions Cup qualification from among the Welsh sides, and no Italian side qualify for the Champions Cup.\nURC League standings.\nThe overall United Rugby Championship table is the central pillar of the regular season, and the mechanism by which the teams qualifying for the Championship play-off bracket are decided. The top eight teams in the table at the end of the regular season, regardless of regional pool, qualify for the play-off quarter-finals, seeded in the order they finished the regular season.\nThe season concluded with seven of the play-off contenders from last season making the knock-out stages for a second time, with only Connacht, replacing Edinburgh, entering the post-season for the first time. All four Irish provinces qualified for the knock-out rounds. For the second year, no Welsh or Italian team qualified for the final stages, Benetton being the last Welsh or Italian side eliminated on the final day of the regular season.\nLeinster Rugby topped the regular season standings for the fourth successive time, and the tenth time in total, both a record. They have confirmed home advantage and first seeding for the whole play-offs. Ulster Rugby have confirmed home advantage for a quarter-final and semi-final. As the final will be held in the Aviva Stadium, neither side will need to leave Ireland to win the competition.\nGlasgow Warriors and Stormers as guaranteed fourth and third placed team, have home advantage for the quarter-finals only.\nLeinster, Ulster, Glasgow, Stormers, Munster and the Bulls have qualified for the 2023–24 Champions Cup by virtue of their league position. Cardiff Rugby have also qualified as the highest-placed Welsh team.\nThe remaining position went to Connacht after the Sharks were eliminated from the Championship playoffs.\nKnockout stage.\nBracket.\nThe play-off draw is seeded based on final positions in the regular season league table.\nThe higher-ranked teams will have home advantage in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\nAttendances by club.\nAttendance was up by 32% in the season, with a regular season average of 9,500 per game. The all-time attendance record for the URC and Pro14/12 was set in the semi-final between the Stormers and Connacht in Cape Town, with 47,261 spectators. The previous record was 47,125 in 2019 at Celtic Park in the final between Glasgow Warriors and Leinster. The record lasted only three weeks as a sell-out crowd of 56,344 watched the 2022-23 final between Stormers and Munster\nEnd of Season Awards.\nURC Dream Team.\nThe 2022–23 United Rugby Championship Dream team is:\nAward winners.\nThe 2022–23 URC award winners were:"

        "title": "Major League Baseball on Fox Family",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) games aired on the predecessor networks for the American pay television channel Freeform. These began in 2000, when the channel was known as Fox Family Channel, co-owned by News Corporation and Haim Saban, as a replacement for Thursday night games that had aired on Fox Sports Net in prior seasons. The package also included some games in the postseason Division Series. After The Walt Disney Company bought the channel in 2001, renaming it to ABC Family, the games were moved to the Disney-owned ESPN channels, although the 2002 Division Series games that had been acquired as part of the purchase remained on ABC Family because of existing contractual obligations. Those games moved to ESPN the following year as well.\nBackground.\nIn 1997, as part of its contract with Major League Baseball, Fox Sports began to show games on its national network of regional sports networks, Fox Sports Net (FSN), which was given rights to two Thursday night games per week, one for the Eastern and Central time zones and one for the Mountain and Pacific time zones, though these games were often preempted in markets where they conflicted with the FSN affiliate's coverage of a local team.\nFox Family's coverage.\nIn 2000, the former FSN coverage passed to Fox Family Channel on an alternating basis with then-sister network FX and was reduced to one game per week.\nStarting with the 2001 season, Fox Family also carried games from the Division Series that did not air on the Fox broadcast network. Among the games that aired on Fox Family included one between the San Francisco Giants and the Houston Astros on October 4, 2001, in which Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the season, tying the all-time single season record that Mark McGwire had set only three years earlier.\nCommentators.\nPlay-by-play announcers for the FSN/Fox Family coverage included Kenny Albert, Thom Brennaman, Chip Caray, Josh Lewin, and Steve Physioc. Color analysts included Bob Brenly, Kevin Kennedy, Steve Lyons, and Jeff Torborg.\nOther commentators included:\nRegular season schedule (2001).\nNOTE: The Thursday night telecasts on Fox Family were subject to blackout in the local markets of participating teams.\nSimulcasts.\nThe following is a list of local television stations that simulcast Fox Family's postseason coverage in 2001.\nABC Family.\nAfter Disney bought Fox Family in 2001 and renamed it ABC Family, the Thursday games were folded into the \"ESPN Major League Baseball\" rights package (and subsequently shifted to weekday afternoon \"DayGame\" broadcasts). However, the Division Series games aired on ABC Family (with ESPN's announcers, graphics, and music) for 2002 because of inherited contractual obligations. The only usage of the ABC Family \"bug\" was for a ten-second period when returning from a commercial break in the lower right corner of the screen. The following year the Division Series games also shifted to ESPN.\nGame 2 (played on October 2) of the Minnesota–Oakland playoff series in 2002 started on ESPN2 because the San Francisco–Atlanta game (which started at 1 p.m. Eastern Time) ran over the three-hour time window. The game was eventually switched back to ABC Family once the early game ended.\nFox local simulcasts.\nThe following is a list of local television stations that simulcast ABC Family's postseason coverage in 2002, all of which were owned by Fox."

        "title": "2023 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2023 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2022–23 season and conclusion to the season's playoffs. The best-of-seven playoffs was played between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat and the Western Conference champion Denver Nuggets. The series started on June 1, and concluded on June 12.\nThe Nuggets defeated the Heat in four of five games, winning their first championship in franchise history after 47 seasons in the NBA. Denver's Nikola Jokić was unanimously voted the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP), after averaging 30.2 points, 14.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 blocks while shooting 58.3% from the field and 42.1% from the 3-point line. Jokić is the lowest-selected player to ever win Finals MVP, being the 41st pick of the 2014 NBA draft. This marked the first NBA Finals appearance for Denver. This was also the second Finals to feature a 8 seed, along with the 1999 NBA Finals.\nBackground.\nMiami Heat.\nAfter losing in game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals as the top seed in the Eastern Conference the previous season, the Heat barely qualified for the playoffs in 2023. They regressed from their 53–29 record the previous season and finished with a record of 44–38, their worst since the 2018–19 season. Additionally, they finished the regular season ranked dead last in points per game and were the only team in the league to qualify for the playoffs with a negative point differential. Although they finished 7th in the regular season standings, Miami had to go through two play-in games to extend their season, losing to the Atlanta Hawks in the first and defeating the Chicago Bulls in the second, earning the 8th seed in the NBA playoffs. \nIn the first round, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks, the team with the best record in the league and the betting favorites to win the championship. The Heat took game 1 on the road after Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered a lower back contusion in the first half that ruled him out for the remainder of game 1, as well as the next two games. The Heat also lost star power of their own, as they lost starter Tyler Herro in game 1 with a broken hand, and Victor Oladipo with a torn left patellar tendon in game 3. Despite their setbacks, the Heat still managed to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, the Heat trailed by 12 with under six minutes remaining, but they went on a pivotal 30–13 run down the stretch, with Jimmy Butler scoring a career-high 56 points in a 119–114 victory to put the Bucks on the brink of elimination. The Heat then overcame a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit in game 5 to become the sixth 8-seeded team to defeat a 1-seeded team in playoff history. Butler, who averaged just 22.9 points in the regular season, finished the first round averaging 37.6 points on 60% from the field.\nLater in the conference semifinals, they defeated the New York Knicks in six games to clinch their third conference finals appearance in the last four seasons, where they faced the Boston Celtics, who finished with the second-best record in the league. The Heat led the series 3–0 before the Celtics won the next three games to force a game 7, in hopes of becoming the first team to overcome a 3–0 series deficit. Miami won game 7 on the road by a score of 103–84, earning their seventh overall NBA Finals appearance. Butler was named the Eastern Conference Finals MVP, while Caleb Martin, who averaged just 9.6 points in the regular season, finished the conference finals averaging 19.3 points. The Heat became the first eight-seeded team since the 1999 New York Knicks to reach the NBA Finals, and the first eighth-seeded team to reach the Finals in a full 82-game regular season. Outside of Butler and Bam Adebayo, the Heat got a majority of their playoff production from undrafted players such as Martin, Gabe Vincent, Duncan Robinson, and Max Strus, as well as veterans Kyle Lowry, Cody Zeller, and Kevin Love, the latter of whom Miami acquired in February 2023 after he was bought out by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nDenver Nuggets.\nThe Nuggets have had several years of recent success. In 2020, they reached their first Western Conference Finals appearance since 2009; however, they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers, who went on to win the 2020 NBA Finals. Denver could not get over the hump after this, largely due to injuries to key players. Jamal Murray, who was crucial to the Nuggets' playoff runs in 2019 and 2020, tore his ACL a month before the start of the 2021 playoffs as the Nuggets were swept by the Phoenix Suns in the second round. The 2021–22 season proved to be challenging as well, as the Nuggets had to play without Murray and lost starting forward Michael Porter Jr. to season-ending back surgery nine games into the season. Despite this, Denver still finished the season with a 48–34 record and earned the sixth seed, led by back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokić and starting power forward Aaron Gordon, who the Nuggets acquired in the middle of the 2020–21 season from the Orlando Magic for Gary Harris, R. J. Hampton, and a 2025 first-round pick. In the first round of the playoffs, the Nuggets lost in five games to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the 2022 NBA Finals.\nThe Nuggets entered the 2022–23 season with Murray and Porter Jr. healthy again. During the offseason, they traded for starting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and rotation player Ish Smith from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Monté Morris and Will Barton. Denver also signed Bruce Brown in free agency and added young talent through the 2022 NBA draft, selecting Christian Braun and trading for Peyton Watson, giving up draft picks and JaMychal Green. With a healthy roster, the Nuggets finished the season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Western Conference for the first time in franchise history. \nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Nuggets won in five games over the eighth-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves. Denver then faced the fourth-seeded Phoenix Suns, who previously swept them in the conference semifinals in 2021. After going up 2–0 in the series, Phoenix won both their home games to tie the series at 2–2, despite a career-high 53 points from Jokić in game 4. The Nuggets then won game 5 in Denver and beat Phoenix on the road to advance in six games. Denver reached their second conference finals in four years, where they faced the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, who previously defeated them in their first seven postseason matchups. The Nuggets defeated the Lakers in four games, marking their first sweep of an opponent in franchise history en route to reaching the Finals for the first time in their history. Jokić was awarded Western Conference Finals MVP, as he surpassed Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason. Playing in their 47th season in the NBA, the Nuggets became the last of the four teams from the American Basketball Association (ABA) that merged with the NBA to reach the NBA Finals. The franchise appeared in the championship round once in the ABA in 1975–76, the league's final season before the merger.\nRoad to the Finals.\nNotes\nRegular season series.\nThe Nuggets won the regular season series 2–0.\nSeries summary.\nOn April 26, the NBA announced that the start times for all the weeknight Finals games will move from 9:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. EDT for the first time in 20 years. Sunday start times remained at 8:00 p.m. EDT.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nNikola Jokić had a triple-double and Jamal Murray contributed 26 points and 10 assists to lead Denver to a 104–93 win in their inaugural NBA Finals appearance. The Nuggets trailed for just 34 seconds in the game, and its largest lead was 24. Michael Porter Jr. recorded his seventh double-double of the playoffs, while Aaron Gordon set the tone by scoring 12 of his 16 points in the opening quarter. Bam Adebayo had 26 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, who made just 41% of their field goals and 33% of their three-pointers. Denver remained unbeaten at home in the playoffs, while the Heat had been 3–0 in their series openers. Miami also dropped to 1–6 all-time in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\nJokić had 10 points and 10 assists by halftime, when Denver was up 59–42. Through the first three quarters, Miami guarded him with Adebayo, Cody Zeller, and a zone defense, forcing Jokić to become a passer. The Heat went on an 11–0 run to start the fourth quarter, cutting an 84–63 deficit to 84–74. Nuggets coach Michael Malone countered by having Jokić post up closer to the basket, and he scored 12 points in the final period. Miami came within nine points after a 3-pointer by Haywood Highsmith with 2:34 remaining, but did not come any closer. Highsmith finished with 18 points off the bench, while Gabe Vincent hit five 3-pointers for Miami.\nJokić had 27 points on 67% shooting to go along with 14 assists and 10 rebounds, joining Jason Kidd of the then-New Jersey Nets as the only NBA players with a triple-double in their finals debuts. Jokić and Murray also became the second pair of teammates to each put up at least 25 points and 10 assists in a finals game since Magic Johnson and James Worthy in 1987. The Heat's Caleb Martin shot just 1 of 7, and Max Strus was 0 for 10, missing all nine of his 3-pointers. Jimmy Butler, who entered the finals averaging 28.5 points this postseason, scored a playoff-low 13 points. Additionally, Miami was just 2 for 2 on its free throws, tied for the fewest free throws made in a playoff game and breaking the record for fewest attempts in a playoff game.\nGame 2.\nMiami rallied from a 15-point deficit to win 111–108 behind 23 points from Vincent and 21 each from Butler and Adebayo, becoming the first No. 8 seed to win an NBA Finals game on the road. The Heat built an early 21–10 lead with 4:56 left in the opening quarter before the Nuggets went on a 40–14 run over the next 12 minutes, turning the double-digit deficit into a double-digit lead. Down by eight entering the fourth quarter, the Heat outscored Denver 32–12 in the opening 8:21 of the fourth quarter to take a 12-point lead, then frittered most of it away and had to survive a 3-point try by Murray that missed as time expired. Miami knocked down 17 of their 35 threes and converted 18 of 20 free throws after making just two in Game 1. Jokić scored a game-high 41 points but recorded a playoff-low four assists as the Nuggets lost their first home game since March 30.\nWith Martin dealing with an illness, Miami elected to insert Kevin Love, who did not play in Game 1, into the starting lineup. Strus, who was 0 for 10 in Game 1, had four 3-pointers in the first quarter as the Heat jumped out to an early 11-point lead, but the Nuggets reclaimed momentum early in the second quarter with four 3-pointers in a 70-second span as Miami trailed by as much as 15 in the first half. Despite an 18-point third quarter from Jokić, the Heat hung around to trail by eight entering the fourth quarter. Coming into the game, Denver was undefeated in the playoffs when leading by double digits and boasted a 37–1 record for the season when leading by at least eight points going into the final quarter.\nMiami opened the first 2:43 of the fourth quarter with a 15–2 scoring run, highlighted by Duncan Robinson going 4 for 4 from the field to give the Heat their first lead of the second half. Miami managed to build a 12-point advantage with under 3:30 remaining but had to weather a late surge from the Nuggets, who cut the lead to three with 35 seconds remaining. After a missed 3-pointer from Butler, Denver chose not to call a timeout in the closing seconds. Murray attempted a last-second 3-point shot that could have tied the game, but it fell short. Murray finished with 18 points and 10 assists, while Jokić converted 16 of his 28 field goals as the Nuggets dropped to 0–3 this postseason when Jokić scores 40 or more points.\nGame 3.\nJokić and Murray became the first pair of teammates in NBA history to each record a 30-point triple-double in the same game as the Nuggets won 109–94, reclaiming the series lead. After a tight first half that saw neither team claim a lead bigger than five, the Heat never led in the second half, as Denver pushed the lead to double digits for the first time early in the third quarter and led by as much as 21 later in the half. The Nuggets won their fourth straight road game, while Miami lost their third straight home game after starting off 6–0 at home this postseason.\nJokić and Murray combined for 24 made field goals, while the entire Heat team managed 34. The duo also contributed significantly on the glass, grabbing a combined 31 rebounds to the Heat's total of 33, while their 20 assists matched Miami's total of 20. For Jokić, this marked his 10th triple-double of the playoffs, further extending his single-season record for triple-doubles in a single playoff run. He finished the game by converting 12 of his 21 shot attempts, while his 32 points, 21 rebounds, and 10 assists made him the first player to record 30-plus points, 20-plus rebounds, and 10-plus assists in a finals game. For Murray, he finished with a game-high 34 points on 55% from the field to go along with 10 boards and 10 assists, joining Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy as the only players in finals history to record 10-plus assists in three consecutive games.\nJokić and Murray also received contributions from their teammates, as Christian Braun scored 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting in 19 minutes off the bench, while Gordon added a double-double as Denver dominated the boards (58 to 33) and points in the paint (60 to 34). For Miami, Butler finished with 28 points, and Adebayo recorded 22 points and 17 rebounds but only made 7 of his 21 shot attempts. Vincent and Strus shot a combined 3 for 17 as the Heat finished the game shooting 37% from the field and 31% from beyond the arc. Udonis Haslem, aged 42 years and 363 days, became the oldest player to play in the NBA Finals; he came off the bench with 29.8 seconds left in the game.\nGame 4.\nGordon dropped a game-high 27 points on 11 of 15 from the field, Jokić chipped in 23 points and 12 rebounds, and Murray recorded 15 points and 12 assists as the Nuggets took a commanding 3–1 series lead back to Denver. Bruce Brown came off the bench and scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, thwarting any attempt by the Heat to overcome their eighth double-digit deficit of the playoffs. The Nuggets won their fifth straight road game, improving to 9–1 in their last ten playoff games, while Miami dropped to 2–6 in their last eight games, as they fell into a 3–1 hole for the third consecutive finals appearance.\nAfter neither team could claim a double-digit lead in the first half for the second consecutive game, the Nuggets led by 13 going into the fourth quarter. Similar to their game 2 victory, the Heat scored the first eight points of the quarter, and Jokić committed his fifth foul and had to go to the bench with 9:24 left. Miami narrowed the lead to five with 8:42 remaining, but the Nuggets held firm, as Brown scored 11 points during a 14–4 run down the stretch that gave Denver a 17-point lead, their largest of the night. Murray, who committed seven turnovers in game 3, finished the game with 12 assists and zero turnovers, joining Magic Johnson and Robert Reid as the only players to record 12-plus assists with zero turnovers in a finals game.\nButler led the Heat with 25 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists, while Adebayo had 20 points, 11 rebounds, and seven turnovers. Kyle Lowry chipped in with 13 points and seven assists off the bench, but the starting backcourt of Strus and Vincent scored just two points on 1 of 10 shooting as the Heat were held to under 100 points for the third time this series. The Nuggets made 14 of their 28 3-pointers, while Miami shot just 32% from deep and committed 15 turnovers after having just four in game 3. Jokić and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope combined for six steals and five blocks, while the entire Heat team finished with just two steals and three blocks. Jokić also became the first player in NBA history to put up at least 500 points, 250 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single postseason run.\nGame 5.\nIn a closely contested Game 5, Jokić propelled the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in franchise history with a hard-fought 94–89 victory over the Heat. Jokic's dominant performance, including 28 points and 16 rebounds, earned him the Finals MVP award. The Nuggets struggled with their shooting throughout the game, particularly from beyond the arc, as they missed 20 of their first 22 three-point attempts; however, Jokic's efficient 12 of 16 shooting from the field provided a much-needed boost, as he was the only starter across both teams to shoot over 50% from the field. Jokić, who averaged 30 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 9.5 assists throughout the playoffs, became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in points (600), rebounds (269), and assists (190) in a single postseason.\nPrior to the game, Miami announced that Tyler Herro was listed as active for the first time since he broke his hand in the first round against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Heat trailed by eight early in the first quarter, but a 31–13 run by Miami turned the deficit into a 10-point lead, their largest since Game 2. Adebayo scored 18 of his 20 points in the first half to give the Heat their first halftime lead of the series. The Nuggets, who entered the game with a series shooting average of 37.6% from three-point range, shot a historically poor 6.7% from three-point range in the first half. Additionally, Denver committed 10 turnovers in the first half and missed 10 of their first 19 free throws. Despite their shooting struggles, the Nuggets showed their resiliency, as they stormed back to take an 83–76 lead with 4:43 left in the fourth quarter.\nButler, who made just two field goals in the first 43 minutes of the game, scored 13 consecutive points for Miami to give them a one-point lead with two minutes to go; however, an offensive rebound and tip-in by Brown swung the momentum back in favor of the Nuggets. After a steal and two free throws from Pope, Butler missed a contested 3-pointer and Brown hit free throws in the final seconds to seal the win for Denver. Murray contributed 14 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, while Porter Jr. recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Nuggets. Butler finished with 21 points on 5 for 18 from the field for the Heat, and Adebayo recorded his fourth 20-point double-double of the series. Although Herro was listed as available, coach Erik Spoelstra elected not to play him. Miami's shooting woes ultimately proved costly, as they shot an inadequate 26% from three-point range and 34% from the field, their lowest percentage of the season.\nDenver became the second original ABA franchise, along with the San Antonio Spurs, to win an NBA championship. It was the Nuggets' first league championship after 56 combined years in the ABA and NBA. Denver is also the first Western Conference team from outside the states of California or Texas to win the championship since the 1978–79 Seattle SuperSonics. Meanwhile, the Heat were one of two South Florida teams to lose the championship series in a \"Big Four\" sports league in a matter of a few days, as the NHL's Florida Panthers were defeated in the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals a day later, also by a series score of 4 games to 1. This was also the final game of Haslem's NBA career, as he retired the following month.\nRosters.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nPlayer statistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; background:#FDE910\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nMedia coverage.\nThe Finals were televised in the United States by ABC (including Denver's KMGH-TV and Miami's WPLG) for the 21st consecutive year. Game 1 received an alternate presentation anchored by Stephen A. Smith on ESPN2 and streamed on ESPN+ as \"NBA in Stephen A's World\".\nSame as before, the series was called by Mike Breen on play-by-play with Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy as analysts, and Lisa Salters as the sideline reporter. This marked the record 15th and final NBA Finals called by the trio of Breen, Van Gundy and Jackson, and the 14th full series overall. Van Gundy also set the record for calling his 17th NBA Finals as an analyst, however he was one of several personnel laid off by ESPN on June 30, 2023. On July 31, Jackson was also laid off by ESPN, and on August 14, the network promoted Doris Burke and Doc Rivers to the lead broadcast team. When Rivers accepted the Milwaukee Bucks head coaching job on January 26, 2024, ESPN promoted JJ Redick to replace Rivers.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the Nuggets win, a parade from Union Station to Civic Center Park in Denver was scheduled for 10 a.m. on June 15, with a pre-parade rally an hour before the parade. The parade was planned to emulate the celebration which followed the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals victory by the Colorado Avalanche.\nDuring the celebrations in downtown Denver immediately following the Nuggets championship win, there were two shootings that resulted in at least eleven people being shot, including one suspect. On the 2000 block of Market Street, the Denver Police Department said nine victims were identified as injured, with an injured suspect located nearby, all with gunshot wounds. Another shooting was reported on 17th Street and Blake Street, with Denver police reporting one victim self-transported to a hospital. Three of those shot were reported as in critical condition as of the morning of June 13, with the remainder not sustaining life-threatening injuries. The celebrations in downtown Denver had been described as \"raucous\", with fireworks detonating and men climbing streetlights near Coors Field and many fans cheering in McGregor Square.\nDuring the parade on June 15, a Denver police officer was struck in the lower leg by a fire truck which was transporting multiple Nuggets players, including Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray. Jokić's wife, Natalija, was hit in the face with a beer can while riding on the fire truck during the parade."

Over three seasons in Michigan, Douglas struggled to find a definitive position, playing defensive back, wide receiver, and running back. He played in 18 games for the Wolverines before in April 2016 he transferred to Rutgers University. There Douglas played as a hybrid safety/linebacker, and over two seasons had 13 starts and played in 22 games.

Gymnasts may request a nationality change through their federations, provided they have citizenship. The number of nationality changes a federation may request for athletes is limited to two per year per discipline and three over all disciplines. If the previous country gives consent for the gymnast to represent the new country, the gymnast may immediately begin representing the new country in competition. If consent is not granted, the gymnast will have to wait a year before they can represent the new country. If a gymnast has already been granted a nationality change, they must wait a minimum of three years before they can make a new request.\nThis is a list of notable gymnasts who have represented multiple countries in gymnastics competitions and had a valid FIG license for each. This list does not include gymnasts who competed for a new nation after the dissolution of their former country (i.e.: Soviet gymnasts)."

        "text": "Elena Rybakina defeated Ons Jabeur in the final, 3–6, 6–2, 6–2 to win the ladies' singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was her first major title. Rybakina became the first Kazakhstani to win a major title, and the third player representing an Asian nation to win a major title after Li Na and Naomi Osaka. She also became the first Kazakhstani to progress past the quarterfinals of a major. Rybakina was the first player to win from a set down in the final since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006. Jabeur became the first Arab to reach a major singles final, the first African woman to do so in the Open Era, and the first African woman to do so not representing South Africa. This marked the first time since 2009 that both finalists represented non-European nations.\nAshleigh Barty was the reigning champion, but retired from professional tennis in March 2022.\nWorld No. 1 Iga Świątek's win streak of 37 matches (dating to Qatar in February) ended when she was defeated by Alizé Cornet in the third round. It was only the fourth loss of her season, and her 37-match winning streak is the longest of the 21st century, and tied for 12th-longest in the Open Era.\nFor the second time in her career, Cornet defeated the incumbent world No. 1 in the third round at Wimbledon; she had defeated then-five-time champion Serena Williams at that stage in 2014. By making her 62nd consecutive major main draw appearance, Cornet matched Ai Sugiyama's all-time record. Williams received a wild card to play in the tournament, making her comeback to the sport after a year due to a right hamstring injury sustained the previous year, and this would be Williams's final appearance at the tournament. She competed for an all-time record-equaling 24th major singles title, but was defeated in the first round by Harmony Tan. Williams later announced her retirement from professional tennis at the US Open.\nThis is the first edition of Wimbledon to feature a champions tie-break, a 10-point tie-break when the score reaches six games all in the third set, and the third edition to feature a final set tie-break rule. The first women's singles main draw match of the tournament to feature the ten-point tie break was the first round match between Caroline Garcia and Yuriko Miyazaki, with Garcia emerging victorious.\nSeeds.\nAll seeds per WTA rankings.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 20 June 2022. Rankings and points are as before 27 June 2021.\nThe WTA is removing ranking points from the 2022 tournament as a result of the All England Club's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the tournament. Points dropping from the 2021 tournament will accordingly be replaced by the player's next best result, regardless of her performance at Wimbledon in 2022. Note that 2021 points were mandatory for WTA players, unlike for ATP players, who were subject to a different rankings adjustment system.\n† Because the WTA is removing ranking points from the 2022 tournament, 2021 points will be replaced by the player's next best result instead.\n‡ The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2021. Accordingly, no points will be replaced.\n§ The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2021. She is defending points from two 2021 ITF tournaments (Montpellier and Contrexeville) instead.\nWithdrawn players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but withdrew before the tournament began.\nBanned players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but were not permitted to enter the tournament due to the decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus.\nOther entry information.\nWild cards.\nSource:\nWithdrawals.\nBanned list.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club declined entries from Russian and Belarusian players to The Championships 2022, stating that \"in the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with The Championships\".\nOn entry list.\nRankings date: 16 May 2022Sources:"

        "text": "The 1978 India-Pakistan field hockey test series was the first series of bilateral field hockey matches between India and Pakistan. It was held between 9 and 19 February 1978 in the form of a four-test series and was played in two legs – first two in India and the remaining in Pakistan. Pakistan won the first three matches and India the last, the former winning the series 3–1.\nBackground.\nNational teams of India and Pakistan of any sport had not traveled to either countries since 1962 due to political tensions. In early January 1978, reports emerged that a field hockey test series between national teams of the two countries was being planned. Nur Khan, president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation, traveled to India on 13 January to finalise plans for the India leg of the series. Three Indian cities were scheduled to host Pakistan in the first leg of the series. The series was initially scheduled to be held between 23 January and 5 February. It was later reported that the series would commence on 9 February, and that Wankhede Stadium in Bombay (now Mumbai) would play host to the first of two matches of the India leg. 25,000 tickets were sold and the match was to be televised in Pakistan. Bangalore was chosen as the venue for the second match, to be played on 12 February.\nThe test series was arranged in preparation for the World Cup to be held in Argentina the following month. Leading up to the series, the two teams had played each other on 12 occasions, with Pakistan winning seven, losing four and one match ending in a draw. These results and Pakistan's recent form led them to being labeled favorites heading into the series. All matches were played on 'rock-hard pitches'.\nSquads.\nOn 20 January 1978, Islahuddin Siddique was named captain of the Pakistan team and Abdul Waheed, the manager of the touring squad. A 16-member India squad was announced on 1 February 1978. Victor Philips was named captain in the absence of six senior players who were excluded owing to a dispute with the hockey authorities. The players excluded were Varinder Singh, Baldev Singh, Surjit Singh Randhawa, Ashok Kumar, B. P. Govinda and Aslam Sher Khan.\nMatches.\nThe first match resulted in a Pakistan victory by a 2–1 margin. They led 2–0 at half-time with Hanif Khan and Samiullah Khan scoring for them before Vasudevan Baskaran pulled one back for India in the 61st-minute with a penalty corner conversion.\nThe Pakistan leg began with another loss for India, this time by a 6–0 margin, at the National Stadium in Karachi. India fielded four unfit players, suffering from flu, and were down 3–0 after 27 minutes into the first half. Three more goals in the second half meant Pakistan secured an unassailable lead in the series. Shehnaz Sheikh and Manzoor Jr. each scored twice while captain Islahuddin Siddique and Samiullah Khan scored once for Pakistan. India took the final match 2–1 coming from behind after an early goal by Siddique. Zafar Iqbal scored the winning goal for the visitors, in the 54th minute. India's defence came into play with Gopal Bhengra and Sylvanus Dung Dung proving effective against the Pakistani attack."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Friars represent Providence College in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nProvidence began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1926. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Providence's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

Including the predecessor competition, the original European Challenge Cup, this is the 27th edition of European club rugby's second-tier competition.\nThe tournament commenced in December 2022, and concluded with the final on 19 May 2023 at Aviva Stadium, Dublin, Ireland, which was contested between Glasgow Warriors (their first European final) and Toulon who made their fourth appearance in a European final.\nThis was the first year that teams from South Africa could qualify, following the inaugural United Rugby Championship season, with Johannesburg-based Lions making their inaugural appearance in European club rugby. In addition, another South African team, the Bloemfontein-based Cheetahs franchise, formerly of the URC predecessor competition the Pro14, had been invited to enter, having been excluded from European competition during their Pro14 tenure.\nTeams.\nSeventeen teams qualified for the 2022–23 EPCR Challenge Cup from Premiership Rugby, the Top 14 and the United Rugby Championship as a direct result of their domestic league performance having not qualified for the Heineken Champions Cup.

The Round of 16 followed a pre-determined format, while the quarter-finals and semi-finals always guaranteed home advantage to the higher ranked team.\nThe last-16 were dominated by clubs from Top 14 (eight) and the United Rugby Championship (six), with only two English clubs reaching the knockout stages - both eliminated in the first play-off round along with the only Irish team, Connacht, while both south African clubs departed by the quarter-finals. Treviso became the first Italian side to reach a European semi-final, as three URC teams from three different countries(Italy, Scotland and Wales) reached the final four along with French giant Toulon.\nSemi-finals.\nThe higher-ranked club gained home stadium advantage, however, in the event that a South African team had been the higher ranked side, the game would have been located in Europe.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.

        "title": "2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos",
        "text": "Prior to the 2022 UEFA Champions League final between English team Liverpool and Spanish team Real Madrid on the evening of 28 May 2022, crowd control descended into chaos at the entrances to the Stade de France in the suburb of Saint-Denis, France.\nWith a large build-up of fans around the stadium unable to gain access to the stadium in the hours prior to the scheduled kick-off time of 21:00 CEST, French police used tear gas and pepper spray on Liverpool fans. These actions were later defended by organisers UEFA and several French political figures, who accused supporters of Liverpool, of whom tens of thousands had travelled to the city, of disorderly conduct, including attempting to gain access to the stadium with counterfeit tickets and penetrating the stadium illegally. This led to the game beginning 36 minutes behind schedule, and resulted in dozens of arrests and hundreds of injuries.\nSeveral supporters, journalists, and political figures disputed the initial story of fan disorder. They accused the organisers and security of major disorganisation and unpreparedness. A full enquiry has been commissioned by UEFA. The report, which was published on 13 February 2023, stated that UEFA bore primary responsibility for the organisational and safety failures in the run-up to the match. The report criticised both the organisation and the French police, and rejected claims by both that only ticketless fans were to blame for the chaos. The report stated that there was insufficient evidence for asserting the validity of such claims, and that with these claims both UEFA and French authorities made 'a reprehensible attempt to avoid responsibility'.\nPre-match.\nTicketing.\nLiverpool received a ticket allocation of 19,618, equating to 26.1% of the capacity of the Stade de France, with Real Madrid receiving a similar allocation of approximately 20,000. 12,000 were sold to the general public, and another 23,000 retained by UEFA to be distributed to \"the local organising structure, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters\". Liverpool supporters union Spirit of Shankly wrote an open letter to UEFA, criticising them for both the ticket allocation and the \"exorbitant\" prices, and received support from Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who accused UEFA of focusing only on money and not on the supporters, and of hypocrisy for increasing their ticket price over the years while they condemned 'the greed' of clubs such as Liverpool who attempted to form a European Super League, in the context of tense relations between several top European football clubs, including Liverpool, and UEFA following the unsuccessful Super League formation attempt, and encouraged supporters to travel to Paris regardless of whether they had a ticket.\nUEFA had requested that the sale of any paper tickets carry holograms. The Real Madrid paper tickets carried holograms while Liverpool F.C. declined to put holograms on their allocation of tickets. Tickets sold by UEFA were delivered electronically through the official UEFA Mobile Tickets app.\nLiverpool F.C. required purchasers of its allocation of tickets to either collect from Anfield or pay a Special Delivery at a charge of £12.59 per booking. In the week before the Final, there were reports of ticketing fraud in the British media and Liverpool FC called on social media companies to close more than 50 social media accounts involved in the sale of fake tickets.\nTicketing issues only impacted Liverpool fans. However, estimates of the extent of the ticketing problems associated with Liverpool's allocation varied widely. According to the Agence France-Presse, at least 2,800 fake tickets were detected at the stadium gates while the French Football Federation said that 35,000 people with fake tickets or with no tickets eventually showed up at the stadium. Paris police prefect Didier Lallement said there was a large-scale ticket fraud operation, of \"30,000 to 40,000 tickets\", though this number was alleged to be 2,589 by \"The New York Times\". Some Liverpool supporters that had bought bona fide tickets said they were refused entry. Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said a friend of his was denied entry using an official ticket given by Robertson. 2,700 ticket holders who were refused entry were to be given refunds. Additionally, each club had a designated \"fan zone\" for supporters travelling to the city; Liverpool's was situated in Cours de Vincennes, seven miles away by train,&lt;ref name=\"rome2rio/Vincennes-Stade\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; during a railway strike,&lt;ref name=\"lepoint/ratp-trafic-perturbe-metro-rer\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Real Madrid's was in \"Parc de la Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur\", within walking distance. Over 7,000 police were on duty in the fan zones and the stadium. Madrid fans entered the stadium from the north, and were directed to arrive by metro, tram or by foot, from their nearby fan zone. The Liverpool fan zone was 10 km from the stadium, and calibrated to welcome 44,000. A later estimate however indicated that the number of supporters that came at the fanzone may possibly have raised to approximately 50,000, exceeding the capacity of the zone.\nStewardship.\nLiverpool fans were supposed to approach the stadium from train stations to the west and south of the stadium. They were directed to arrive on rail lines RER B and D. However the B line was running a partial service due to a strike. A larger than expected number of Liverpool supporters took the D line, which was also on a direct route from their fan zone.\nStewards on the outer perimeter were largely organised to check Liverpool ticket holders coming from the B line. However a large number of supporters came from the D line station. Stewards on the route set out for supporters coming from the D line station were in insufficient number and quickly overwhelmed. Liverpool fans were able to access the turnstiles at the immediate perimeter of the stadium, quickly leading to overcrowding and tension. Moreover, the approach was through a narrow enclosed pathway that quickly become clogged up as a dense crowd formed.\nThe police requested that the stewards remove their controls at this point, for safety reasons. As a result, Liverpool fans were able to access the turnstiles at the immediate perimeter of the stadium, quickly leading to overcrowding and bottlenecks. With stewards unable to cope, many Liverpool supporters had great difficulties entering the stadium, even with valid tickets with codes that had not already been presented.\nGates at one point were closed entirely, with many supporters still waiting outside. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on supporters outside the stadium. By 21:00 local time, the originally scheduled kick-off time, thousands of seats remained empty in the Liverpool end. For \"security reasons\", the kick-off was initially delayed by 15 minutes to 21:15. This was further delayed by 15 minutes to 21:30, before being pushed back another 6 minutes to 21:36, eventually started at 21:37.\n\"Liverpool Echo\" reported that \"senior officials from Liverpool officially requested for the kick-off to be delayed after lobbying UEFA\" but \"a UEFA statement released during the game...claimed that supporters who 'had purchased fake tickets' were the reason why\".&lt;ref name=\"liverpoolecho/24090683\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMerseyside Police officers, deployed at Stade de France \"reported the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner, arriving at turnstiles early and queuing as directed\".&lt;ref name=\"bbc/61619831\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nInside the stadium, messages on the public address system and the jumbotron attributed the delay to the \"late arrival of fans\"; Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol disputed this, noting he arrived to the ground four hours before kick-off and was \"quite shocked at how early supporters had turned up\". Some of the journalists attending the match attributed the difficulties outside the stadium to the organisers. In a later statement, French police said \"people attempted to penetrate the stadium\", and that police had \"intervened to push back people trying to force their way through\", and blaming fans with \"fake tickets\" who were unable to enter through the turnstiles.\nAccording to Football Supporters Europe (FSE) board member Pierre Barthulemy, the head of the French Interior Ministry's Anti-Hooligan Division, Thibaut Delaunay, was not present because he was visiting Qatar to assist with the organisation of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nPost-match.\nFollowing the match, large groups of thugs attacked, mugged, and robbed both sets of supporters, actions which were strategically organised by the perpetrators. Eye-witnesses said gangs of youths were \"roaming around outside\" the stadium waiting for fans to leave following the full-time whistle. French police arrested 68 people in total, while a reported 238 people received medical attention. MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett who was at the match compared the events after the game to scenes from the American dystopian film \"The Purge\", alleging that there were \"large groups of men armed with machetes, knives, bars and bats\". According to the testimony of a police officer in \"Le Figaro\", there was mass sexual assault. The secretary of Liverpool's disabled supporters' group told BFM TV that he saw the sexual assault of a disabled young woman.\nResponse.\nClubs.\nImmediately after the match, Liverpool requested a formal investigation into the causes of the issues. Liverpool chief executive officer Billy Hogan described the stadium entry and security issues, in addition to the treatment of supporters, as \"absolutely unacceptable\", said accusations being aimed at Liverpool supporters were \"deeply hurtful\", and continued to defend the behaviour of Liverpool supporters. By 31 May, the club had received over 5,000 responses after requesting experiences and issues encountered.\nOn 3 June, Real Madrid followed suit, requesting that \"what were the reasons that motivated that designation of the venue for the final and what criteria were taken into consideration taking into account what was experienced that day\", and \"answers and explanations to determine who were those responsible for leaving the fans unattended and defenceless\", highlighting that video evidence showcased fans being \"assaulted, harassed, mugged and robbed with violence\". Former Liverpool player, Jason McAteer said that his wife and son had been attacked and robbed after the game with his wife's blouse being ripped open and her watch stolen. His son was kicked and his phone stolen.\nFans.\nThe tactics and actions of the French police were heavily criticised due to their similarity to the events of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in which police incompetence in crowd control contributed to a human crush that claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans. Several family members of Hillsborough victims who were in attendance at the final also compared the response of the police after the match to the response of South Yorkshire Police after the Hillsborough disaster; after Hillsborough, the then-prevailing narrative that drunken Liverpool fans were to blame was fostered by the police in concert with sympathetic journalists and politicians. Survivors of the Hillsborough disaster who also attended the final in Paris reported having their trauma triggered by the \"mayhem\" on display.\nFormer Liverpool players Kenny Dalglish, Robbie Fowler, Jim Beglin, and Jamie Carragher reported first and second-hand experiences which were highly critical of UEFA, the French police and Parisian locals. Ronan Evain, executive director of the FSE, condemned the comments, saying \"there is a cheap, very old prejudice against Liverpool fans, and I think it has been used for political gain by the French government.\"\nOn 3 June, UEFA issued an apology to all of the Liverpool and Real Madrid supporters who \"had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events\".\nPolitical.\nBritish Labour Party MP Ian Byrne described the entrance as \"one of the worst experiences\" in his life due to the \"horrendous security and organisation putting lives at risk\". The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss called for a full UEFA inquiry into how the chaos was allowed to unfold. Joanne Anderson, the Mayor of Liverpool criticised the \"appalling management\" of the match and the \"brutal treatment\" of Liverpool fans by the police and stadium officials and called their blaming of the Liverpool fans \"shameful\", comments followed with agreement by Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Nadine Dorries and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Tourism, Heritage and Civil Society Nigel Huddleston, the latter of which criticised the use of tear gas against young and elderly Liverpool fans.\nFrench Sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra and Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin both blamed the problems before the game on Liverpool supporters and their behaviour. This was disputed by reports of supporters from the ground which said it was disorganised and heavy-handed policing, claims that were relayed by British broadcaster Sky Sports, and newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\". Merseyside Police praised the behaviour of Liverpool fans, describing it as \"exemplary in shocking circumstances\". French politician and Member of the European Parliament Jérôme Rivière stated Darmanin's comments were a \"lie\", pressing him to \"apologise to the British for having wrongly accused them and to the French for the shameful fake news\". Further to her earlier comments, on 30 May Oudéa-Castéra blamed a mass gathering of supporters with fake tickets for the chaos at the stadium.\nFrançois-Noël Buffet, the President of the Law Committee, requested that Oudéa-Castéra and Darmanin should show proof for their post-game comments regarding counterfeit tickets. Richard Bouigue, the deputy-mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, was the first French politician to apologise to Liverpool, writing a letter to their supporters' union Spirit of Shankly, in which he said regretted what had taken place. BBC News correspondent Hugh Schofield wrote that the fallout from the final had become an issue in the 2022 French legislative election to be held in June. Right-wing opponents of president Emmanuel Macron portrayed the chaos as stemming from locals from the \"banlieue\" of Saint-Denis, a largely immigrant-descent area. French polling expert Jérôme Fourquet mentioned the events from the final as a reason why Macron's Ensemble Citoyens made losses at the elections, and Marine Le Pen's National Rally made large gains.\nPolling by Odoxa-Backbone Consulting found that 53% of the French public were apprehensive about France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympics, and that 90% thought that the episode had harmed the nation's reputation abroad.\nOn 9 June, the chief of the Paris Police Prefecture, Didier Lallement apologised for the use of tear gas saying that the main aim of the police operation was to save lives. The same day, it was confirmed that the surveillance footage from the stadium of the French Football Federation, had been destroyed as it had not been claimed by the courts within seven days. The French police conserved their own footage however, and handed it over to the courts.\nUEFA inquiry.\nOn 30 May, UEFA announced they were commissioning an independent report into the events surrounding the final to examine the decision making, responsibility and behaviours of all entities involved, and would be led by Portuguese member of parliament Tiago Brandão Rodrigues on a pro bono basis. The report would be made public upon its completion, with UEFA evaluating the next steps to take.\nThe report, which was published on 13 February 2023, found that UEFA bore primary responsibility for the organisational and safety failures in the run-up to the match. The report criticised both the organisation and the French police, and rejected claims by both that ticketless fans were to blame. The report stated that there was insufficient evidence for asserting the validity of such claims, and that with these claims both UEFA and French authorities made 'a reprehensible attempt to avoid responsibility'. UEFA was criticised for marginalising its own safety and security unit, and for statements made during and after the match. The French police were also blamed for not working with other stakeholders, for failing to prevent or remedy congestion, and for using teargas and pepper sprays without justification. They were also criticised for not acting against local groups who attacked supporters. The report stated that these failures could have caused a mass-fatality crowd disaster.\nUEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis accepted the findings of the report, thanking Dr Rodrigues, and offering an apology to those who were affected, particularly the supporters of Liverpool FC 'for their experiences many of them had', and 'for the messages released prior to and during the game which had the effect of unjustly blaming them for the situation'. UEFA also promised to refund all Liverpool fans the cost of their tickets."

        "title": "2022 Wimbledon Championships",
        "text": "The 2022 Wimbledon Championships was a Grand Slam tier tennis tournament that took place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. Novak Djokovic successfully defended his gentlemen's singles title to claim his 21st major title, defeating Nick Kyrgios in the final. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning ladies' champion, but did not defend her title after retiring from professional tennis in March 2022. The ladies' singles title was won by Elena Rybakina, who defeated Ons Jabeur in the final.\nThis year, the AELTC barred Russian and Belarusian players from competing because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In reaction, the WTA, ATP, and ITF withdrew ranking points from the tournament.\nTournament.\nThe tournament was played on grass courts, with all main draw matches played at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Wimbledon from 27 June to 10 July 2022. Initial wild card entries were first announced on 14 June 2022. Qualifying matches were played from 20 June to 23 June 2022 at the Bank of England Sports Ground in Roehampton.\nThe 2022 championships were the 135th edition, the 128th staging of the ladies’ singles championship event, the 54th in the Open Era, and the third Grand Slam tournament of the year. The tournament was being run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and included in the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category, as well as the 2022 ITF tours for junior and wheelchair competitions respectively. The tournament consisted of men's (singles and doubles), women's (singles and doubles), mixed doubles, boys' (under 18 – singles and doubles, under 14 – singles), girls' (under 18 – singles and doubles, under 14 – singles), which were a part of the Grade A category of tournaments for under 18, and singles &amp; doubles events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players. This edition marked the return of the gentlemen's and ladies' invitational doubles competitions for the first time since 2019, along with the introduction of a new mixed invitational doubles draw.\nThis was the tournament's first edition with a scheduled order of play on the first Sunday during the event, dubbed \"Middle Sunday\". Prior to the 2022 edition, the tournament had seen only four exceptions to the tradition of withholding competition on Middle Sunday to accommodate delayed matches during championships that were heavily disrupted by rain. Additionally, this was the first edition of the tournament to have a champions tie break rule in the final set. Unlike in 2019 and 2021, which had a standard seven-point tie break at 12 games all in the final set, this tie break was played up to 10 points when a match reaches 6 games all, to be won by two clear points to win the match. \nTo commemorate the centenary of the opening of Centre Court in 1922 and to mark the inauguration of middle Sunday play, several former singles champions were invited to a special celebration on Sunday 3 July 2022. The event was hosted by Sue Barker and Clare Balding with John McEnroe, who paid tribute to Barker's thirty years as the BBC's Wimbledon presenter. The champions were presented first by the number of singles titles won and then chronologically within that category from furthest to most recent winners. In order of presentation the champions were: one-time winners – Angela Mortimer, Ann Jones, Stan Smith, Jan Kodeš, Patrick \"Pat\" Cash, Conchita Martínez, Martina Hingis, Goran Ivanišević, Lleyton Hewitt, Marion Bartoli, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep; two-time winners – Stefan Edberg, Rafael Nadal, Petra Kvitová and Andy Murray; three-time winners – Margaret Smith Court, John Newcombe, Chris Evert and John McEnroe; four-time winner Rod Laver; five-time winners Björn Borg and Venus Williams; six-time winners Billie Jean King and Novak Djokovic; and eight-time winner Roger Federer. The only nine-time singles champion, Martina Navratilova, cancelled her appearance after contracting COVID-19 on the morning of the event. British former player Tim Henman was also presented to reminisce about his matches on the court as a member of the Wimbledon Committee of Management.\nPrize money.\nThe Wimbledon Championships total prize money for 2022 is a record £40,350,000, an increase of 15.23% compared to 2021 and 6.18% vs 2019 when the event was last played with a full capacity crowd.\nControversy regarding the participation of Russian and Belarusian players.\nIn April 2022, the AELTC announced that players representing Russia or Belarus would not be allowed to enter the upcoming Championships as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stating that \"it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players\", and citing guidance given by the British government. The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) also banned players representing Russia and Belarus from other tennis tournaments taking place in the UK. Outside of the Davis Cup and the Billie Jean King Cup, players from these countries were allowed to compete in other tournaments, including at the Grand Slam level at the year's French Open and US Open, as neutral players without national flags.\nThe ban attracted criticism from many players, including from defending and six-time champion Novak Djokovic, who described it as \"crazy\". Andrey Rublev, one of the players affected by the ban, accused the AELTC of making an \"illogical\" and \"discriminatory\" decision. Others, such as Ukrainians Marta Kostyuk and Sergiy Stakhovsky, came out in support of the ban. The three international governing bodies of tennis—the ATP, WTA, and ITF—criticised the decision, and on 20 May 2022 they stripped the tournament of its ranking points, on the bases that participation should be based on merit rather than nationality and that the unilateral decision by the AELTC contrasts with the remainder of the tour. This decision received criticism as well, with two-time men's singles champion Andy Murray commenting that the removal of ranking points will likely not affect participation in the event and has frustrated players.\nThe WTA and the ATP each levied $1 million in fines against the AELTC and the LTA as a consequence of the ban."

        "text": "Royal Golf Club Mariánské Lázně, also known as Royal Marienbad Golf Club, is a golf club in the spa town of Mariánské Lázně () in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic.\nHistory.\nThe club, one of the oldest in Central Europe, was at the time of its founding located in the empire of Austria-Hungary. Marienbad, as it was then known, enjoyed a golden era as one of the Great Spa Towns of Europe, where many celebrities and European rulers came to enjoy the curative carbon dioxide springs. The original 9-hole golf course and clubhouse were opened in 1905, in response to numerous requests from western spa guests. The course was built according to plans by Robert Doig of Musselburgh, Scotland, and sits at an elevation of 787 meters above sea level.\nKing Edward VII, who financially supported the club, together with the British ambassador to Vienna, became two of club's first members. The first game at the newly opened 9-hole course was played on 1 June 1905, while the clubhouse opening ceremony took place on 21 August 1905, in the presence of Edward VII. A tournament was also organised, with prizes donated by the king.\nThe course was presented at the Imperial Austrian Exhibition world's fair held at Earl's Court in London in 1906., where the special Marienbad section featured a relief model of the course. The club became popular particularly among the English and American guests, and some noteworthy visitors to the club in the summer months included British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, his friend Lord Reading, and Rudyard Kipling.\nThe course was extended to 18 holes in 1923. Queen Elisabeth II bestowed Royal status on the club in February 2003, and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex visited the course to mark its centennial in 2005.\nNotable members.\nMembers include Alex Čejka, who has won two majors on the PGA Tour Champions, and tennis legend turned golfer Ivan Lendl.\nNotable tournaments hosted.\nThe club has hosted both amateur and professional international championships, including the Czechoslovak Open in the 1930s and the Czech Open on the European Tour in the 1990s."

King Alexander I of Yugoslavia chose Bled as his summer residence in 1922, due to its mild climate.\nAustrian Rudolf von Gelmini designed the original layout and in 1937 the first nine holes of the course was completed, marking the birth of golf in the region. In 1938 it became the only 18-hole course in Yugoslavia prior to the Second World War. After the outbreak of the WWII, the course was largely abandoned until its resurrection by Donald Harradine in 1972.\nIn 2014, Howard Swan was commissioned by new owners to bring the course up to modern standards while respecting the original heritage. In 2017, the King's course reopened after a 2-year renovation that saw considerable updates made to the original layout. At a combined 80th anniversary and re-opening ceremony, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia hit the first ceremonial shot and bestowed Royal status upon the club.\nThe facility comprises the 7,275 yard 18-hole Championship King's Course, and the 3,332 yard 9-hole Lake Course.\nIn 2020, \"Golf Digest\" ranked the course the best in Slovenia.\nNotable tournaments hosted.\nThe club has hosted both amateur and professional international championships, including the Slovenian Open."

Captain of the touring side Balbir Singh Sr. finished with most goals (44), while Susainathan scored 25 and vice-captain Randhir Singh Gentle, 14.\nBackground.\nThe idea of inviting an India team to Malaya was first mooted in 1949 and officially expressed by G. E. N. Oehlers, then president of the Malayan Hockey Council (MHC). In November 1952, the MHC wrote to the Government of India inviting a team in 1954. It suggested that the touring side include five or six national team players and that the side play nine games in Malaya and three in Singapore. However, this was the second tour of Malaya by an Indian team; the first by the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics gold-winning national team that had toured the same year just before the Olympic Games. They played All-Malaya XI and beat them 7–0.\nSquad.\nA 16-member Indian squad for the tour was named on 30 October 1953. Balbir Singh Sr. was named captain of the side and Randhir Singh Gentle, the vice-captain. The squad included six players from the team that won gold at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. The squad arrived on 9 February 1954.\nThe touring squad included:\nGK = Goalkeeper,\nFB = Fullback,\nHB = Halfback,\nFW = Forward"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent the Drake University in the NCAA's Missouri Valley Conference.\nDrake began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Drake's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season. Players with performances during the 2023–24 season are displayed in bold."

        "text": "The Cortland Red Dragons men's lacrosse team represents SUNY Cortland in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III men's lacrosse. The Red Dragons compete in the State University of New York Athletic Conference (SUNYAC) and play home games in the city of Cortland, NY. The team was recently coached by Steve Beville, who led the Red Dragons to a national title in 2009 and retired after the 2023 season. Coach Lelan Rogers, who guided the Red Dragons to a 76-17 record from 2001-2005, returned to Cortland as the head coach in the fall of 2023. In addition to winning four national championships, Cortland has won a record 28 conference championships until 2022.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Red Dragons began playing men's lacrosse in 1926 under head coach W.P. Ashbrook. After the 1928 season, the team did not compete again until 1947, then under head coach Jack MacPhee, and has competed every year since.\nNCAA to USILA and back.\nCortland would achieve significant success under head coach Jack Emmer from 1970 to 1972, going 32-6 and reaching the semifinals of the second ever NCAA Men's Lacrosse Tournament in 1972. After beating Navy 9-8 in overtime of the quarterfinals, the team's season would end with a loss to the eventual and then first-time NCAA champion Virginia Cavaliers. The following season, Emmer would leave for Washington and Lee and be replaced by Chuck Winters. In Winters' first year as head coach, the team would compete in the USILA College Division Tournament and defeat Washington College of Maryland to win the first national championship in its lacrosse program's history. Following the 1973 victory, the NCAA would split into Divisions I and II, with the Dragons competing in the latter and winning their first and only Division II Championship in 1975. Winters would go 94-55 during his tenure and become the school's winningest coach, a distinction he would hold until surpassed by Steve Beville in 2012. Between 1978 and 1987, under Winters and his eventual replacement Jerry Casciani, the Red Dragons would win all but one (1982) SUNYAC Championship. During that time, the team would reach the NCAA Division III finals twice, in 1980 and 1981, both times losing to the Hobart Statesmen.\nDivision III Success.\nIn 2006, under head coach and former Dragons All-American goalie Rich Barnes, the team would win its first NCAA championship since becoming a Division III competitor in 1980, beating the Salisbury Sea Gulls in overtime of the title game 13-12. The Red Dragons' victory ended Salisbury's 69-game winning streak. Former Vermont Head Coach Steve Beville would replace Barnes the following year and help deliver the Red Dragons' second Division III Championship in 2009. Under Beville, the team would make the NCAA Tournament every year it was held until 2023. On July 19, 2023, it was announced that Steve Beville would retire as Red Dragons Head Coach.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Cortland's results by season as a NCAA program:"

        "text": "The Men's K1 at the 2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 23 and 25 September 2021 at the Čunovo Water Sports Centre in Bratislava. It was the 41st edition of the event, and 80 athletes from 36 nations competed.\nThe event was won by Boris Neveu of France, winning his second title, after he led a French one-two-three in 2014. Italian underdog Marcello Beda won silver in his first international final, while Joan Crespo matched his result from 2019 with bronze.\nBackground.\nCzech Jiří Prskavec entered the event a clear favourite, as the reigning World Champion, Olympic Champion and World No. 1. The host nation Slovakia fielded Olympic silver medallist Jakub Grigar. Czech Vít Přindiš came into the event having won the last two World Cup rounds en route to the overall World Cup title, also winning the European Championships and the extreme overall World Cup title. World No. 3 Joe Clarke also entered as a favourite, and with something to prove after not qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics. Andrej Málek was the last athlete to win a major ICF race on the Bratislava course, winning the second round of the 2019 World Cup, but he did not take part after retiring in 2020.\nCompetition format.\nThe Men's K1 event in canoe slalom uses a three-round format with heats, a semifinal and final. Athletes complete up to two runs in the heats. In the first heat, the 30 fastest men qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest complete another run in the repêchage second heat for a further 10 qualification positions. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Athletes start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nPenalties of 2 or 50 seconds are incurred for infractions such as missing a gate, touching a gate, or not negotiating gates in numerical order. A team may request up to one review of a penalty per boat in the heats or semifinals phases, with no enquiries considered in the finals.\nResults.\n2014 World Champion Boris Neveu topped the first heat with a clean 82.14, a day after winning the Team world title, ahead of Czechs Vít Přindiš and Vavřinec Hradilek. Sergei Maimistov won the second heat representing the Russian Canoe Federation, 1.15 off Neveu's first run time. Joe Clarke and Slovak Martin Halčin were the two highest ranked athletes to miss out on the semifinal. With both Germans Noah Hegge and Stefan Hengst setting equal times of 85.95 in the first heats run to finish 30th, 41 athletes progressed to the semifinal. 34 of the 41 who progressed to the semifinal did so with a penalty-free run.\nThe semifinal was won by home favourite Jakub Grigar, with a time of 85.16, ahead of Hegge and Marcello Beda, both making their first World Championship final. After the nation won 4 of the last 6 World Championship titles in this event, no Czech athletes qualified for the final, making this the first final without Czech participation since 2014. By finishing 9th in the semifinal, Brazilian Pedro Gonçalves became the first South American to progress to the World Championships final in this event since Thomas Bersinger placed 4th in 2014. This also marked the first time since 1995 that all three German athletes made the final.\nNeveu became the 2021 K1M World Champion with a clean run of 83.92, almost 4 seconds clear of silver medalist Beda, while Joan Crespo won bronze at a second consecutive World Championship. The standard in the final was such that 7 of the athletes would have won a medal, had they completed the course in the same time as their semifinal.\nPenalties are included in the time shown. The fastest time in each round is shown in bold."

        "text": "The 2021 US Open Women's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the women's singles tournament at the 2021 US Open, contested by two unseeded players, qualifier Emma Raducanu and 73rd-ranked Leylah Fernandez. The match was notable for being the first time that a qualifier had ever advanced to the final of a major, for being the first all-teenage major final since the 1999 US Open, and for being the first major final where both finalists were born in the 21st century. Fernandez had defeated four players ranked in the top 20 (three of whom were in the top five) to reach the final: Naomi Osaka (also the defending champion), Angelique Kerber, Elina Svitolina, and Aryna Sabalenka. Meanwhile, Raducanu beat two seeds, 11th seed and Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Belinda Bencic, and 17th seed Maria Sakkari, and had advanced through all her matches, including qualifiers, without dropping a set.\nBackground.\nRaducanu and Fernandez had never met on the professional tour before the final, but Raducanu had defeated Fernandez at the 2018 Wimbledon girls' singles event. The two met in the second round, with Raducanu winning 6–2, 6–4; Raducanu went on to lose to Iga Świątek in the quarterfinals. Entering the US Open final, it was by far both players' best record at a Grand Slam tournament. Before the US Open, Fernandez's best result was at the 2020 French Open, where she defeated 31st seed Magda Linette and Polona Hercog before losing to Petra Kvitová in straight sets in the third round. Earlier in the 2021 season, Fernandez had won her first WTA Tour title at the 2021 Monterrey Open. She entered the US Open ranked as the world No. 73. Fernandez began her tournament by beating both Ana Konjuh and Kaia Kanepi in straight sets. She then went on to successively defeat third seed and defending champion Naomi Osaka, 16th seed Angelique Kerber, fifth seed Elina Svitolina, and second seed Aryna Sabalenka, all in three-set matches. \nMeanwhile, 2021 was Raducanu's first season on the WTA Tour, having lost her debut tour-level match at the 2021 Nottingham Open against Harriet Dart. She had won three ITF titles between May 2018 and December 2019. Raducanu's best major result prior to the US Open was at the 2021 Wimbledon Championships, her major debut. Entering as a wildcard and home player, Raducanu impressively reached the fourth round by beating Vitalia Diatchenko, Markéta Vondroušová, and Sorana Cîrstea, before retiring in the second set against Ajla Tomljanović. She entered the US Open's qualifying tournament ranked as the world No. 150. Raducanu was seeded 31st in the qualifying rounds, and beat Bibiane Schoofs, Mariam Bolkvadze, and 4th seed Mayar Sherif, all in straight sets. Initially scheduled to play 13th seed Jennifer Brady in the first round of the main draw, before Brady withdrew, Raducanu instead met Stefanie Vögele and beat her in straight sets. She went on to win matches against Zhang Shuai, Sara Sorribes Tormo and Shelby Rogers before beating 11th seed Belinda Bencic in the quarterfinals and 17th seed Maria Sakkari in the semifinals, also all in straight sets. Raducanu's straight-set wins made her the favorite for the title entering the final. In contrast, at the start of the tournament betting odds for Raducanu were 400–1, implying a 0.2% chance of success.\nMatch.\nThe match began at 4.22 p.m. and lasted 1 hour and 51 minutes, ending at 6.13 p.m. Raducanu won the match, 6–4, 6–3. With the win, she completed a run to the title without dropping a set en route.\nWith the result, Raducanu became the new British No. 1, surpassing Johanna Konta, and entered the world's top 30 for the first time in her career. Fernandez moved up 45 places into a career-high of world No. 28.\nImpact.\nIn the United Kingdom, the match was watched by an estimated 9.2 million people. Amazon Prime Video held exclusive broadcast rights to the US Open in the UK, however, a last-minute deal enabled Channel 4 to simultaneously broadcast the match on free-to-air television. According to ESPN, the match attracted a bigger audience in the United States than the men's final (despite the storyline there of Novak Djokovic's quest to complete the Grand Slam), with an estimated 2.44 million viewers compared to 2.05 million for the men's match.\nIn winning the US Open, Raducanu became the first qualifier in the Open Era to win a major, across either the men's or women's tours. She was the first British woman to win a major since Virginia Wade's win over Betty Stöve at the 1977 Wimbledon Championships; Wade had herself won the US Open in 1968, against Billie Jean King. Raducanu became the second active British player to be a major champion, along with Andy Murray, who won three men's singles major titles between 2012 and 2016. Raducanu became a popular figure in the UK, having already received much attention for her Wimbledon run. She received congratulatory messages from notable figures including Queen Elizabeth II, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Raducanu later received an MBE owing to her win in the 2022 New Year Honours, and was received by Charles III in November 2022. The win served as a catalyst for increased government funding to tennis in the UK, with culture secretary Nadine Dorries promising £30 million in funding a few weeks after her win, in order to improve the quality of and access to tennis courts and coaching across the country. \nFernandez also received a significant amount of attention, particularly for her wins over three top-five players to reach the final. She became the third woman and fourth player overall representing Canada to reach a major final, after Bianca Andreescu at the 2019 US Open, Milos Raonic at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, and Eugenie Bouchard at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships. Additionally Fernandez and Raducanu (who was born in Canada and emigrated to Great Britain aged 2), became the sixth and seventh Canadian-born players to play a major final, including Greg Rusedski, who represented Great Britain at the 1997 US Open and Mary Pierce, who represented France in several major finals. Fernandez was congratulated by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and was also congratulated by Elizabeth II."

The World Champion is decided on a cumulative points basis, with the sum of their four best points scores, plus their score in Abu Dhabi, deciding the series rankings, medallists and champions.\nThe Montreal leg introduced a super-sprint eliminator format, and will host both the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships and World Triathlon Sprint Championships; which crowned the third World Triathlon Sprint champion for both men and women, and the tenth Mixed Relay champion team. Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown of Great Britain won their first World Sprint titles; it was Yee's first World title overall, while it was Taylor-Brown's second after her Elite World Championship win in 2020. France won the Mixed Relay title, while Great Britain, in silver, took the available Olympic Mixed Relay Qualification spot, as France had pre-qualified as hosts. The event included the world championship events for junior men and women, and the mixed relay world championship for junior and under-23 triathletes.\nThe grand final was held in Abu Dhabi with increased points and prize money to round off the series. As part of the event, Abu Dhabi also hosted the World Championships races in the elite under-23 category, and the six para-triathlon disciplines. Other non-title races were held for age-group athletes.\nKristian Blummenfelt and Flora Duffy began the season as defending champions from the 2021 season.

        "title": "Red-boxing",
        "text": "Red-boxing is a tactic used by American political candidates to coordinate with their political action committees (PACs) in a way that circumvents campaign finance laws. Political campaigns place statements or requests on public campaign websites which are then used by PACs to support the candidate. The name for the practice comes from the red-colored box that often surrounds the instructions for PACs on campaign websites. It is used by both major American parties, but was noted for its use by Democratic candidates in primary elections in 2022. \nCampaigns will use boxes to focus PACs' attention on certain aspects of opposing candidates' biographies, including past controversies. They often include detailed instructions on what type of ad to use, what areas to target, and what age, gender, or ethnicity to appeal to. Red boxes are most often located in the \"Media Resources\" or \"Media Center\" sections of a campaign website where political operatives know to look. Instructions sometimes use terms like \"hear\" for radio ad requests, \"read\" for direct mail, \"see\" for television, and \"see while on the go\" for digital ads.\nHistory.\nIn a 2021 \"Yale Law Journal\" article, Kaveri Sharma traced the origin of red-boxing to shortly after the United States Supreme Court decided \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" which led to a huge increase in super PACs and overall independent campaign expenditure. Initially campaigns would put 'top hits' against opponents on their websites in the hope that they would be used by PACs but this proved to be too subtle to be effective. After the election cycle, campaign operatives, PAC employees and party staff gathered to improve the way in which information was exchanged, settling on red boxes. Because staff regularly switched between working for campaigns, PACs and party organisations, the information was easily disseminated and the practice developed and became an open secret. Messaging has been refined after each election cycle in order for the process to be even more effective.\nSharma proposes several 'magic signals' to help to define red-boxing, acting much like the 'eight magic words' used to define express advocacy. These signals are:\nInstances of use.\nA 2022 \"New York Times\" survey found that at least 19 Democrats running in four states holding contested congressional primaries on May 16, 2022, had used some kind of red-boxing. Republicans did not rely on red-boxing as much, largely using other tactics to communicate with PACs.\nResponse.\nAccording to Adav Noti, the legal director of campaign finance watchdog group the Campaign Legal Center, \"The coordination of super PACs and candidates is the primary mechanism for corruption of federal campaigns in 2022.\"\nLegality.\nFederal level.\nFederal law does not explicitly ban red-boxing, but coordination between candidates and super PACs is prohibited. In a 2022 article in the American Bar Association's \"Human Rights Magazine\", Paul M. Smith and Saurav Ghosh said that red-boxing and using \"coded instructions\" to direct the actions of super PACs amounted to \"illegal coordination\".\nHowever, complaints about illegal coordination between political campaigns and PACs involving public material posted online submitted to the Federal Election Commission have not resulted in any action. In 2020, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust made a complaint to the FEC against John Hickenlooper's 2020 Senate campaign alleging coordination between the Hickenlooper campaign and Senate Majority PAC, who used video footage from a previous Hickenlooper advert and talking points from Hickenlooper's campaign website to make an advert supportive of his campaign. The FEC's general counsel recommended that the FEC investigate the re-use of video footage but not the alleged coordination. In November 2022, the FEC dismissed the complaints using prosecutorial discretion.\nState level.\nIn August 2022, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" reported that the Philadelphia Board of Ethics was considering an amendment to the city's campaign finance regulations which would explicitly ban red-boxing. Opponents of the amendment argued that its wording was too broad, and would also cover normal campaign messaging. The Board voted unanimously to approve the motion once it was amended to be more specific.\nHawaii Senate Bill 1212 which prohibited red-boxing under the state's campaign law was passed on January 25, 2023 but was amended in the committee stage so that it does not take affect until March 22, 2075."

Indoor volleyball competitions will occur at Paris Expo Porte de Versailles with the beach volleyball tournament staged at the Eiffel Tower Stadium in Champ de Mars. This is the first time in the history of the Olympic volleyball competition, each team participating in the Games will be entitled to include one non-competing (AP) athlete to replace an athlete for medical reasons. As such, team rosters will increase from 12 to 13 athletes.\nQualification summary.\nIndoor volleyball.\nOn 6 April 2022, Fédération Internationale de Volleyball welcomed the International Olympic Committee's decision to approve several changes to the Olympic volleyball program and its qualification system, particularly on the rules of the allocation of the quota places for Paris 2024. Twelve teams per gender will participate in the indoor volleyball tournament. As the host nation, France, the reigning men's champions, reserves a direct spot each for both the men's and women's teams.\nThe remainder of the twelve-team field per gender must endure a dual qualification pathway to secure the quota places for Paris 2024. First, the winners and runners-up from each of the three Olympic qualification tournaments will qualify directly for the Games. Second, the last five berths will be attributed to the eligible NOCs based on the FIVB world rankings by June 2024 while observing the universality principle, that is, prioritizing those from the continents without a qualified team yet in the Paris 2024 tournament. \nBeach volleyball.\nTwenty-four teams per gender will participate in the beach volleyball tournament with a maximum of two per NOC. As the host nation, France reserves the direct spot for both the men's and women's beach volleyball teams. \nThe remainder of the twenty-four team field must endure a tripartite qualification pathway to obtain a ticket for Paris 2024, abiding by the universality principle and respecting the two-team NOC limit. The initial spot will be directly awarded to the men's and women's winners, respectively, from the 2023 FIVB World Championships, scheduled for 6 to 15 October in Tlaxcala, Mexico, with the seventeen highest-ranked eligible pairs joining them in the field through the FIVB Olympic ranking list (based on the twelve best performances achieved as a pair) between 1 January 2023 and 10 June 2024. The final five spots will be attributed to the eligible NOCs from each of the five continental qualification tournaments (Africa – CAVB; Asia and Oceania – AVC; Europe – CEV; North America, Central America, and the Caribbean – NORCECA; and South America – CSV)."

The Spirit advanced to the semi-finals as the team with the best record among second-place finishers in each division.\nThe Courage defeated second-seeded Kansas City Current 2–1 in its semi-final match, behind a penalty kick goal scored by Debinha and drawn by Kerolin, and the first professional goal by Diana Ordóñez. Kristen Hamilton scored for Kansas City in the 79th minute but could not complete a comeback.\nThe Spirit drew top-seeded OL Reign 0–0 in regulation time of their semi-final match, which was marked by a perceived officiating error in second-half stoppage time when a handball foul went uncalled against the Spirit's Anna Heilferty during a corner kick. The Challenge Cup did not employ a video assistant referee, which would not be introduced to NWSL competitions until 2023. With no extra time, the Spirit advanced by winning a penalty shoot-out 9–8. Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury scored the Spirit's third penalty and also saved the Reign's 8th and 10th penalty attempts to secure advancement.\nThird-seeded North Carolina Courage won the right to host the final against fourth-seeded Washington Spirit by finishing with a better record in the group stage. Both teams were first-time finalists in the Challenge Cup.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first.\"\nMatch.\nThe match was scheduled for May 7, 2022, which coincided with the second matchweek of the 2022 regular season. Regular-season matches on that day between the Courage and Portland Thorns FC, and between the Spirit and Chicago Red Stars, were consequently rescheduled to later dates.\nThe Courage opened scoring in the 10th minute on Kerolin's first goal in her Courage career, with the Spirit's Ashley Hatch equalizing in the 35th minute.\nIn a sequence near the middle of the second half, Spirit defender Sam Staab tackled Kerolin in the Spirit's penalty area, with the ball going out of play. The tackle injured Kerolin, who was substituted out of the match. Courage players called for center referee Katja Koroleva to call a foul and award the Courage a penalty kick, but Koroleva instead issued a yellow card to Courage defender Merritt Mathias, the match's only penalty card, and awarded the Courage a corner kick.\nDuring the ensuing corner kick, Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury was pushed by a teammate into the goal while falling, her head colliding with the goalpost, and defender Taylor Aylmer scored an own goal. Kingsbury remained down for several minutes and underwent concussion tests but returned to the match. and in a post-match press conference Spirit coach Kris Ward said she would be evaluated for delayed-onset concussion symptoms.\nAylmer's own goal would become the Courage's championship-winning score.\nIn the 80th minute, Spirit defender Jordan Baggett's head collided with Courage midfielder Debinha, with players reportedly shouting that Baggett was experiencing a seizure. Baggett's teammates helped paramedics carry an ambulance stretcher faster onto the pitch. After the match, Ward said Baggett was being transported to a local hospital, where she was released the same day. On June 3, the Spirit listed Baggett on the league's 45-day disabled list for a concussion.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBroadcasting.\nOn March 1, 2022, the league announced that the championship match would be broadcast on CBS, streamed domestically on Paramount+, and streamed internationally on Twitch. The match was also streamed in Canada on Radio-Canada. The match drew an estimated 368,000 viewers and 0.22 rating on CBS.\nReaction.\nAfter the match, players expressed concern about injuries and the response by facility staff. Spirit forward Trinity Rodman posted to Twitter that the slow pace of the paramedic team to assist Baggett was \"absolutely unacceptable\", though press reports noted that paramedics are trained not to run to a scene. \nCourage defender Abby Erceg criticized match officials for not calling a high-boot foul on Spirit forward Ashley Hatch after the studs of Hatch's boot struck Erceg's chest. After the match, Erceg and Katelyn Rowland both claimed that Koroleva told them the ball hit Erceg's ribs. Courage defender Kaleigh Kurtz and goalkeeping coach Nathan Thackeray also criticized officials on social media after the match about their lack of response to Spirit defender Sam Staab's tackle on Kerolin. Erceg further criticized the scheduling of the match, which forced both the Courage and Spirit to play three matches in a span of eight days and led to fatigue that lowered the quality of play.\nJournalists, supporters' groups, and players on other teams also joined in criticism of the match, the tournament's structure and timing, and the league's ability to protect players. Australian international forward Hayley Raso, who fractured three vertebrae in a collision with Kingsbury during a 2018 match while playing for Portland Thorns FC, criticized the medical response to Baggett's injury as well as the league's lack of progress since her own injury. OL Reign players Nikki Stanton and Jess Fishlock, and Portland Thorns FC midfielder Lindsey Horan, publicly criticized the lack of player protection from officials. Fishlock further criticized the tournament's scheduling. Prior to the tournament, OL Reign forward Bethany Balcer also criticized the championship match's early kickoff time as potentially interfering with players' preparations for the match, and its date overlapping with the regular season as an injury risk.\nThe championship match's injuries also occurred in the context of a season-ending injury during an earlier cup match to Kansas City Current forward Lynn Williams, and injures in training to Chicago Red Stars defender Tierna Davidson, and during an early regular-season match to Orlando Pride midfielder Marta.\nDuring the post-match press conference, Spirit coach Kris Ward described discussions involving coaches and league personnel about changes to the cup's format and restrictions imposed by broadcast partners. On November 17, 2022, the league announced changes to the tournament's format to take effect in the 2023 edition. Cup matches would take place entirely during the regular season but would no longer overlap with regular-season matchdays, instead positioning cup matches between regular-season rounds. The league cited player safety and performance as reasons for the scheduling changes."

        "text": "The 2022 Giro d'Italia was the 105th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began in Budapest on 6 May, and Stage 11 occurred on 18 May with a stage to Reggio Emilia. The race finished in Verona on 29 May.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage of the Giro featured an almost entirely flat parcours with a kick at the end. The first were mostly flat while the final featured a steady uphill climb to the finish at Visegrád. The first of the climb averaged 2.6 per cent before kicking up to 5.1 per cent over the rest of the climb. The riders passed through the first intermediate sprint after , with the sprint offering points for the points classification. The last intermediate sprint took place after , with the sprint offering bonus seconds of 3, 2, and 1 to the first three riders across.\nAfter the riders passed through the neutralised zone, two riders from immediately jumped from the peloton as Mattia Bais and Filippo Tagliani comprised the day's breakaway. The duo would build an advantage of around 11 minutes before , , and began to bring down the gap. After the duo up front took maximum points at the first intermediate sprint, the sprinters fought for the remaining points, with Giacomo Nizzolo () taking third place. The break's advantage continued to dwindle over the rest of the day, with the gap hovering at just over a minute with to go. At the intermediate sprint for bonus seconds, the pair took the first two places before Thomas De Gendt () took the last bonus second. With left, the pair up front was finally swept up by the peloton.\nThe battle for positions ahead of the final climb soon began after the break was caught. With to go, as the pace increased, a crash took down Harm Vanhoucke (), Jan Tratnik (), and Erik Fetter (); the three would eventually get back up. As the peloton hit the climb, the pace was steady before Lawrence Naesen () launched an attack with to go. led the chase while Davide Ballerini () crashed with left. With remaining, Lennard Kämna () accelerated from the peloton, immediately going past Naesen and building a lead of around 9 seconds. led the chase, with the peloton eventually catching Kämna inside the final kilometre. Once the catch was made, Davide Formolo () attacked but he was unable to build a significant gap. A sprint for the stage win ensued, with Mathieu van der Poel (), Biniam Girmay (), and Caleb Ewan () the main challengers for the win. After Van der Poel went past Girmay, Ewan's front wheel touched Girmay's back wheel, causing the Australian to go down; he would get back up and finish over a minute down. Van der Poel kept himself ahead of Girmay to take the stage win and the first \"maglia rosa\". Pello Bilbao () took third while Richard Carapaz () and Wilco Kelderman () also finished in the lead group, taking four seconds from some of the main GC contenders. With his win, Van der Poel also took the \"maglia ciclamino\" and the \"maglia azzurra\" as leader of the points and mountains classification, respectively, while Girmay took the white jersey as the best young rider.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage in Hungary featured the race's first individual time trial, with the riders tackling a long technical course in Budapest. The first were mostly flat but the final featured a fourth-category climb to the finish, with the stage's only intermediate time check located just before it. The first of the climb had a steep 14 per cent section before having a false flat uphill section inside the final kilometre.\nAs is customary for time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order of their general classification placings. As a result, Harm Vanhoucke () was the first rider off the start ramp. The first rider to set the benchmark time was Alex Dowsett (), who set a time of 12' 23\". He sat on the hot seat for a time until Jos van Emden () went four seconds quicker with a time of 12' 19\". His time was quickly beaten by his teammate, Edoardo Affini, who finished with a time of 12' 10\". His time stood for a while until Lennard Kämna () managed to beat Affini's time by three seconds. Some riders came close to beating his time before the Italian national time trial champion, Matteo Sobrero (), went on to set the provisional fastest time of 12' 03\". Only three other riders would go on to beat Sobrero's time. The first was Tom Dumoulin (), who went on to set a time of 11' 55\", the first time under 12 minutes. His time was quickly beaten by Simon Yates (), who set the fastest time at the time check before finishing with a time of 11' 50\". No one would threaten his time until the last rider off the start ramp, Mathieu van der Poel (), the race leader. Van der Poel was less than a second behind Yates at the time check but he fell short by three seconds at the finish, giving Yates the stage win.

Just before the riders reached the climb of Colle di Nava, news filtered through that Romain Bardet (), who sat in 4th on GC, abandoned the race. It was revealed that he got sick with stomach problems overnight and his condition did not improve. At the intermediate sprint for points, after the break took maximum points, Arnaud Démare (), the \"maglia ciclamino\" leader, led the peloton across to extend his lead in the points classification. On the climb, the peloton took it easy, with no sprinters getting dropped. This allowed the break to extend their lead to almost seven minutes. Up front, Tagliani was dropped on the climb, making it four riders left in the lead group.\nAfter the climb, the sprinters' teams began to send riders to the front of the peloton. However, the break worked well together to prevent the peloton from reeling them in too quickly. With to go, the break still held a lead of around three minutes. Because of the peloton's pace, there was a split in the peloton but no GC contenders were caught out.

Superga, a climb with an average gradient of 8.6 per cent, has featured in previous editions of Milano–Torino. Meanwhile, the climb of Colle della Maddalena is long with an average gradient of 8.1 per cent, with the first averaging 11.6 per cent. Each ascent of Superga and Colle della Maddalena were categorised. The riders reached the intermediate sprint for bonus seconds at the top of the third passage of Parco del Nobile with remaining before the riders descended towards the finish.\nThe first rider to get a gap following the stage's official start was Mathieu van der Poel (), but he was caught after a while. A furious fight for the break ensued, and no break was formed until after the first climb of Il Pilonetto. After the leader of the KOM classification, Diego Rosa (), took maximum points at the top, a group of 12 riders formed a break on the descent. initially controlled the gap, letting the break gain two and a half minutes, before lit up the peloton with a ferocious pace. The peloton immediately began to split with the pace, with the break being caught by the elite GC group just before the first climb of Superga. At one point, only Richard Carapaz () and Simon Yates () were able to follow , but most GC contenders would eventually bridge up to them, including the race leader, Juan Pedro López (). Contenders who were caught out included João Almeida (), Guillaume Martin (), Alejandro Valverde (), and Thymen Arensman (). Just before the climb of Superga, Valverde suffered a mechanical, losing even more time. On the climb, after some effort, only Almeida was successful in bridging up to the lead group. Meanwhile, Martin, Valverde, and Arensman would lose considerable time, losing somewhere from eight to ten and a half minutes on the day.\nTowards the top of Superga, more riders would drop until only 12 riders remained up front. Wilco Kelderman () continued to set the pace in the group throughout the rest of the first lap, also taking maximum KOM points at the first passages of Superga and Colle della Maddalena. As the group climbed Superga for the second time, Jai Hindley () accelerated, taking with him Vincenzo Nibali (), Mikel Landa (), López, and Carapaz. Meanwhile, Almeida dragged Pello Bilbao (), Emanuel Buchmann (), Domenico Pozzovivo (), and Yates with him in the chase group, which slowly bridged up to the front group. The two groups merged with around left. Towards the top, the race leader, López, was unable to follow the pace. At around the same time, Carapaz attacked, building a lead of around 20 seconds towards the top of Superga. His lead hovered between 20 and 30 seconds until he reached the foot of Colle della Maddalena.\nAs the chase group climbed up the Colle della Maddalena for the second time, Nibali attacked, bringing Hindley with him while Yates chased after the two. Hindley would soon drop Nibali, eventually catching Carapaz with around left. Towards the top, Nibali and Yates caught the leading pair to make it four riders up front while only Almeida and Pozzovivo were left in the chase group. The pair came to within 12 seconds of catching the lead group, but they could not make the catch, with Pozzovivo also dropping Almeida on the descent. On the final uncategorised climb of Parco del Nobile, Nibali attacked but he was not able to get a gap. Eventually, Yates accelerated, building a gap of around 20 seconds towards the finish. He would not be caught as he won his second stage of the race. 15 seconds later, Hindley outsprinted Carapaz for second, with Nibali taking fourth. Pozzovivo and Almeida finished 28 and 39 seconds behind, respectively, while Landa and Bilbao lost 51 seconds. López eventually crossed the line at four and a half minutes down.\nIn the GC, Carapaz took the \"maglia rosa\", seven seconds ahead of Hindley while Almeida sits in third, 30 seconds behind. Landa rose to fourth, 59 seconds down, with Pozzovivo in fifth, just two seconds behind the Spaniard. With his ride, Nibali rose to eighth.

Some notable names involved were the race leader, Richard Carapaz (), Mikel Landa (), and Simon Yates (), but all riders got back up and continued racing. It took almost before a group of 27 riders got away from the peloton, with José Joaquín Rojas () bridging up to them to make it 28 leaders. immediately went to the front of the peloton to set a steady pace, content to let the break battle for the stage win. On the climb of Pila-Les Fleurs, Koen Bouwman () attacked near the top to take the maximum KOM points. Without the \"maglia azzurra\" wearer, Diego Rosa (), in the break, Bouwman moved into the virtual lead of the KOM classification. On the descent, he would soon be joined by Mathieu van der Poel () and Martijn Tusveld (). The trio increased their lead over the chasers to as much as a minute and a half at the foot of the second climb to Verrogne.\nOn the climb, the chasing group split while the front group began to lose ground. Giulio Ciccone () and Santiago Buitrago () emerged as the strongest riders from the chasers, with Antonio Pedrero () also joining the two shortly thereafter. They went past van der Poel and Bouwman to go into the lead of the stage, while Tusveld held on for a while before being dropped. Near the top, Hugh Carthy () and Rui Costa () were in pursuit of the lead group, before Carthy dropped Costa and bridging up to the lead group. On the descent, Costa and Tusveld managed to catch the front group to make it six up front. As they reached the steepest section of the climb to Cogne, Ciccone attacked twice, with his last move allowing him to go solo. He gradually built his gap over the rest of the climb to win the stage. Buitrago was the closest rider to him at a minute and a half down. The peloton rolled across the line at almost eight minutes down. Only Guillaume Martin () attacked from the peloton, gaining almost two minutes at the end. The move allowed him to enter the top ten, eight minutes down on Carapaz, who kept the \"maglia rosa\" heading into the second rest day.\nStage 16.\nFollowing the last rest day, the race entered the Dolomites in what is considered as the queen stage.

At the top, Bouwman took maximum KOM points to extend his lead in the KOM classification.\nAs the break reached the uncategorised climb to Teglio, Bouwman got dropped while the chase group got swept up by the peloton. The six leaders' advantage over the peloton gradually decreased but they maintained a three-minute advantage ahead of the final climb to Valico di Santa Cristina. Just before the climb, Kämna dropped the rest of the lead group, building a lead of around 50 seconds on the lowest slopes of the climb. Towards the steepest sections, Thymen Arensman () and Hirt attacked from the chase group at separate times, dropping Carthy and Valverde. They joined together in pursuit of Kämna, with the pair catching him with left. Arensman and Hirt immediately dropped Kämna before Hirt distanced Arensman with remaining. Hirt held a lead of around 15 seconds on Arensman over the top of Santa Cristina. Arensman tried to close the gap on the descent, but Hirt held him off, winning his first Grand Tour stage.

On the climb, took over at the front of the peloton, controlling the pace until they tackled the climb of Valico di Santa Cristina. Several contenders were dropped by the pace, like Juan Pedro López () and Martin, who both dropped out of the top ten. Emanuel Buchmann () and Pozzovivo were also distanced further up the climb of Santa Cristina.\nWith around to go, a touch of wheels caused Pello Bilbao () to go down, while his teammate, Mikel Landa, João Almeida (), and Jai Hindley () were caught up. All riders would get back to the \"maglia rosa\" group, before Landa accelerated with around to go. Only the race leader, Richard Carapaz (), and Hindley were able to follow him. Almeida and Nibali tried to get back before Almeida dropped Nibali in pursuit of the \"maglia rosa\" group, which passed the remnants of the breakaway. The trio maintained their advantage over the top and on the descent, with Hindley outsprinting Carapaz for third, 1' 24\" behind Hirt, and the four bonus seconds.

The climb is long with an average of 9.9 per cent, with the steepest sections right near the top. The climb was crested with remaining, before the riders tackled a rolling terrain to the finish.\nOn the Passo del Tonale, Felix Gall (), Hugh Carthy (), Alessandro Covi (), and Thymen Arensman () got a gap over the peloton. Further up the climb, several chase groups formed before the peloton slowed down. On the descent, the front group ballooned to 25 riders while the peloton was being controlled by . The best-placed GC rider in the break was Jan Hirt (), who was ninth at only seven minutes down. The break gradually built their advantage to six and a half minutes, with the peloton not keen on chasing the break. At the climb to Giovo, Koen Bouwman () took maximum KOM points to extend his lead for the \"maglia azzurra\". from the finish, the break split, with 10 riders slipping off the front.

The quartet extended their lead to a minute over the chasers ahead of the climb of Passo del Vetriolo.\nOn the climb, Covi was dropped by the front group. There were also two accelerations by Carthy in the chase group, with his last move turning the chase group into a more selective group. He brought Santiago Buitrago (), Hirt, and Bouwman with him, catching the front group with to go. Gijs Leemreize () also bridged to the front a few kilometres later. At the top, Bouwman again took maximum KOM points to extend his lead further. On the technical descent, Leemreize and van der Poel attacked, building a lead of a minute and a half ahead of the final climb to Monterovere. On the lower slopes, van der Poel distanced Leemreize, but Leemreize slowly reeled him back before passing him with left. In the chase group, Buitrago dropped the rest of the chasers, going in pursuit of Leemreize. He caught him with left. Towards the top, Buitrago dropped Leemreize, gradually building his gap to win the stage, despite crashing earlier during the stage. Leemreize finished 35 seconds behind while Hirt and Carthy finished two and a half minutes down.\nIn the peloton, continued to pace until took over on the Passo del Vetriolo. The pace thinned out the group, with Alejandro Valverde () and Domenico Pozzovivo () among those losing contact on the climb. As the peloton reached the climb of Monterovere, took over once again. Towards the top, Emanuel Buchmann (), Pello Bilbao (), Vincenzo Nibali (), and João Almeida () were unable to follow the pace. A few kilometres from the top, Mikel Landa () made his move, with only the race leader, Richard Carapaz (), and Jai Hindley () able to follow him. Landa also got some help from his teammate, Wout Poels, who came back a couple of times on the climb. The three contenders remained together until the finish, where Carapaz and Hindley sprinted to gain six seconds on Landa. Almeida lost a minute while Nibali lost two minutes. Buchmann and Bilbao finished two and a half minutes behind the Carapaz group while Pozzovivo and Valverde ended up losing nine minutes.\nIn the GC, Carapaz kept the \"maglia rosa\", maintaining his three-second advantage over Hindley while Landa moved into third, 1' 05\" down.

Juan Pedro López () moved back inside the top ten while Pozzovivo dropped to tenth.\nStage 18.\nAfter four consecutive mountain stages, the eighteenth stage featured the only flat stage of the third week and the last chance for the sprinters to take the win. The first featured rolling terrain, with a few lumps and two fourth-category climbs. The last categorised climb, the Muro di Ca' del Poggio, is only long, but it averages 12.3 per cent and was crested with left. Following the climb, the rest of the stage was flat. The intermediate sprint for points took place after just while the intermediate sprint for bonus seconds took place with remaining.\nBefore the stage, it was reported that João Almeida (), fourth on GC, tested positive for COVID-19, forcing him to withdraw from the race. This meant that Juan Pedro López () took over the \"maglia bianca\" as the best young rider. A few kilometres following the start, a group of four riders escaped from the peloton. The break was composed of Magnus Cort (), Edoardo Affini (), Davide Gabburo (), and Dries De Bondt (). They gained a maximum advantage of around two and a half minutes before the sprinters’ team began to stabilise the gap. At the intermediate sprint for points, the four leaders took maximum points while the \"maglia ciclamino\" wearer, Arnaud Démare (), led the peloton across to extend his lead. As the riders went across the top of Muro di Ca' del Poggio, the break still held a lead of two and a half minutes.\nIn the final part of the stage, the break's lead gradually decreased, but the leaders collaborated well together to maintain their advantage.

Alberto Dainese () led the sprinters' group home at 14 seconds down, with the group of favorites finishing a few seconds further behind. López's group ended up losing two and a half minutes. Meanwhile, Jai Hindley suffered a mechanical close to the finish, but since it happened inside the last , he was credited with the same time as the GC group. Because of Almeida's withdrawal, the contenders below third moved up a spot, but López kept ninth because of his time loss. Hugh Carthy () also entered the top ten as Richard Carapaz () kept the \"maglia rosa\".\nStage 19.\nThe race headed back to the mountains for the nineteenth stage, with the riders tackling a course from Marano Lagunare to Santuario di Castelmonte. The first were mostly flat, with the riders passing through the intermediate sprint for points after of racing. Afterwards, the climbing began with the third-category climb to Villanova Grotte, a climb with an average of 8 per cent. This was immediately followed by the third-category climb of Passo di Tanamea, which is long with an average of 5.4 per cent.

At the intermediate sprint for points, Fernando Gaviria () sprinted to take maximum points. As the break went across the first two climbs of the day, Bouwman took maximum KOM points to further increase his lead in the KOM classification. The break soon reached the foot of the first-category climb of Kolovrat with a lead of more than eight minutes over the peloton.\nOn the climb, the break split into several groups, with Mauro Schmid (), Attila Valter (), Alessandro Tonelli (), and Bouwman proving themselves the strongest from the front group. Most of the breakaway riders were swept up by the peloton, but Andrea Vendrame () slowly clawed his way back to the front group. As he caught the front group, Vendrame immediately went on the attack on the descent. He gained a few seconds but was eventually brought back. On the final climb, although Tonelli, Bouwman, and Valter made some attacks, the stage win was decided by a five-man sprint. On the final corner, which featured a sharp left-hander, Bouwman made his turn first. This caused Schmid, who was close to him, to suddenly break and miss the apex while Vendrame and Valter misread the turn and had to stop their sprints. Schmid tried to go around Bouwman but the Dutchman held him off to take his second stage of the Giro. By taking maximum KOM points at all four climbs, Bouwman also mathematically clinched the \"maglia azzurra\", provided he finishes the race.\nIn the GC group, there were no action until the final climb of Santuario di Castelmonte. As lifted the pace, Emanuel Buchmann () got distanced first, soon followed by Juan Pedro López (), Domenico Pozzovivo (), and Alejandro Valverde (). Towards the top, Richard Carapaz (), Jai Hindley (), and Mikel Landa () traded attacks, but the top three GC riders were inseparable. Most of the contenders finished between three and 25 seconds behind the trio, but Buchmann lost more than a minute. In the GC, Carapaz kept the \"maglia rosa\" and although there were time gaps between the top ten contenders, there were no movements in the top ten ahead of the final mountain stage of the race.\nStage 20.\nThe penultimate stage of the race featured the final mountain stage, with the riders tackling three big climbs at high altitude. After a flat start and two uncategorised hills, the riders gradually went uphill towards the intermediate sprint for points after of racing, right at the foot of the first-category Passo San Pellegrino. The climb is long with an average of 6.2 per cent, but the last averaged 9 per cent. After the descent and a valley section, the riders tackled the climb of Passo Pordoi, which is long with a steady average of 6.8 per cent. At above sea level, the climb is the \"Cima Coppi\" for the highest point reached during the race. The climb was crested at from the finish. The long descent immediately led to the foot of the final climb for a summit finish at the top of the first-category Passo Fedaia. The climb is long with an average of 7.6 per cent, but the last averaged approximately 11.1 per cent. The intermediate sprint for bonus seconds took place halfway up the climb, at from the finish.\nMultiple attacks marked the start of the stage as several riders attempted to jump into the break. As the riders reached the uncategorised climbs after just , a group of 15 riders went up the road while the peloton began to splinter into pieces. At one point, Domenico Pozzovivo (), eighth on GC, was dropped but he eventually managed to get back. As the peloton calmed down, the break began to increase their lead to as much as six minutes while took over at the front of the peloton. The break headed up the first climb of Passo San Pellegrino with a lead of more than five minutes over the peloton. There were no moves from both groups on the climb, with Davide Formolo () taking maximum KOM points ahead of Giulio Ciccone (). Over the next few kilometres, the break maintained their five-minute advantage as continued to set a steady pace in the peloton.\nOn the climb of Passo Pordoi, the break split as several riders began to drop. from the finish, Edoardo Zardini () was the first to make his move from the break, but he was quickly caught. After a kilometre, Alessandro Covi () attacked from the break. A chase group of eight riders formed behind Covi, but the lack of cooperation from the chasers meant that his lead gradually ballooned. At the top, Covi led by a minute and a half, taking the \"Cima Coppi\" in the process. On the descent, his lead continued to increase, going out to a maximum of two and a half minutes on the bottom of Passo Fedaia. On the lower slopes of the climb, the chase group splintered, with Domen Novak (), Thymen Arensman (), Antonio Pedrero (), and Ciccone emerging as the strongest chasers. Upon reaching the climb's steepest sections, Novak went off in pursuit of Covi, who was still leading by around a minute and a half at this point. Novak began to eat into Covi's advantage, getting to as close as 30 seconds, but Covi held him off to win his first Grand Tour stage. Novak finished 32 seconds down, with Ciccone finishing a further five seconds behind the Slovenian.\nIn the GC group, there were no attacks until they reached the final climb of Passo Fedaia. On the lower slopes of the climb, Guillaume Martin () attacked, but he was caught as took over the pace-setting. The GC group continued to thin out, with the pair of Pavel Sivakov and Richard Carapaz, Jai Hindley (), Mikel Landa (), and Hugh Carthy () the only ones remaining in the group on the climb's steepest sections. Inside the final , Hindley attacked and only the race leader, Carapaz, could follow. Hindley linked up with his teammate, Lennard Kämna, who dropped back from the break. As Kämna set the tempo, Carapaz began to lose contact within the last . Hindley gradually increased his advantage towards the top, while Carapaz suffered as he was passed and dropped by Kämna, Carthy, and Landa. Hindley eventually finished the stage in sixth, exactly two and a half minutes down, while Carthy and Landa finished 49 seconds behind the Australian. Carapaz ended up losing almost a minute and a half.\nIn the GC standings, Hindley took over the \"maglia rosa\", almost a minute and a half ahead of Carapaz. Landa closed to within 26 seconds of Carapaz with his time gains on the Ecuadorian. There were no other movements within the top ten despite the time gaps on the stage as the race headed to the final day individual time trial.\nStage 21.\nFor the fourth successive edition, the Giro ended with an individual time trial, with the riders tackling a course in Verona. The first were flat before the riders went up the fourth-category climb of Torricella Massimiliana, which is long with an average of 5.4 per cent. The riders went through the only intermediate time check at the top of the climb with left. The riders descended until there were remaining before tackling a short flat section towards the finish in Piazza Bra.\nAs is customary for time trials, the riders set off in reverse order of their GC placings, with Roger Kluge () the first rider to go down the start ramp. The first rider to set a benchmark time was Julius van den Berg (), who set a time of 24' 53\". However, his time was soon smashed by Michael Hepburn (), going through the course a minute faster with a time of 23' 48\". Edoardo Affini () was one of the favorites for the stage win, but he fell short of beating Hepburn's time by six seconds. Eventually, Magnus Cort () went into the hot seat after finishing in 23' 42\", six seconds faster than Hepburn. Mauro Schmid () ended up going a second faster than Cort, but by the time he finished, the Italian time trial champion, Matteo Sobrero (), was flying through the course. Sobrero took the fastest time at the time check before finishing with a time of 22' 24\". Only two riders came to within less than a minute of his time as Thymen Arensman () and Mathieu van der Poel () were 23 and 40 seconds down, respectively. This meant that Sobrero won his first Grand Tour stage. Meanwhile, Arnaud Démare () and Koen Bouwman () safely finished to confirm their victories in the points and mountains classifications, respectively.\nThe battle soon shifted to the GC contenders as some spots in the top ten were still set to be decided. In the battle for the ninth spot, Juan Pedro López () led Hugh Carthy () by only 27 seconds. Carthy, who finished 11th on the stage, took more than a minute to pass the Spaniard into ninth but López did go home with the \"maglia bianca\" as the best young rider. Emanuel Buchmann () and Domenico Pozzovivo () safely negotiated the stage to retain their seventh and eighth spots, respectively. Meanwhile, Jan Hirt () trailed Pello Bilbao () by only 12 seconds for fifth on GC. Both riders were evenly matched but Bilbao finished two seconds ahead to retain his fifth place. Both riders also came close to overtaking Vincenzo Nibali (), who was almost a minute slower but retained his fourth place. In the battle for second place, Mikel Landa () was 26 seconds behind Richard Carapaz (). However, Carapaz finished tenth on the stage, taking more than a minute and a half on Landa. The last rider off the start ramp was Jai Hindley (), the race leader. He safely went through the course, finishing in 15th with a time of 23' 55\", more than enough to keep the \"maglia rosa\" and win the Giro. This marked his first Grand Tour victory and he became the first Australian to win the Giro. The traditional prize-giving commenced shortly afterwards."

The race is one leg of the American Triple Crown and is held annually at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The Preakness Stakes is traditionally held on the third Saturday in May, two weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nThe 2022 Preakness took place on May 21 with television coverage by NBC. The race was won by Early Voting.\nField.\nThe Preakness traditionally features the winner of the Kentucky Derby competing against other runners from that race as well as some \"new shooters\" – horses that either bypassed the Derby or did not qualify. However, it was announced that Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike would not be competing at the Preakness, citing the horse's condition and need for rest, and therefore the horse gave up the chance to become a Triple Crown winner. Had Rich Strike competed, he would not have entered the race as the favorite. As a result, this would be just the second instance since 1996 that the Kentucky Derby winner did not run in the Preakness.\nA field of nine was drawn for the Preakness Stakes on Monday, May 16; the contenders included Epicenter, Early Voting, and Kentucky Oaks winner Secret Oath. Epicenter was installed as the 6–5 favorite.\nResults.\nEarly Voting, who entered the race as the second most favored contender with 7-2 odds, won the 2022 Preakness Stakes. Favored contender Epicenter finished second."

        "title": "Great Southern Golf Club",
        "text": "Great Southern Golf Club was an 18-hole golf course located in Gulfport, Mississippi overlooking the Mississippi Sound. Designed by Donald Ross and built in 1908, the Great Southern Golf Club was the oldest golf course in Mississippi. To satisfy mortgage debts, the land was sold at auction in 2021 to a residential developer. After 114 years of operation, the golf course closed in May 2022 due to lack of funding.\nHistory.\nWhen entrepreneur Joseph T. Jones completed construction of the Great Southern Hotel in 1903, he also provided guest amenities to attract more tourists. In 1908, the Jones family funded construction of a 9-hole golf course overlooking the Mississippi Sound to draw in more guests to their hotel. \nThe course was designed by Donald Ross and built by New Orleans architect Charles Nieman. The golf course was located east of the Great Southern Hotel, between Gulfport and Biloxi. In 1910, a clubhouse was built, and the course became the Great Southern Golf and Country Club. In 1921, land north of the L&amp;N Railroad (now CSX Railroad) was acquired, and the golf course was expanded to 18 holes.\nYears of significance.\nNotable guests and professional golfers who played the course included: Woodrow Wilson, Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, Glenna Collett-Vare and Babe Didrikson Zaharias.\nIn March 1944, Jug McSpaden won the first of two PGA Gulfport Open tournaments held at Great Southern Golf Club. Sam Snead defeated Byron Nelson in a playoff at the 1945 Gulfport Open.\nOwnership of the course changed hands several times through the years, along with name changes to the course. From the 1960s to 1990s, it was part of the Broadwater Hotel Resort under the name Broadwater Sea Course. In 1964, the club hosted the Mary Mills Mississippi Gulf Coast Invitational that was won by Mickey Wright. In 1993, the course was purchased by local residents and members of the golf club, who renamed it the Great Southern Golf Club.\nIn 1999, the Great Southern golf course was renovated by architect Brian Curley, who retained the original square greens from Donald Ross's original design. \nDecline.\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed up to 400 trees on the property and demolished the 95-year-old clubhouse. Flood water from the gulf storm surge decimated the golf course grasses and damaged infrastructure throughout the course. In 2013, a new 4,800 sq ft clubhouse was completed, and the golf course was restored. The debt incurred from storm recovery resulted in a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing in 2019, because there was insufficient funding from membership fees and public-play rates to maintain operations.\nIn 2021, the property was sold at auction to a developer with plans to construct single-family homes. In April 2022, after more than 100 years of operation, Great Southern Golf Club announced that Mississippi's oldest golf course would close May 9, 2022."

        "text": "The 2022–23 Stonehill Skyhawks men's basketball team represented Stonehill College in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Skyhawks, led by tenth-year head coach Chris Kraus, played their home games at Merkert Gymnasium in Easton, Massachusetts, as first-year members of the Northeast Conference.\nThis season was Stonehill's first year of a four-year transition period from Division II to Division I. As a result, the Skyhawks were not eligible for NCAA postseason play until the 2026–27 season.\nPrevious season.\nThe Skyhawks finished the previous season 15–12, 10–9 in NE-10 play to finish in fourth place in the Northeast Division. In the first round of the Northeast-10 tournament, they defeated Le Moyne in the first round, before falling to Pace in the quarterfinals.\nPreseason polls.\nNortheast Conference poll.\nThe Northeast Conference released its preseason coaches' poll on October 19, 2022. The Skyhawks were picked to finish last in the conference.\nPreseason All-Conference Team.\nNo Skyhawks were selected as members of the NEC Preseason All-Conference Team.\nSeason notes.\nFive of the Skyhawks' top six scorers from the previous season returned.\nThe Skyhawks opened their inaugural Division I season against UConn at XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut on November 7, 2022. The Skyhawks fell, 85–54. Cole Bergan scored the first point for Stonehill as a Division I team on a free throw.\nStonehill's Division I home opener was on November 10, 2022, against Quinnipiac. The Skyhawks dropped a 102–95 decision in their first meeting with Quinnipiac, since the two teams were in the same Division II conference in 1998.\nThe Skyhawks' first Division I win came on November 12, 2022, when they used a 7–1 run to close the game and defeat Army West Point on the road, 82–77. Isaiah Burnett's jump shot in the final minute put Stonehill in front, 77–76, and they hit their free throws down the stretch to put the game away. The Skyhawks shot 52% from the field and were led by Andrew Sims, who shot 9 for 11 and added eight rebounds and two blocked shots. Burnett had 19 points for Stonehill, and Thatcher Stone added 15.\nOn November 19, Stonehill overcame an 11-point second-half deficit at the Tom Konchalski Classic at Fordham University to defeat Holy Cross, 81–79. After the Skyhawks had taken a three-point lead, the Crusaders tied the game at 79 with 11 seconds to play. With Stonehill out of time outs, Josh Mack brought the ball up the court, backed into position in the paint, and hit a contested hook shot that banked in with 2.1 seconds remaining to give Stonehill the win. Mack scored a season-high 10 points, and had four rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot. Through five games over the season's first two weeks, the Skyhawks led the NEC in field goal percentage at 49.5%, effective field goal percentage at 56.6%, and free throw percentage at 83.7%. They were second in three-point field goal percentage 38.1%.\nTwo Skyhawks earned Northeast Conference Player of the Week honors during the first two weeks of the season: Andrew Sims and Isaiah Burnett. Sims averaged 19.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.0 blocks over first three games of the season. He shot 64.7% from the field and 90.9% from the free-throw line. He came off the bench to score a team-high 12 points at UConn in the season opener, and 18 of his 24 points in the second half against Quinnipiac in the Skyhawks' home opener. In his first start, Sims had a game-high 21 points while shooting 9–11 and collecting eight rebounds against Army West Point. Sims finished his first week ranked second in the NEC in both scoring and field goal accuracy.\nBurnett averaged 20.0 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 2.5 steals and 1.0 block per game during the second week of the season. He shot 64.7% from the field, 84.2% from the line and hit both his three-point attempts. After scoring 10 points at Providence, Burnett had a career-high 30 points on just nine shots from the field, making seven, and shot 15 for 17 from the free-throw line in the neutral-court win over Holy Cross. He also had four steals in the game. Burnett gave Stonehill a one-point lead with 2:49 to play on a three-point play and then hit three key free throws in the final 1:01.\nDespite the Skyhawks losing two of their three games at the Tom Konchalski Classic, two Stonehill players, Andrew Sims and Isaiah Burnett, were named to the All-Tournament team.\nThrough the season's first three and four weeks, Stonehill led NCAA Division I in free-throw shooting percentage.\nJosh Mack hit a three-pointer from the left wing at the buzzer off a pass from Cole Bergen to give Stonehill a dramatic 69–66 victory at Binghamton on December 3. The Skyhawks had a four-point lead with 18 seconds to play, only to see Binghamton tie the game with only five seconds remaining. However, without any timeouts, Stonehill was able to push the ball up the floor for the game-winning shot. Andrew Sims led the Skyhawks with 22 points.\nAndrew Sims recorded a double-double with 17 points and a career-high 10 rebounds in Stonehill's NEC debut on December 29. The Skyhawks used 10 first-half three-pointers to build a 51–29 lead at Sacred Heart and then held on for a 74–67 victory. Shamir Johnson led Stonehill with 18 points.\nStonehill senior forward Andrew Sims became the 43rd player in school history to record his 1,000th career point in a 65–57 home loss against Fairleigh Dickinson on January 16. Isaiah Burnett had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Skyhawks in the game.\nAfter falling behind, 31–19, at halftime at Fairleigh Dickinson on January 22, the Skyhawks put on an offensive show in the second half on their way to a 70–59 victory. In a game Stonehill trailed by as many as 16 points, Shamir Johnson led the Skyhawks' comeback by scoring 20 of his 23 points in the second half, while hitting five of his seven three-point attempts and grabbing six rebounds. Stonehill shot 68.2% on their field goal attempts and hit seven of 10 three-pointers while scoring 52 second-half points. The Fairleigh Dickinson loss knocked the Knights out of first place, a half game behind Saint Francis (PA).\nWith Fairleigh Dickinson losing to Wagner on February 4, the door was open for Stonehill, which won their third straight game, 65–59, at St. Francis Brooklyn to improve their conference record to 8–3 and move into first place in the NEC. Max Zegarowski scored 17 points, including the 1,000th point of his college career, and had seven rebounds for the Skyhawks.\nFirst-place Stonehill traveled to Merrimack on February 9, for a key game between NEC contenders. The Warriors got 16 points and 10 rebounds from Jordan Minor and earned a 56–43 victory, leaving both teams with 8–4 conference records. Thatcher Stone scored 10 points for the Skyhawks.\nWhile Stonehill and Merrimack were battling in North Andover, Fairleigh Dickinson was visiting LIU. The Knights had an 11-point lead with four minutes to play, but the Sharks pulled within a single point in the closing minute. C.J. Delancy's jump shot from the elbow at the buzzer missed, and the Knights escaped with an 80–79 victory that gave them an 8–3 conference record and vaulted them back into first place in the NEC.\nStonehill got back on the winning track on February 11, against St. Francis Brooklyn. Andrew Sims scored 30 points and gathered seven rebounds to lead the Skyhawks to a 62–51 home win that improved Stonehill's conference record to 9–4.\nFollowing Stonehill's early-afternoon tilt, Merrimack earned a 75–68 road win at Saint Francis (PA), which improved the Warriors' league record to 9–4.\nFairleigh Dickinson hosted Central Connecticut on the evening of February 11, looking to win and remain in first place. However, the Blue Devils earned a 77–73 road win.\nThe Merrimack and Stonehill wins and the Fairleigh Dickinson loss on February 11, left the Warriors and Skyhawks tied for first place with the Knights a half game behind.\nWhile Merrimack was winning a non-conference game at Hartford on February 16, Stonehill puts its share of first place on the line at home against LIU. The Skyhawks got 30 points and six rebounds from Max Zegarowski on their way to a 75–60 victory that put them alone atop the NEC standings with a 10–4 conference record.\nCentral Connecticut hosted Stonehill on February 18, in a game that became a triple overtime thriller. With the game tied on the final possessions of regulation and each of the first two overtimes, all attempts to beat the buzzer came up empty. However, in the closing seconds of the third overtime, the Blue Devils had the ball and a two-point lead. Central Connecticut broke the Skyhawks' trap and Nigel Scantlebury found Tre Breland for a dunk with two seconds remaining that put the game away for the Blue Devils. Andrew Sims scored 24 points and grabbed seven rebounds for the Skyhawks, who fell out of first place with the loss. It was the first overtime game for Stonehill as a Division I team.\nStonehill's hopes for an NEC regular-season championship came to an end, when Merrimack earned a 70–54 home win over Central Connecticut on February 23.\nSkyhawks' head coach Chris Kraus was voted Jim Phelan Coach of the Year by the NEC's coaches.\nStonehill had three all-conference players, the most ever by a first-year NEC program, and tied for the most among NEC teams this season. Fifth-year senior Andrew Sims was selected to the first team. He ranked sixth in the league in scoring at 15.2 points per game. Isaiah Burnett earned a second-team selection by ranking second in the NEC and fourth nationally with 2.8 steals per game. Graduate student forward Max Zegarowski shot 45.6% from three-point range during conference play to merit a third-team selection. He ranked second overall in three-point shooting accuracy at 41.9%.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\nSources"

        "title": "2022–23 snooker world rankings",
        "text": "The sport of professional snooker has had a world ranking system in place since 1976. Certain tournaments were given \"ranking\" status, with the results at those events contributing to a player's world ranking. The events that made up the 1976–77 snooker season were the first to award players with ranking points. Originally, the world rankings were decided based only on results in the World Snooker Championship, but other events were later added. The system used for the 2022–23 snooker season was first used in the 2010–11 season, where players won ranking points based entirely on prize money won from these events. The rankings are based on the prior two seasons, with eight revisions after specific tournaments throughout the season. These revisions are used as official rankings, with points awarded in the current season overwriting those from two years prior.\nRonnie O'Sullivan began the season as the highest ranked player and retained his position throughout the season, despite not winning any ranking titles or even making semi finals. O'Sullivan began the season with a lead of 26,500 points over second ranked Judd Trump, and finished the season above 2023 World Champion Luca Brecel by 9,500 points.\nRanking list.\nRevision dates.\nSeedings for each event were based on the world rankings, with totals being updated at specific revision dates. On these dates, ranking points from the 2020–21 snooker season were removed from a player's total.\nSeeding list.\nThe following table contains the rankings which were used to determine the seedings for following tournaments. Other provisional and unofficial rankings are produced after each ranking event which are not noted here. Blank fields indicate that the player was not active on the tour, or had no ranking. The names are initially sorted by the scores at the end of the season.\nRanking points.\nBelow is a list of points awarded to each player for the events they participated in. Grey fields indicate that the player did not participate at the event."

        "text": "The Original Group 19 Rugby League was a competition which ran from the 1950 until 1970, in the Southern Tablelands region of New South Wales. Many clubs left for other competitions after this time, including Group 16 and Group 8. The Group 19 tag was then transferred to Canberra and later Northern New South Wales.\nHistory.\nA senior Rugby League competition under the enumeration Group 19 ran from the post-war years until 1970. Participating teams included Bibbenluke, Bombala, Delegate, Jindabyne and (usually) Adaminaby. In most seasons two or three Cooma teams participated – the Cooma Rovers and St Patricks, Cooma Blues or Cooma Citizens. Employees engaged in the Snowy River Scheme fielded teams for short periods – Public Service, Snowy and the intriguingly named Utah-Island Bend.\nIn 1971 the northern Group 19 clubs – Cooma Rovers, Adaminaby, Jindabyne, Cooma Citizens and Nimmitabel agreed to combine playing resources and field a team in the Group 16 competition, as the Alpine Wanderers. The three teams from southern Monaro, Bibbenluke, Bombala and Delegate, also joined the combined competition, although they remained separate clubs.\nThe enumeration Group 19 was later redeployed to the Canberra District competition, before again being used in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, with teams from Armidale, Glen Innes, Guyra, Narwan, Uralla and Walcha competing under that banner in the 1980s."

        "text": "John Adrian Abando Wong (born February 10, 1996) is a Filipino-American professional basketball player who last played for the Converge FiberXers of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). After growing up in Dallas, Texas, he moved to the Philippines to pursue his college and professional basketball career.\nEarly life and high school career.\nWong was born in Euless, Texas to parents who were both Filipino nurses and grew up in Dallas. He started playing basketball in the 2nd grade when his father signed him up for a basketball camp.\nOne year later, he played AAU basketball for the Net Raiders. After that team disbanded, he transferred to the Texas Select team. He played for that team until his senior year.\nHe also played at Trinity High School, where he became teammates with future NBA leader in blocks Myles Turner. In his senior year, he averaged 10.6 points per game and 4 assists.\nAt the end of his high school career, his family chose between Ateneo, La Salle, or staying in the States. He ended up playing for Ateneo after his father emailed the coach at the time, Bo Perasol, about his son.\nCollege career.\nWong moved to the Philippines with his older brother, Dan. His Ateneo teammate Von Pessumal and former Blue Eagle Chris Newsome helped him adjust to life in the Philippines.\nIn Wong's UAAP debut in Season 78, he played 17 minutes. He started the season playing as a shooting guard and had limited minutes. In the first game of the second round of eliminations, he had 14 points in a win over the FEU Tamaraws. After that performance, he moved over to the point guard position and became the main point guard off the bench. Against the De La Salle Green Archers, he and Aaron Black combined for 23 points off the bench. In the Final Four, Ateneo faced FEU once again, this time as the 3rd seed. He had 17 points off the bench in that game, but missed a layup that would have given Ateneo the lead. Instead, it set the stage for Mac Belo to make a buzzer-beating, game-winning putback, eliminating Ateneo and sending FEU to their second straight UAAP Finals.\nIn Season 79, Wong had an increased role, but struggled. He had 13 points in a win over FEU. He then had 17 points against the UE Red Warriors, but did not finish the game due to foul trouble. Still Ateneo made it to the Finals, where they lost to the Archers.\nIn January 2017, Wong suffered a torn ACL injury that kept him out of Season 80. Despite his absence, Ateneo was able to claim their first seniors basketball title in five years.\nWong was able to play again in 2018, as he joined Ateneo in competing at that year's Jones Cup. The Eagles won the championship once again, this time over the UP Fighting Maroons.\nIn Season 82, Wong had a career-high 18 points on 4-of-7 from three in a win over La Salle to help Ateneo secure a spot in the Final Four. They had no losses that season, as Ateneo went on to win its third straight. Although he had one more year of eligibility left, he decided not to use it, choosing to move on to the next chapter of his basketball career.\nProfessional career.\nRain or Shine Elasto Painters (2019–2022).\nWong was drafted 5th overall in the 2019 PBA Draft by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, and was signed to a two-year deal. During the suspension of the league due to COVID-19, he and Barangay Ginebra player Japeth Aguilar were caught on video playing pickup basketball, which was not allowed at the time. As a result, they were fined P20,000 each, and were required to do 30 hours of community service.\nHis best game of the rookie season was in a win against the NorthPort Batang Pier, when he had 15 points.\nIn the 2021 Philippine Cup, Wong hit a three-pointer in a 48–74 loss that prevented both teams for combining for the lowest scoring total in league history. Rain or Shine bounced back the next game, as Wong had 15 points in the win against the Terrafirma Dyip.\nMagnolia Hotshots (2022–2023).\nWong became a free agent after his contract expired on January 30, 2022. Rain or Shine decided not to renew his contract as well. A week later, he signed with the Magnolia Hotshots on a two-year deal. In a blowout win against the Phoenix Super LPG Fuel Masters, he tied his career high with 18 points, making six out of seven of his threes.\nDuring the 2023 PBA All-Star Weekend, Wong competed in the Team Greats vs. Team Stalwarts game, where he helped Team Greats get the victory with his 29 points, and claimed MVP honors.\nConverge FiberXers (2023–2024).\nOn April 14, 2023, Wong, along with a 2022 first-round pick, was traded to the Converge FiberXers for David Murrell and Abu Tratter. On March 7, 2024, during the 2024 Philippine Cup, he announced that he would be taking a sabbatical from basketball.\nNational team career.\nWong played for Manila East in the 2014 World Tour Manila Masters. The team only placed 8th in that tournament.\nPBA career statistics.\n\"As of the end of 2023–24 season\""

        "title": "Bobby Grier (American football executive)",
        "text": "Bobby Grier (born November 10, 1942) is an American football executive and coach.\nEarly life.\nGrier was born on November 10, 1942, in Detroit. He attended the University of Iowa, where he played running back for the Hawkeyes from 1961 to 1964.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school.\nGrier began his coaching career in 1966 as an assistant coach at Waterford Kettering High School in Waterford, Michigan. He then served as the head coach at Detroit's Martin Luther King High School from 1970 to 1973.\nCollege.\nIn 1974, Grier moved to the college ranks, serving as running backs coach for Eastern Michigan University. He followed head coach Ed Chlebek to Boston College in 1978, becoming the school's first full-time black assistant coach.\nNFL.\nIn January 1981, Grier was named the offensive backfield coach at Northwestern University. However, two months later he took the same job with the New England Patriots. He was the team's first black coach since 1966. The team finished 2–14 and the entire coaching staff was fired. He returned to the Patriots in July 1982 as a scout. He returned as Patriots offensive backfield coach in 1985 under head coach Raymond Berry. That year the Patriots running backs rushed for 2,331 yards, fourth best in club history, and made their first ever Super Bowl. In 1986 he was given the additional title of running game coordinator. Grier was retained by Rod Rust and Dick MacPherson.\nExecutive.\nWhen Bill Parcells became the Patriots head coach in 1993, Grier was moved to the personnel department as the Patriots' director of pro scouting. In 1995 he was promoted to director of player personnel.\nFollowing New England’s 6–10 1995 season, Patriots owner Robert Kraft shifted control of football operations away from Parcells to Grier. In the 1996 NFL Draft Grier, with Kraft’s blessing, selected Ohio State wide receiver Terry Glenn with the seventh overall pick over the wishes of Parcells, who wanted a defensive player. The team also used their fifth round pick on Christian Peter, who had a history of violence against women, without consulting NFL security. The Patriots released their rights to Peters 24 hours after \"The Boston Globe\" reported on his record. The Patriots made Super Bowl XXXI, however, Parcells, who was upset with losing his personnel powers to Grier, left for the New York Jets. Pete Carroll was hired to replace him and Grier was promoted to vice president of player personnel. As VP of player personnel, Grier was responsible for selecting draft busts Chris Canty and Sedrick Shaw, but also chose a number of players who produced well for the Patriots, including Damien Woody, Kevin Faulk and Tebucky Jones.\nIn 2000, Carroll was fired and new head coach Bill Belichick was given the final say on personnel matters. Grier left the Patriots after the 2000 NFL Draft. One of his final duties with the team was to perform extensive scouting work on Tom Brady, who the Patriots selected in the sixth round of the draft.\nIn May 2000, Grier joined the Houston Texans, where he worked as Associate Director of Pro Scouting and senior personnel advisor until his retirement on May 1, 2016. Wade Phillips credited Grier as being instrumental in the team selecting J. J. Watt with the 11th overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. In 2017, Grier joined the Miami Dolphins as a consultant.\nPersonal life.\nGrier is the father of Miami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier, and San Jose Sharks general manager (and former National Hockey League player) Mike Grier."

UST found themselves grouped in a quadruple tie at first place with the FEU Tamaraws, the De La Salle Green Archers, and the Adamson Falcons with a 10–3 record heading into the last game of the eliminations. They were looking into a Finals berth with a win over FEU. In the game, UST was trailing, 56–68 with 3:47 remaining when a power outage struck the venue, causing game officials to reschedule the remainder of the game. It was resumed three days later with only the last three minutes left to be contested. The Tigers lost, 76–87. They had managed to come within six points in the last 1:15 from a deficit of 63–76, but the Tamaraws clamped them down with their defense forcing the players to miss their shots.\nTeam captain Udoy Belmonte and Rey Evangelista were selected to the Mythical first team, while Dennis Espino, who missed a few games including the FEU match in the second round made it to the second team.

However, the circuit begins at George Square rather than starting in Glasgow Green. The circuit then heads towards Kelvingrove Park via – amongst others – Queen Street, Argyle Street, Buchanan Street, St. Vincent Street, North Street and Sauchiehall Street. After exiting the park, the riders will pass the University of Glasgow before descending into the West End at Byres Road.

Having traversed the city, the riders will pass through the Rottenrow, High Street, Ingram Street and George Street before reaching Montrose Street, a climb at an average gradient of nearly 8%. From there, the riders will descend back into George Square, passing Glasgow Queen Street railway station and Nelson Mandela Square, before a pair of 90-degree left-handed corners onto the finishing straight. Both junior road races will be held over the circuit, with the women completing five laps and the men completing nine laps.\nThe men's road race on the first weekend will start at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh on a route, heading towards Fife via the Queensferry Crossing.

Thereafter, the route extends onto the A82 road between Hillhead and Kelvinside, before doubling back on itself, with the riders then rejoining the original circuit until High Street. An additional loop in and around Glasgow Green takes the riders alongside the River Clyde, and rejoin the original circuit via the Saltmarket.\nAll the individual time trial races will be held over three days in and around Stirling, with all the races finishing at Stirling Castle. On the first day, the men's under-23 race will be held over a route, following the A811 road out of Stirling towards Gargunnock. After a right-hand turn, the route heads towards Blair Drummond Safari Park from the south, before turning away to the left. After following several B-roads, the route returns to the A811 road in the other direction, and deviates first into Gargunnock and then for a second time towards Cambusbarron via Touch Road, passing near to Touch House.

The competition will be held from September to November 2024 (league phase), March 2025 (League A quarter-finals, and League A/B and B/C play-offs), June 2025 (Nations League Finals) and March 2026 (League C/D play-offs).\nSpain are the defending champions, having won the 2023 finals.\nFormat.\nThe UEFA national teams will be divided into four leagues, with Leagues A, B, and C featuring 16 teams each, divided into four groups of four teams, while League D will feature 6 teams divided into two groups of three. The teams are allocated to leagues based on the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League overall ranking. Each team will play six matches within their group, except for teams in League D which will play four, using the home-and-away round-robin format on double matchdays in September, October and November 2024.\nOn 25 January 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee confirmed a modified format for the Nations League following the league phase. In the top division, League A, the group winners and runners-up will advance to a new quarter-final round, played home-and-away over two legs in March 2025. In each tie, group winners will face a runner-up from a different group, with the group winner hosting the second leg. The four quarter-final winners will qualify for the Nations League Finals, retaining its previous format, which is played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings, along with the administrative home teams for the third place play-off and final, are determined by means of a draw. The host country will be selected among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also compete for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. The group winners in Leagues B, C, and D are directly promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B are directly relegated. As League C has four groups while League D has only two, the two worst-ranked League C teams will automatically be relegated (a change from the previous editions, which featured relegation play-outs between the fourth-placed teams of League C). As part of the format change, promotion/relegation play-offs will also be introduced, with the third-placed teams of League A facing the runners-up of League B, the third-placed teams of League B facing the runners-up of League C, and the two best-ranked fourth-placed teams of League C facing the runners-up of League D. The matches will be played home-and-away over two legs in March 2025 (League A/B and B/C) and March 2026 (League C/D), with the winners going to the higher league and the losers entering the lower league.\nIn all two-legged ties, the higher-ranked teams host the second leg. The team that scores more goals on aggregate is the winner. If the aggregate score is level, extra time is played (the away goals rule is not applied). If the score remains level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out is used to decide the winner.\n2026 FIFA World Cup qualification.\nThe 2024–25 Nations League will be partially linked with European qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the format confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, on 28 June 2023. The twelve group winners after the first round (group stage) will qualify directly for the World Cup. Then, the second round (play-offs) will be contested by the twelve group runners-up, along with the best four Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. The play-offs will be split into four play-off paths, played in two single-match knockout rounds (semi-finals and finals, with the home teams to be drawn), from which an additional four teams will also qualify.\nTiebreakers.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group are equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:\nNotes\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings are established according to the following criteria:\nCriteria for interim overall ranking.\nFollowing the completion of the league phase, the interim overall UEFA Nations League rankings are established as follows:\nCriteria for final overall ranking.\nFollowing the completion of the League A knockout stage and promotion/relegation play-offs, the final overall UEFA Nations League rankings are established. Within each of the groups listed below, teams are ordered based on their interim overall ranking.\nSchedule.\nBelow is the schedule of the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League.\nTo allow for enough teams to participate in the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification group stage in March 2025, the League C/D promotion/relegation play-offs will be played in March 2026. If any of the teams due to participate in these ties advance to the World Cup play-offs in March 2026, the League C/D promotion/relegation play-offs will be cancelled, and all teams will remain in their respective leagues for the following edition.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 9 February 2024, the day following the draw.\nSeeding.\n54 of UEFA's 55 national teams entered the competition. Russia, slated to participate in League C, were banned from participating as a result of their suspension from UEFA and FIFA competitions due to their country's invasion of Ukraine. The teams which finished bottom of their group in Leagues A and B, as well as the losers from the relegation play-outs of League C, from the 2022–23 season will move down a league, while the group winners of Leagues B, C and D moved up. The remaining teams stayed in their respective leagues.\nIn an interview with the Polish website \"meczyki.pl\", UEFA vice-president Zbigniew Boniek said that all ten teams from CONMEBOL, South America's football federation, could join the UEFA Nations League from the 2024–25 edition of the competition. The plans, which would act as a response to FIFA's biennial World Cup plans, were intended as part of enhanced cooperation between the two organisations following the signing of a memorandum of understanding and the opening of a joint office in London. However, such an expansion was not possible after CONMEBOL submitted a request to FIFA to maintain the round-robin qualification format for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. On 25 January 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee confirmed the format for the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League, with no South American teams to be added.\nIn the 2022–23 access list, UEFA ranked teams based on the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League overall ranking, with slight modifications: teams that were relegated in the previous season were ranked immediately below those who were promoted, and rankings shifted with the removal of Russia. The seeding pots for the league phase were based on the access list ranking. The seeding pots, draw procedure, and fixture list procedures were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on 2 December 2023.\nThe draw for the league phase took place at the Maison de la Mutualité in Paris, France, on 8 February 2024, 18:00 CET. The draw, originally planned to take place in Madrid, was relocated due to the Luis Rubiales scandal.\nFor political reasons, Armenia and Azerbaijan (due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict) could not be drawn into the same group. Due to excessive travel restrictions, only one of England, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland or Wales could be drawn with Kazakhstan. No winter venue restrictions were necessary for countries with a risk of severe winter weather, and several other potential political and excessive travel restrictions were not required because the teams concerned were either in different leagues or the same draw pot.\nPromotion/relegation play-offs.\nThe draw for the promotion/relegation play-offs will be held on 22 November 2024 in Nyon, Switzerland, along with the draw for the League A quarter-finals. For the League A/B and B/C ties, the first legs will be played on 20 March, and the second legs will be played on 23 March 2025. For the League C/D ties, the first legs will be played on 26 March, and the second legs will be played on 31 March 2026.\nOverall ranking.\nStarting from the 2024–25 season, the overall rankings are split into interim and final versions. While the interim overall rankings will be based on league rankings, explicitly ordering teams from higher leagues over those from lower ones, the final overall rankings will take into account the results of the League A knockout stage and promotion/relegation play-offs, updating the interim overall rankings accordingly.\nInterim overall ranking.\nFollowing the conclusion of the league phase in November 2024, an interim overall ranking is established based on the results of each league.\nFinal overall ranking.\nThe final overall ranking, established at the conclusion of the competition, adjusts the interim overall ranking by taking into account the results of the League A knockout stage and promotion/relegation play-offs. Teams that are promoted at the end of the 2024–25 season are ranked above those who are relegated, with the final rankings reflecting the composition of leagues for the 2026–27 UEFA Nations League."

The tournament will be held from 4 to 8 June 2025, and will be contested by the four quarter-final winners from Nations League A. The tournament will consist of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and final to determine the champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nSpain are the defending champions, having won the 2023 finals.\nFormat.\nThe Nations League Finals will take place in June 2025 and will be contested by the four winners of the League A quarter-finals, the newly introduced round for the 2024–25 season.\nThe Nations League Finals will take place over five days and be played in single-leg knockout matches, consisting of two semi-finals on 4 and 5 June (the first of which features the host team, if participating), and a third place play-off and final three days after the second semi-final on 8 June 2025.

As a result, UEFA revised the bidding process from previous tournament editions. All teams participating in League A which meet the stadium requirements must submit a proposal to host the Nations League Finals. Following the league phase, the UEFA Executive Committee will designate one pair of quarter-finalists capable of holding the tournament, with the winner automatically becoming the host. Additionally, associations from outside League A may also submit a bid to hold the tournament as a neutral host, with their bids to be considered only if no pairing of quarter-finalists can offer sufficient guarantees or satisfy the hosting requirements.\nUEFA requires the tournament to be played at two Category 4 stadiums, each with at least 30,000 net seating capacity (though there may be some flexibility regarding the second stadium). Ideally, the stadiums should not be located more than , or a two-hour bus drive, apart. If hosted by a participating team, the larger of the stadiums should hold the first semi-final (featuring the host team) and the final. The bidding timeline is as follows:\nDraw.\nThe semi-finals pairings will be determined by means of an open draw. For scheduling purposes, a host team will be allocated to the first semi-final as the administrative home team. The administrative home team for both the third place play-off and final were predetermined as the teams which advanced from semi-final 1.\nSquads.\nEach national team has to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom have to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player becomes injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he will be replaced by another player.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nSemi-final 1.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 1 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 1 /&gt;\nSemi-final 2.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 2 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\n&lt;section begin=Third place play-off /&gt;&lt;section end=Third place play-off /&gt;\nFinal.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\nA player will be automatically suspended for the next match for receiving a red card, which can be extended for serious offences. Yellow card suspensions did not apply in the Nations League Finals, including any pending suspensions from the league phase, while yellow cards issued were not carried forward to any other future international matches."

He appeared for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the team's final game of the 2021–22 season as an emergency goaltender following injuries to both John Gibson and Anthony Stolarz.\nEarly life.\nHodges was born in Shrewsbury, United Kingdom, but emigrated to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and grew up playing youth ice hockey. Hodges was forced to abandon his aspirations of playing in the National Hockey League after taking an errant puck to the head at age 12, which caused him a decrease of vision in his left eye. He later attended Southern Methodist University and played club hockey there despite his injury, and later became a goalie coach of the Allen Americans of the ECHL. During his time there, he was put into a 2016 game for the Americans, entering with 50 seconds remaining in the game.\nNHL appearance.\nOn April 29, 2022, both of the Anaheim Ducks' goaltenders, John Gibson and Anthony Stolarz, were injured during a game against the Dallas Stars. Hodges entered the game during the third period as the emergency backup goaltender, after signing a one-game contract with the NHL. Donning a Stars helmet and pads, and wearing number 68 for the Ducks without a nameplate on the back, he entered the game at 0:54 of the 3rd period with the game tied 2–2. He made two saves on three shots, allowing a goal from Jason Robertson, which wound up being the game winner to help secure a 4–2 win for Dallas. He became the first emergency backup to enter a game in the NHL since David Ayres in 2020. Hodges' performance drew applause from fans and players from both teams.\nFor his efforts, Hodges earned the third star of the game, and was able to secure his game-worn jersey and a game puck."

        "title": "Alf Mitchell (rugby league)",
        "text": "Alfred Derwent Mitchell (2 April 1910 – 28 February 1974) was a rugby league player. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in 1 test against Australia in 1935. In the process he became the 238th player to represent New Zealand. Mitchell also played one match for Auckland Province in 1935. He played for the Richmond Rovers club in the Auckland Rugby League competition from 1933 to 1936. Mitchell enlisted in the New Zealand military and fought in World War 2.\nEarly life.\nAlfred Derwent Mitchell was born in Haʻapai, Tonga on April 2, 1910. His mother was Samoan born Mele Mataele (Mitchell). His father was Ernest Hamilton Rea Mitchell. Ernest was born in Litherland, Merseyside, England and had been traveling the Pacific Islands when he met Mele. They had several children, including Ernest, Jane Eusenia Mitchell, Evelyn Jane Violet Mitchell, Sarah Evelyn Thompson, Agnes Catherine Bouchier, Caroline Beatrice Taripo, Robert Edward Mitchell, Henry Hamilton Mitchell, Dugald Trevor Mitchell, Alfred, and George Gordon Mitchell. The children were born in a variety of islands, including Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands.\nDugald, who was born in 1907 died aged just 1 in 1908. The eldest son, Ernest was killed on September 24, 1916 in World War I at the Somme when most of his siblings were very young. Ernest had been educated at Auckland Grammar School. Youngest son, George, like Alfred would go on to represent New Zealand at rugby league in the late 1930s.\nIn 1928 Alfred was sent to study at Feilding Agricultural High School near Palmerston North. That same year he equaled the high school record for the 220 yards senior championship with a time of 25 seconds.\nPlaying career.\nNavy rugby side.\nAt some point in the early 1930s Mitchell moved to Auckland and is likely to have begun working in the Naval Dockyards. He played for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves junior rugby side in 1932 against the Royal Navy junior side. It was their annual match with Mitchell named at fullback.\nRichmond Rovers rugby league club.\nOn April 19, 1933 he registered with the Richmond Rovers rugby league club. It was stated in his registration that he was living in Sandringham at the time. He was aged 23 by this time and made his debut in round 1 of the Fox Memorial Shield competition which was and still is Auckland Rugby League's premier club competition. The match was played on the main field at Carlaw Park and saw their opponents, Newton Rangers win 25-11. Mitchell played at centre but had an inauspicious start to his rugby league career when he was knocked out. The “three-quarter line was operating prettily up to the time of the unfortunate accident to Mitchell”. The New Zealand Herald reported that “Cameron and Mitchell were injured in a collision and the last-named, who had been playing well, was unable to resume”. It was later reported that he had been taken to Auckland Hospital and was living at 54 Paice Avenue in Sandringham. He then missed Richmond's next 3 matches as he recovered before returning to their first grade side for their round 5 match against Marist Old Boys on May 27. Marist won the match 12-6. In round 6 against Newton in a match won 18-10 by Richmond it was said that their “three-quarter line — Marshall, Mitchell and Bennett — always was dangerous, the ex-Feilding High School centre, Mitchell being a classy player”. The Herald said that he was “a promising footballer”. Then in their round 7, 36-12 win over Ponsonby United he scored his first try. The Auckland Star said that “Marshall, Mitchell, and Bennett make a speedy three-quarter trio, and the centre's [Mitchell's] play on Saturday was most impressive”. His “good try” came in the first half after Richmond had been dominating in open play. Then in round 8 in a 12-8 loss to City the Auckland Star said that the Richmond backs attacked across the field too much which cramped “the wingers, of whom Mitchell was the star. This player shows much promise”. While the Herald said he and Bennett “played with plenty of dash”. Round 9 saw Richmond draw with competition leaders Devonport United 5-5 at Carlaw Park. He had played once more on the wing and it was said that “Mitchell was out of his usual position, but is well equipped as a scoring man”. The following week in a 13-5 loss to Marist, the Star reported that the Richmond “wingers, Marshall and Mitchell, were very fleet and willing”.\nMitchell's form by this point in the season had caught the eye of the selectors and he was named as a reserve for an Auckland trial to be played as curtain raiser to the Auckland v South Auckland (northern Waikato) match on July 15 at Carlaw Park. In this era reserves were only allowed to be called on due to first half injuries and Mitchell was not required to play. Around this time the legendary rugby and rugby league player Bert Cooke returned to the Richmond side and as a result the young Mitchell was dropped down to their senior B side. Though he did return to the top side for round 3 of the Challenge Round series of matches on September 2. He played again the following weekend in round 4, and then again in the Stormont Shield final against Devonport United. Richmond had qualified earlier by winning the Roope Rooster competition, with the Stormont Shield being played for by the championship winners and the Roope Rooster winners each season. Richmond lost 12-7 but Mitchell was outstanding on the day. The Auckland Star, in reference to the Richmond three-quarters, said “these three club colts – Mitchell, Young, and Abbott- combined brilliantly. The first mentioned, a Feilding High School old boy, was the star of the day, his strong and clever running and defensive work stamping him a player of exceptional calibre”.\nThen on September 27 Mitchell was given the opportunity to play against the touring St George side from Sydney. They had finished runner up in the NSWRFL competition. They played seven matches on their tour. Richmond won a physical encounter 13-8 with Mitchell and Stan Prentice “the outstanding backs”, with “both playing hard football and tackling solidly, while they consistently followed up fast”. On October 10 Auckland Rugby League decided to find the ‘best club team in Auckland’ by pairing up Richmond and Marist, who had both defeated St George. Richmond won the match easily by 31 points to 8 but Mitchell, playing on the wing “left the field with a wrenched knee”. As a result he missed the final few matches of the season including Richmond's second match with St George which they also won 5-3. This brought to an end his debut season in the rugby league code.\nThe 1934 season saw Mitchell play 12 games once more for Richmond. His season was cut short slightly by injury too, though he did manage to score 6 tries for them. Mitchell's first try though did not come until round 7 when Richmond defeated Marist 20-8. Richmond were undefeated at this point, beating most teams handily. As well as scoring he also helped Bert Cooke score after Mitchell broke away “and Ted Mincham ran round on the outside of him to take the pass. Realising the opportunity Cooke dashed up in a flash and reverse passing between Mincham and himself completely baffled the defence, Cooke eventually touching down between the posts”. The week prior Mitchell had played for the Richmond reserve grade side but due to an injury to McNeil after just ten minutes of the senior game he had had to come on as a replacement and play another hour of football.\nMitchell's first try of the season came in Richmond's 26-10 win over Ponsonby United. He scored a double in a closely fought match which Richmond only led 15-10 until late when the Auckland Star said “Richmond rode to victory on the crest of a wave. In those fleeting minutes glimpses were again seen of the tenacity of one player particularly – Mitchell, the young Richmond left flank-man, who gained due reward to crown a most meritorious general performance”. The Herald said he “ran determinedly from all positions”. The following week Richmond thrashed City 43-14 and Mitchell scored a hat trick. He “was the best of the three-quarters”, but “was unlucky to receive a nasty ear injury toward the end of the game”. On July 14 in a match with Newton, Mitchell was concussed and admitted to Auckland Hospital the following morning. At the time it was stated that he was living on Wellington Street in the City. Making his debut for Richmond in the same match was future Kiwi, Eric Fletcher who had grown up in the Palmerston North area where Mitchell had spent his senior high school years. Fletcher was captaining the Palmerston North Boys' High School 1st XV in Mitchell's final year at Feilding High School in 1928. Along with Mitchell's injury in the match with Newton, Cliff Satherley, and McNeil were also injured, with Mitchell and McNeil still in hospital 2 weeks later. Though it was said that they were “progressing favourably”. Mitchell ultimately missed 5 matches for Richmond and only returned to play in the Stormont Shield final on October 13, some 4 months after his head injury. He took his place in the side ahead of Bennett and unsurprisingly he “did not seem quite in form”. Richmond won nonetheless 21-5 over Newton to claim their first ever Stormont Shield title.\nNew Zealand selection.\nThe 1935 season was to be the most significant of Mitchell's career. He played 18 matches for Richmond, scoring 8 tries, as well as making his one and only appearance for the New Zealand national side, in addition to a match for Auckland Province.\nIn Richmond's opening match for the season against Newton the ball “did not go so much the way of Mitchell” in a 27-15 win. His handling was also said to be “a little uncertain”. In round 2 Richmond beat Mount Albert United 27-13 with “Noel Bickerton, Bert Cooke, and Ted Mincham on their toes, with the result that Mitchell and McNeil sparkled”. Following a 14-6 over Newton on June 15 it was said that he had “shone for his resource”. And that Fletcher and Mitchell were prominent on attack”. His first try of the season came against Devonport in round 10. He was described as “fit and alert” along with McNeil on the other wing in a 28-0 win. He “showed plenty of dash and scored a fine try as the result of determined running”.\nOn the evening of July 19 Mitchell departed Auckland by train with the Richmond team to play Wellington in Wellington. They were staying at the Royal Oak Hotel. Mitchell scored 2 tries and played a “fine game” in their 32-4 win at Winter Show Stadium before a crowd of 3,000. Then in a round 14 win over City by 19 points to 6 Mitchell scored again and he and McNeil “played with dash on the wings”. The following week saw a ‘final’ for the Fox Memorial championship between Richmond and Mount Albert who were tied on 19 competition points after the round robin had finished. Richmond won 14-9 to claim their second championship. Mitchell disappointed in Richmond's round 1 win over Devonport in the Roope Rooster knockout competition. He had “replaced McNeil on the opposite wing, [and] did not impress greatly, and particularly in the first spell lack of understanding with Bickerton and Fletcher and erratic handling cost his side points”. He “did not play with confidence and dropped many passes”. Nevertheless he was selected to play in Richmond's semi final win over Mount Albert (20-6), before again being chosen to play on the wing in the final against Newton Rangers. Both teams were depleted as Auckland was on tour, so Richmond played without Bert Cooke, Eric Fletcher, Cliff Satherley, and Bill Telford, while Newton was missing Claude Dempsey, and Ted Brimble. Newton won a close match 10-8 with Mitchell said to have “shown up frequently for determined running”. A week later Mitchell had a big impact on the Stormont Shield ‘champion of champions’ match, scoring 4 tries in a 26-15 win over Newton. He was “the star of the match [and] scored … tries by determined and confident finish. He was too resourceful for his vis-à-vis, Pope, and Clemm, who was taken out of the pack to strengthen the defensive line”. It was said that Ted Mincham's speed “made good opportunities for Mitchell, who played a splendid game on the wing”.\nFollowing the match the Auckland team was named to play the touring Australian side. Mitchell was not initially named in the squad but due to the unavailability of fullback Norm Campbell the backline was reshuffled and Mitchell replaced C. Hall on the reserve list. However due to international rules at the time there were no replacements allowed once the match had started and unsurprisingly Mitchell was not able to take the field.\nThen on October 3 he was named to play in the 3rd and final test for New Zealand. New Zealand had won the first test at Carlaw Park in Auckland 22-14 on September 28, before losing the second at the same venue 4 days later on October 2 (8-29). Mitchell was replacing his Richmond team mate Ted Mincham who had been disappointing in the second test. The Auckland Star said of Mitchell that he is “a resolute and heady player with big match temperament”, which was slightly curious given he had never played a single game of representative rugby league. He was picked on the wing with Arthur Kay in the centres and Lou Brown on the other wing, with Cliff Hunt at fullback. The five-eighths were Brian Riley, and Mitchell's Richmond team mate Stan Prentice, while another club mate, Eric Fletcher was also on debut at halfback.\nNew Zealand was well beaten in the third test 31-8 which was also played at Carlaw Park. Mitchell had a quiet game and was barely named in any match reports. One mention of Mitchell was that “he gained useful ground with a nice dash down the side line” when the scores were locked at 8-8 in the first half. Ray Lawless then took possession and carried play thirty yards further down field before Laurie Ward of Australia saved “well with a fine tackle”. Mitchell was subsequently named in the Auckland Provincial team to play Australia during the following week indicating that he can't have played a bad game. The Star said that he was part of “a smart three-quarter line” that also included the brothers George and Wally Tittleton, with Claude Dempsey at fullback. Mitchell was again rarely involved in the match which Auckland Province lost 36-18 and was not mentioned in any of the relatively brief newspaper reports describing the play.\nTransfer to Newton and end of career.\nThese two representative matches were to be the first, and last of Mitchell's career. In 1936 he only made one appearance for Richmond on June 6 against Devonport. The match was drawn 8-8 with Mitchell scoring a try. The Herald said that “Mitchell was the better of the wingers and he scored a try for Richmond by coming into the five eighths position and receiving an in-pass, a movement which left the opposition standing. He was named in a handful of the first grade squads for Richmond but there was no mention of him in any of their match reports for the rest of the season so it is unlikely that he played many, or any further matches for them. It appears as though he transferred to rugby union at some point in the season as on August 27 he was granted a transfer to the Newton Rangers “subject to reinstatement approval by the New Zealand Council”. He made his debut for them on September 5 against City Rovers in a round one Roope Rooster loss. His registration was approved the following week, though it seems that he did not play in Newton's final match of the season which was a Phelan Shield loss to Marist. This appears to have been the end of his career as he did not play for Richmond the following season, although his brother George Mitchell did debut for them.\nPersonal life and World War 2.\nOn May 23, 1935 Alfred married Hazel Maude Barnett at St Patricks Cathedral in Auckland. After he moved to Auckland he worked at the Naval Dockyards in Auckland. Together Alfred and Hazel had three children including a son, Ron.\nIn 1938 Alfred was living at 49 Symonds Street according to the Electoral Roll with it stated that he had no occupation. Then on May 15, 1940 he enlisted in the New Zealand Military for World War 2 along with 36 other men in the Auckland city centre. He had served for three years as a territorial in the New Zealand Army before he signed up for active service.\nIn December he appeared on a list of men who were leaving Auckland to train at Trentham. They were part of the Fifth Reinforcement of the Second New Zealand Exhibitionary Force. While at war he attained the rank of Lance Corporal while with the Māori Battalion. In 1941 he was listed as living at 23 Kings Road in Mount Roskill, Auckland with his wife Hazel Maude Mitchell. His occupation at the time was recorded as “labourer”.\nAlf and Hazel would later separate and indeed they were not living together at the time of his embarkation. He had returned to New Zealand on furlough in February, 1944. She would later remarry Robert Bowden. Hazel died in Toronto, Canada on January 13, 2007. Alf was still living at the same address in Mount Roskill while Hazel was living at 16 Summers Street in Ponsonby, Auckland.\nAfter the war Mitchell settled once more in Auckland. In February 1949 he was sentenced to one month in jail for dealing in “sly grog at premises in Hobson Street” along with Mary Benson Cannon. He then moved to Wellington and lost contact with his family and by 1963 he was living at 38 Cuba Street with his occupation as labourer according to electoral rolls. He later moved and was living at 108 Wallace Street in Island Bay, Wellington and was now a pensioner.\nAlfred died on February 28, 1974, aged 63. He was buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington in the Soldiers section, plot number 3 Z/5."

        "title": "Bill Withers (snooker player)",
        "text": "W. A. \"Bill\" Withers was a Welsh player of English billiards and snooker. He defeated Fred Davis in the preliminary match for the 1937 World Snooker Championship, and lost 1–30 to Joe Davis in the quarter-finals. In the qualifying competition for the 1950 World Snooker Championship, he played Willie Smith, and lost 7–28. Withers won the Welsh amateur billiards championship in March 1928.\nBiography.\nWithers won Welsh Junior championships in swimming and boxing. In the early 1920s, he played for Preece's Billiard Hall in the local English billiards league. In 1923, his team won the Western Valley second division title, with 15 wins from 16 matches. Five years later, his team again won the league, and he won the Western Valley individual championship.\nHe also won the Welsh Amateur billiards championship, in March 1928, and turned professional afterwards. In 1928, he started representing the Queen's Saloon, based in or near Hastings, East Sussex, as a professional. Back in Wales in 1929, he made a Western Valley league record of 148, and lost 608–800 against Tom Carpenter in December. Carpenter said afterward that Withers \"gave me quite a good game.\"\nWithers was runner up to Tom Jones in the western Valley section of the Welsh Amateur billiards championship in 1931, losing 997–1,000. In 1932, chosen from amongst 274 applicants, he became the caretaker of the Penrhiwceiber Welfare Institute. He played Carpenter again in 1932, and lost their afternoon billiards game 218–962. In the evening, Withers won 620–550, and also won the two of snooker they played.\nIn 1933, Withers reportedly made a snooker break of 107 in a match at Penrhiwceiber Welfare Institute. This would have been a world record, superseding the record of 105 held by Joe Davis, if the table had been determined to meet necessary standards. Two years later, Withers played Davis at Penrhiwceiber, and, receiving 14 points start each frame, won the first two of their three scheduled frames, before Davis took the last.\nThe Billiards Association and Control Council introduced a qualifying competition for their World Snooker Championship for the first time in 1937 World Snooker Championship. With nine entries, Bill Withers and Fred Davis, both world championship debutants, were chosen to play a qualifying match, the winner to join the main event. Withers took a decisive 16–13 lead on the final evening, and the match ended with him 17–14 ahead. Withers then met Joe Davis, older brother of Fred, in the quarter-final match. According to snooker historian Clive Everton, \"Joe was furious at [the] affront to family honour. He berated Fred for losing\". Joe Davis won the first frame, and, after trailing 0–35 in in the second frame, produced a break of 59 and went on to take the frame. Withers made a 47 break in the third frame and was leading by 36 points with just the colours (worth 27 points) left but, by gaining 16 points in , Davis managed to level the score with just the left. Withers, however, the black to win the frame. Davis led 9–1 at the end of the first day, after breaks of 77 in the eighth frame and 64 in the tenth frame. Davis added the five frames from the second morning session, and, with an 84 break, the first frame of the second evening. He claimed victory at 16–1 by taking the following frame. He also won the remaining 14 to finish at 30–1, having taken 28 frames in succession. Davis made breaks of 97 and 99 on the final afternoon. The five official afternoon frames having been completed quickly, the players played an exhibition frame during which Davis made a new record break of 135, beating the 133 scored by Sidney Smith during the 1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup earlier in the season.\nIn the qualifying competition for the 1950 World Snooker Championship, Withers played Willie Smith. Smith led 10–2 after the first day and took an 18–4 lead on the second day. The final score was 28–7."

It was the fifteenth edition of the Under-19 Cricket World Cup. India were the defending champions.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka, but its hosting was pulled in November 2023 after Sri Lanka Cricket was suspended by the ICC. In the final, Australia defeated India by 79 runs to win their fourth Under-19 Cricket World Cup title.\nQualification.\nThe top eleven teams from the previous tournament qualified automatically, along with the five winners of regional qualification tournaments. \nIn November 2023, Sri Lanka was suspended by the ICC due to government interference in the country's cricket board; while Sri Lanka lost its rights to host the men's U-19 World Cup as a result, it did not affect the ability for Sri Lanka to play international matches. The suspension was lifted on 28 January 2024.\nUmpires.\nOn 10 January 2024, the ICC appointed the match officials for the tournament. Along with the sixteen umpires, Graeme Labrooy, Narayanan Kutty, Shaid Wadvalla and Wayne Noon were named as the match referees.\nSquads.\nEach team selected a squad of fifteen players for the tournament, excluding reserves, with England being the first team to name their squad.\nIn January 2024, a week before the start of the tournament, Cricket South Africa removed David Teeger from the captaincy while retaining him in the World Cup squad. In a statement, CSA explained that \"We have been advised that protests related to the war in Gaza can be anticipated at the venues for the tournament. We have also been advised that they are likely to focus on the position of the SA Under-19 captain, David Teeger, and that there is a risk that they could result in conflict or even violence, including between rival groups of protestors. CSA has a primary duty to safeguard the interests and safety of all those involved in the World Cup and must accordingly respect the expert advice of those responsible for the safety of participants and spectators. In all the circumstances, CSA has decided that David should be relieved of the captaincy for the tournament. This is in the best interests of all the players, the SA U19 team and David himself.\"\nFormat.\n16 teams were divided into four groups, namely Group A, B, C, D. The top three teams from each group advanced to the Super Six stage. The fourth-placed teams in Group A and D faced each other while the fourth-placed teams in Group B and C faced each other in the placement stage.\nIn the super-six stage top three teams from Group A and D were combined in a group while top three teams from Group B and C combined in another group. Each team carried forward the number of points, wins, NRR they have earned against their fellow super-six qualifying teams.\nEach team played two matches in the super-six stage against the opponent from the corresponding group that finished in a different group stage position (i.e. the A1 team played only D2 and D3 in the super-six. Similarly, A2 played only D1 and D3 and so forth).\nThe top two teams from each group in the super-six stage qualified for the semi-finals.\nWarm-up matches.\nWarm-up fixtures were announced on 11 December by ICC.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\nPoints table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\nPoints table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\nPoints table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\nPoints table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSuper 6.\nTeams will face each other in diagonally form in Super 6,means A1 will face D2 and D3,\nA2 will face D1 and D3,\nA3 will face D1 and D2.\nGroup 1.\nFixtures.\n---- \n---- \n---- \n---- \n---- \nGroup 2.\nFixtures.\n \n \nUnoffical final standings.\nThe nationality of the author of this table and the alternative method for placing had not been declared.\nTeam of the tournament.\nOn 12 February 2024, the ICC announced the team of the tournament."

        "title": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2022",
        "text": "The 2022 season was Glamorgan County Cricket Club's 135th year in existence and their 101st as a first-class cricket county. They finished third in the Second Division of the County Championship, nine points behind second-placed Middlesex; they also finished fourth in Group B of the Royal London One-Day Cup, a point off the quarter-final qualification places, and sixth in the South Group of the 2022 T20 Blast, six points off the quarter-final places. It was the team's third season with Matthew Maynard as head coach and their first with David Lloyd as captain. The team's overseas players were Australians Marnus Labuschagne and Michael Neser, and South African Colin Ingram, while Shubman Gill and Ajaz Patel were brought in during the season. Glamorgan played two 50-over matches at The Gnoll in Neath, their first matches there for 27 years, but for the third season in a row, they did not play any matches at Penrhyn Avenue in Rhos-on-Sea.\nFriendlies.\n2–4 April: Glamorgan v Cardiff MCCU.\nGlamorgan began their preparations for the 2022 season with a three-day match against Cardiff MCC University. With newly appointed club captain David Lloyd rested for the match, Kiran Carlson took the captaincy and led the first innings with a score of 148. Opening batsman Joe Cooke also scored a half-century, and Tom Cullen made an unbeaten 38 as Glamorgan made it to 320/7 before declaring ahead of the second day's play. Cooke then took four wickets as Cardiff MCCU managed a total of 249/6 declared, although 108 of those runs came courtesy of Glamorgan academy batsman Morgan Bevans, who finished the innings unbeaten. Glamorgan finished the second day with 26 runs for no loss. Wet conditions meant 90 minutes of play were lost on the morning of the third day. Glamorgan batted on for 29 more overs, Billy Root putting on an unbeaten 64 on the way to a total of 163/4 before they declared. Cardiff MCCU were set a nominal target of 235, but with only 13 overs possible before the close of play due to bad light, they finished on 33/1 and the match was drawn.\n31 July: Glamorgan v Wales NC.\nAhead of their defence of the One-Day Cup title, Glamorgan played a 40-over friendly against Wales National County at Sophia Gardens. The National County won the toss and chose to field, but a century from Colin Ingram and fifties from David Lloyd and Billy Root helped Glamorgan to a total of 331/7 in their allotted overs. Glamorgan Second XI batter Tom Bevan provided an anchor for the Wales NC response, hitting 80 off just 61 balls; however, Glamorgan's Joe Cooke struck with his first two balls after being brought on to bowl, and Jamie McIlroy also took two in two to remove Bevan and Andy Gorvin. Ben Kellaway and Sam Jardine provided some resistance for the National County, each scoring 39, but two wickets in an over for spinner Andrew Salter meant Wales NC were bowled out for 198, giving Glamorgan a 133-run win.\nCounty Championship.\nMatches.\n7–10 April: Glamorgan v Durham.\nExtreme weather at Sophia Gardens meant only 47 overs were possible after Glamorgan were put in to bat by Durham on the first day of the County Championship season. Stand-in opener Andrew Salter and vice-captain Kiran Carlson scored only a run each, while captain David Lloyd and new signing Sam Northeast could only manage starts, falling for less than 30 each as Glamorgan found themselves at 108/4 in the 29th over; however, Colin Ingram's unbeaten 71, aided by Chris Cooke, meant they recovered to 164/4 before rain forced the close of play.\nIngram and Cooke eventually fell for 87 and 59, respectively, and Glamorgan were all out for 234 before lunch on the second day; however, Durham faced just one over before rain and hail set in and brought play to a close for the day. Glamorgan found wickets hard to come by on day 3, as England opener Alex Lees reached 163 not out by the close of play; supported by Scott Borthwick (64) and David Bedingham (unbeaten on 71), Durham reached 348/3, a lead of 114.\nIt took just 10 overs for Glamorgan to bowl Durham out on the final morning, as they lost seven wickets for just 35 runs, six of them falling to the off spin of Salter, who finished with career-best figures of 7/45 off 12 overs. Glamorgan needed 149 runs to make Durham bat again, but were four wickets down after 23 overs; however, Carlson (61) and Cooke (85 not out) were able to stabilise the innings, helping Glamorgan to 220/5 by the close of play, and the match was drawn.\n20–23 July: Leicestershire v Glamorgan.\nThe two teams went into the match at opposite ends of the table, with Leicestershire still without a win, while Glamorgan were unbeaten in their last three and just a point behind second-placed Middlesex in the chase for promotion. Nevertheless, the home side were in good batting form, having scored 756/4 declared in their previous match away to Sussex, including double-hundreds for both Colin Ackermann and Wiaan Mulder. After winning the toss and choosing to bat, Leicestershire scored quickly on the opening day, reaching 387/5 by the close of play; although they lost Ackermann for a golden duck, Mulder picked up where he had left off in Hove, finishing the day unbeaten on 147, supported by half-centuries from Louis Kimber (68), Lewis Hill (81) and Harry Swindells (52*).\nSwindells was dismissed with the third ball of the second day, followed by Mulder less than nine overs later, but Ben Mike (91) and former Glamorgan player Roman Walker (64) helped Leicestershire to a total of 584. Glamorgan lost both of their opening batters in little more than the first six overs of their response, but Colin Ingram (46*) – in his last match before leaving for the 2022 Caribbean Premier League – and Sam Northeast (50*) helped the Welsh county reach 111/2 at the end of day 2. Ingram and Northeast batted comfortably through the morning session on day 3, both reaching their centuries on the way to a partnership of 306 before Ingram was dismissed for 139. Kiran Carlson and Billy Root followed in quick succession soon afterwards, but Northeast and Chris Cooke stabilised the innings with another 229 runs before the end of the day, as Northeast reached his maiden double- and triple-centuries in first-class cricket, leaving Glamorgan just 21 runs behind the hosts.\nNortheast soon passed Steve James' previous record of 309*, set at Colwyn Bay in 2000, for the highest score by a Glamorgan player in the County Championship. That match had also seen Glamorgan's highest total in the Championship (718/3d), but that record also fell as Cooke reached his century and Northeast reached 400, the fourth man to do so in the Championship and the eleventh in all first-class cricket. Glamorgan declared at the end of the morning session with the score at 795/5, having added 232 runs to their overnight total; Northeast finished on 410*, the third-highest score in the Championship and ninth in all first-class cricket, while Cooke was unbeaten on 191, their partnership worth 461 runs – the biggest sixth-wicket stand in Championship history and the biggest for any wicket by a Glamorgan pair. With a lead of 211, the visitors gave themselves two sessions to bowl Leicestershire out, but by the end of the first, they had just three wickets to show for their efforts; however, two wickets in an over from Michael Hogan with Leicestershire on 128 sparked a batting collapse. As in the first innings, Mulder was the home side's main source of resistance, but he managed just 59 before he was caught behind for Hogan's fourth wicket of the innings, leaving Leicestershire on 181/9 with 9.3 overs left in the match. Michael Neser, in his final Championship match before returning to Australia for pre-season with Queensland, bowled Chris Wright soon after to give Glamorgan the victory by an innings and 28 runs. The win moved Glamorgan up to second place in the Division 2 table, eight points ahead of Middlesex.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nMatches.\n2 August: Derbyshire v Glamorgan.\nGlamorgan began their defence of the Royal London Cup with a trip to Derbyshire, albeit without seamer Michael Hogan and coach Matthew Maynard, who were involved in The Hundred. The visitors made quick inroads after choosing to field first, as Timm van der Gugten and competition debutant Jamie McIlroy combined to remove the hosts' top order for just six runs in the first four overs. Van der Gugten took his third wicket of the innings to limit Tom Wood's contribution to the Derbyshire response to just 18 runs, and McIlroy got a second with the dismissal of Brooke Guest for six. Derbyshire put on another 30 for the sixth wicket before Glamorgan one-day captain Kiran Carlson caught Anuj Dal off the bowling of Joe Cooke, and David Lloyd clean-bowled Mark Watt for a duck. Mattie McKiernan put on another couple of useful partnerships, with Ben Aitchison for 18 and Sam Conners for 28, before Dan Douthwaite became the fifth Glamorgan bowler to take a wicket, dismissing McKiernan for 43, leaving Derbyshire on 108/9. Conners went in the next over, Van der Gugten taking his fourth wicket, and Derbyshire were all out for 110. With a target of 110 set by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method, Glamorgan lost openers Lloyd (12) and Sam Northeast (10) to reach 28/2 by the end of the ninth over. Despite the shaky start, though, Colin Ingram (30) and captain Carlson (54) saw the reigning champions through to victory by 8 wickets with less than 22 overs bowled.\n4 August: Glamorgan v Kent.\nGlamorgan's first home game of the One Day Cup season saw them put Kent in to bat, and they were rewarded with an early wicket as James Weighell removed Ben Compton with the second ball of the innings; however, Ollie Robinson – who had recorded an unbeaten double-century in a win over Worcestershire two days earlier – scored another half-century as part of a 90-run partnership with Joey Evison for the second wicket. Evison then combined with Alex Blake for 135 runs before Blake (66) was caught trying to slog David Lloyd, and Evison soon followed – caught and bowled by Colin Ingram – for 109. After that, wickets fell fairly rapidly; after Darren Stevens (18*) retired hurt with a calf injury, the remaining eight overs saw Kent lose four more wickets for just 31 runs, finishing with a final score of 304/8. The home side's response started shakily, with both openers again going cheaply; Northeast was out for a golden duck in the first over, while Lloyd (2) fell early in the fourth. Ingram and captain Kiran Carlson started the recovery with a 56-run partnership for the third wicket before Carlson (28) was bowled by Matt Quinn. That dismissal sparked a mini-collapse from Glamorgan, who also lost Billy Root and Joe Cooke to fall from 75/2 to 107/5 in the space of six overs; however, Tom Cullen's arrival at the crease saw him prove an effective partner for Ingram, as both notched their biggest scores in List A cricket (Cullen with 80 and Ingram with 155, his first century in the format for Glamorgan since 2017) on the way to a club record sixth-wicket partnership of 186. Ingram was eventually out with Glamorgan 15 runs shy of victory, but Cullen, Douthwaite (6) and Salter (1*) saw them through to a second victory of the season.\n10 August: Glamorgan v Yorkshire.\nGlamorgan suffered their first one-day defeat of the season with the visit of Yorkshire on 10 August. After winning the toss and deciding to bat, Yorkshire jumped out to an early score of 58 before the first wicket fell, as Will Fraine hit a run-a-ball 40, including 20 off the bowling of James Weighell. As William Luxton (19) and George Hill (9) fell, Fraine's fellow opener Harry Duke eventually put up another big partnership with captain Jonathan Tattersall, the pair adding 90 for the fourth wicket before Duke was caught by Weighell off Jamie McIlroy for 87 with nine overs to go. Wickets fell quickly after that as Yorkshire searched for rapid runs to shore up their total, but only Matthew Waite reached double-figures as the visitors managed a score of 257/9 off their 50 overs. Glamorgan's response again saw them lose early wickets, as Lloyd went for 2, followed by Ingram for 7. Captain Carlson's partnerships of 41 with Northeast and 53 with Root provided some hope of a recovery, but the Glamorgan batters failed to really get going and when Carlson was caught by Tattersall off Matt Revis for 64, the home side found themselves at 146/6. Tom Cullen and Andrew Salter put on 29 for the eighth wicket and there was a final-wicket stand of 42 between Weighell and McIlroy, but Glamorgan were eventually bowled out for 234, falling 23 runs short with just seven balls remaining.\n12 August: Northamptonshire v Glamorgan.\nGlamorgan batted first for the first time this season in their fourth match away to Northamptonshire, but were four wickets down with little over five overs bowled, losing Northeast, Ingram, Carlson and Root for single-figure scores. It was not until Joe Cooke joined David Lloyd at the crease that Glamorgan managed any real runs, as the pair put on 94 for the fifth wicket; however, the introduction of Saif Zaib into the bowling attack proved pivotal for Northamptonshire, as the left-arm spinner dismissed the entirety of Glamorgan's middle order. First he took the wickets of Lloyd (65) and Cooke (39) in successive overs, followed by Salter (20) and Cullen (24) to reduce Glamorgan to 186/8; all four were dismissed via different methods – Lloyd was caught, Cooke bowled, Salter lbw and Cullen stumped. An unbeaten 30 from Dan Douthwaite helped the visitors past 200, but he ran out of partners and Glamorgan finished on 221. Northamptonshire put on a rapid response, reaching 188 before the fall of their first wicket in the 30th over, a new club record for an opening partnership in List A cricket against Glamorgan. Despite the loss of Emilio Gay (81) and Will Young (4) in the same over, they had little left to do by that point. Ricardo Vasconcelos (104) hit the second List A century of his career, falling 8 runs short of his career best with the score at 199, but although Saif Zaib was unable to repeat his bowling heroics with the bat, Rob Keogh and Lewis McManus were able to pick up the winning runs with just under 36 overs bowled.\n14 August: Essex v Glamorgan.\nAfter being asked to bowl away to Essex, Glamorgan made an early start as James Harris took the wicket of Josh Rymell in the first over; however, the second-wicket partnership between Feroze Khushi and captain Tom Westley saw them put on 203 runs before Khushi was eventually bowled by David Lloyd for 104 off just 88 balls. Westley took a little longer to reach exactly the same score (110 balls) before he was stumped off the bowling of Andrew Salter, as Essex reached 248/3 with just under 13 overs to go. Debutant Prem Sisodiya chipped in with the following two wickets of Robin Das (11) and Aaron Beard (1), and he had the best economy of the Glamorgan attack, giving away just 42 runs in his 10 overs; however, it was Salter who took more wickets despite conceding more runs, the scalps of Aron Nijjar (0) and Shane Snater (2) completing his three on the day. Meanwhile, Grant Roelofsen finished the innings unbeaten on 69, having shared a final-wicket flurry of 38 with Raymond Toole, to set a total of 341. Glamorgan knocked off the first 50 of their required runs inside the first four overs, before losing Lloyd (30) to the first ball of the fifth; however, Northeast remained at the crease to share two more fifty partnerships with Ingram (17) and Carlson (29) as Glamorgan reached 159/3 just after the midway point of the innings. The wicket of Carlson was the first of the day for Essex bowler Luc Benkenstein, who also removed Northeast (70) in his next over. Benkenstein went on to take six wickets in the innings, finishing with club record figures of 6/42 as he helped reduce Glamorgan from 159/3 to 238 all out before the end of the 44th over. That left Glamorgan needing wins in each of their three remaining matches to keep their hopes of retaining their one-day title alive.\n17 August: Glamorgan v Lancashire.\nIn their first match at The Gnoll in Neath for 27 years (and their first home match away from Cardiff for three years), Glamorgan were put in to bat by Lancashire, who made early inroads by taking the wickets of Tom Bevan and Sam Northeast to leave Glamorgan at 5/2 inside the first four overs. Half-century partnerships between Colin Ingram and both captain Kiran Carlson (22) and Joe Cooke (40) helped them back to 129/4, but the loss of Cooke and then Ingram 16 runs later meant Lancashire were into the Glamorgan tail with less than 150 runs scored. The home side then lost Weighell (9) and Cullen (11) to consecutive balls as the innings passed 38 overs, and both Ruaidhri Smith – making his return from injury – and Prem Sisodiya fell soon after to close the innings at 177. Lancashire's openers made a quick response, putting on 83 runs before Luke Wells was trapped lbw by Carlson the ball after reaching his half-century. Wells' partner, captain Keaton Jennings, then combined with Josh Bohannon to see off the remaining 95 runs, reaching his fifty in 71 balls before finishing on 77, while Bohannon hit a four to seal the win, albeit leaving him stranded on 48.\n19 August: Glamorgan v Hampshire.\nGlamorgan won the toss in their second match at Neath two days later and elected to have a bowl at Hampshire. A flurry of early wickets fell, leaving the visitors at 54/4 after 15 overs and then 99/5 after 27, but opener Nick Gubbins led a patient fightback, assisted by Ian Holland for a partnership of 72, before Gubbins was finally out for 93 with Hampshire on 171/6. Holland then took up the baton, helping the visitors to a further 50 runs, finishing unbeaten on 63 on the way to a team total of 228/9. As in most of their previous one-day games this season, Glamorgan lost an early wicket as they began their run chase, Chris Cooke going for a five-ball duck; however, Tom Bevan and Colin Ingram combined to put on 203 runs for the second wicket before Bevan (134) was caught in the deep, falling one run shy of their List A record second-wicket partnership. Kiran Carlson (6) went soon after, but Ingram was able to put on the winning runs in his final match for the county in 2022.\n23 August: Worcestershire v Glamorgan.\nIn the final group match, Glamorgan were put in to bat by Worcestershire and lost both Tom Bevan and Chris Cooke by the end of the seventh over to reduce the Welsh side to 16/2; however, Sam Northeast rediscovered his form from July and combined with captain Kiran Carlson (41) to put on 95 runs for the third wicket. By that point, Northeast had reached his half-century off 68 balls, and it took him just 46 more to reach his maiden List A century of the season. In the same over, Billy Root reached 50 two balls quicker than Northeast had, but it took Northeast just 23 more deliveries to reach 150, surpassing his previous best List A score of 132 in the process. By the end of the 48th over, he had surpassed Jacques Rudolph's club record total of 169, set against Sussex at Hove in 2014. In the following over, Root joined Northeast in making a century by hitting five sixes off the over. The Glamorgan innings closed on a score of 356/3, with Northeast on 177 and Root on 113; their partnership was ultimately worth 245 runs, surpassing the fourth-wicket record set by Root and Cooke away to Gloucestershire in 2018. Like Glamorgan, Worcestershire lost early wickets in their attempt to chase down the total. Jake Libby (58) and Joe Leach (63) both made half-centuries as the home side made the target seem more attainable, but regular wickets – including three from Prem Sisodiya – meant Ben Cox's unbeaten 84 was in a losing cause. Glamorgan's victory meant they still had a chance of making the knockout stage, but although Yorkshire lost, Kent's victory over Lancashire meant Glamorgan finished fourth in the group.\nT20 Blast.\nMatches.\n26 May: Sussex v Glamorgan.\nGlamorgan began their T20 Blast campaign away to Sussex at Hove, where they had never won before in the 20-over format. They won the toss and put Sussex in to bat; Michael Hogan, playing in his first T20 match since 2019, took the first wicket of Luke Wright and ended up with figures of 3/26 as Glamorgan limited the hosts to 150/6 off their 20 overs. Opener Mohammad Rizwan finished unbeaten on 81, but he found partners hard to come by, as none of them managed more than 13. Glamorgan captain David Lloyd went early in their response, having contributed all 15 of their runs to that point; however, Sam Northeast combined with Marnus Labuschagne to put on 82 for the second wicket, and then with Kiran Carlson for 41 for the third, to ease the visitors towards the total. Northeast finished not out on 63 as Glamorgan reached the target with seven balls – and seven wickets – to spare.\n27 May: Surrey v Glamorgan.\nGlamorgan's second match saw them put in to bat by Surrey, and they again lost captain Lloyd (3) early. Labuschagne (20) followed in the seventh over, before Carlson (9) was caught at short fine leg by Reece Topley off the bowling of debutant Sunil Narine. At the other end, though, Northeast soon reached another half-century, and a quickfire 46 from Chris Cooke helped Glamorgan to a fourth-wicket partnership of 63. Northeast was dismissed for 65 in the penultimate over, leaving Dan Douthwaite and Joe Cooke to get the visitors to a final total of 173/5. Surrey's reply saw Hogan remove openers Jason Roy (15) and Will Jacks (6) in quick succession in the third over. That only brought Ollie Pope to the crease, though, and his partnerships with Laurie Evans, Sam Curran and Jordan Clark on the way to an individual score of 62 rescued Surrey from a score of 23/2 to 165/4. Hogan removed Curran in the 15th over to draw level with Dean Cosker as Glamorgan's highest wicket-taker in Twenty20 cricket, before surpassing Cosker with the wickets of Pope and Clark in the penultimate over to reduce Surrey to 166/6. That left the hosts needing eight runs off the final over, which Jamie Overton and Chris Jordan navigated successfully with a ball to spare.\n29 May: Middlesex v Glamorgan.\nGlamorgan continued their T20 Blast campaign with a third straight away game, and were put in to bat by Middlesex. After again losing captain Lloyd early, the visitors also lost Northeast before the end of the third over. Labuschagne's 38 got the innings back on track before leg-spinner Luke Hollman tempted him into skying a catch by Martin Andersson, and both Carlson and Cooke hit valuable 20s before they were dismissed. James Weighell then hit a late-innings 30 off 20 balls before becoming one of three Glamorgan batters to fall to Toby Roland-Jones in the final over. Chasing a total of 168, Middlesex made a good start despite Eoin Morgan not batting due to an injury suffered in the first innings; they reached 71 before the loss of their first wicket at the end of the seventh over, Max Holden going for 41. Stephen Eskinazi (34) and Hollman (7) fell in quick succession either side of the midway point of the innings, but Joe Cracknell's partnerships with John Simpson and then Andersson meant Middlesex needed just eight more runs by the time Cracknell was bowled by Labuschagne at the end of the 17th over. Morgan was padded up and ready to bat by this point, but Chris Green and Roland-Jones hit the required runs to give Middlesex a four-wicket victory with an over remaining.\nTable.\n advances to quarter-finals"

        "text": "Latvian Basketball Cup (Latvian: Latvijas kauss basketbolā), for sponsorship reasons known as Latvijas Basketbola Užavas kauss, is an annual national domestic basketball cup competition in Latvia. It is organised by the Latvian Basketball Association. After 26 years long absence, it was restored in 2020. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic the first season was cancelled. In the season 2021-22 the cup was finally played, and BK VEF Rīga won it for the first time.\nHistory.\nLatvian Basketball Cup was first organized since 1948 to 1952 and since 1960 to 1994. After former Latvia NT player Kristaps Janičenoks became the director of Latvian Basketball League, he restored the competition in 2020. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic the first season was cancelled after the first games. \nIn the 2021-22 season Užavas Beer (\"Užavas alus\") became the title sponsor of the tournament. On March 7, BK VEF Rīga won the title, beating BK Ventspils in the final, which was held in Ventspils.\n2022-23 was the second full season of the restored competition. The same amount of teams participated as the previous year - 21. There was a couple of surprising results, as second division teams BK Gulbenes Buki and Kandava/Anzāģe won the first division teams, Valmiera Glass VIA and BK Liepāja respectively, in first games of ties. However, in second games first division teams always came back on won ties to qualify for the next rounds. Draw decided that the first season finalists BK VEF Rīga and BK Ventspils met in the semi-final already. Title defenders VEF won the tie and went back to the Final, where it met BK Liepāja. Final was played on 19th January, 2023, in Liepāja.\nIn 2023-24 season the biggest surprise was the newly created team Rīgas Zeļļi reaching the final, as they won the semi-final battle against previous finalist BK Liepāja. On the other side of the bracket BK VEF Rīga and BK Ventspils met again. Although, Ventspils won the first game, VEF overcame the deficit in the second leg and easily qualified for the final once again. The final was played in the city of Jelgava. In front of almost 2500 spectators BK VEF Rīga won pretty easily and won the trophy for the third straight year.\nFormat.\nEvery basketball team in Latvia is allowed to participate in the tournament, even if it's an amateur level team. Professional teams join the tournament, starting from the quarter-finals. Tournament is played in the knockout format, teams playing against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, with the overall cumulative score determining the winner of a round. Thus, the score of one single game can be tied. Final is played in one game."

        "text": "The 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals was the final tournament of the 2022–23 edition of the UEFA Nations League, the third season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The tournament was held from 14 to 18 June 2023 in the Netherlands and was contested by the four group winners of Nations League A. The tournament consisted of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and a final to determine the champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nFollowing their win in 2021, defending champions France were unable to retain their title after finishing third in their group.\nSpain won the final against Croatia, 5–4 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time, for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nFormat.\nThe Nations League Finals took place in June 2023, and were contested by the four group winners of League A. The four teams were drawn into a five-team group (rather than a six-team group) for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group stage, thereby leaving the June 2023 window available for the Nations League Finals.\nThe Nations League Finals took place over five days and were played in single-leg knockout matches, consisting of two semi-finals on 14 and 15 June (the first of which featured the host team), and a third place play-off and final three days after the second semi-final on 18 June 2023. The semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw. All matches in the tournament utilised goal-line technology and video assistant referee (VAR) systems.\nIn the Nations League Finals, if the scores were level at the end of normal time:\nQualified teams.\nThe four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals.\nHost selection.\nThe Netherlands was confirmed as the host country by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 29 November 2022. Only League A teams could bid for the Nations League Finals, and only one of the four finals participants would ultimately be selected as hosts. UEFA required the tournament to be played at two Category 4 stadiums, each with at least 30,000 net seating capacity. The stadiums ideally would be located in the same host city or up to approximately apart. UEFA envisioned the larger of the stadiums to host the first semi-final (featuring the host team) and the final. The bidding timeline was as follows:\nOn 13 April 2022, UEFA announced that Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Wales had declared interest in hosting the tournament. As all four associations were in Group A4, the group winner was in line to be appointed as the host, provided that the associations submitted bids which meet UEFA's requirements. Poland and Wales were unable to win Group A4 following their results on 14 June 2022, leaving Belgium and the Netherlands as the remaining potential hosts. On 25 September 2022, the Netherlands won Group A4 over Belgium and advanced to the Nations League Finals, thereby automatically winning hosting rights, which were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 29 November 2022.\nVenues.\nDe Kuip in Rotterdam and De Grolsch Veste in Enschede were confirmed as the venues for the tournament on 29 November 2022. Other potential stadiums, such as the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam (the largest in the country) and the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven, were both unavailable for the tournament due to previously scheduled concerts.\nDraw.\nThe semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw on 25 January 2023, 11:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Former Dutch international Wesley Sneijder, ambassador for the Nations League Finals, drew the match pairings. The first two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing A, while the remaining two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing B. For scheduling purposes, the host team was allocated to the first semi-final as the administrative home team. The administrative home team for both the third place play-off and final were predetermined as the teams which advanced from semi-final 1.\nSquads.\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nAll times are local, CEST ().\nSemi-finals.\nNetherlands vs Croatia.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 1 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 1 /&gt;\nSpain vs Italy.\n&lt;section begin=Semi-final 2 /&gt;&lt;section end=Semi-final 2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\n&lt;section begin=Third place play-off /&gt;&lt;section end=Third place play-off /&gt;\nStatistics.\nAwards.\nPlayer of the Tournament\nThe Player of the Finals award was given to Rodri, who was chosen by UEFA's technical observers.\nGoal of the Tournament\nThe Alipay Goal of the Tournament was decided by online voting. A total of four goals were in the shortlist, chosen by UEFA's technical observers: Federico Dimarco (against Netherlands), Donyell Malen (against Croatia), Mario Pašalić (against Netherlands) and Bruno Petković (against Netherlands). Petković won the award for his goal in the semi-final.\nDiscipline.\nA player would have been automatically suspended for the next match for receiving a red card, which could have been extended for serious offences. However, no players received a suspension during the Nations League Finals. Yellow card suspensions did not apply in the Nations League Finals, including any pending suspensions from the league phase, while yellow cards issued were not carried forward to any other future international matches."

As a senior in 2019, he went 8-2 with a 1.17 ERA and 102 strikeouts over 65 innings alongside batting .409 with three home runs. He was selected by the Houston Astros in the 18th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. Campbell originally committed to play college baseball at Tulane University, but due to changes in admission requirements, he was unable to attend, and instead enrolled at Oklahoma State University.\nAs a freshman at Oklahoma State in 2020, Campbell was named to the team's starting rotation and made four starts before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He returned to the starting rotation for the 2021 season, and on May 8, 2021, he threw the 11th no-hitter in school history in a 19-0 win over the Kansas Jayhawks, striking out 11 batters. He finished the 2021 season having started 13 games, going 7-2 with a 2.57 ERA and 102 strikeouts over 84 innings. He also appeared in 42 games as a designated hitter, batting .269 with one home run, and was one of the five finalists for the John Olerud Award. Following the season's end, he was named to the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team. For the 2022 season, Campbell stopped playing as a two-way player, and began focusing only on pitching. Over 17 games (16 starts) for the season, he went 9-2 with a 3.82 ERA and 141 strikeouts over innings.\nProfessional career.\nCampbell was selected by the Cleveland Guardians with the 37th overall selection in the 2022 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the team for $1.70 million.\nCampbell did not play in 2022 after signing, and missed all of the 2023 season after undergoing elbow surgery. \nOn March 20, 2024, the rookie–level Arizona Complex League Guardians placed Campbell on the full–season injured list. The transaction ended his season before it began, and further delayed his professional debut."

        "text": "Tim Horton is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the special teams coordinator and running backs coach at the United States Air Force Academy. He has also had coaching stops at Appalachian State University, Kansas State University, the University of Arkansas, Auburn University, and Vanderbilt University.\nPlaying career.\nHorton played wide receiver and returned punts during his career at Arkansas from 1986 to 1989. He was a four time letterwinner, and three-year starter. As a senior, Horton was a team captain and earned second-team All-Southwest Conference honors. He helped lead the Razorbacks to four straight bowl appearances and back-to-back Southwest Conference titles in 1988 and 1989.\nHorton was a two time all-state running back in football and a two-time all-state sprinter in track &amp; field while attending Conway High School in Conway, Arkansas. He was inducted to the Conway High School Wampus Cat Hall of Fame in 2019, and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2021.\nCoaching career.\nAppalachian State.\nFollowing Horton's playing career, he joined the coaching staff at Appalachian State. In his time with the Mountaineers, Horton helped guide the program to a 67–32 record during eight seasons, including Southern Conference championships in 1991 and 1995 and five NCAA Division I-AA playoff appearances. He coached the wide receivers and tight ends in his first three seasons, before transitioning to the running backs prior to the 1993 season.\nAir Force (1st stint).\nHorton was hired as the wide receivers coach at Air Force prior to the 1999 season. He held this position through the 2004 season, before switching over to running backs for the 2005 season.

While working for Houston Nutt at Arkansas, Horton coached the running backs and served as the recruiting coordinator. He was recognized by Rivals.com and ESPN.com as one of the nation's top recruiters. In 2007 he coached Darren McFadden to his second straight Doak Walker Award and his second straight runner-up finish for the Heisman Trophy.

Horton also coached McFadden's back-up RB and top return specialist Felix Jones to All-America honors in 2007, plus Horton coached starting fullback and future NFL player Peyton Hillis. After Nutt resigned following the 2007 season, Horton was retained by new Arkansas head coach Bobby Petrino. Horton would coach some of the best running backs Arkansas has ever had, to include Dennis Johnson, Michael Smith, Jonathan Williams and Knile Davis, all of whom earned all-SEC honors. After Petrino was fired in April 2012, Horton stayed on under interim head coach John L. Smith, but was not retained by new head coach Bret Bielema when he was hired following the 2012 season. \nAuburn.\nFrom 2013 through 2016, Horton coached the running backs for Gus Malzahn and the Auburn Tigers football team.

Mason and Johnson both earned SEC offensive player of the year honors, and Mason was a Heisman Trophy finalist.\nAs the special teams coordinator, Horton coached kicker Daniel Carlson, who was the SEC's special teams player of the year. Horton became the only assistant in league history to coach the SEC offensive and special teams players of the year in the same season.\nVanderbilt.\nHorton spent two years (2019 – 2020) as the running backs coach for Derek Mason at Vanderbilt. He coached future NFL running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn.\nAir Force (2nd stint).\nFollowing the dismissal of the Vanderbilt staff, Horton returned to Air Force as the special teams coordinator and running backs coach in January 2021.\nPersonal life.\nHorton's father, Harold Horton is a former Razorback player and assistant coach, and won two NAIA national championships (1984, 1985) as the head coach at Central Arkansas from 1982 to 1989.

It is scheduled to take place in the United States, tentatively from September to October 2031. This will be the first time the tournament is held in the Americas.\nHost nation selection.\nUSA Rugby officially launched their bid to host the 2027 or 2031 editions of the Rugby World Cup in October 2021, while in February the same year, England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland had considered a joint bid to host the 2031 edition. At the time, the United States was the only bidder for the 2031 Rugby World Cup and the following month (November 2021) were in an “exclusive targeted dialogue” with World Rugby with regard to hosting the 2031 edition.\nIn April 2022, President Joe Biden sent a letter of support to World Rugby affirming his support for the bid. On May 12, 2022, World Rugby announced the United States had won the bid to host the 2031 Rugby World Cup.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nExpansion &amp; Format.\nThe Rugby World Cup will expand from twenty to twenty-four teams at the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. The 2031 Rugby World Cup will be the second edition of the Rugby World Cup to include twenty-four teams. There will be six pools consisting of four teams. A round of sixteen will be introduced prior to the quarter-finals. A total of 52 matches will be played during the six week tournament.\nDates.\nThe Rugby World Cup typically takes place from September to October. In the United States, this would overlap with the 2031 NFL season and the 2031 Major League Soccer season. As many of the proposed venues are NFL stadiums, MLB stadiums and MLS stadiums, there is the possibility of the tournament being held during the summer months (June–September) to minimize clashes with other leagues' schedules, mainly that of the NFL. However, a determination of scheduling is yet to be made.\nCandidate host cities.\nA total of 25 cities have been shortlisted for the 2031 Rugby World Cup. Shortlisted cities include Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

The federation also cancelled the 2020 event of one of its two official junior world championship tournaments, the IIHF World U18 Championship. On 21 March, IIHF publicly announced that the senior men's world championships had also been cancelled.\nThe 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were played behind closed doors.

The tournament was postponed to later in the year and moved to Calgary, where it was played behind closed doors.\nConcerns over Omicron variant led to the cancellation of multiple IIHF tournaments in December 2021. The IIHF cancelled all tournaments scheduled for January 2022, including the 2022 IIHF World Women's U18 Championship for the second year in a row. The decision led to criticism by players and officials for stifling the growth of women's hockey, especially as the men's 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were still going on as scheduled. After multiple games were declared a forfeit due to positive tests, the IIHF cancelled the 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships on 29 December 2021.\nEurope.\nAs a result of the German government's ban on large events, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga announced on 10 March that it would cancel the remainder of its season, marking the first time in the league's history a champion would not be crowned.

On 8 June, the NHL authorised teams to reopen their training facilities under COVID-19 protocol. On 10 July, the NHL announced that the games for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs would be hosted in two hub cities, Edmonton, and Toronto. Toronto's Scotiabank Arena hosted games for the Eastern Conference's playoff qualifiers, quarterfinals, and semi-finals; while Edmonton's Rogers Place hosted the same rounds for the Western Conference's, in addition to both conference's finals, as well as the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals. Players that entered the hub city \"bubbles\" were required to agree to protocols governing how camps operate, and the environment around where games are played, separating the hubs into \"secure zones\".\nFrom 28 to 31 July 24 NHL teams each played one exhibition game before the Stanley Cup playoff qualifiers began on 1 August. The league conducted over 7,000 tests for COVID-19 during the first week of return-to-play, with the NHL reporting no positive cases. The playoff qualifiers were concluded on 9 August, with the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning the day after. The entire 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs (including the qualifier rounds) were scheduled to last 66 days. Play ended on 28 September in Edmonton, when the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup.\nThe 2020 NHL Entry Draft was held remotely after being postponed. The draft began with the New York Rangers selecting Alexis Lafrenière with the first overall pick.\n2020–21 season.\nOn 20 December 2020, the NHL announced its 2020–21 season would begin on 13 January 2021 and run for 56 games per team, ending on 8 May. To reduce travel and overcome international travel restrictions, all teams were re-aligned into four geographical divisions, with three consisting exclusively of U.S. teams, and all seven Canadian teams placed in a single North Division. In the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the top four teams in each division played each other in the first two rounds, and the four division champions were reseeded based on their regular-season point totals for the semi-final round (which replaced the traditional conference finals). The Canadian government granted a travel exemption for U.S.-based teams for the remainder of the postseason. Teams were also allowed to temporarily have a \"taxi squad\" of reserve players, who could be called upon in the event a team player is unfit to play.\nThe season did not include the Global Series, Winter Classic, Stadium Series, and All-Star Game, which were all postponed by the league. The NHL scheduled two outdoor games at the Edgewood Tahoe Resort in Stateline, Nevada, which were intended as television showcases with no spectators, to supplant the scrapped special events. In addition, the annual Kraft Hockeyville USA preseason game was postponed by one year; it was eventually rescheduled for 3 October 2021, to be played in El Paso, Texas.\nThe 2020–21 ECHL season began on 11 December. At first, only 13 of its 24 member teams played, however, the Fort Wayne Komets decided just days before the season started to participate, and indeed ended the season by sweeping the South Carolina Stingrays to win the Kelly Cup. The 2021 AHL season began on 5 February, with three teams opting out, six others playing home games in alternate locations, and the two teams based in Ontario not allowed to play home games. There were no playoffs (except in the Pacific Division) and once again no playoff champion was crowned. The Hershey Bears won the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy as the league's regular season champion.\nHockey Canada cancelled its national championships for the second season in a row in February 2021, citing that it was \"the safest decision given the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic at a local level, as well as the uncertainty around each region being able to compete for a national championship.\" The CJHL's Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL), Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL), and Superior International Junior Hockey League (SIJHL) cancelled their seasons in 2021, citing uncertainties or a lack of government approval to commence or resume play \nThe QMJHL and WHL were the only two CHL leagues to go on with play this season; the QMJHL initially took advantage of the \"Atlantic Bubble\" for its Maritimes division, and was the only CHL league to play a postseason. However, the Maritimes division was disrupted by new health orders and travel restrictions which prevented interprovincial games, and their regular season was halted in mid-April—with all Nova Scotia-based teams becoming ineligible to compete in the playoffs, and the first round consisting of a nine-game round robin between the three New Brunswick-based teams to determine who would play the Charlottetown Islanders for the Maritimes division championship. They would join three Quebec-based teams for the President's Cup semifinals, with all games from then on being played at Videotron Centre in Quebec City. The WHL played a shortened season between divisional opponents (with three divisions aligned to consist exclusively of Alberta, British Columbia, and U.S.-based teams respectively), used hub cities for teams based in British Columbia and the East division (Manitoba and Saskatchewan), and cancelled its playoffs due to interprovincial travel restrictions. The OHL was unable to play a 2020–21 season at all due to the Ontario stay-at-home order, and the CHL cancelled the Memorial Cup for the second consecutive season.\n2021–22 season.\nThe 2021–22 NHL season returned to a normal schedule and divisional alignment, and the league anticipated that every team would be able to host spectators without capacity restrictions by the start of the season.\nThe league announced COVID-19 protocols with a focus on vaccination in September 2021, allowing teams to suspend players without pay if they are \"unable to participate in club activities\" due to a COVID-19 infection or inability to travel resulting from not being fully-vaccinated (outside of religious and medical exemptions), and additional quarantine requirements and restrictions for non-vaccinated players. It was reported that the \"overwhelming majority\" of players had already been vaccinated over the offseason; in October 2021, league commissioner Gary Bettman stated that only four players in the league were not fully-vaccinated. On 18 October 2021, San Jose Sharks player Evander Kane was suspended for 21 games after it was found that he had submitted a forged vaccine record to the league.\nBy early-November, outbreaks had begun to impact teams, and result in players being deactivated via placement on the NHL's \"COVID-19 protocol list\". Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby, one of the NHL's biggest stars, and teammate Brian Dumoulin tested positive for COVID-19 on 3 November 2021 and head coach Mike Sullivan was later placed in protocol. Crosby had just returned from wrist surgery that forced him to miss the first eight games of the regular season.\nDue to the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to more player unavailability and a large number of games to be postponed, the NHL postponed all games that had been scheduled for 22 and 23 December, and extended the usual break for Christmas and Boxing Day. That break was later extended again through 27 December, when the NHL announced that most teams would resume play on 28 December, and that the \"taxi squad\" rule from the previous season would be reinstated. The NHL has postponed a number of games or moved them to U.S. cities, specifically citing the implementations of capacity restrictions in multiple Canadian provinces.\nOn 22 December, the NHL and NHLPA also announced that they would withdraw from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing COVID-19 concerns and the need to use the reserved break in the schedule to make up postponed games. Also in December 2021, the AHL announced that its all-star game and skills contest would not be held as scheduled. The Laval Rocket was to have hosted the event on 6 and 7 February 2022.\nOn 19 January, the NHL announced new dates for 121 games, or about 9 percent of the season total. Of those, 98 games had been postponed and 23 others were relocated to different dates to avoid new conflicts. Also, 95 of the 121 games were to be played during the Winter Olympics at which NHL players were to have participated.\nOn 2 February, it was disclosed that Alex Ovechkin had tested positive for COVID-19 and would miss the 2022 NHL All-Star Game, for which he had been selected as team captain for the Metropolitan Division team."

By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA rankings making her the first player representing Kazakhstan, male or female, ever to reach this milestone.\nAshleigh Barty was the reigning champion, but she retired from professional tennis in March 2022.\nBarty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka’s absences (both due to pregnancy) meant that Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin were the only former champions left in the draw. They met in the first round, with Azarenka winning in straight sets.\nJeļena Ostapenko became the first Latvian to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals.\nThis tournament marked the final professional major appearance of former world No. 1 and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbiñe Muguruza. She lost in the first round to Elise Mertens.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 9 January 2023.

        "title": "1942 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1942 Auckland Rugby League season was its 34th. The season was extremely hampered by World War II with so many men away at war. The Auckland Rugby League reduced the number of teams in the senior grade from 9 to 6, and there were few reserve grade matches and no senior B competition what so ever. Many clubs were forced to focus on their junior teams and schoolboy sides.\nThe Fox Memorial Shield was won by Manukau for the second time in its history following its first title in 1936. They finished with a 13 win, 2 loss record, comfortably ahead of the amalgamated City-Otahuhu side in second place with a 10 win, 5 loss record. The City-Otahuhu side had won all 5 of their first round matches to win the Rukutai Shield. The Roope Rooster was won by Richmond Rovers who beat the amalgamated Marist-North Shore side 13-6 in the final. This was the 7th time Richmond had won the Roope Rooster trophy. A week later the Stormont Shield was won by Manukau who defeated Richmond 11 to 5.\nThe J. F. W. Dickson medal for a senior player went to Owen Hughes of the City-Otahuhu club who was adjudged the most sportsmanlike player in the code for the season, while the junior medal was awarded to Arnold Jones of the Glenora club. They were presented at the board meeting on September 23. The following week the veteran player Lindsay Simons of the North Shore club was also presented with a medal.\nThere were only three representative matches played. On July 11 Auckland hosted South Auckland (northern Waikato) at Carlaw Park and won 49 to 16. Then on August 29 Auckland Māori (Tamaki) beat Auckland Pākēha 10 points to 8. The same two teams met again on September 28, this time a 23-all draw was the result. The year was also marked by the deaths of several players while at war.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League News.\nARL Chairman nomination.\nOn March 6 the trustees of Carlaw Park announced that Mr. J. W. Watson, J.P., had been nominated for the chairmanship of the Auckland Rugby League control board to succeed Mr. G. Grey Campbell, who was not available for re-election due to “business and health reasons and was retiring from the position after nine years. Watson was the manager and director of Heards Limited and had been a “keen supporter of rugby league for many years”. He had been “actively associated with the Manukau club and of late years has been a member of the New Zealand Rugby League Council, representing Wellington [Rugby] League”. Mr. Grey Campbell was nominated by Mr. John A. Lee to succeed him as president as he was retiring from the position.\nAnnual report.\nOn March 23 the Auckland Rugby League released its annual report. It showed that despite the “overshadowing effect of the war, it was able at the end of the season to show a profit of £309”. There had been a “consensus of opinion of the leaders of governments and military authorities... that recreational sport such as football should be carried on”. It was said that the “war made serious inroads among the players, while in other directions rugby league played its part in the war effort in New Zealand. Since the commencement of the war Carlaw Park has, without cost, been placed at the disposal of many essential units engaged in war activities”. The accounts showed that the main source of revenue, which was from gate receipts had dropped from £4486 in 1940 to £3923 in 1941 which was a drop of £563. However the working account only showed a reduction of £271. In terms of referees it was noted that over 10 percent of referees had enlisted, and many others were engaged in war production work and therefore unable to work on Saturday’s. This had meant that on many occasions some members had had to referee two or three matches on a single day.\nAnnual meeting.\nThe 32nd annual meeting was scheduled for March 25 at the Auckland Rugby League rooms in the Grey Buildings in Courthouse Lane on Wednesday at 7:45 pm. President John A. Lee spoke at the meeting and said that it was “apparent that the war had made inroads, not only into the administration of the game, but also to the clubs, which had lost the services of many good players. “You have a duty to perform in carrying on the game and in providing competition for all who remain”. He also paid tribute to the retiring chairman Mr. G. Grey Campbell. Campbell said that “he had spent nine happy years as chairman and he was now handing over the reins of office at a difficult time. However, he was assured of the assistance of a very loyal crew of officials. He thanked Messrs. I. Culpan (secretary) and J. E. Knowling (treasurer) for their loyal support. Mr. J. W. Watson was welcomed as the newly appointed chairman. The following officials were elected: Patron, Mr. J. B. Donald; president, Mr. G. Grey Campbell; vice-patrons, Messrs. J. F. W. Dickson, J. A. Lee, M.P.; chairman, Mr. J. W. Watson; deputy-chairman, Mr. E. J. Phelan; auditors, Messrs. Garrard and Bennett; hon. solicitor, Mr. H. M. Rogerson; secretary, Mr. I Culpan; treasurer, Mr. Mr J. E. Knowling, Mr. R. Doble; management committee, Messrs. J. W. Probert, E. Chapman, Jim Clark, V. Rose, T. Wilson. T. Davis, William Mincham, and R. Doble.\nOn April 16 a “Presentation Social Night” was held to honour the retired chairman, Mr. G. Grey Campbell at Lewis Eady Hall on Queen Street. Chairman Mr. J. W. Watson presided over the evening and the main presentation of a silver tea service was given by Mr. E. J. Phelan, the deputy chairman. Phelan “related many instances of the business sagacity of” Campbell, “who had put into the management of the code all his powers ad talents”. During the evening other presentations were made to Campbell, including the Junior Board (secretary’s satchel), schoolboys (dinner service), ladies (barometer), referees (clock), and senior clubs (two fireside chairs). The chairman of the Auckland Rugby Union, Mr. A. A. Baker said “I would like to pay a high tribute to the sportsmanship of Mr. Campbell... it had been a pleasure to have worked with him in the interests of sport generally”., while Mr. F. Baker, chairman of the Auckland Football Association, said his “common sense had made for harmonious relations among the winter sportsmen”. Campbell in his reply thanks Ivan Culpan, and Mr. J. E. Rowling for their help and also his wife for her support.\nSenior competition amalgamations and protest.\nAt the April 8 meeting of the board of control it was announced that nine teams had been nominated for the senior grade competition however a decision was not made immediately as to whether all the teams would be accepted without learning more about their relative strength first. Mr. R. Doble said that it was originally intended to limit the senior championship to seven clubs, with a preference for six well-balanced teams. It was decided to defer the draw until the following Wednesday (April 15).\nA deputation from an army unit regarding the entry of a team in the senior grade was heard. They said that a number of prominent players would be available each Saturday, but several of them were registered with local clubs. Chairman Watson said transfers to the Army team from local clubs would not be favourably considered.\nAt the April 15 board meeting it was decided to omit the Manukau club from the senior grade, and also not accept the nomination from a military team from the motor transport pool. The Motor Transport Pool team later decided to enter a team to play rugby union. They would ultimately win the Gallaher Shield (the ARU senior club rugby competition) later in the year. Otahuhu Rovers however did have their nomination accepted as they had sent in a list of 25 players, most of whom were engaged in essential trades. Mr. William Mincham expressed disappointment at the “laxity of the clubs in submitting the personnel of teams. He said every support had been given to club secretaries but it was apparent that the full strength of clubs was not known”. The board would look at the teams on the field in a preliminary round on April 18 to see their strength and then decide on the final sides to begin the championship proper.\nFollowing the preliminary games on April 18 the ARL control board met in the evening and decided to merge several senior sides “so that the identity of the clubs will not be lost during wartime competition”. The clubs who would merge were North Shore and Marist, Newton and Mount Albert, City and Otahuhu, while Manukau, Richmond, and Ponsonby would remain as stand alone senior sides. It was remarked that the Mount Albert club did not approve of joining up with the Newton club. In fact prior to their first combined match the Mount Albert club published a notice in the Auckland Star that stated “patrons and members of the Mt. Albert Rugby League Club kindly note that the Mt Albert-Newton team is in no way connected with the well-known Mt Albert Rugby League Football Club which plays under the blue and gold colours”.\nPrior to the start of the season the Otahuhu club received a letter from the military authorities that said “we cannot let men off for sport if it is not their weekend free. It would not be fair to my officers and men if special leave were granted for football”. The Auckland Rugby League considered the letter at their weekly meeting on April 30 and they had two other similar letters from the camps at Papakura and Avondale.\nThe second week of preliminary matches was something of a mess when neither the North Shore nor Mount Albert clubs contributed any players to their amalgamated sides leaving Newton and Marist to play as themselves. While in the City-Otahuhu combined side both clubs fielded their own team for a half each. Following the weekend the ARL board met to review the amalgamation scheme. Chairman Watson said “he had met members of the two clubs concerned, and thought that the prospect of the dissenting clubs (North Shore and Mount Albert) as at present constituted, coming into the scheme most remote”. Mr. E. J. Phelan “urged that cooperation was desired”. On May 13 the ARL received a letter from the Mount Albert club asking them to reconsider the amalgamation scheme. The board decided to replay that the decision could not be changed. It was decided to run the senior competition for three rounds with the board holding the right to curtail the season if it was necessary.\nIn June after the 6th round of matches North Shore Albions called a special meeting and eventually decided to confirm their amalgamation. Until that time none of their players had taken part in any matches played by the side. Negotiations were carried out by Messrs. Joe Sayegh (president), and Jack Kirwan (secretary) who represented the Marist club, while Messrs. Horace H. Hunt, and J. Mann represented the North Shore club. It was then reported that six North Shore players would be available for the following Saturday. Chairman of the ARL, Mr. Watson said that the North Shore club had agreed to the scheme for the duration of the war.\nAvailability of senior players in military camps.\nDespite requests early in the season for senior league players to be made available for Saturday games the league was repeatedly told that this would not be possible. Then during the season the Otahuhu club requested leave for one of their players but the commanding officer of the camp said \"I regret I am unable to allow any men extra leave for sport other than for Rugby Union and hockey teams on Saturdays\". Upon seeing the letter at the board meeting on June 24 chairman Mr. J. W. Watson, \"thought the time had arrived when strong action should be taken on this question of the feeling in some military quarters against the league code. He realised that any complaint might be visited upon the player concerned, but action should be taken in view of the Minister of Defence, Mr. Fred Jones, that no bias would be shown towards league players and that leave would be granted to them equally with any other game of football\". Members spoke strongly on the issue and it was decided to communicate directly with the Minister of Defence immediately.\nRefusal for league team to travel.\nIn August a trip to Wellington by the Manukau league side to play a Wellington was not allowed by the railway authorities, however one by a rugby union team was allowed. Chairman Watson “went on to detail efforts made in trying to overcome this alleged affront to rugby league. He had interviewed railway officials at Auckland who admitted that permission had been granted for an Auckland Rugby Union team to go to Wellington for a football match, while a similar application for a league team had been refused. They said they could not give any reason for this discrimination, and were instructed by Wellington not to give any reason”. Chairman Watson “concluded that protests had been forwarded to prominent members of Parliament and of the War Cabinet”. A week later a telegram was received at the meeting of the board of control on September 2 from the Minister of Railways, Mr. Bob Semple, “stating that permission had been granted for the Māori league team [Manukau] to visit Wellington on September 12 for the purpose of playing a match on [the] Basin Reserve”. Chairman Watson said that “the question of the application had been placed before the acting Prime Minister, the Hon. Daniel Giles Sullivan, and all connected with the code would be pleased with the amended decision”.\nRichmond v M.T.P. proposed match.\nOn October 6 it was reported that Chairman Watson had stated that “at the request of Military Transport Pool (winner of the Gallagher Shield, Auckland rugby’s chief club trophy) a match has been arranged for next Saturday at Carlaw Park against Richmond (holder of the Roope Rooster)”. The gate was said to be divided between the M.T.P. regimental fund, the St. John Ambulance and the Auckland Rugby League. The match would be clashing with the rugby match between Auckland and the Third New Zealand Division military side. The ARL even began to advertise the match in the newspapers despite no assurances from the ARU that the match would be permitted on their part. The president of the M.T.P. Rugby Football Club, Captain J. Todd was surprised by the advertisements and “he declared that the match had been definitely cancelled last Monday. You can take it from me that the M.T.P. team cannot play”. He went on to say “owing to unforeseen circumstances he had considered that it was not possible for his club team to take part in the match. For that reason he had communicated to the chairman of the Auckland Rugby League last Monday the fact that the M.T.P. team would not be available this Saturday. The following day it was reported that “as far as the league is concerned the match between M.T.P. and Richmond is definitely on, not withstanding Captain Todd’s statement, said Chairman Watson. He went on to say “I would like to point out that M.T.P. men are rugby league players. “We know” added Mr Watson that the team is still anxious to play this game”. Five of the M.T.P. team had been selected for the Auckland representative side in their match. Watson said “it is important to bear in mind that this is an Auckland Rugby Union representative team and not a military team. We know of no authority that any military officer has empowering him to determine the code of football soldiers under his command should play when away from military duties... as members of the M.T.P. team have been available to play rugby union football every Saturday of the past season we can only presume that there should be no military duties to interfere with the personnel of the team playing the game they desire on any one particular Saturday”. On October 7 at the ARL board meeting it was decided that the match would most likely be cancelled and that a final decision would made on the 8th. It was announced later in the afternoon that the match would no longer be able to proceed.\nJust days later a match was advertised to be played at Western Springs between a side named “All Golds” and Auckland Māori. The side listed for the All Golds featured a large number of rugby league players who had spent the season in the M.T.P. side so it appears to be an effort on their part to arrange their own match. The match was being provided by the NZ RL Old Boys’ Association which had been established a year prior. The Auckland Rugby League stated in an advertisement that the match was not under their jurisdiction, “nor has it our authority”.\nReserve grade competition.\nDue to the low numbers of senior players the competition did not begin and a decision on it running at all was deferred until following the 2nd round of senior matches. Ultimately there was no proper reserve grade competition though some reserve grade sides played matches during the season.\nCarlaw Park.\nCarlaw Park continued, as it had done in previous years to be used by the military for training purposes. It was used on January 18 by the Auckland City Battalion for an all day parade. During the offseason the lease of the ground had been secured for a further 21 years. At the board of control meeting on April 8 it was stated that “satisfactory arrangements were being made for the erection of suitable dispersal gates for the speedy release of patrons at Carlaw Park in the event of an emergency”. It was decided to make entry for Carlaw Park matches sixpence for soldiers and visiting men of Allied nations. Returned soldiers would be admitted for free. The ordinary entry fee was 1 shilling for the ground, sixpence for ladies and sixpence for the grandstand. At the May 27 board meeting the room rearrangement underneath the Carlaw Park grandstand was discussed as the board had given 3 of them to the E.P.S. fire service. At the board meeting on July 29 Mr. W. Foreshaw was presented with a wallet and a cheque to thank him for being in charge of the players’ gate at Carlaw Park for 21 years as a volunteer. Chairman Watson said “the great success of the code had been due to the services rendered by men of the stamp of Foreshaw”.\nWar effort contributions.\nAt the board meeting on May 27 Mr. J. W. Probert said that “the time has arrived for the people to do all they can for the Liberty Loan”. He said “that though the league had given the Home Guard the use of Carlaw Park and the Fire Section of the E.P.S. the free use of rooms under the grandstand, the league could still do more in this time of national stress. The need was urgent and he proposed that the board take up £100 in the loan”. Chairman Mr. J. W. Watson “was in full agreement with the proposal, to which the board agreed”. Days later the Reserve Bank recorded that it had received £100 for the Liberty Loan from the Auckland Rugby League.\nOld timers’ passes.\nIt was decided on April 22 that former senior players would be given senior match passes for the season based on how many senior games they had played. For 50 matches they would receive a one season pass; 60, two seasons; 70, three seasons; and so on up to 100 games with a limit of a six years’ pass to any player.\nLife membership.\nA subcommittee met at the board meeting on June 11 to discuss the criteria for life membership. The committee was chaired by Mr. G Grey Campbell (the retired board chairman). Their recommendations “included that the honour, character and standing of the recipient must be taken into account; that the League should have the right of recalling the honour if the recipient brought dishonour upon the code, and that life membership only be granted on a four-fifths majority of the board”. The recommendations of the subcommittee were all approved.\nThomas (Scotty) McClymont.\nOn April 1 Thomas McClymont was nominated by the Richmond Rovers club for life membership of Auckland Rugby League and it was agreed to. He had played 100 matches for the Ponsonby United seniors from 1913 to 1924, along with 17 appearances for Auckland (1919-22), and 16 for New Zealand (1919-24). He had also coached Richmond Rovers for several seasons in the mid 1930s as well as coaching Auckland and New Zealand. In 2007 he was inducted into the New Zealand Legend of League. Messrs R. Doble and T. Davis supported the recommendation and “both drew attention to the long and faithful service Mr. McClymont had given to the code, “As a selector, player, and advisor”, said Mr. Doble, “he has proved an outstanding personality in the code”.\nMr. George Chapman.\nOn May 6 life membership was granted to Mr. George Chapman of Ellerslie in recognition of 30 years service to the code. His nomination was by the junior control board.\nAuckland representative side.\nAt the May 13 board of control meeting Mr. A. J. (Dougie) McGregor, Bill Cloke, and Stan Prentice were appointed Auckland selectors for the season. All three were past Auckland club, representative, and New Zealand team players.\nObituaries.\nLaurence Douglas Mills.\nIt was reported in mid January that Private Laurence Douglas Mills had been killed in the Western Desert campaign of North Africa on December 1, 1941. Mills was the son of Ephraim and Irene Winifrede Mills of Grey Lynn. He had been a Richmond schoolboy player and moved through the various grades until debuting for the senior side in 1938. He played for Richmond seniors from 1938 to 1940, scoring 26 tries. He also represented Auckland Pākehā in 1940, and was selected for the aborted New Zealand tour of England and Wales in 1939 at the age of just 20. He had been educated at Mount Albert Grammar School and departed with the Third Echelon. His only brother, Ray, had departed with an earlier draft. He was memorialised at El Alamein War Cemetery in Egypt.\nMalcolm Vernon Cato.\nIn early August it was reported that Malcolm (Mal) Vernon Cato had been killed in an aircraft accident while serving on July 16. He was 25 years of age at the time of his death. Cato had been “educated at the Te Kaha School, where his father was native schoolmaster, and then at Mount Albert Grammar School.\" He belonged to the North Shore Rugby Club and also played senior rugby league for Mount Albert after joining them in late 1939 and playing the 1940 season and the early part of 1941 before his departure overseas. Cato was \"a keen student of the Māori language... and very popular among Māoris in the Te Kaha district. When news of his death was received, a tangi was held in his memory\". The Mount Albert senior players wore armbands as a mark of respect for their match on August 1 with Ponsonby. The Mount Albert senior players wore armbands as a mark of respect for their match on August 1 with Ponsonby. At the board meeting on August 5 a “motion of sympathy was carried in silence with” his relatives. Cato was buried at Beck Row (St John’s) Churchyard, Mildenhall, Suffolk, England.\nFox Memorial Shield (senior grade championship).\nPreliminary rounds.\nAfter the first round the Auckland Rugby League looked to enforce their amalgamation decision however both North Shore and Mount Albert refused to join with Marist and Newton respectively therefore those sides played as themselves. City and Otahuhu did play 'together' however they played one half each in their match with Ponsonby. There was no scoring provided for any of the matches aside from a mention that B Sullings scored a try in Richmond's round 1 win over Ponsonby, and E Cowley scored 2 tries in Newtons round 2 win over Marist. Later in the season it was also mentioned that Tom Chase had scored 102 points to that point in the season and as he had only scored 92 points in the Fox Memorial matches it is implied that he kicked 5 goals in the preliminary matches. The first round saw a number of players on weekend leave.\nAnnual General Meetings and Club News.\nAuckland Rugby League Junior Management Committee.\nThey held their annual meeting in the Auckland Rugby League rooms on Courthouse Lane on Tuesday, March 31 at 8 pm. Mr. E. Chapman was elected chairman and the present board was re-elected. The junior control board appointed the following officers:- Chairman, Mr. E. Chapman, deputy chairman, Mr. C.

The junior control board resolved at its weekly meeting prior to the start of the season to increase the weights in all junior grades by 5lb at weighing in with no restriction on normal growth of players during the season. This was considered a war time measure designed to meet clubs wishes. The age restrictions in all grades would remain unaltered.\nAuckland Rugby League Primary School Management Committee.\nNominations were received for 36 schoolboy teams and four seven-a-side teams. Forty eight footballs were presented to the schoolboy committee.\nAuckland Rugby League Referees Association.\nThe Auckland referees elected Mr. A. C.

He was at the Army School of Instruction at Trentham and on a special course after being called to service by ballot. His death occurred during a demonstration being given to a class of officers and non-commissioned officers undergoing instruction in the practical use of bombs. A bomb which had had its fuse lit was about to be thrown when it detonated. Four men were killed instantly including Geard, 4 were seriously injured with one dying later, and eight others injured.

Green.\nCity Rovers Football Club.\nIt was reported on January 21, 1942, that Private William Vuglar who was initially reported missing had in fact been captured and was a prisoner of war. He was a member of the City rugby league club. Vuglar had been captured on December 13, 1941, and was held at the Prisoner of War – Stalag VIII-B (later 344) camp in Lamsdorf, Poland. In March it was reported that Private Andrew Albert James Mitchell had been killed in the Middle East. He was 24 years of age and had played for the City Rovers club for about six years prior to his departure for war. His death occurred on December 5, 1941, in the sinking of the SS \"Chakdina\". The ship was carrying 380 wounded, including 97 New Zealanders from Tobruk Harbour. At 9 pm an enemy plane dropped a torpedo into one of its after holds and the ship sank in minutes. Around 400 on board were killed, including some German and Italian POWs. City Rovers held their annual meeting at the Auckland Rugby League rooms at Courthouse Lane on Tuesday, 24 March at 7:30 pm. Their secretary Ernie Asher advertised the meeting. City held a practice for all grades at 3 pm at Carlaw Park on April 11 and advertised that future trainings would be on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.\nEllerslie United Football Club.\nIt was reported on January 12 that Ernest John Warner had been killed in the Western Desert campaign in North Africa on December 1, 1941.

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 1993–94 began on July 17, 1993, and the host school for the season was Far Eastern University.\nThe Tigers went undefeated with a 14–0 record, in the year that was supposedly the first time that the Final Four semifinal playoff format was to take place in the UAAP tournament. Existing league rules stipulated that a team that wins all their games in the double round-robin eliminations is declared automatic champion, making UST the winners for the first time since their shared championship with the UE Red Warriors in 1967.\nThey had an average winning margin of 15.8 points with five blowout wins over the Ateneo Blue Eagles, the NU Bulldogs, and the UP Fighting Maroons. UST won twice over Ateneo by 27 and 28 points in each elimination rounds. They also defeated NU in both rounds with deficits of 31 and 27 points, and had a 32-point lead in their win against UP in the second round.\nDennis Espino was named Season MVP, and together with Rey Evangelista and team captain Patrick Fran, they were selected to the Mythical first team. Udoy Belmonte was included in the second team.\nRoster changes.\nThe Tigers' starting point guard Binky Favis and national team members Rene Cabaluna and Jay Torres have already graduated and are replaced by two rookies, a transferee, and a returning player. UST has managed to recruit point guard Taddy Ramos from the Mapúa Cardinals, the 1991 NCAA champions for a one-and-done season. The 6-6 center Chris Cantonjos, out of the Letran Knights juniors basketball team was scouted by the Tigers' assistant coach Mady Tabora during one of his PBL team's tune-up games. Tabora, who was the coach of the Burger Machine team invited Cantonjos to try out with UST and is now included in this season's lineup.\nCoaching staff.\nAssistant coach and team trainer Mady Tabora died from a heart attack in the offseason while on vacation in his hometown in Cebu City. The former Glowing Goldie who was also the head coach of UST's high school basketball team was replaced by the recently graduated Binky Favis as Aric del Rosario's deputy.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on RPN 9 by Silverstar Sports.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nRey Evangelista was chosen second overall in the 1994 PBA draft by the Chot Reyes-led Coney Island Ice Cream Stars team on January 16, 1994. Udoy Belmonte also got selected in the same rookie draft and was picked 16th overall in the second round by the Yeng Guiao-coached Swift Mighty Meaties team. Patrick Fran and Siot Tanquingcen, meanwhile applied for the 1996 PBA draft on January 21, 1996, with Fran getting picked in the second round by the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs and Tanquingcen going undrafted. The Sunkist Orange Bottlers, however, signed Tanquingcen late in the 1996 PBA season to a one-month contract to replace the injured Boybits Victoria."

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2016-17 began on June 25, 2016, and the host school for the season was San Beda College.\nThe Knights, the Season 91 champions, finished the double round-robin eliminations at sixth place with 9 wins against 9 losses. The Knights missed the Final Four playoffs this season.\nRoster.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nCoaching changes.\nBarely a month after the Knights captured its 17th title, Letran team manager Ricky Paulino confirmed to Letran's school paper, The LANCE, that head coach Aldin Ayo left Letran to coach the De La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP. In the Knights' bonfire celebration, Ayo clarified that the move was not about the money and it was necessary, citing problems with his family and the business.\nIn March 2016, Letran officials formally named Jeff Napa as the new head coach for the Knights. Napa was hired days after he steered the National University Bullpups to a championship in the UAAP.\nRoster changes.\nThe Knights lost two of its key players from the championship team, Mark Cruz and Kevin Racal, to graduation. Holdovers were Rey Nambatac, McJour Luib, Jom Sollano, JP Calvo and Bong Quinto. Tommy Gedaria, meanwhile, was originally in the roster but did not play this season due to ACL injury. Added to the roster were big men Ato Ular and Jeo Ambohot, transferees from Arellano University.\nNCAA Season 92 games results.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on ABS-CBN Sports and Action.\nSource: Pong Ducanes, Imperium Technology"

It took place on 28 May 2022 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Wigan won the cup for the 20th time by beating Huddersfield 16–14.\nBackground.\nTeams.\nWigan Warriors and Huddersfield Giants have faced each other only once before in the Challenge Cup Final during the 1919–20 season resulting in a 21–10 victory to Huddersfield. Since then, Wigan have established themselves as the most successful team in the tournament, winning the trophy 19 times and reaching a further 13 finals, their last in 2017, and last winning in 2013. By contrast, Huddersfield's ten Challenge Cup Final appearances consist of six wins and four losses, their most recent in 2009, but have not won the competition since 1953. Upon making the final, Wigan were fourth in the Super League, behind rivals, cup holders, and their semi-final opposition St Helens and Catalans Dragons Meanwhile Huddersfield were fifth, only 1 point behind, the sides had met twice in the league with each side winning their home games, with little between the sides it made the final one of the hardest to call in recent years.\nStadium.\nThe 2022 Challenge Cup Final was moved away from Wembley to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium due to a scheduling conflict between the RFL and the BBC. This also resulted in the final being moved to late May from its usual date in July or August. The RFL later announced this would be a temporary change, and would return to Wembley for 2023.\nPre-match.\n1895 Cup Final.\nIn the curtain opener, Leigh Centurions beat Featherstone Rovers 30–16 in the 2022 1895 Cup Final.\nAnthems.\nRegular Challenge Cup anthem singer Lizze Jones sung \"Abide with Me\" ahead of the final. The national anthem was sung by Twinnie from the roof of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nTicketing.\nTicket prices started at £30 for adults and £15 for under-16s, with a select number of free tickets for NHS and military personnel.\nMatch details.\nTeams.\nHuddersfield: Lolohea, McGillvary, Cudjoe, Leutele, Senior, Cogger, Russell, Hill, Levi, Wilson, Jones, McQueen, Yates (c)\n\"Interchanges\": English, Greenwood, Golding, Trout.\n\"Head coach\": Ian Watson\nWigan: Field, French, Thornley, Bibby, Marshall, Cust, Smith, Singleton, O'Neill, Byrne, Farrell (c), Bateman, Smithies.\n\"Interchanges\": Leuluai, Mago, Ellis, Havard.\n\"Head coach\": Matty Peet\nSummary.\nThe game was viewed by many as a classic, with Wigan breaking Huddersfield hearts, with a match winning try late on. Huddersfield had led the game for the most part, taking a 2–0 lead through a Tui Lolohea penalty goal. Ricky Leutele scored the games first try, to give Huddersfield a 6–0 lead, Lolohea hit the post with the conversion. Wigan then scored through Harry Smith to which he converted, to level the scores at 6–6. With 20 minutes of the game played, Huddersfield lost prop forward Chris Hill, with a leg injury. With the scores level at 6–6, Chris McQueen threw a dummy and went over to give Huddersfield a 10–6 lead. Lolohea missed the conversion (0/2). \nHalf time- Huddersfield 10–6 Wigan. \nWigan came out strong for the second half, and were soon in the ascendancy, as Jai Field went over in the opening minutes of the 2nd half. Smith successfully converted the try, to put Wigan into the lead for the first time in the game. Huddersfield hit back soon after, with Jermaine McGillvary touching down in the far corner, despite 4 Wigan defenders trying to keep him out. There was a bit of controversy halfway through the 2nd half, when Morgan Smithies was penalised of 2 reckless high tackles, within the space of a couple of minutes. many in the crowd were expecting to see the cup final's first yellow card since 2001, but referee James Child was extremely lenient in issuing Smithies with just a ticking off. Lolohea opted to go for the 2 points to try and give the giants A 4 point lead, but missed the relative straight forward penalty. however, with the clock ticking down and Huddersfield defending stoutly, Cade Cust went off with what appeared to be a dislocated elbow, and was replaced by Thomas Leuluai. With less than 4 minutes of the game remaining, Wigan were pushing and pushing to find their match winning try, and after a switch of play from right to left by Thomas Leuluai, Smith put an inch perfect kick behind the Giants defence for Liam Marshall to score the match winning try, to the delight of the Wigan fans, and the despair of the Huddersfield fans. Smith missed the conversion, and with less than 2 minutes remaining, Huddersfield could not gain possession of the ball, and the match was won by Wigan.\nPost-match.\nThe day following the final, Wigan Warriors had a trophy parade outside the Robin Park Area.\nFollowing, what was dubbed by the media, a successful final for rugby league certain outlets questioned the finals future at Wembley especially if the trend of declining attendance figures in the sport continued. Wembley and the RFL are in a current agreement to hold the final at the stadium until 2027.\nThe match was watched by 1,519,400 people on BBC One."

The host city was to be announced in 2019 in Rwanda, but was cancelled over lack of interest. The winning bid was announced by Dame Louise Martin, head of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF).\nThe 2026 Commonwealth Games may not go ahead after Victoria withdrew as host, saying it was not prepared to spend as much as A$7 billion on a 12-day sporting event. Following Victoria's announcement on 18 July 2023, a second selection process was triggered to find a replacement host.\nSecond selection.\nFollowing the cancellation of Victoria in hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games due to funding issues surrounding the Games, other countries explored the possibility of hosting the games in place of Victoria.\nFirst selection.\nBidding calendar.\nDuring the CGF General Assembly on 31 March 2017 in Gold Coast, after the troubled 2022 Commonwealth Games host city bid process, the executive board announced that it had planned to award both 2026 and 2030 Commonwealth Games simultaneously at the CGF General Assembly scheduled for Kigali, Rwanda in September 2019. A new model called CGF Partnerships (CGFP) was implemented. This aims to give stronger support to the associations and cities that show interests in hosting future Games, and enhance the overall value of the event. This is similar to the process used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 2017."

He is currently a phantom ballplayer, having spent a day on the active roster of the Philadelphia Phillies without making an appearance.\nCareer.\nCamden Riversharks.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, Singer signed with the Camden Riversharks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 13 appearances for Camden, Singer posted a 5.26 ERA with 30 strikeouts in 49.2 innings pitched.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn October 15, 2015, Singer signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies organization.

        "title": "2022 Major League Rugby final",
        "text": "The 2022 Major League Rugby final was the fourth Major League Rugby (MLR) championship match, held at the conclusion of the 5th season of the rugby union club competition in North America. The match was played on June 25, 2022, at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. It was the first MLR Final to be held in New Jersey as all previous MLR Finals were played in California. Rugby New York emerged victorious over the Seattle Seawolves by a score of 30-15.\nBackground.\nOn November 9, 2021, Major League Rugby announced the format of the 2022 season and post-season. The competition had expanded to 13 teams with the addition of the Dallas Jackals, and all teams were scheduled to play 16 games over the 18 week regular season. The teams were again divided into 2 conferences, Eastern and Western. Due to the odd number of teams, the Western conference had 7 teams, and the Eastern conference had 6 teams. This was the first time in MLR history that teams would not face all other opposition teams in the regular season. Western teams faced their conference rivals in a double round-robin format, and played 4 Eastern teams, either home or away. Eastern teams faced their conference rivals in a double round-robin format, with one additional game. They then played 5 Western teams, to complete the 16 games required for the season.\nFor the post-season, MLR introduced a first-round, single game playoff, called Eliminators. The 2nd ranked team in each conference hosted the 3rd ranked team, while the 1st ranked team received a bye week. The following weekend, the 1st ranked team hosted the winner of their conference's Eliminator in their Conference Final. The winner of the Conference Finals met in the Championship Final to determine the winner of the 2022 season.\nOn June 3, 2022, MLR announced that the Austin Gilgronis were disqualified from the 2022 post-season, due to \"violation of league rules\". Following the conclusion of the regular season, the Eastern-qualified teams all had greater table points than any of the Western-qualified teams. As such, the 2022 Championship Final was guaranteed to be hosted by an Eastern Conference team for the first time.\nOn June 7, 2022, MLR announced that the LA Giltinis were also disqualified from the 2022 post-season, again due to \"violation of league rules\".\nChampionship Series.\nEastern Conference.\nThe Eastern Eliminator featured Rugby ATL hosting Rugby New York at Silverbacks Park. This marked the successive year of Atlanta hosting New York in the Championship Series, having faced each other in the 2021 Eastern Conference Final.\nThe first half of the match was focused on defensive decisions, and forcing penalties, as the visitors led 9-6 at halftime. The first try of the game was scored in the 44th minute, when referee Mike Lash awarded a penalty try to New York. Although Atlanta reduced the deficit with penalties, New York scored another try from the driving maul to effectively seal their victory. Atlanta were able to score a consolation try at the end of the match, but were unable to overcome New York. \nThe Conference Final was hosted by the New England Free Jacks, at Veterans Memorial Stadium. This was New England's first appearance in the Championship Series since joining the league in 2020.\nAlthough New England were able to score first and maintained the lead at half-time, it was New York that was able to seal the victory with two tries in the second half. The victory marked New York's first Eastern Conference Championship win, and the first time that the team that finished first in the Eastern Conference did not reach the Championship Final.\nWestern Conference.\nThe Western Eliminator featured the Seattle Seawolves hosting the San Diego Legion at Starfire Stadium. Seattle and San Diego returned to the Championship Series for the first time since 2019, where both teams contested in that season's Championship Final.\nAlthough San Diego were the first team to get on the scoreboard, the impressive points total from AJ Alatimu alone was enough to see off the Legion, as Seattle claimed a fifth successive win in their MLR post-season matches, as well as a 3-0 winning streak over San Diego.\nThe Conference Final was hosted by the Houston SaberCats, at AVEVA Stadium. This was the first time Houston had reached the Championship Series, and the first Championship Series game ever to be hosted in Texas.\nDespite scoring first, Houston were outmatched by Seattle, with the visitors able to take the lead early on in the match, and retained it throughout the game. This result awards Seattle their first Western Conference Championship, their third appearance in the Championship Final, and the first time the first-ranked team in the Western Conference did not reach the Championship Final (since the conference system was introduced.)\nVenue.\nOn June 21, it was announced that the Championship Final would be held at the Red Bull Arena, in Harrison, New Jersey. The Arena had previously hosted rugby union matches, including an Premiership Rugby match between London Irish and Saracens, as well as an International game between the United States and Ireland. This was the first time that an MLR Championship Final match was held at a venue that wasn't the home ground of any MLR team.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was broadcast in the United States on Fox, and available internationally on The Rugby Network."

        "text": "Metedeconk National Golf Club, known colloquially as \"The Conk\", is a private, 27-hole golf course located in Jackson, New Jersey off of I-195. The club is named after the Metedeconk River, the south branch of which runs through the property. Metedeconk National has hosted the Metropolitan Open, the New Jersey Open, and various state and NJPGA sectional events.\nHistory.\nInitially scheduled to be developed as a trailer park, local contractor and owner of the 1,200-acre property Richard \"Dick\" Sambol, with the help of his son, decided on utilizing a portion of the land for a golf course. Famed course architect Robert Trent Jones was hired to design the grounds.\nThough the original plans slated for the course to be an amenity rather than the main attraction, as the project moved forward, and at the behest of Jones, the idea of a housing development was scrapped in favor of fully devoting efforts to the course and club.\nMembership and facilities.\nBeing a private club, day-to-day access is only allowed to members and up to seven of their guests. As of 2017, membership fees were around $13,000 for the year, though this amount doesn't include an initial buy-in. Membership is for one person, though children (under 24) of members are not charged for entry. Membership is by invitation only, and prospective new members must have a recommendation from current member in good standing before being approved for invite by the board.\nCourse.\nSimilar to other Jones designs, Metedeconk National features multiple tee boxes at each hole. This opens the course to players of varying skill levels and also allows for a faster or slower play. The front and back nine were part of the original 18-hole course, with the new nine (19th-27th holes) unveiled in 1998. Water serves as a playing hazard on seven holes. The course carries four sets of tees ranging from 5,200 to 7,200 yards.\nBeginning in 2018, the club contracted with Michigan-based course designer Raymond Hearn for a 3-year project that would include course restorations and bunker enhancements. Renovations were completed in May 2022.\nPractice facilities.\nThe club has devoted 50 acres of property to practice facilities and short-game areas. The site includes a pair of tees and fairways, as well as six target greens, a 10,000 square-foot putting green, several bunkers, uneven lies, and a teaching center.\nCottages.\nOvernight accommodations are available onsite for members and their guests: \"The Lodge\" and \"The Cedar House\". Two different \"cottages\" each provide eight bedrooms, seven to eight bathrooms, a private putting green, and views of the course. Lodging services are only available if booked through or by a club member."

        "text": "Ence (stylized as ENCE) is a Finnish esports organization with teams and players competing in \"Counter-Strike 2\", \"\", \"StarCraft II\", and \"NHL 22\". ENCE was founded in 2013 and the organization takes inspiration for its name from the Enceladus of Greek mythology. It is currently based in Helsinki and is the most popular esports organization in Finland. The organization also competed in \"Hearthstone\" and \"Overwatch\" until 2018, and in \"League of Legends\" for the 2020 season. ENCE is best known for its success in \"Starcraft II\" and \"CS:GO\". Serral was the first non-Korean to win a StarCraft II World Championship and the \"CS:GO\" team finished second at IEM Katowice Major 2019.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nENCE was founded in 2013 and picked up a Finnish \"CS:GO\" team which competed in local tournaments. In July 2014, the team disbanded after a series of disappointing results and did not return to \"CS:GO\" until 2016. The organization fielded multiple Finnish lineups for the next two years but did not have a stable roster until April 2018, when the organization signed Aleksi \"allu\" Jalli, Aleksi \"Aleksib\" Virolainen, Jani \"Aerial\" Jussila, Jere \"sergej\" Salo, and Sami \"xseveN\" Laasanen. The roster of young talent went on an unexpected Cinderella run at IEM Katowice Major 2019 before finally losing in the finals to Astralis. During the Major the team's unlikely success made them a fan favorite among neutrals and in Finland. The Verkkars, a Finnish musical duo, released a song called \"EZ4ENCE\", titled after the team's chant; it references players, coaches, and team memes. \"EZ4ENCE\" went viral in Finland during the tournament, eventually becoming the fourth-most-popular song in a Finnish top 50 published by Spotify. The song would later be added into the game by Valve. ENCE remained one of the top \"CS:GO\" teams in 2019, winning BLAST Pro Series Madrid and finishing second at DreamHack Masters Dallas and IEM Chicago.\nIEM Katowice 2019 remains ENCE's best performance at a \"CS:GO\" Major, although they reached the playoff round of and the semifinals of PGL Major Antwerp 2022.\nThe team's results worsened at the start of 2020 and ENCE gradually replaced all of the players from the IEM Katowice run with an international roster. In February 2022, with the release of Joonas \"doto⁠\" Forss, ENCE's roster was completely non-Finnish for the first time in the organization's history. The team instead set up a Finnish academy team. Shortly after, ENCE partnered with ESL, receiving a guaranteed spot in the ESL Pro League. The new roster has reached the top-5 of HLTV's world rankings.\nENCE won their first trophy in over four years after beating MOUZ in the grand finals of IEM Dallas 2023, where Alvaro \"SunPayus\" Garcia would claim his first MVP title. The team would continue their strong form with grand final appearances in their following two tournaments, IEM Cologne 2023 and Gamers8 2023.\nENCE also attended ESL Pro League Season 18, where they placed 3-4th after being eliminated in the semi-finals by MOUZ.\n\"Counter-Strike 2\".\nHistory.\nOn 26 November 2023, ENCE announced the departures of coach Eetu \"sAw\" Saha and in-game leader Marco \"Snappi\" Pfeiffer, who were replaced by Jakub \"kuben\" Gurczynski and Lukas \"gla1ve\" Rossander respectively. Later, on 16 December 2023, the team announced the departures of Alvaro \"SunPayus\" Garcia and Pavle \"⁠Maden⁠\" Bošković, who were signed by Saudi Arabian organization Team Falcons, along with Snappi the day prior. Heroic announced the signing of Guy \"NertZ\" Iluz on 17 December 2023, reducing ENCE's roster to only gla1ve and Paweł \"dycha\" Dycha.\nThe same day, ENCE announced the signing of the Polish roster 9INE's core, consisting of Krzysztof \"⁠Goofy⁠\" Górski, Kacper \"⁠Kylar⁠\" Walukiewicz, and previous ENCE player Olek \"⁠hades⁠\" Miskiewicz.\n\"Starcraft II\".\nSerral, a Finnish Zerg player, joined ENCE in October 2016 and is one of the best players in the world. In 2018, Serral became the first non-Korean player to win a StarCraft II World Championship.\n\"NHL\" esports.\nFinnish player Erik \"EKI\" Tammenpää represents ENCE in \"NHL\" esports. EKI is the most successful Finnish player in the game and one of the top players globally. He was chosen by the Finnish Association of Sports Journalists as the 2021 Finnish esport athlete of the year."

Both universities participate in a range of intercollegiate sports, and for the last several years, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has sponsored a \"Sunshine Showdown\" promotion that tallies the total number of wins for each school in head to head sports competition.\nThe Florida and Florida State baseball series began in 1956, and the game has usually been played at least two times during the regular season. Since the 2007 season, the two teams have met in three-game midweek series played throughout the non-conference schedule playing in Gainesville, Tallahassee, and Jacksonville at 121 Financial Park. The 2020 series saw only the first game played, as the remainder of the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Current Gators head coach Kevin O'Sullivan has established a pattern of dominance in the series between the two collegiate baseball powers, holding a 29–21 against the Seminoles, including handing longtime Florida State head coach Mike Martin 11 consecutive losses to the Gators before his retirement after the 2019 season, making his all-time coaching record against the Gators 76–77.\nThe two programs have met in twelve different NCAA Baseball Tournaments, including four since O'Sullivan took over the Gators in 2008."

East Binny House and lands are the remains of that estate.\nThe present house was built circa 1800 by a naval captain, Mr Stewart who lived there with his wife Janet until they died circa 1880. They are buried in the mausoleum which is located close to the house.\nThe house eventually was left to the Sue Ryder foundation by the last owner/resident Mrs Annie Lang. Sue Ryder opened up a care centre in Binny House in 1987 and since then many parts of the estate have been sold to the Oatridge Agricultural College, including the site of the golf course. In February 2002 the Sue Ryder care centre was closed and is now owned by the Huntercombe Hospital.\nThe name Binny is also famous for the stone extracted from the six quarries in the area. The Binny Stone Quarries operated from 1790 until 1914 and was widely used in the construction of Edinburgh’s New Town.\nIn 1997 a temporary quarry was opened at Binny to extract 75 cubic metres of stone for the repair of the Scott Monument. After the work was completed the quarry was refilled and returned to farm land."

Smit scored a half-century, then took a five-wicket haul which included a hat-trick.\nNamibia cruised to victory in the first 50-over game after dismissing the visitors for only 68 runs.

The first Canberra Cavalry player to 300 games for Robbie Perkins and the first Brisbane Bandits player to 350 games for Andrew Campbell.\nThe Adelaide Giants broke the win streak record with 12 games between 24 November and 10 December 2022. Trent D'Antonio broke the record for most career appearances on 8 January 2023 with 387 games. Dae-sung Koo who held the record for the oldest player to play in the ABL when he pitched an inning for Geelong-Korea at age 48 in 2018, came back out of retirement to break his own record, pitching a scoreless inning against at age 53.\nT.J. Bennett broke the single-season homerun record with 17 homeruns, a record he previously held with 16 alongside Kellin Deglan and Donald Lutz.\nStandings.\n&lt;section begin=Standings /&gt;\nThe game between Canberra Cavalry and Sydney Blue Sox scheduled for Sunday 23 January was rained out before play could begin. Because that was the last Sunday of the regular season, the game could not be rescheduled, and both teams were awarded a half win per the League's rules.\nPostseason.\nThe playoffs will see four teams compete in two rounds. The semi-final round saw the winner of each division host the runner-up of the other division in a best-of-three series. The winners of each semi-final will compete in a best-of-three final round, with the first game being hosted by the lower seed and the remaining games hosted by the higher seed. This format is similar to that used for the season.\nSemi-Final: Brisbane Bandits (NE1) vs Perth Heat (SW2).\nBrisbane Bandits hosted Perth Heat for a best-of-three semi-final at Viticon Stadium (Holloway Field). Brisbane won the first game, but Perth won the remaining two to secure a place in the finals.\nSemi-Final: Adelaide Giants (SW1) vs Auckland Tuatara (NE2).\nAdelaide Giants hosted Auckland Tuatara for a best-of-three semi-final at Diamond Sports Stadium. Game 2 was postponed and moved to the next day due to rain, resulting in double-header being played. Adelaide won the first and third games to secure a place in the final against Perth.\nFinal: Adelaide Giants (SW1) vs Perth Heat (SW2).\nAdelaide Giants and Perth Heat played a best-of-three final. The first game was hosted by Perth at Empire Ballpark, and the remaining games were hosted by Adelaide at Diamond Sports Stadium.\nAdelaide and Perth last faced each other in the final of the 2014–15 Australian Baseball League season, when Perth won the Claxton Shield. Despite Adelaide making the final four times since the ABL's inaugural season in 2010–11, a team from South Australia has not won the Claxton Shield since 1980.\nPerth won the first game, but Adelaide won the second and third games and consequently the final, ending South Australia's 43-year Claxton Shield drought. \nAdelaide-born Jordan McArdle was named the Postseason MVP, hitting three home runs across in both of the Giants' Championship Series wins."

Should the tie persist among some, but not all, of the teams, the ranking of the teams still tied will be determined by again taking into account the victories in the games played only among them, and repeating this same procedure until the tie is entirely resolved.\nIf a tie persists, the ranking will be determined by the goal difference in favour and against in the games played only among the teams still tied.\nSeries.\nThe first playoff series was determined on 6 April 2022, when Bayern Munich lost a match in Istanbul to the defending league champions Anadolu Efes. This result confirmed that they would finish the regular season in eighth place, and therefore would face the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, Barcelona.

Raymond Almazan bagged three individuals awards: NCAA Most Valuable Player, NCAA Defensive Player of the Year, and NCAA Mythical Five member.\nRoster.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nCoaching changes.\nRight after a disappointing loss in Season 88 Finals, long-time head coach Louie Alas announced his resignation as mentor for the Knights citing personal reasons. In January 2013, after a proposed deal with former Letran mentor Larry Albano fell through, Letran officials named then-Rain or Shine Elasto Painters assistant coach Caloy Garcia as the new head coach for the Knights. Caloy Garcia was the former head coach of St. Benilde Blazers in 2005–2007. Garcia then brought his own assistant coaches Elvis Tolentino, Ricky Umayam, and Mike Buendia.\nRoster changes.\nThe Knights lost its star player Kevin Alas, foregoing his final year of eligibility, to focus on his duties in the national team. Holdovers were NCAA Defensive player of the Year Raymond Almazan, big man Jonathan Belorio, spitfire Kevin Racal, and diminutive point guard Mark Cruz, who were expected to lead the team. Franz Dysam also returned for his final year. Added to its roster was NCAA Season 87 juniors MVP Rey Nambatac, a product of Letran's high school program.\nFranz Dysam shooting incident.\nOn July 20, 2013, after the Knights game against the Lyceum Pirates, Letran point guard Franz Dysam and his girlfriend Joan Sordan, who were on their way to a victory party in Intramuros, were rushed to a hospital after they were shot by motorcycle-riding gunmen. Sordan's son and two nephews were in the car with the couple. Using a .45 caliber gun, the two gunmen fired several times at the driver's side of the car, killing Sordan and leaving Dysam injured. Dysam tried to shield Sordan from the gunmen and was able to bring her to a hospital, but she was hit in the stomach and was declared dead on arrival. Dysam was in a stable condition after he was transferred to UST Hospital.\nNCAA Season 89 games results.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on AksyonTV.\nSource: PBA-Online"

        "text": "The World Boxing Federation (WBF) is an organization which sanctions professional boxing bouts. It was created in 1988.\nInformation.\nThe World Boxing Federation was originally established in 1988 by Larry Carrier, who was part owner of Bristol Motor Speedway in northeastern Tennessee. It was an expanded version of the American Pro Boxing Association. The original concept for the WBF was written on the back of a napkin as an alternative for boxing as Carrier felt there was a lack of vision in boxing. The WBF wanted to give overlooked fighters a chance and wanted to be a more affordable sanctioning body for aspiring promoters by only charging a $5,000 sanctioning fee. The WBF also sought to promote itself in an honest manner and help the sport. The promotion signed their first title fight in November 1990, when they organized a cruiserweight bout between Rickey Patkey and Joe Louis for December 7, 1990. The WBF's titles were not initially recognized by the British Boxing Board of Control and had to wait until 1995 to achieve recognition. The company had 17 field offices outside of the US by 1995 and the company moved its headquarters to Las Vegas prior to 1998. Larry Carrier sold the WBF to Ron Scalf in June 1998. The organization closed in 2004 after losing a lawsuit and was revived in 2009. In 2022, the promotion announced that they would no longer sanction title fights with boxers with negative records in an effort to raise standards.\nThe organization has sanctioned matches on 6 of the 7 continents. The organization has three levels of champions including World champions, Intercontinental champions and International champions. The organization also sanctions women's boxing matches. The promotion also monitors its judges closely and feels integrity is its greatest asset.\nThe promotion also had their own magazine called, \"Inside Boxing with the WBF\".\nCurrent WBF World Champions.\nAs of (men):"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Monarchs represent Old Dominion University in the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference.\nOld Dominion began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1930. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Old Dominion's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "In basketball, field-goal percentage is the ratio of field goals made to field goals attempted. The top 25 highest career percentages in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's basketball history are listed below. While the NCAA's current three-division format has been in place since the 1973–74 season, it did not sponsor women's sports until the 1981–82 school year; before that time, women's college sports were governed by the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW).\nTo be listed in the Division I record book, a player must have been active in at least three D-I seasons during the era in which the NCAA governed women's sports if she played four seasons in all, or two D-I seasons in a three-season career. However, for those players who qualify for inclusion in the record book, AIAW statistics are included. To qualify for career leaderboards, a player must have made at least 400 field goals in her college career.\nNo listed players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, but Ruth Riley and Kara Wolters have been enshrined in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.\nAmong the career top 25, only two have played at more than one school. Celena Taborn split her college career between Furman and Butler, and Liz Sherwood split hers between UConn and Vanderbilt. Monika Czinano of Iowa, Mya Berkman of Liberty, Taborn, and the currently active Mackenzie Holmes of Indiana are the only players among the top 25 to have played in more than four college seasons. All benefited from the NCAA's decision not to count the 2020–21 season, extensively impacted by COVID-19, against the eligibility of any basketball player.\nSix programs have placed more than one player in the top 25. UConn has three in all, with Sherwood joined by all-time leader Tamika Williams and Wolters, who played their entire college careers at UConn. Five programs have two each: Georgia Southern (Regina Days and Trina Roberts), Iowa (Czinano and Megan Gustafson), Maryland (Crystal Langhorne and Brionna Jones), Tennessee Tech (Renay Adams and Roschelle Vaughn), and Vanderbilt (Chantelle Anderson and Sherwood).\nTop 25 career field-goal percentage leaders.\nCurrent through the 2022–23 season."

        "text": "Golf de Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche () is a 36-hole golf complex in Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche, Yvelines department, 25 km west of central Paris, France.\nHistory.\nDanieal Féau conceived the project in 1954 and Mr. Entem, mayor of Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche, officially revealed the project of a golf course to the town council in 1957. Designed by Fred Hawtree, 1959 saw the opening of the first of two 18-hole courses, the Rouge, and in 1960 the Bleu followed. The Rouge was rated the 10th best in France by Golf Digest in 2020.\nSeveral of the best players in France have been attached to the club, such as Catherine Lacoste, Cécilia Mourgue d'Algue, Gaëtan Mourgue D'Algue, Marc Pendariès and more recently Philippe Lima, Victor Dubuisson, Marine Monnet, Cassandra Kirkland and Victor Riu.\nTournaments.\nSaint-Nom-la-Bretèche hosted the 1963 Canada Cup, an event later renamed the World Cup, which gave the club an international reputation as Jack Nicklaus won five strokes ahead of Arnold Palmer and Sebastián Miguel of Spain. \nIt hosted the Open de France, the oldest national open in continental Europe, 3 times between 1965 and 1982. \nBetween 1970 and 2003 Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche was home to the Trophée Lancôme, from 1982 onwards an official money event on the European Tour. Created by Saint-Nom resident Gaëtan Mourgue D'Algue and chairman of the Lancôme Company Pierre Menet, it attracted some of the best golfers of its day. Past champions include World Golf Hall of Famers such as Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Seve Ballesteros, Lee Trevino, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle, Colin Montgomerie, Ian Woosnam and Mark O'Meara.\nThe Seve Trophy, a biennial European Tour match between Great Britain &amp; Ireland and Continental Europe, was staged here three times. The Trophy was named in honor of Seve Ballesteros, five times major winner and considered one of the most successful golfer from Continental Europe."

Ronan played professionally for several years, mostly in the lower North American leagues, but did spend a season in the Dutch Premier League shortly before his retirement.\nRonan returned to Maine to finish his degree in 2013 and then worked as a volunteer assistant at Union during the Dutchmen's national championship run. The following year he became a full time assistant in the USHL before returning to the college ranks and eventually wound up back at Union. He remained as an assistant under Rick Bennett until his former boss was suspended in January 2022 after allegations of improper coaching conduct. Ronan was made the interim head coach and remained in that position after Bennett's resignation a week later. Ronan led the team to an 8–8–1 finish.\nAfter the season, Union decided to name Josh Hauge as the new head coach, however, Ronan was retained as an assistant with the Dutchmen."

        "title": "David Freese's 2011 World Series home run",
        "text": "David Freese's 2011 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series on October 27, 2011, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. After the Texas Rangers had taken the lead in the ninth and tenth innings by two runs each, the St. Louis Cardinals rallied twice to keep the score tied. Jake Westbrook pitched a scoreless 11th inning to set up a walk-off home run by Freese off of Mark Lowe to tie the series and force Game 7, which the Cardinals won.\nBackground.\nFreese was projected to start the 2011 season, and he was named the starter on Opening Day, despite suffering minor ailments during spring training. He started off the year batting over .320, but he missed 51 games after being hit by a pitch that fractured his left hand. After returning to the starting lineup, he finished the season with a .297 batting average, 10 home runs, and 55 RBIs. He recorded hits in eight of the final nine regular-season games. Freese credited his improvement in power hitting to hitting coach Mark McGwire, who helped him refine his stroke.\nPostseason.\nThe Cardinals returned to the playoffs in 2011 by usurping the Wild Card spot on the final day from the Atlanta Braves after falling games behind on the 130th game. Thus they completed the largest comeback in history with 32 left to play. Due to their fixtures in different divisions, they played fewer head-to-head games, further lowering Cardinals' odds of catching the Braves.\nIn the NLDS, the Cardinals defeated the Phillies. Freese drove in four runs against Philadelphia in Game 4 to force a fifth game. Game 5 featured a pitching duel between Chris Carpenter and Phillies ace Roy Halladay that became the first NL playoff series to end in a 1–0 score and Carpenter's second complete game shutout clincher of the season. In the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against Milwaukee, Freese had a .545 batting average, hit 3 home runs, drove in 9 runs, and scored 7 runs. He was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player.\nBecause the National League had won the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, home field advantage went to the Cardinals as the National League champions, thus allowing the team to host the Texas Rangers for Games 1, 2, 6 and 7. Game 1 was won by the Cardinals on October 1. Through Game 3 of the World Series, Freese had a 13-game postseason hitting streak, a Cardinals record and just two short of matching the all-time National League record. The hitting streak was snapped in Game 4.\nMeanwhile, Albert Pujols tied a World Series record in Game 3 by smashing three home runs, joining only Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson. \"Mr. Octo-bert\" also tied World Series single-game records for hits, total bases, RBIs, and runs scored.\nThe setup.\nThe game.\nNelson Cruz hit a solo home run to put the Rangers up 6-4 against the Cardinals in Game 6. The home run allowed Cruz to tie the record for most postseason home runs in a season at 8; he shares the achievement with Carlos Beltrán and Barry Bonds. Game 6 nearly saw the Rangers win the Series, but after twice being one strike away from elimination, St. Louis tied both times –– the first such occurrence in MLB history.\nBesides David Freese, Lance Berkman made key contributions for the Cardinals in Game 6 against the Rangers. He hit his first home run in a World Series game in the 1st inning and in the 9th, with St. Louis down to their final strike before elimination, Berkman was driven home followed by Albert Pujols after a game-tying 2-run triple by Freese. After Texas scored two runs in the top of the 10th and Ryan Theriot hit a run-scoring groundout, Berkman hit a two-out two-strike RBI single scoring Jon Jay to tie the game.\nThe play.\nLeading off the 11th, Freese hit a walk-off home run to deep center field (420 feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man for whom he was traded, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination. The fan that retrieved the home run ball was subsequently given an autographed bat and ball by Freese after the former returned it to him.\nIn Game 6, Freese posted the best win probability added in Major League Baseball postseason history, with a 0.969, which is 0.099 better than the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The third- and fourth-best WPAs are .854 (by the San Diego Padres' Steve Garvey in Game 4 of the 1984 National League Championship Series) and 0.832 (by the Cardinals' Lance Berkman in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series).\nThe calls.\nJoe Buck.\nFox play-by-play commentator Joe Buck echoed his late father Jack's call of Kirby Puckett's home run from the 1991 World Series, saying, \"...we will see you tomorrow night!\" Puckett's and Freese's home runs occurred under similar circumstances: both happened during Game 6 of a World Series, and both Freese and Puckett were the first batter of the eleventh inning. The home runs were hit twenty years and a day apart from each other.\nAftermath.\nGame 7.\nIn Game 7 of the World Series, Freese hit a two-run double in the bottom of the first inning, bringing his 2011 postseason RBI total to 21, an MLB record. The Cardinals went on to win the game and the series, making Freese a World Series champion for the first time. For his efforts, Freese was named the World Series MVP. He became the sixth player to win the LCS and World Series MVP awards in the same year. Freese also won the Babe Ruth Award as the postseason MVP.\nOffseason.\nThree days after the Series ended, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa announced his retirement, making him the first manager to end his career with a World Series win and with the most managerial victories (1,408) in franchise history. Pujols declared free agency on October 31. On December 7, the Houston Astros hired Jeff Luhnow as their general manager, culminating his rise through the Cardinals ranks as a top player developer. The next day, Pujols signed with the Los Angeles Angels for $254 million, the second-highest valued sports contract in history at the time.\nOne week later, \"Baseball America\" bestowed the Cardinals with their Organization of the Year award for the first time, an award given since 1982. It was given in part to recognize the increased productivity of the Cardinals farm system. Seventeen of the 25 players on the Cardinals' 2011 postseason roster were drafted and developed by the Cardinals. Along with Luhnow, John Mozeliak helped fulfill owner Bill DeWitt, Jr.'s mission to make Cardinals' farm system a consistent producer of prospects who would be key in the club's success."

Originally the tournament was played using a knockout format. Halifax defeated Medway Dragons 120–40 in the opening round of the 2015 competition and went on to win the final against Mersey Storm before completing the double by winning the league championship. Another double followed for Halifax in 2016 which included a 92–48 win over Leeds Rhinos in the cup final. Leeds had scored over 100 points their previous two rounds but faced a Halifax side who had not lost a match since June 2015. Halifax repeated the double again in the 2017 season with a 110–48 cup final win over Leeds that included 15 tries by Jack Brown. Other notable matches included a 160–0 win for Leeds over Argonauts in the opening round and the first all-Scottish match in the competition between Dundee Dragons and Glasgow Panthers in the quarter-finals.\nIn 2018, a plate competition was introduced which was intended to reduce the number of one-sided fixtures being played. The two plate finalists qualified for the quarter-finals of the cup though the finals of both competitions were played on the same day. Hereford Harriers defeated North Wales Crusaders for the plate and Halifax won the cup competition for the fourth time by defeating Dundee Dragons 62–18 in the final. In 2019, the plate was replaced by Challenge Trophy played as a separate competition competition for teams outside of the Super League. Leeds Rhinos won 74–46 against Argonauts to win the cup for the first time.\nIn the draw for the 2020 cup, which contained only six teams, two were given byes to the semi-final, but following the cancellation of the 2020 competition a new format was introduced in 2021 with the teams playing in a round-robin tournament. The top two teams qualified for the final which was a repeat of the 2019 final with Leeds retaining the title with a 60–26 victory. The following year it was the top four from the round-robin stage that qualified for the semi-finals. French team, Catalans Dragons, made their début in the competition, but lost in the final to Leeds who claimed the cup for the third time. The 2023 competition saw the top two teams advance to the final. Catalans and Leeds were both unbeaten in the qualifiers and drew 4–4 against each other to set up a rematch in the final which Catalans won 66–20 to add the Challenge Cup to their French Championship and Coupe de France titles.\nFrom 2024, the Challenge Cup reverted to a straight knockout format, like the running game, for the five Super League sides, Catalans Dragons, and the Challenge Trophy finalists.\nResults.\n2015.\nSources:\n2016.\nSources:\n2017.\nSources:\n2018.\nSources:\n2019.\nsource:\nChallenge Trophy.\nIn 2018, the Rugby Football League introduced a Plate competition as part of the Challenge Cup. It was planned to continue in 2019, but was instead replaced by the inaugural Wheelchair Challenge Trophy. The Challenge Trophy is played alongside the Challenge Cup, for teams outside the Super League. This was originally played as a separate competition, but in 2024 it was announced that the two finalists would qualify to take part in the Challenge Cup."

        "text": "John Albert Thompson (May 19, 1927 – May 24, 2022) was an American football executive. He served as the first general manager of the Seattle Seahawks from 1976 to 1982.\nEarly life and education.\nThompson was born on May 19, 1927, and grew up in South Bend, Washington. In high school, he was valedictorian of his class. Thompson attended the University of Washington, but left before receiving a degree.\nExecutive career.\nThompson worked as an assistant to University of Washington sports information director Bert Rose and replaced him when Rose joined the Los Angeles Rams in 1955. He left after their win in the 1961 Rose Bowl over the Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nIn 1961, Thompson reunited with Rose, who was then the general manager of Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). Thompson served as the team's publicity director until he was promoted assistant general manager in 1966.\nIn , Thompson was named assistant to the president of the National Football Conference (NFC), who at the time was George Halas. After a few months in that position, he moved to the NFL management council in November 1971. He served as the executive director of the management council, the collective bargaining agent of the NFL, from 1971 to .\nIn March 1975, Thompson was named the general manager for the new Seattle NFL franchise, which began play in . Wellington Mara, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and owner of the New York Giants, said \"Seattle could not have made a better choice. He has experienced success at every level of professional football. When my opinion was asked by the Seattle people, he was my only choice.\" Among the first tasks of Thompson was to pick the name of the team and colors. He decided to hold a fan vote to decide the name. The \"Seahawks\" had the most votes out of 20,365 entries with 1,741 different names. Thompson later oversaw the hiring of Jack Patera as head coach on January 3, 1976.\nIn his first season as general manager, the Seahawks compiled a record of 2–12. They went 5–9 in the following year, which was at the time the best record for an expansion team in their second season. The 1978 Seahawks were 9–7, at the time the best record for a third-year expansion franchise. For this, Thompson was named NFL Executive of the Year by \"Sporting News\" and Patera was named Coach of the Year. Seattle went 9–7 again in , but declined in the following years, going 4–12 in and 6–10 in , leading to the firing of both Thompson and Patera mid-season in .\nLater life and death.\nThompson was never again a member of an NFL team but did have a stint with the Sports and Events Council of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce before announcing his retirement.\nThompson had three children with his wife Marilyn and was married to her for 71 years. He remained an avid fan of the Seahawks for the rest of his life after his stint with the team. He was a resident of the Seattle area until 2018, when he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Thompson died in Las Vegas on May 24, 2022, five days after his 95th birthday."

        "title": "Nebraska–Penn State volleyball rivalry",
        "text": "The Nebraska–Penn State volleyball rivalry is a college women's volleyball rivalry between the Cornhuskers of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the Nittany Lions of Pennsylvania State University. Both programs are among the most successful in the history of NCAA Division I women's volleyball. Prior to 2011, the teams competed frequently as out-of-conference opponents and met nine times in the NCAA tournament. Since Nebraska joined the Big Ten they have typically played twice annually as conference opponents. Nebraska leads the series 28–11.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nNebraska and Penn State are two of the most decorated programs in collegiate volleyball history. The Cornhuskers have the most wins, conference championships, and All-Americans of any program, while the Nittany Lions lead in win percentage and rank second in national championships. They have met eleven times in the NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament, with Nebraska hosting and winning eight of them, though Penn State is 2–1 in three national semifinal meetings. Both teams have been ranked in the AVCA Top 25 for all but one of their thirty-six matches, and both have been in the top ten for twenty-four, including nineteen straight meetings from 1994 to 2016.\nThe first meeting between the Cornhuskers and Nittany Lions was a 15–2, 15–8 Penn State sweep on October 2, 1981 in Springfield, Missouri as part of the Southwest Missouri State Invitational. Despite losing the first match between the programs, Terry Pettit and Nebraska soon became the first Midwestern national power in a sport that was still largely dominated by West Coast programs (seventeen of the first twenty-four NCAA Tournaments were won by schools from California, with three more from Hawaii). NU won nine of the next ten meetings with PSU, and knocked the Nittany Lions out of the NCAA tournament six times between 1982 and 1996, including a 3–1 win over 44–0 Penn State in the 1990 Mideast Regional Final. Pettit's run of success culminated in 1995 with Nebraska's first national championship, a title run that included a 3–1 win over Penn State in the regional semifinal.\nNational powers.\nPenn State's fortunes, both on the national scene and against Nebraska, began to turn in 1997; the Nittany Lions beat the Cornhuskers for the third time and spent much of the year ranked No. 1, reaching the national title game. In 1998, the programs met in the national semifinal for the first time. Undefeated Penn State beat Nebraska 3–1 to set up a match with undefeated Long Beach State, though PSU lost the title game for a second consecutive year. Penn State head coach Russ Rose, a Nebraska graduate and former assistant, won his first national title the following year, which included an early-season win over Nebraska in Lincoln.\nAfter meeting fourteen times in the first eighteen years of the rivalry, Nebraska and Penn State played just three times in the 2000s, due largely to the national expansion of college volleyball and the lack of necessity for the schools to be placed in the same tournament region. What this period in the rivalry lacked in frequency it made up for in quality, as all three of these matchups included the No. 1 team in the country. Either Nebraska or Penn State occupied the No. 1 spot in the AVCA national poll for eighty-one consecutive weeks, a streak that stretched from November 29, 2004 to September 13, 2010. NU, led by head coach John Cook following Pettit's retirement in 1999, won national championships in 2000 and 2006, and Penn State followed by winning an NCAA-record four consecutive titles from 2007 to 2010. The 2008 national semifinal meeting between the schools is often considered one of the great college volleyball games ever played.\nConference opponents.\nThe rivalry became an annual occurrence for the first time when the University of Nebraska–Lincoln joined the Big Ten in 2011. In a press conference prior to Nebraska's first Big Ten season, Cook quipped of Rose, \"Russ and I — I wouldn't say we're best friends, but we have a good relationship. It's hot and cold. It's like dating.\"\nFor several years the teams largely traded blows in conference play, splitting the first eight Big Ten matchups evenly. However, on the national scene Penn State continued its dominance over the rest of the country, winning another set of back-to-back national championships in 2013 and 2014 to give Rose a record-setting seven titles in total. Since the last of these titles, the series has decisively flipped to Nebraska, which has taken twelve of the past thirteen meetings with Penn State, including both NCAA Tournament matchups. Cook has taken NU to the national title game four times since PSU's last appearance, winning in 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2021, Rose, the only coach in Penn State volleyball history, retired with a career record of 1,330–229; his 1,264 wins in the NCAA era are the most all-time. Former Penn State outside hitter Katie Schumacher-Cawley was named his replacement.\nMemorable games.\nDec. 17, 1998: No. 2 Penn State 3, No. 3 Nebraska 1.\nNebraska and Penn State met in the national semifinal for the first time in 1998 in Madison, Wisconsin. Despite four national semifinal appearances in the previous six seasons, PSU had won just once in seven tries against NU in the NCAA tournament. The undefeated Nittany Lions jumped out to a 2–0 lead behind Lauren Cacciamani and All-American Bonnie Bremner. The Cornhuskers ran away with the third set to keep the match alive, but PSU took the fourth and the match. It was the second of three consecutive wins against NU for the Nittany Lions, one in each of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Penn State improved to 35–0 but lost the national title game to Long Beach State.\nDec. 18, 2008: No. 1 Penn State 3, No. 4 Nebraska 2.\nNearly ten years to the day since their most recent NCAA Tournament meeting, No. 1 Penn State met No. 4 Nebraska in the national semifinal in front of a then-NCAA record crowd of 17,430 at the Qwest Center in Omaha, just fifty miles from Nebraska's Lincoln campus. The defending national champion Nittany Lions, 36–0 and without a single set loss all season, quickly opened up a two sets-to-none advantage. Nebraska dominated the first set out of intermission 25–15 to snap PSU's NCAA-record streak of 111 consecutive set wins, and then took the fourth to send the match to a decisive fifth set. NU surged out to a 10–8 lead before a six-point service run by AVCA National Player of the Year Nicole Fawcett gave the Nittany Lions a 14–10 lead that NU could not overcome.\nIt was Nebraska's first-ever loss at the Qwest Center, where they were previously 14–0, and snapped a ninety-six-match win streak in the state of Nebraska. Penn State swept Stanford two days later to win their second of what would become four consecutive national titles. The 2008 national semifinal has been termed \"the greatest match in volleyball history\", and United States men's national team coach Karch Kiraly, who broadcast the game for ESPN, said he \"gets chills every time I think about it.\"\nDec. 9, 2016: No. 2 Nebraska 3, No. 13 Penn State 2.\nNo. 15 Penn State traveled to Lincoln to face top-seeded Nebraska at the Devaney Center in the 2016 Regional semifinal, the first NCAA Tournament in which the top four national seeds were able to host more than two matches. The defending national champion Cornhuskers had easily dispatched the Nittany Lions just weeks earlier, but it was PSU that jumped out to a two-set lead at intermission of the tournament matchup. Despite not trailing by more than two points at any point in the match, Nebraska faced a 24–22 deficit and two Penn State set points in the third set. After a PSU service error, an Amber Rolfzen block of Simone Lee tied the set at 24, and a pair of Mikaela Foecke kills won it. NU dominated the final two sets to win the match 3–2. Nebraska advanced to the national semifinal for the second consecutive year, but fell to Texas.\nDec. 14, 2017: No. 5 Nebraska 3, No. 1 Penn State 2.\nNebraska and Penn State met for a third time in the national semifinal at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri on December 14, 2017. NU had won six consecutive games against Penn State, including the first sweep of PSU by a visiting team at Rec Hall in fourteen years earlier in the season, but the top-ranked Nittany Lions were 33–1 and had won twenty-three consecutive matches. No. 5 Nebraska won the first set 25–18, but the following three sets were each decided by two points. Penn State's only set point of the match came with a 26–25 lead in set four, when two Nittany Lions tripped on each other and allowed the ball to fall for a game-tying Nebraska point. The Cornhuskers won the next two points to take the set 28–26, and held on to win the fifth set and advance to the national championship game. The match set a new NCAA attendance record at 18,374. Nebraska defeated Florida two days later to win the national title."

The team was led by Hubert Davis, who was in his second year as UNC's head coach. The Tar Heels played their home games at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Tar Heels, coming off a National Runner-up in the 2022 NCAA tournament, were ranked #1 in the Preseason AP poll, and failed to live up to the lofty expectations the ranking entailed. The team struggled offensively all season, finishing the season with the second-worst 3-point-percentage in program history. The 2022-23 Tar Heels went 1-9 in NET quad 1 games (their only Q1 victory being a home win against #6 Virginia). They finished the season 20–13 overall and 11–9 in ACC play, earning the 7 seed in the ACC Tournament.\nOn Selection Sunday, the Tar Heels were not picked to be a part of the field for the 2023 NCAA Tournament, and were one of the first four teams left out by the selection committee. By narrowly missing out on a spot in the tournament, the Tar Heels became the first preseason #1-ranked team to miss the tournament since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Following the missed bid, coach Hubert Davis announced via statement that the team would decline an invite to the 2023 NIT, ending their season.\nPrevious season.\nIn Hubert Davis' first year at the helm, the Tar Heels got off to a rocky start, with blowout losses to Tennessee, Kentucky, Miami, Wake Forest, and Duke (at home). The Tar Heels rounded into form in the latter half of conference play, finishing with a 15–5 record in conference play. The Tar Heels capped the regular season with an upset win over the Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game. The Tar Heels earned the No. 3 seed and a double-bye in the ACC tournament. They defeated Virginia in the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions Virginia Tech in the semifinals.\nThe Tar Heels earned the No. 8 seed in the East Region of the 2022 NCAA tournament. In the tournament, they beat Marquette and upset No. 1 seed in Baylor to earn North Carolina's 35th Sweet Sixteen appearance of all time. The Tar Heels upset No. 4 seed UCLA and beat \"Cinderella\" team Saint Peter's in the Elite Eight. The Tar Heels earned a record 21st Final Four appearance, where they beat the Blue Devils in the first-ever NCAA Tournament matchup between the rival schools, 81–77, before falling 69–72 against Kansas in the National Championship game.\nStarters Brady Manek, Armando Bacot, Caleb Love, R. J. Davis, and Leaky Black earned the nickname \"The Iron 5\" for their togetherness and strong play as a unit throughout the season, and for the fact they played a large amount of the team's minutes throughout the campaign. Against Duke in Durham, Bacot, Love, Davis, and Manek each scored twenty-plus points in a game, the first time four players went for twenty or more in one game in Carolina basketball history. Head coach Davis became only the second person in history to take the same school to the Final Four as both a player and a coach, joining Kansas' Dick Harp. Davis also became the 10th first-year head coach in history to take his team to the Final Four.\nOffseason.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2021–22 season, Anthony Harris and Dawson Garcia entered the transfer portal. Garcia announced he would transfer to Minnesota to be closer with family in the wake of the family issues that forced him to miss the latter half of the previous season. Brady Manek also left the team, as the previous season was his final year of collegiate eligibility. Manek had taken advantage of the extra year given out by the NCAA in response to COVID-19 to play for the Tar Heels in 2021–22. Harris committed to transfer to Rhode Island in May, but was unable to enroll at URI due to reported academic issues. Guard Kerwin Walton also announced plans to transfer on May 1, 2022, the last day to enter the portal and maintain eligibility for the following season.\nAfter speculation that he would turn pro and enter the 2022 NBA draft, Armando Bacot confirmed his return in a video for the 2022–23 season on April 13, 2022. A few days later, Leaky Black, R. J. Davis and Caleb Love similarly announced their intentions to return for the 2022–23 season. On June 18, former Northwestern forward Pete Nance announced that he had committed to North Carolina, completing their roster for the 2022–23 season.\n2022 Recruiting class.\n \n† Shaver, a member of the 2022 recruiting class, enrolled early and redshirted during the second half of the 2021–22 season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|ACC Tournament"

        "title": "2022 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2022 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2021–22 season and the culmination of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. The series was between the Eastern Conference and two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning and the Western Conference champion Colorado Avalanche. The Avalanche won the best-of-seven series, four games to two, for their third championship in franchise history. Colorado had home ice advantage in the series with the better regular season record.\nThe series began on June 15, and concluded on June 26. With the Government of Canada allowing cross-border travel for fully vaccinated players and team personnel between Canada and the United States, the league was able to return to its usual two conference alignment and reinstate its standard playoff format that was used from 2014–2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The Finals were still pushed from the usual start date in late May/early June for the third consecutive year, this time due to a scheduled break in the regular season that coincided with the league's planned participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, though the league's players ultimately did not participate in the Olympics. When NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman tested positive for COVID-19, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly took over the presentation of the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Stanley Cup. This was the first time since 1992 that Gary Bettman did not give the presentation.\nPaths to the Finals.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was Tampa Bay's third consecutive Finals appearance and fifth overall. They won the prior (2020, 2021) two Stanley Cups and have won three in franchise history. They were the first team to clinch three consecutive Finals appearances since the 1983–1985 Edmonton Oilers. The Lightning joined the Montreal Canadiens (1976–1980) and New York Islanders (1980–1984) for becoming the only teams in league history to post at least eleven consecutive playoff series victories.\nCaptain Steven Stamkos led the team in scoring with 106 points during the regular season. Defenceman Victor Hedman scored 85 points, eclipsing the previous Tampa Bay record for defencemen, which Hedman set in 2017. During the off-season, the Lightning signed goaltender Brian Elliott, defenceman Zach Bogosian, and forwards Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and Corey Perry via free agency. They also opted to re-sign forwards Brayden Point and Ross Colton and defenceman Cal Foote with Patrick Maroon re-signing during the season. At the trade deadline, the Lightning acquired forwards Brandon Hagel and Nick Paul. For Corey Perry, this was his third straight Finals appearance with three different teams (Dallas Stars in 2020, Montreal Canadiens in 2021), the first player to accomplish this feat since Marian Hossa did it with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2008, Detroit Red Wings in 2009, and Chicago Blackhawks in 2010.\nThe Lightning finished third in the Atlantic Division gaining 110 points with a record. Tampa Bay defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the First Round in seven games, followed by a four-game sweep of their intrastate rival, the Florida Panthers, during the Second Round, and then triumphed over the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference Final in six games.\nColorado Avalanche.\nThis was Colorado's third appearance in the Finals. They won their two prior appearances with their most recent against the New Jersey Devils in 2001.\nMikko Rantanen led the team in points, scoring 92 overall. Goaltender Darcy Kuemper started 57 times for the Avalanche, obtaining 37 wins in the process. However, during Game 1 of their Conference Final series, Kuemper left the game with an upper-body injury. Backup goaltender Pavel Francouz finished the opening game after replacing Kuemper and started the remaining games of the series as a result. During the off-season, the Avalanche traded for Kuemper and defenceman Kurtis MacDermid. They also picked up free agent Darren Helm. They re-signed defenceman Cale Makar, captain Gabriel Landeskog, and Francouz. Nearing the trade deadline, the Avalanche acquired Josh Manson, Nico Sturm, Artturi Lehkonen, and Andrew Cogliano.\nThe Avalanche finished the season with 119 points via a record, grabbing the Central Division title and first place in the Western Conference. Colorado swept the Nashville Predators in four games during the First Round, then defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games during the Second Round, before sweeping the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference Final.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nIn game one, the Avalanche controlled the first period scoring three times compared to the Lightning's one goal. Colorado's captain Gabriel Landeskog began the scoring, pushing the puck past Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy when Mikko Rantanen's shot barely squeaked under the goaltender's pads. The next goal came when defenceman Victor Hedman's clearing attempt got picked by Nathan MacKinnon, whose pass to Valeri Nichushkin made it 2–0. The Lightning halved Colorado's lead when Brayden Point's dump-in was retrieved by Nick Paul who broke in and dangled out Avalanche goaltender Darcy Kuemper to make 2–1. The Avalanche regained the two-goal lead five minutes later when Tampa was in a 5-on-3 penalty kill. MacKinnon's shot got blocked and on the rebound he passed back to Landeskog who set up Rantanen for a wrist shot that got tipped in by Artturi Lehkonen. In the second period, the Lightning got two goals to tie the game. Ondrej Palat scored the first goal as he and Nikita Kucherov entered the zone with the latter going inside-out on Devon Toews to set up Palat for the tip-in. 1:48 later, the Lightning continuing their offensive zone attack had a pass back to Mikhail Sergachev from Brandon Hagel whose shot through traffic went off the post and into the net. The third period did not have any scoring albeit the Avalanche firing 12 shots compared to the Lightning's 5 shots, thus the game went into overtime. In overtime, as the Lightning attempted to clear the zone, J. T. Compher picked up the loose puck and shot it, but it was blocked by a Lightning defenceman. The puck then came to Nichushkin who passed to Andre Burakovsky and he fired a snap shot past Vasilevskiy to give Colorado a 4–3 victory.\nGame two.\nThe Avalanche routed the Lightning in game two. In the first period, after Lightning defenceman Ryan McDonagh got penalized for roughing J. T. Compher, a power-play ensued for Colorado. During it, Andre Burakovsky led a cross-ice pass to Valeri Nichushkin's tip-in goal to give the Avalanche an early 1–0 lead. The Avalanche then grabbed a 2–0 lead when a 2-on-1 rush with Andrew Cogliano and Josh Manson led to the latter's wrist shot under Andrei Vasilevskiy's blocker. Burakovsky then made it 3–0 when the Avalanche on an offensive zone rush had Mikko Rantanen's shot rebound to Burakovsky for the quick tip-in. Burakovsky almost made it 4–0 when he was given a breakaway thanks to Rantanen's lead pass. In the second period, the Avalanche continued their offensive zone coverage allowing Rantanen to centre a pass to Nichushkin to make it 4–0. The Avalanche then made it 5–0 when the Lightning misplayed a pass leading Darren Helm and Logan O'Connor on a 2-on-1 break for which the former's wrist shot went over Vasilevskiy's glove. O'Connor was also given a breakaway chance to make it 6–0, but the Lightning goaltender stopped that. In the third period, as Rantanen was in the penalty box for tripping, the Lightning gave the puck away to Cale Makar who, with Andrew Cogliano on another 2-on-1, made it 6–0. Ondrej Palat then got called for cross checking and on the ensuing power-play, Nathan MacKinnon made a pass to Rantanen, who quickly passed to Makar for his second goal of the evening to make 7–0. With frustrations boiling over for Tampa Bay, four of their players were called for roughing for which Colorado retaliated with their own roughing calls. However, the Avalanche claimed a 7–0 victory with Darcy Kuemper stopping the 16 shots he faced.\nGame three.\nIn game three, the Lightning showed more offence than their previous two games. However, the Avalanche began the scoring in the first period. After a coach's challenge revealed Valeri Nichushkin's goal was offside, and then Ondrej Palat got called for high-sticking, Colorado went on the power-play. During the power-play, Cale Makar set up Mikko Rantanen for a quick shot through traffic which pinballed off Andrei Vasilevskiy and Erik Cernak for an easy tap-in for Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog. The Lightning tied the game less than five minutes later when the Avalanche gave the puck away to Anthony Cirelli who passed to Patrick Maroon and then back again to Cirelli who tried to deke out Darcy Kuemper except his mishandling of the puck went five-hole through Kuemper. The Lightning then gained the lead for the first time in this series after Devon Toews fanned on a pass leading to a breakout of Tampa Bay. Palat and Nikita Kucherov went down the ice, with Steven Stamkos trailing. Palat passed back to Stamkos who set up Palat again for a snap shot that went past Kuemper for a 2–1 lead. In the second period, the Lightning outscored the Avalanche, four goals to one. The first goal came off a turn-over from Colorado's Josh Manson who gave the puck to Victor Hedman setting up an open Nick Paul for a 3–1 lead. However, the Avalanche minimized the Lightning's lead to one goal, when on the power-play, Rantanen and Makar set up Landeskog's snap shot goal. Tampa Bay regained their two-goal lead when Kucherov and Stamkos lead the offensive zone rush with Kucherov back-handing a pass to an open Stamkos for a quick wrist shot. Patrick Maroon made it 5–2 deking out the defencemen with his shot rolling up Kuemper's blocker to the top of the net. Corey Perry made it 6–2 when the Lightning were on the power-play, tipping in a shot by Palat that went over Kuemper. Although the third period had no goals scored, both teams leveled their frustration at each other with both Logan O'Connor and Ross Colton fighting and Patrick Maroon and Andrew Cogliano both squaring off after the whistle resulting in misconducts.\nGame four.\nIn game four, the Lightning and Avalanche traded off periods where one team dominated the shot clock. The first period saw Tampa Bay fire 17 shots compared to Colorado's four shots. The third shot for the Lightning 36 seconds into the game gave Tampa Bay their first goal when Erik Cernak's shot bounced off of goaltender Darcy Kuemper to Anthony Cirelli who fired it into the net. Although Kuemper's mask had come off during the play, it was still ruled a goal due to the continuation of the puck. In the second period, the Avalanche poured off 17 shots compared to the Lightning's seven shots. Both teams ended up scoring this period. Colorado got the equalizer on the power-play when Nathan MacKinnon passed to Mikko Rantanen who passed to the front of the net and MacKinnon redirected the puck in with his skate. Tampa Bay regained the lead as defenceman Victor Hedman led the rush into the offensive zone, slipping by the defenders, and backhanding a shot over Kuemper for 2–1 advantage. However, as the teams switched on shots again, this time with Tampa Bay shooting ten times compared to Colorado's six, the Avalanche tied the game. As the Avalanche were working the point, Darren Helm shot at Andrei Vasilevskiy and the rebound went to Nico Sturm whose shot deflected off of Andrew Cogliano and into the net. With the game tied at two goals apiece, the game went into overtime. In overtime, Kuemper flipped the puck ahead to Artturi Lehkonen who passed to a speeding Nazem Kadri who got the shot through Vasilevskiy and into the top part of the net\n. The goal gave Colorado a 3–2 victory and a chance to win the series in Game 5 in Colorado.\nGame five.\nWith a potential Stanley Cup victory in Colorado for the Avalanche in game five, the Lightning tried to hold on to extend the series. The first period saw both teams relatively even in shots with Colorado holding a one-shot advantage. However, Tampa Bay began the scoring as Mikhail Sergachev cleared the defensive zone forwarding a pass to Corey Perry with a cross-ice pass to Jan Rutta whose slap shot found its way past Darcy Kuemper for a 1–0 lead. The second period held a different story as the Avalanche held a stronger advantage in shots and managed to tie the game, prior to Tampa Bay's proceeding goal. The Avalanche, upon winning a faceoff, had Nathan MacKinnon pass to Cale Makar who shot the puck at Andrei Vasilevskiy but the rebound bounced to Valeri Nichushkin for an easy tap-in goal. Nikita Kucherov put the Lightning up 2–1 on a 4-on-3 power-play as his one-timer through traffic found its way above Kuemper's blocker to the back of the net. Much like in game four, the Avalanche tied the game in the third period. Once Colorado was able to enter the offensive zone, they set up Makar for a wrist shot through traffic that deflected off of Vasilevskiy, rebounding to Erik Cernak's skate and pinballing through Vasilevskiy and into the net. However, the Lightning reobtained the lead with less than seven minutes left, as the Lightning worked the offensive zone, eventually leading to an Ondrej Palat one-timer that got past Kuemper for a 3–2 advantage. The Avalanche continued to press the Lightning. However, Tampa Bay held off any late attempts to win the game 3–2 and force a sixth game.\nGame six.\nBack in Tampa for game six, the Lightning struck first during the first period. As the Lightning were working the forecheck, a giveaway by Cale Makar brought an errant deflection to Steven Stamkos who put it five-hole through Darcy Kuemper. The Avalanche managed to tie the game in the second period during their offensive zone coverage which led to a delayed penalty on Tampa Bay. On the delayed penalty, Nathan MacKinnon's shot from the short side beat Andrei Vasilevskiy. Colorado then gained the lead when a 3–on–2 involving Josh Manson, MacKinnon, and Artturi Lehkonen resulted in a wrist shot by the latter to go up 2–1. With the lead the Avalanche continued to shoot at the Lightning goaltender while also maintaining defence. The Avalanche held on to claim a 2–1 victory to win their third Stanley Cup.\nCale Makar was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player during the playoffs. He became the third defenceman to win the Norris Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy and Stanley Cup in the same year; equalling Bobby Orr and Nicklas Lidstrom in accomplishing this feat. Corey Perry became the first player in league history to be on the losing side of three consecutive Finals while playing for three different teams.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe Stanley Cup was presented to Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog by NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly following the Avalanche's 2–1 win in Game 6.\nThis is a list of 52 names that were engraved on the Stanley Cup in 2022:\n2021–22 Colorado Avalanche\nPlayer notes.\nThese players were on the extended roster during the playoffs, with most having played regular-season games for Colorado. None appeared in the playoffs. They received championship rings, but were left off the Stanley Cup engraving.\nMedia rights.\nIn Canada, this was the eighth consecutive Stanley Cup Finals broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC Television in English, and TVA Sports in French. The series was also streamed on Sportsnet Now and Rogers NHL Live. Some stations in Sportsnet's sibling broadcast network Citytv also simulcast ABC's coverage of the deciding Game 6 for simultaneous substitution purposes, similarly to how Canadian networks handled the 2019 NBA Finals.\nIn the United States, the series was televised on ABC and streamed on ESPN+. This was the first year of a seven-year deal in which ABC/ESPN+ broadcasts the Finals in even years, alternating with TNT. This was thus ABC's first Finals since 2004. With the entire series on ABC, 2022 was the first time that the Finals were carried in their entirety on broadcast television since 1980 (under ABC/ESPN's previous contract, the series was split between the two networks. And under the previous broadcast deal with NBC, coverage of the series was also split with two games exclusive to NBCSN). ABC's coverage drew the Finals' highest average viewership since 2019, with 4.6 million viewers."

The finals were hosted by the Mid-American Conference and played at Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl in Columbus, Ohio from April 15–16, 2022.\nFormat.\nThe 2022 championship continued the 16-team format that debuted in the 2021 tournament. However, whereas the 2021 regionals were also contested at the championship site, the 2022 regionals took place at four pre-determined locations:\nEach regional was played as a double-elimination tournament. All regional matches, except for what the NCAA calls \"if necessary regional finals\", were best-of-three matches bowled in the following order: five-person team, Baker total pinfall, Baker best-of-seven match play. Any \"if necessary regional final\" was Baker best-of-seven. Regional winners advanced to the championship event, which was also double-elimination. All matches were bowled under the standard format for regionals (best-of-three matches using specified formats in a specific order) except the championship final, which was Baker best-of-seven.\nQualification.\nSince there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 16 teams competed in the double-elimination tournament, with eight conference champions receiving automatic bids and eight teams receiving at-large bids.

Balmain controversially merged with rivals the Western Suburbs Magpies to form the Wests Tigers as part of the NRL's rationalization strategy. Hennessy was not offered a contract to play with the newly formed team for the 2000 NRL season and subsequently never played first grade rugby league again.\nPost career.\nAfter his departure from Balmain, Hennessy went on to play, coach, and become club president of the Eden Tigers in the Group 16 competition."

        "text": " \nThe Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent Gonzaga University in the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference.\nGonzaga began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nOfficial NCAA basketball records date only to the 1937–38 season, the first of what it calls the \"modern era\" of men's basketball, following the abolition of the center jump after each made basket. Official statistical rankings in scoring began in 1947–48. Individual assists and rebounds were first recorded in the 1950–51 season. Rebounds have been recorded in each subsequent season, but the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season, not resuming this practice until the 1983–84 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in 1985–86, and three-pointers followed in 1986–87, the first season in which the three-pointer was made mandatory throughout college men's basketball at a standardized distance. Gonzaga's record books, however, include all of the school's basketball seasons, regardless of whether the NCAA officially recorded statistics in the relevant seasons.\nThese lists are updated through the 2022–23 season."

The race was won by Mo Donegal.\nThe race took place on Saturday, June 11, with an actual start time of 6:44 p.m. EDT; television coverage was on NBC. It was a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million.\nThe race was run without a Triple Crown at stake, as the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes had already been won by different horses: Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike bypassed the Preakness (and gave up the chance to become Triple Crown winner), while Preakness winner Early Voting did not enter the Kentucky Derby or the Belmont Stakes.

        "text": "Bryce Austen Miller (born August 23, 1998) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2023.\nCareer.\nMiller attended New Braunfels High School in New Braunfels, Texas. He was a fellow baseball teammate and 2017 graduate with Jordan Westburg. Both were childhood friends who grew up in the same neighborhood.\nMiller played college baseball at Blinn College originally. He was drafted by the Miami Marlins in the 38th round of the 2018 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign and transferred to Texas A&amp;M University to play for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies. In 2019, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. \nThe Seattle Mariners selected Miller in the fourth round, 113th overall, of the 2021 Major League Baseball draft and signed. He made his professional debut with the Single-A Modesto Nuts. In 2022, Miller made 27 appearances (26 starts) split between Modesto, the High-A Everett AquaSox, and the Double-A Arkansas Travelers, posting a cumulative 7–4 record and 3.16 ERA with 163 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nMiller began the 2023 season with Double-A Arkansas, struggling to an 0–2 record and 6.41 ERA in 4 starts to begin the year. On May 1, 2023, the Mariners announced that Miller would be promoted to the major leagues for the first time to start against the Oakland Athletics. He made his debut the next day, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning with one out before giving up a single to Tony Kemp. He pitched six innings, allowing one earned run and recording ten strikeouts, a franchise record for most strikeouts in a debut. \nIn his first three starts, Miller allowed only eight baserunners, breaking the MLB record held since 1901 (minimum 15.0 innings pitched). In addition, he had the lowest WHIP (0.421) through a pitcher's first three starts in MLB history (minimum 15 innings). On May 24, Miller became the first pitcher since 1901 to pitch at least six innings while allowing four or fewer hits in his first five career appearances."

However, later the same day, Netherlands won the next game by 70 runs after captain Heather Siegers was dropped five times in her innings of 41 and the Namibians were then bowled out for only 29 runs. the series moved on to Voorburg, where the sides again traded wins with Namibia again chased down their target in the final over, before hosts completed a 5-run victory in a rain-affected match later in the afternoon. The series decider was another close encounter, with the visitors looking set complete another tense run-chase, but a wicket maiden by Frederique Overdijk in the final over sealed a 2-run success and a 3–2 series win for the Netherlands."

        "title": "Free agency (Major League Baseball)",
        "text": "Free agency in Major League Baseball (MLB) concerns players whose contracts with a team have expired and who are therefore eligible to sign with another team. Free agents may be eligible for pendulum arbitration, also called \"salary arbitration\" or just \"arbitration\" in baseball circles.\nHistory.\nFree agency in MLB has existed since the 1972 \"Flood v. Kuhn\" Supreme Court case. One of the landmark decisions in the aftermath was the Messersmith/McNally Arbitration, also known as the Seitz Decision, which effectively destroyed the \"reserve clause\" in baseball. With the end of the reserve clause, the players and the league negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement which was signed on July 12, 1976. It gave players a broader range of options as free agents.\nIn Major League Baseball, free agents were previously classified as either Type A, Type B, or unclassified. Type A free agents were those determined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement to be in the top 20% of all players based on the previous two seasons. Type B free agents were those in the next 20%. Unclassified free agents were those in the bottom 60% of players. Teams that lost a Type A free agent to whom they had offered arbitration received the top draft pick from the team that signed the free agent, plus a supplemental draft pick in the upcoming draft as compensation. Teams losing Type B free agents to whom they had offered arbitration received only a supplemental pick as compensation. Teams that have lost unclassified free agents, or who did not offer arbitration to classified free agents, did not receive any compensation.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players union, signed on November 22, 2011, and taking effect in the 2012 season, dramatically changed free agent compensation. Players were no longer classified by type; if a player has six or more years of major-league service (on the team's 40-man roster) and is not under contract for the following season, he is automatically a free agent. The team can offer him an arbitration salary if they want to be able to receive draft pick compensation, and such an offer must be at least the average of the 125 richest contracts. However, if a player is traded during the final season of his contract, his new team will be ineligible to receive any draft pick compensation. \nEligibility.\nIf a player is drafted and is offered a contract by his drafting team (or any team to which he is traded) each year, he may not become a free agent until:\nTwo examples of players falling under (2) above are Hideki Okajima and Hiroki Kuroda.\nA player with fewer than six years of service time is eligible for salary arbitration if he:\nPlayers with more than six years of service time and who are eligible for free agency can also be offered arbitration when their contracts are up, if they have been tendered a contract offer by their current team by the tender deadline, and have not agreed on a contract.\nThe 4.2 example of arbitration eligibility above is called the \"Super Two\" exception, in which a player will have an extra year of arbitration eligibility. Notable \"Super Two\" players include Nolan Arenado, Chris Archer, Anthony Rendon, and Avisail Garcia.\nFollowing the salary arbitration process, the player and the team both submit a salary offer for a new contract. The arbitrator chooses one number or the other, based on which offer is closest to the salaries of players with similar ability and service time.\nFor purposes of salary arbitration and free agency, a player acquires a year of service time if the player remains on the major league roster for at least 172 days of the typical 187-day season.\nPlayers eligible for neither free agency nor salary arbitration are very seldom offered contracts for much more than the league minimum salary, as the player has no recourse to try to obtain a better salary elsewhere. For this reason, in the first three major league years of their careers (except for the \"Super Two\" exception above), it is standard practice for players to accept comparatively low salaries even when their performance is stellar. Occasionally, a team may wish to sign a player in his second or third year to a long-term contract, and the resulting negotiations can involve salaries significantly higher than minimum. A recent example is the contract Ryan Braun signed barely a year into his major league career, which would have taken him through 2015. However, in April 2011, he and the Milwaukee Brewers extended that contract through 2020.\nA team does not have to offer a contract to a player not eligible for free agency if his contract has expired, regardless of service time. If the player is not tendered a contract offer by the tender deadline (usually in the second week of December), the player becomes a non-tender free agent.\nIf a player becomes a free agent without accruing six years of service time and is not a 10-year NPB free agent, they will still be subject to service time rules with their new club. For this reason, these free agents are typically only signed to a one-year contract as nothing further is required to maintain team control if the player will have less than six years’ service time at the end of that year. For example, Derek Dietrich became a free agent after being designated for assignment by the Miami Marlins and elected to become a free agent instead. He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds for the 2019 season on a minor league deal. The Reds selected his contract for the 2019 season and he had accrued five years of service time at the beginning of the 2020 season. He was under the Reds’ team control and was eligible for arbitration as if he had remained with a single team. Dietrich became a free agent in 2021."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Lions represent Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in the NCAA Division I Southland Conference.\nTexas A&amp;M–Commerce began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1916. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nA&amp;M Commerce, then known as East Texas State, was a founding member of the NAIA in 1940, remaining in that body until 1982, when it joined NCAA Division II. The school did not join Division I until the 2022–23 season. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions.\nThe NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its oldest record in any significant statistical category (as of 2022–23) dates to the 1952–53 season. The NCAA has recorded individual scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made field goal was abolished, with weekly recording of scoring leaders starting in 1947–48. Individual rebounding was first recorded in 1950–51, as were individual assists. While rebounding has been recorded in every subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season. Recording of assists resumed in D-I in 1983–84, but that statistic was not recorded in D-II until 1988–89. Similarly, while the NCAA started recording blocks and steals in D-I in 1988–89, it did not record those statistics in D-II until 1992–93. The A&amp;M Commerce record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which it was a member.\nThese lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

South Canterbury continued to play occasional matches against touring teams, and began a regular series of matches against Canterbury. In the match in February 1904 at Lancaster Park, Dick Dalgleish took seven wickets in each innings and Andrew Barron hit a century to help South Canterbury to victory over Canterbury by seven wickets. \nSouth Canterbury were one of the eight teams that competed in the inaugural Hawke Cup in 1910–11. They have competed regularly since the 1960s. Their only title came in January 2000, when they beat Canterbury Country; their captain was Todd Elliotte, one of only four people to play 100 matches for South Canterbury.\nThe senior clubs of the South Canterbury Cricket Association are Celtic, Geraldine, Pleasant Point, Star, Temuka, Timaru Boys High School, Timaru, Twizel and Waimate."

        "text": "The Class of '92 is a group of three professional snooker players—England's Ronnie O'Sullivan, Scotland's John Higgins, and Wales's Mark Williams. All three were born in 1975, Williams on 21 March, Higgins on 18 May, and O'Sullivan on 5 December, and all turned professional during the 1992–93 snooker season. They have become known for their collective dominance of the sport, as well as their longevity as top-ranked players. \nHonours.\nThe Class of '92 has collectively won 98 ranking titles, with O'Sullivan having won 41, Higgins 31, and Williams 26. All three players have won each Triple Crown event multiple times, for a combined total of 39 Triple Crown titles. At the end of the 2021–22 snooker season, after 30 seasons on the professional tour, all three players were ranked within the top eight in the world. In terms of their collective dominance and longevity, O'Sullivan has compared the Class of '92 to the Big Three of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Rafael Nadal in men's singles tennis. \nAt least one member of the Class of '92 featured in 18 of the 25 World Snooker Championship finals contested between 1998 and 2022. The three players have won a combined 14 world titles, three by Williams, in 2000, 2003, and 2018; four by Higgins, in 1998, 2007, 2009, and 2011; and a record-equalling seven by O'Sullivan, in 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2020, and 2022. As of the 2024 World Championship, they have made a combined total of 88 appearances at the event's main stage at the Crucible, with O'Sullivan having featured 32 times, Higgins 30 times, and Williams 26 times. All three players have reached the semi-finals of the World Championship on three occasions: in 1998 (with Ken Doherty), in 1999 (with Stephen Hendry), and in 2022 (with Judd Trump). \nThe Class of '92 has collectively compiled over 2,850 century breaks in professional competition, including 31 officially recognised maximum breaks, of which O'Sullivan has made 15, Higgins 13, and Williams 3. From the time Higgins first became world number one in May 1998 until the end of the 2023–24 snooker season, the Class of '92 players held the top ranking spot for a cumulative out of a total days.\nLongevity.\nMore than three decades after turning professional, the Class of '92 continues to win events and has set longevity records in the sport. As of January 2024, O'Sullivan holds records as the oldest winner of all three Triple Crown events, having won his seventh world title in 2022, aged ; his eighth UK Championship title in 2023, aged ; and his eighth Masters title in 2024, aged . O'Sullivan has made more appearances than any other player in the final stages of the World Championship at the Crucible, with 32 as of the 2024 event. During the 2023–24 season, Williams won the 2023 British Open aged and the 2024 Tour Championship aged , making him the second-oldest player to win a ranking event, after Ray Reardon, who won the 1982 Professional Players Tournament aged . When Williams faced O'Sullivan in the 2024 Tour Championship final on 7 April 2024, the two players set a record for the highest combined age in any ranking snooker final. Higgins has spent the most consecutive seasons ranked within the world's top 16 players, his record standing at 29 seasons at the end of the 2023–24 season. Higgins also holds the record as the oldest player to make a maximum break in professional competition, achieved at the 2024 Championship League when he was aged .\nTriple Crown and ranking events.\nThe three players have won a total of 98 ranking events to date, O'Sullivan having won 41, Higgins 31, and Williams 26. They have also achieved 39 Triple Crown wins between them, O'Sullivan having won 23, Higgins 9, and Williams 7."

The course design incorporated plans for a drainage system efficient enough to make it possible to play on normal greens and tees all year round.\nThe course was officially opened in May 1993 when Ian Woosnam hit the opening shot. In 2007 a 9-hole extension was completed, also designed by Martin Hawtree, and a skins match featuring Ian Woosnam, Colin Montgomerie and Søren Hansen inaugurated the course.\nNotable tournaments hosted.\nBetween 1994 and 1997 the club hosted the Danish Open, Denmark's national open golf tournament, sanctioned by the Challenge Tour. In 2003, the club hosted the Nordic Open with a purse of €1,600,000, the first ever European Tour event in Denmark. Ian Poulter shot a 66 in the final round to secure victory, with Colin Montgomerie in 2nd place and home player Søren Hansen tied 3rd.\nIn 2008 the club hosted the Danish Ladies Masters, won by Martina Eberl ahead of Melissa Reid, Annika Sörenstam and Iben Tinning, in what was to be Sörenstam's final European event prior to her retirement at the end of the year.\nIn celebration of the club's 25th anniversary, it hosted the European Senior Tour event Shipco Masters in 2018. Colin Montgomerie won over a field that included Laura Davies, who became the first woman to play in a European Senior Tour event. Davies was 8-over-par after 16 holes of her opening round but played the remaining 38 holes in level par to finish tied for 44th in the field of 60."

        "text": "Jackie Jones (born December 20, 1997) is an American football cornerback for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at USC and Moorpark College before transferring to Arizona State and was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft.\nCollege career.\nJones was ranked as a fivestar and the #19 overall recruit by 247Sports.com coming out of high school. He committed to USC on February 3, 2016, over offers from Alabama and Texas A&amp;M on an interview with Snoop Dogg. He became a starter for the team during his sophomore season, but was dismissed before his junior season due to academic struggles. He transferred to Moorpark College, a junior college in California in an effort to improve his grades. After improving his grades at Moorpark College, he committed to Arizona State as a threestar JUCO recruit. During his junior year for the Sun Devils, Jones played in 13 games and started in one. In the Territorial Cup against the University of Arizona, Jones recorded 2 interceptions and was subsequently named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the week. Jones finished the 2019 season with a Pac-12 All-Conference selection and a Pro Football Focus Pac-12 Honorable Mention. Jones only played in 2 games in the 2020 season as a senior and recorded 5 total tackles for the year. He returned to play for Arizona State as a graduate student in 2021 where he recorded 42 tackles including 2.5 tackles for a loss and a strip sack. Jones had 3 interceptions in 2021 with an 86-yard pick-six against Arizona on November 27. Jones received an Honorable Mention Defensive Back nomination from the Pac-12 following his 2021 season performance.\nProfessional career.\nNew England Patriots.\n2022.\nJones was drafted by the New England Patriots with the 121st pick in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. On June 9, 2022, Jones officially signed his rookie deal with the Patriots. The deal involved a $746,984 signing bonus and four years totaling $3.6 million in salary.\nJones made his first career start in the Patriots' Week 4 game against the Green Bay Packers. In the first half of the game, Jones had a forced fumble and fumble recovery as well as a pick-six off Aaron Rodgers in the 27-24 overtime loss. Jones became just the fourth player in NFL history to return an interception thrown by Rodgers for a touchdown, joining Tanard Jackson, William Jackson III, and Jamel Dean.\nIn Week 5 against the Detroit Lions, Jones recorded his second interception of the season off a throw by Jared Goff. Through the first five weeks, Jones was rated the number one cornerback in single-coverage by Pro Football Focus with a rating of 92. He played in 13 games with two starts, recording 30 tackles, two interceptions, and six passes defended. On December 31, 2022, Jones was placed on season–ending injured reserve.\n2023.\nJones entered the 2023 season as a starting cornerback, however in practice prior to Week 1, he suffered a hamstring injury. He was placed on injured reserve on September 9, 2023. He was activated on October 21.\nThe night before the Patriots Week 9 game vs the Washington Commanders, Jones missed curfew at the team hotel and was benched and played a reduced role. He also played a career-low 10 snaps vs the Indianapolis Colts the next week. He was waived the next day on November 13, 2023.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn November 14, 2023, Jones was claimed off waivers by the Las Vegas Raiders, reuniting with former high school and college coach Antonio Pierce. In a Week 15 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Jones snagged a one-handed interception on an errant slant pass from Chargers quarterback Easton Stick. He returned it for a touchdown, capping off Las Vegas’ scoring in a stunning 63-21 victory. Then the next week on Christmas Day, in a Week 16 victory against Kansas City Chiefs, he intercepted a Patrick Mahomes pass, returning it for his second touchdown in two weeks. Following the touchdown, in celebration, Jones offered the intercepted ball to a young Chiefs fan. Jones then snatched the ball back after the child reached out to grab it. The clip went viral, leading Jones to explain that he wasn’t trying to steal the ball from the child but instead from an adult fan standing behind the child and his parents attempting to steal it.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 8, 2018, Jones was arrested at a Panda Express in Santa Paula, California, for commercial burglary. He pled guilty to commercial burglary, a second-degree misdemeanor, and served 45 days of house arrest.\nJones was arrested on June 16, 2023, at Boston's Logan Airport when two loaded guns were found in his carry-on baggage by Transportation Security Administration agents. Massachusetts State Police said that Jones would face multiple charges, including possession of a concealed weapon and ammunition in an airport, as well as possession of a large-capacity magazine. Jones entered a not guilty plea on nine separate weapons charges during his initial court hearing on June 20, 2023. He posted a $30,000 bail and was scheduled to return to court on August 18, 2023. Jones did not make any comments and would not answer questions from the media after the hearing, but his attorney, Rosemary C. Scapicchio, told the media “He had no intention of bringing any guns onto an airport that day.” The Patriots released a statement acknowledging his arrest but declined further comment.\nOn September 5, 2023, all weapons charges were dropped by the Suffolk County District Attorney when Jones agreed to serve one year of pretrial probation and 48 hours of community service.

        "text": "The Danish handball league system, also known as the handball league pyramid, refers to the hierarchically interconnected league structure for handball in Denmark, in which all divisions are bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation. Within men's handball, the top two professional levels contain one division each. Below this, the semi-professional and amateur levels have progressively more parallel divisions, which each cover progressively smaller geographic areas. The top four tiers are classed as nationwide, while the fifth tier and below are classed provincial leagues. Teams that finish at the top of their division at the end of each season can rise higher in the pyramid, while those that finish at the bottom find themselves sinking further down. In theory it is possible for even the lowest local amateur club to rise to the top of the system and become Danish handball champions one day. The number of teams promoted and relegated between the divisions varies, and promotion to the upper levels of the pyramid is usually contingent on meeting additional criteria, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances.\nThe league system is held under the jurisdiction of the Danish HA (DHF) and its three regional associations. Dansk Arbejder Idrætsforbund (DAI) run a separate league system for their members. . The pyramid for women's football in Denmark runs separately with fewer divisions and levels. The women's top-flight league is semi-professional and additional criteria apply, the higher the team is placed in the league system."

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 1994–95 began on July 16, 1994, and the host school for the season was National University.\nUST finished third at the end of the double round-robin eliminations, winning eight games against four losses. Even as the Adamson Falcons were suspended for the year due to eligibility violations involving former UST high school player Marlou Aquino, the Tigers still found themselves struggling in the first round as they barely made it to fourth place in the standings with a 3–3 record. They managed to win four straight games in the next round, including a 68–66 win over the De La Salle Green Archers which prevented them from getting their own season sweep and an outright championship.\nThey defeated the No. 2-ranked UE Red Warriors in two games of their Final Four pairing to overcome their twice-to-win disadvantage and advance to the Finals against La Salle. The Tigers yielded a 74–77 loss to the Archers in Game 1 of the best-of-three series, but were able to extend it to a third and deciding game after an 87–75 Game 2 victory. They had succeeded in defending the crown when they won in Game 3 by a single point at 77–76. The Tigers were able to wrest the lead from La Salle when Bal David converted both his free throws off a foul from the Archers' Elmer Lago with six seconds left. It was the team's first back-to-back title since winning a three peat from 1951 until 1953. They also helped to achieve the UAAP's first and only triple championship after their junior and women's team earlier won the titles in their respective divisions.\nDennis Espino, who had poured his frustration out of getting excluded from the Asian Games-bound national team into the Tigers' championship run was named season MVP for the second straight year. He was looking forward to representing the country and even had to drop 15 units of his college load and delay graduation just to be able to keep up with practices of both squads, but was then relegated as a reserve along with two amateur players after the Philippine Basketball Association allowed the inclusion of other professional players to the team.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on RPN 9 by Silverstar Sports.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nDennis Espino was picked first overall in the 1995 PBA draft by the Nat Canson-led Sta. Lucia Realtors team on January 8, 1995. Edmund Reyes and Bal David also got selected in the same rookie draft, with Reyes earning a first-round seventh overall selection and David in the third round as the 22nd pick."

        "title": "Midfielder (lacrosse)",
        "text": "In men's field lacrosse, midfielders (also known as middies or the middy) clear the ball during the game. Midfielders do most of the running out of all the players, as they are allowed to cross the middle line (unlike other players) and play as attack and defence. \nRules.\nThere are only 3 midfielders allowed on the field at one time by each team. They are allowed to cross the midline, unlike the attackmen and defenders. The only time they are not allowed to have 3 midfielders on the field is if there is a penalty. If there is one penalty on one player, then there can only be two midfielders on the team. If there are two people in the penalty box because these two people both got penalties, then there can only be one midfielder on the field at the time. Midfielders are allowed to substitute throughout the game at any time through a certain area on the sideline in between both benches of the teams.\nEquipment.\nMidfielders are required to wear a chest pad, elbow pads, gloves, a helmet, and a mouthguard. They are required to have a chest pad that meets NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) standards. The gloves must not have any huge holes on their palms. They are also required to have a stick which meets the NCAA regulations. Midfielders can have either a 3 foot stick or a 6 foot stick.\nRole.\nMidfielders can play offense and defense. This makes midfielders the most versatile players on the field as they must play both sides of the ball. For younger lacrosse players, usually in elementary school and middle school, midfielders will play both offense and defense. For older players who are in college and play professionally for the PLL, midfielders will usually specialize in either offense or defense.\nObjectives.\nThe main objective of a midfielder is to transition the ball from defense to offense. Midfielders will try their best to connect passes to move the ball towards their offensive side, or they can try to run with the ball to the other side of the field. Midfielders also have a lot of other objectives depending on what type of midfielder they are.\nTypes of Midfielders.\nOffensive Midfielder (Attacking Midfielder).\nAn offensive midfielder is a midfielder that plays offense. They will play when the team does have the ball. They join the attackmen to make up 6 players and will try their best to score on the opposing teams defense and goalie. Their role is to try and score, or feed the attackmen so they can try their best to score.\nDefensive Midfielder.\nA defensive midfielder is a player that plays defense as a midfielder. They will play when the team does not have the ball. A defensive midfielder may have a long stick or a short stick. Defensive midfielders also must clear the ball usually, which means to try and get the ball from the defensive side to the offensive side.\nLSM.\nThis position is a special type of defensive midfielder. They are special because they are the only midfielders allowed to use 6 foot poles. They play defense like a normal defensive midfielders. Each team is only allowed to have 4 long stick (6 feet sticks) players on the field at a time. Therefore that usually means that there will be 3 defensemen with 6 feet poles, and one LSM with a 6 foot pole on the field when playing defense.\nTwo-way Midfielder.\nA two-way midfielder is a midfielder that will play both offense and defense. These players usually are good at everything including shooting, dodging, and playing defense. At the younger levels of lacrosse all midfielders are usually considered two-way midfielders.\nWinger.\nThe winger is a Middie that specializes in playing on the wings on a face-off. Their job is to start on the restraining line on the fields, when the whistle is blown, they will run toward where the face-off is taken place and will try and get the loose ball if there is one.\nFOGO.\nFOGO is an acronym meaning Face-off and Go-off. These players are technically midfielders, although in high school, college, and professional they are usually considered a different position. This special position are the people who take the face-off and then run off the field to get a substitution from a defensive middy or offensive middy once one team has possession of the ball."

        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to basketball across the world, mirroring its impact across all sports. Across the world and to varying degrees, events and competitions have been cancelled or postponed with limited or no spectators, and other restrictions in 2020 and 2021. The National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its 2019–20 season due to one player testing positive from COVID-19, and began to resume the season later in 2020.\nInternational basketball.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, but the event was postponed to 2021 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the \"Tokyo 2020\" branding for marketing purposes. The basketball tournament was held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.\nBy continent.\nAfrica.\nThe launch of the inaugural season of the Basketball Africa League set for March 2020 was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. No new date has been announced.\nAsia.\nThe 2019–20 Chinese Basketball Association season was suspended on 1 February 2020.

This brought the postponed games to three, after FIBA earlier ordered the China vs. Malaysia game in Foshan to be postponed. Later that week, the Guam vs. Hong Kong game in Hagåtña was also postponed.\nThe Korean Basketball League canceled its 2019–20 season on 24 March, after playing its last game on 29 February. This comes as the Women's Korean Basketball League canceled its season a week before.\nOn 4 March, FIBA announced the cancellation of the 2019 FIBA Under-16 Asian Championship in Beirut and the 2019 FIBA Under-16 Asian Championship for Women in Canberra. It also postponed the 3x3 Olympic qualification tournament in Bangalore, and rescheduled the 2020 FIBA Asia 3x3 Cups in Changsha and the 2020 FIBA 3x3 Under-17 Asian Cup in Cyberjaya.\nThe 2019–20 season of the Super Basketball League in Taiwan continued despite the outbreak.

The PBA management also imposed a two-week prohibition on team \"practices, scrimmages and other related activities\" which took effect on 14 March 2020.\nSeveral leagues have suspended their tournaments on 12 March: Community Basketball Association, National Basketball League, Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League.\nOn 7 April 2020, the PBA Board of Governors have decided to shorten this season into a two-conference season (later revised to a one-conference season on August) following the postponement of the Philippine Cup due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the enforcement of the Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon until 30 April.\nOn 17 September, the PBA Board of Governors have approved a plan to restart the season on 11 October (originally on 9 October), then was given a provisional approval by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-IED) on 24 September. All games were played in the \"PBA bubble\" at the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga, the isolation zone specifically created for league operations. The MPBL would follow suit in March 2021 with its own bubble in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, continuing its suspended 2020 MPBL playoffs.\nEurope.\n2019–2020 season.\nJordi Bertomeu, CEO of the Euroleague, suspended the games from 14 March to 11 April.

On 31 March, the BCL decided that the season will have to be finished with a \"Final Eight\" tournament planned for 30 September 2020 until 4 October 2020. The tournament was to be held behind doors in a single venue and would be a single-elimination tournament. Two games which were still not played in the Round of 16 took place beforehand. On 2 September 2020, FIBA announced that the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall would host the Final Eight.\nLithuania, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovakia and Ukraine canceled outright their respective first division leagues, naming the teams in the top of the standings as champions.

It was also decided that there would be no relegations this season.\nOn 17 June, the ACB League in Spain resumed. The format was changed and the top 12 teams after round 23 played the games behind closed doors in La Fonteta (Valencia) to win the championship. Relegations to LEB Oro (second tier) were revoked and the Spanish Basketball Federation approved the promotions to Liga ACB of the top two LEB Oro teams. The teams playing for the title were divided into two groups of six, playing every team in their group once. The top two teams per group qualified for the semifinals. From semifinals onwards, the teams played a single-elimination tournament consisting of two rounds. A total of 33 matches were played within two weeks.\nOn 21 June, the Israeli Basketball Premier League returned to action with a different format.\n2020–2021 season.\nOn 22 September 2020, the Basketball Champions League (BCL) began with the qualifying rounds, before the previous season Final Eight.\nIn Spain, the 2020–21 ACB season was expanded to 19 teams instead of 20, including the same 18 sides from the previous season and one promoted from the LEB Oro. This was because Carramimbre CBC Valladolid did not request to join the league. As a result, this season was contested by odd-numbered teams, which meant that each regular season round one team did not play any games. FEB and ACB reached an agreement in which there would only be one team promoted from LEB Oro to Liga ACB. Also, both organizations agreed to create a support plan for the LEB Oro intended to alleviate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to guarantee the broadcast of all the matches of the league. The total of these grants, therefore, amounted to one million euros, which were distributed evenly among the clubs registered in the league for the 2020–21 season. On February 11, 2021 the 2021 Copa del Rey started in Madrid. All matches were played behind closed doors.

On June 2, 2021, the Spanish High Council for Sports allowed the general admission of the spectators for the playoffs, indicating that the maximum number of spectators was 1,000 people.\nFIBA Eurobasket.\nThe FIBA Eurobasket was originally scheduled to take place between 2 and 19 September 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, it was postponed to September 2022.\nNorth America.\n2019–2020 season.\nCollege.\nOn 6 March 2020, in the first round of the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament, a game played at Johns Hopkins University between Yeshiva University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute became the first U.S. sporting event to be played without fans in attendance, after a student at Yeshiva University tested positive for COVID-19.\nOn 11 March 2020, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) — the main U.S. sanctioning body for college athletics — initially announced that its winter-semester championships and tournaments, including its popular men's and women's Division I basketball tournaments, would be conducted behind closed doors with \"only essential staff and limited family attendance\".\nThe following day, all Division I conferences in college basketball canceled their respective tournaments in-progress. The Ivy League had already called off its tournament prior to the decision, while some conferences, as well as the NCAA for its men's and women's tournaments, had previously announced that they would conduct their games behind closed doors. The Big East's tournament was cancelled in the middle of its first quarter-final game, which marked the final sporting event of the 2019–20 season. Later that day, the NCAA announced that all remaining championship events for the 2019–20 academic year would be canceled entirely, resulting in the first cancellation in the 81-year history of the NCAA tournament. The NCAA subsequently canceled its tournaments outright.\nProfessional.\nOn 11 March 2020, the National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its 2019–20 season after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for coronavirus prior to tip-off for a scheduled game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Commissioner Adam Silver stated the next day that this suspension \"will be most likely at least 30 days, and we don't know enough to be more specific than that\".\nOn 14 March, the Baloncesto Superior Nacional of Puerto Rico suspended its season.\nOn 23 March, National Basketball League of Canada suspended the remainder of the 2019–20 season.\nOn 3 April, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) announced that they had postponed the start of training camp and regular season which was originally scheduled for 15 May. The 2020 WNBA draft was held virtually and televised on 17 April 2020 without players, guests, and media on-site. The 2020 WNBA season was held in a \"bubble\" setting at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida starting on 25 July and ending when the Seattle Storm completed a three-games-to-none sweep of the Las Vegas Aces to win the league championship on 6 October.\nOn 4 June, the NBA announced that the season would restart on 31 July for 22 teams still in playoff contention at the time of the suspension, and would finish no later than 12 October. Professional teams such as the Houston Rockets saw their seasons impacted as players like all-star Russell Westbrook tested positive for COVID-19.\nOn 30 July, the NBA season officially resumed in a \"bubble\" setting at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Bay Lake, Florida. Play concluded on 11 October when the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA championship.\n2020–2021 season.\nCollege.\nPandemic impacts continued into the next college basketball season. The earliest allowable date for games in the 2020–21 season was pushed back from 10 to 25 November, when most campuses would have either concluded their fall term or moved remaining classes online. In addition, the maximum number of games was reduced by four (to 27), and the minimum number of games required to qualify for the national championship tournament was halved from 26 to 13. Some conferences adapted altered scheduling formats intended to limit air travel (divisions, back to back games at one site), and allow opportunities for cancelled games to be rescheduled.\nThe NCAA released a guidance sheet that recommended eliminating hard copy (printed) statistics that coaches would use. The NCAA recommended conferences apply for a technology waiver to allow transmission of live statistics to the bench area using electronic devices. The technology rules were permanently adopted for the 2021–22 season.\nA number of early-season tournaments and showcases (usually held around the Thanksgiving holiday) were cancelled, relocated, or rearranged due to logistical concerns—especially those held outside of the continental United States. The Maui Invitational was moved from Lahaina, Hawaii to Asheville, North Carolina, while the Battle 4 Atlantis in Nassau, Bahamas was cancelled outright. A new tournament known as the Crossover Classic was organized in Sioux Falls, South Dakota as an unofficial substitute, initially inviting most of the teams originally committed to Battle 4 Atlantis (although many of them would later drop out). The Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut hosted a two-week series of non-conference games known as \"Bubbleville\", organized by Gazelle Group and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which primarily featured showcases and tournaments organized by the two (such as the Empire Classic, Hall of Fame Tip Off, and Legends Classic).\nDue to logistical concerns, the NCAA centralized the early rounds of its 2021 Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments at sites in the regions of the host city for their respective Final Four—Indianapolis and San Antonio respectively—rather than at sites around the country. The 2021 National Invitation Tournament was reduced from 32 teams to 16, with automatic bids for teams that win their conference's regular-season championships but not their conference tournaments eliminated. The championship game took place at Comerica Center in Frisco, Texas, marking the first time in the NIT's 83-year history that Madison Square Garden in New York City did not stage the final.\nProfessional.\nThe 2020–21 NBA season began on 22 December. Each team played 72 games – less than the normal 82 games, but more than teams played the prior season, including the games in the bubble. The NBA released the slate in two parts, with the first covering games from 22 December to the start of a six-day break on 5 March, and the second covering the period from 10 March to the end of the regular season in mid-May. All games were to be played at home arenas, with health and safety protocols still in place. The Utah Jazz were the first team to admit a limited crowd to home games, with other teams following suit as the season progressed and as local authorities allowed. By 18 April, all 30 teams permitted crowds at their home venues.\nAs the playoffs began, more teams then started allowing full capacity crowds at their arenas, with masking and vaccination restrictions in place. By the beginning of the NBA Finals between the Bucks and Suns on July 8, all 30 teams had announced they would return to full capacity the following season, with Milwaukee and Phoenix taking the lead in having a full arena.\nDue to ongoing restrictions on traffic on the Canada–United States border, the Toronto Raptors moved home games to Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida.\nAfter announcing on 25 November 2020 that its annual All-Star Game and other weekend events would not be held during the coming season – and giving the original host team, the Indiana Pacers, the 2024 game as compensation, the league reversed course on 18 February 2021 and played the game at State Farm Arena in Atlanta on 7 March.\nOn 8 January 2021, the G League announced plans to run its entire season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. Play began on 10 February and consisted of a four-week regular season and single-elimination playoffs. Eighteen of the league's 29 teams participated, including the newly launched NBA G League Ignite team of prospects. The Lakeland Magic defeated the Delaware Blue Coats on 11 March in the championship game.\nIn June 2021, the WNBA announced that 99% of its players had been fully vaccinated. Furthermore, the 2021 WNBA season began on 14 May as scheduled and ended on 19 September, matching the original 2020 schedule, one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe induction ceremony of the class of 2020 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was postponed from September 2020 to 15 May 2021 and was moved from Springfield, Massachusetts, where the hall is located, to the Mohegan Sun Arena. Among the inductees were Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, and Kim Mulkey.\n2021–2022 season.\nCollege.\nIn December 2021, the program at the University of Washington had an outbreak, forcing them to miss three consecutive games against nationally-ranked teams: 11th-ranked Arizona on 2 December, 5th-ranked UCLA on 5 December, and 5th-ranked Gonzaga on 12 December. The game against Arizona was rescheduled for 25 January 2022, while the other two games were canceled outright, with UCLA being awarded a win via forfeit per Pac-12 Conference policies. Later, UCLA had its own outbreak; as a result of that and those of other teams, the Bruins played only one game from 1 December 2021 to 6 January 2022.\nIn January 2022, Michigan also had to put off consecutive games against ranked teams: No. 10 Michigan State on 8 January and No. 7 Purdue on 11 January. These games were among hundreds of games canceled, postponed, or forfeited in various Division I conferences and teams, most of which could be attributed to spread of the Omicron variant.\nThe Maui Invitational was moved to the mainland for the second season in a row, landing at Michelob Ultra Arena at Mandalay Bay in Paradise, Nevada. Chaminade, a Division II school in Honolulu, did participate as scheduled in odd-numbered years. The Asheville Classic was founded as a result of the 2020 Maui Invitational being conducted in Asheville, NC.\nThe CBS Sports Classic at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise was reduced from two games to one as Kentucky took on North Carolina in a rearranged game. Kentucky was supposed to take on Ohio State and UNC was to face UCLA before both opponents had to cancel due to outbreaks.\nProfessional.\nOn 29 September, a new series of protocols was revealed in a memo sent jointly by the NBA and the NBAPA. It restricted player movements and activities, both on and off the court, for players who were not fully vaccinated. In addition, players who were suspended for protocol violations will not be paid.\nPlayers and other key personnel of the Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks, and Golden State Warriors were required to be fully vaccinated in order to enter their home facilities, pursuant to the laws of, respectively, New York City and San Francisco. Members of visiting teams were not required to be vaccinated. As a result, Kyrie Irving, who refused to be vaccinated, did not make his season debut until 5 January 2022 against the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\nOn 8 December, the NBA further revised the protocols; as of 15 January 2022, unvaccinated players will not be allowed to participate in Toronto Raptors home games.\nOceania.\nIn Australia's National Basketball League, the 2020 NBL Grand Final between the Sydney Kings and Perth Wildcats was played behind closed doors beginning with Game 2, and the NBL stated that it would be suspended immediately if any player was diagnosed.\nAfter Game 3—trailing 2–1 in a best-of-five series—the Kings announced 17 March that they would withdraw from the Finals, due to \"a critical mass of relevant and actual concerns related to player welfare and the club's social responsibility\". The NBL had been considering playing Game 4 of the series on 18 March instead of 20 March as originally scheduled to accelerate its completion. On 18 March, the NBL declared the Perth Wildcats as champions by default.\nSouth America.\nOn 12 March 2020 the Argentine Basketball Confederation and the Asociación de Clubes de Básquetbol (AdC), which jointly organize the Liga Nacional de Básquet in Argentina, decided that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina the games would be played behind closed doors. On March 14, the season was suspended. On 17 June 2020, the season was finally cancelled without a champion or relegations.\nOn 15 March 2020 Novo Basquete Brasil was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil which broke out in the country. On 4 May 2020 the season was finally cancelled."

The tournament itself has been rescheduled tentatively to 2023, depending on a new collective bargaining agreement between MLB and the players' union.\nOn 30 June 2020, the WBSC announced that the U-23 Baseball World Cup, scheduled to be held in September 2020 in Mexico, would be postponed until September 2021.\nOn 23 February 2021, the WBSC announced that the U-15 Baseball World Cup and Women's Baseball World Cup, scheduled to be held in March in Tijuana, had been postponed due to the \"pandemic and associated international travel restrictions.\" On 1 October 2021, the two competitions were cancelled.\nOn 2 June 2021, the Chinese Taipei national baseball team withdrew from the final round of the qualifiers for the 2020 Summer Olympics due to concerns related to player safety from COVID-19 in Mexico.

This was the first cancellation of the tournament since its first edition in 1947. Then the following year, Little League Baseball announced that the LLWS and Little League Softball World Series would go on, but will be played with U.S.-based teams only. Two teams will qualify from eight U.S. regions for a 16-team LLWS, and two teams qualifying from five U.S. regions will compete in a 10-team LLSWS. A planned expansion of the LLBWS field to 20 teams and the LLSWS field to 12 teams has been postponed to 2022, and all other Little League division championships have been canceled.\nBy continent.\nAsia.\nJapan.\nOn 26 February 2020, Nippon Professional Baseball announced that spring training would continue behind closed doors. On 9 March, the league announced that the start of its 2020 season, originally scheduled for 20 March, would be postponed until April. Eventually, the heavily modified season started on 19 June and was shortened from 143 games to 120 games. To maximize the number of intraleague games that could be played, interleague play and the All-Star Series were eliminated. Additionally, NPB's post-season, the Climax Series, was affected as well. The Pacific League reduced their post-season from two playoff series to one, while the Central League cancelled their Climax Series altogether, instead opting to advance their regular-season champion directly to the Japan Series. NPB Commissioner Atsushi Saito announced on June, fan entry admit within 5000 audience in ballpark, that start from 10 July, set on hand spray and thermo-temperatures measuring device in stadium entrance.\nAccording to NPB commissioner Saito announced on 12 September, the maximum spectator capacity increases from 11,000 to 20,000 from 19 September.\nOn 4 March, the Japan High School Baseball Federation announced that the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament, scheduled to begin on 19 March, would take place without fans in attendance. However, on 11 March, the governing body of high school baseball in Japan declared that the tournament had been cancelled. The cancellation of the 2020 tournament marked the first time the contest was not organised since 1946, when the tournaments were not formally scheduled between 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nAccording to JHSBF chairman announced on 20 May, all games, including regional qualifying for the High School Baseball Tournament of Japan were called off, marking the first time since World War II.\nAccording to Japan Students, Baseball Association honour chairman announced on 9 October, a , was called off because of restrictions around the Tokyo Metropolitan Area for the first time since 1988, when it was not held because of the illness involving Emperor Hirohito at the time.\nSouth Korea.\nOpening Day of the 2020 KBO League season was originally scheduled for 28 March 2020. The Korea Baseball Organization announced in March that all ten exhibition games would be cancelled. The league later decided that exhibition games would be played starting 21 April with no spectators. The start of the regular season would also take place with no spectators, on 5 May.\nTaiwan.\nThe Taiwan-based Chinese Professional Baseball League was scheduled to begin its 2020 season on 14 March. On 1 April, the league announced that opening day would take place on 11 April, without fans in attendance. Due to inclement weather on that date, games did not begin until 12 April. On 9 May, the CPBL began admitting spectators.\nNorth America.\n2020 season.\nOn 12 March 2020, Major League Baseball suspended all spring training activities. Opening Day of the 2020 season, scheduled for 26 March, was postponed, as was the start of the regular season for Minor League Baseball, which was to begin on 9 April. In addition, the Mexico Series and Puerto Rico Series games were canceled; the former would have featured the San Diego Padres playing the Arizona Diamondbacks at Mexico City's Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú, and the latter featuring the New York Mets playing the Miami Marlins at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. MLB also canceled the 2020 London Series games, which would have featured the Chicago Cubs playing the St. Louis Cardinals at London Stadium. The COVID-19 pandemic was the biggest interruption of the MLB season since 2001 when several games were postponed due to the September 11, 2001 attacks. \nAlso on 12 March, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced the suspension of its baseball season and cancellation of the entire season, further adding an automatic redshirt year without officially using a redshirt year. Seniors who would have exhausted their eligibility would not be charged a year, as most conferences had not begun their conference seasons.\nOn 30 April, the 2020 Little League World Series and its other associated tournaments were canceled, and with it, the Little League Classic game between the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles scheduled for 23 August in Williamsport, Pennsylvania was subsequently changed to a regular home game for the Orioles.\nSeveral summer collegiate baseball leagues were canceled entirely, while others postponed their starts from the beginning of June to the beginning of July. The Portland Pickles of the West Coast League announced that they would play without fans, while several other teams withdrew from their leagues entirely.\nIn late May 2020, multiple members of the Fieras del San Fernando of the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League contracted COVID. Coach Carlos Aranda fell ill, was brought to a hospital in Nicaragua already unconscious and died. The deaths attracted attention to the government's response to the pandemic as Nicaragua was one of the few countries in which sporting events continued as scheduled.\nOn 30 June 2020 the Minor League Baseball season was canceled outright. On 1 July, the 2020 Mexican Baseball League season was cancelled, citing that the league's reliance on ticket sales for team revenue made playing games behind closed doors economically unviable.\nA shortened 60-game 2020 Major League Baseball season began on 23 July; all neutral site games were cancelled, and no game was played outside of the Contiguous United States (including international neutral site games, and the Toronto Blue Jays playing most of their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo (home of the Buffalo Bisons, a Blue Jays minor league affiliate) rather than Rogers Centre due to Canadian travel restrictions). The schedule limited games to divisional opponents to reduce travel, with interleague games played against corresponding divisions (i.e. AL East vs. NL East) rather than the annual alternating cycle. New temporary rules were enacted, including social distancing violations with umpires and opposing players being classified as unsportsmanlike conduct, the National League using designated hitters for all games, and a modified version of the international tiebreaker where each half-inning begins with a runner on second base. It was later decided for health and safety reasons, games in doubleheaders would also be shortened to seven innings (a rule standard in minor league play).\nThe postseason was expanded to 16 teams, with the top two teams in each of the six divisions, as well as the top two remaining teams based on regular season records, advancing to the best-of-three \"Wild Card Series\" round (which replaced the usual Wild Card Game). The winners advanced to the eight-team Division Series round as normal. Approximately 40 regular season games were cancelled due to outbreaks within teams. It was later announced that in an effort to diminish the impact of further outbreaks, all postseason games would be centralized at one of several venues in California or Texas beginning with the Division Series round, and that the entirety of the 2020 World Series would be held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, new home of the Texas Rangers. All games throughout the season were played behind closed doors, with the only exceptions being the 2020 National League Championship Series and 2020 World Series at Globe Life Field (which offered limited in-person attendance).\nAfter Game 6 of the World Series, Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner stormed onto the field with his teammates to celebrate his team's championship, despite having been removed from the game in the eighth inning after testing positive for COVID-19. Turner later apologized for the incident, and Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced that no actions would be taken, citing Turner's apology and admitting that \"we all have made mistakes as we navigated these unprecedented challenges and have tried to learn from those mistakes so they are not repeated.\"\nTemporary rules for the postseason tiebreaker, designated hitter, and extra innings are still in use as of the 2022 season, though the National League did not use the designated hitter in 2021. The Wild Card Series was officially implemented in 2022, with only 12 teams instead of 16 teams. The top two division winners earn a bye to the Division Series. The third-place division winner plays the third-best non-winner based on record, and the first and second placed non-division winners playing in the other round, using the same best-of-three Wild Card Series format.\n2021 season.\nMajor League Baseball returned to a full 162-game season for 2021, but some protocols and scheduling changes from the 2020 season remain in place, including shortened doubleheader games, and interleague games being played against teams from the corresponding region. No games are scheduled outside the contiguous United States or Canada. The Blue Jays hoped to return to Rogers Centre if travel restrictions permitted, but instead began the season at their spring training home of TD Ballpark in Dunedin, Florida before returning to Sahlen Field beginning in June. On 16 July, the team received a National Letter of Exemption from the Canadian government allowing home games to return to Toronto, effective with the contest of 30 July. Strict health protocols were in place for visiting teams and attendance was limited to 15,000 fans per game.\nMinor League Baseball, which had extensive retooling during the offseason, revealed its original schedule for the season on 18 February. It included staggered starts for the Triple-A level (6 April or 8 April) and all other levels (4 May). Triple-A teams would play 142 games each, and all other teams would play 120 games each. All games were played in six-game series at a single ballpark, with one day off during each series. Originally, no postseason play was planned, but on 1 July MiLB reversed course and announced that the top two teams in each league from Low-A to Double-A, based on winning percentage, played a best-of-5 series. The Triple-A level had two separate championships: one for the teams with the best regular-season record, and the other for the winners of 10-game mini-tournaments called the \"Triple-A Final Stretch.\" On 3 March, MLB informed its minor-league organizations that the start of the Triple-A season would be postponed until sometime in early May, at the same time of those of other levels. Players assigned to Triple-A teams would be sent to alternate training sites, which were used by MLB organizations in 2020 as well.\nOn 12 February 2021, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum announced that a smaller, indoor ceremony would replace the usual outdoor event. The inductions of Derek Jeter, Larry Walker, Ted Simmons, and Marvin Miller had already been postponed by one year when that ceremony was canceled outright. Unrelated to the pandemic and because no candidates met the year's election criteria, no new members were inducted in 2021. On 9 June, HOF officials announced a change to an outdoor ceremony with a limited number of tickets available, with the event scheduled for 8 September.\nOn 5 April 2021, the Texas Rangers held its home opener at Globe Life Field with around 38,000 fans, after having announced that it would not limit capacity for the game. This came as the state of Texas removed capacity limits for businesses state-wide. Despite criticism from health officials and U.S. president Joe Biden, there were no significant spikes in cases tied to Rangers games, and cases had been declining in the state. By May 2021, as restrictions eased across the country due to vaccination progress and a resulting reduction in caseloads, teams have gradually increased their spectator limits, and more teams announced plans to remove restrictions. Prior to the start of the season, MLB and the MLBPA announced that they would allow teams to ease their COVID-19 protocols if at least 85% of their \"tier 1\" staff (such as players) are fully-vaccinated.\nEarly on the morning of 26 June, the NCAA announced that North Carolina State had to withdraw from the College World Series due to multiple positive tests and required contract tracing. On 25 June, the Wolfpack had lost to Vanderbilt with only 13 players available.\n2022 season.\nMost Major League Baseball restrictions were lifted by the 2022 season, and the season began without any COVID-related delays or attendance restrictions for the first time since 2019. The season also marked the return of television and radio broadcast teams to road games, with some teams such as the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and New York Mets sending their broadcasters to call away games in person. Other broadcast teams, such as the MASN teams covering the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, initially chose to remain remote for road games in 2022, but quickly retreated following fan backlash. Some teams, like NESN's Boston Red Sox commentators, decided between remote and in-person broadcasting on a series-by-series basis. The Los Angeles Angels' lead commentator Matt Vasgersian called games from MLB Network's studios in New Jersey to accommodate his day-to-day contributions to the channel.\nWhile few MLB-imposed restrictions remained in place by 2022, players and personnel still had to comply with local ordinances relating to the pandemic. As the regular season approached, New York City's worker vaccine mandate posed a threat towards the ability of unvaccinated Yankees and Mets players to play games at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. On March 24, following campaigning for the decision by Yankees and Mets executives, New York City mayor Eric Adams announced an exemption to the vaccine mandate for professional athletes and performers, allowing unvaccinated players on the two teams to play games within the city. During the 2022 season, Canada's border vaccination requirement remained in place, barring unvaccinated players from playing against the Toronto Blue Jays in Rogers Centre. The travel restriction created a notable impact for division rivals, with Boston pitcher Tanner Houck missing a scheduled start in Toronto as a result.\nFor the third consecutive season, COVID-19 was the direct cause of at least one game postponement. That occurred on May 11, when the last game of a three-game series between the Cleveland Guardians and the Chicago White Sox was postponed due to numerous positive tests among the Guardians, including manager Terry Francona.\n2023 season.\nKansas City Royals manager Matt Quatraro left the team on April 5 after testing positive. Bench coach Paul Hoover took over on an interim basis, through at least April 9.\nOceania.\nIn September 2021, the Australian Baseball League announced that the start of its upcoming season would be delayed until November due to COVID outbreaks. In October 2021, the Australian Baseball League announced that the season would be canceled."

        "text": "Kyle Allen McCord (born September 19, 2002) is an American football quarterback for the Syracuse Orange. He previously played for the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nEarly life and high school.\nMcCord grew up in Mount Laurel, New Jersey and attended St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was teammates with future fellow Buckeye Marvin Harrison Jr. He received his first college scholarship offer from Central Michigan before the start of his freshman year of high school. As a sophomore, he passed for a school-record 2,883 yards and 35 touchdown passes. McCord passed for 2,399 yards and 31 touchdowns during his junior season before missing the final four games due to injury. He was named the Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior after completing 65 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,582 yards and 21 touchdowns. McCord finished his high school career with 6,887 passing yards, a Philadelphia Catholic League record, and 88 touchdown passes.\nMcCord was initially rated a four-star recruit and committed to play college football at Ohio State during his sophomore year over offers from Texas A&amp;M, Penn State, Mississippi State, and Michigan State. He was later reranked as a five-star prospect by \"247Sports\" as a junior.\nCollege career.\nOhio State.\nMcCord primarily spent his freshman season at Ohio State as the backup to starter C. J. Stroud. He made one start against Akron while Stroud was recovering from a shoulder injury. In the game, McCord completed 13 of 18 passing attempts for 319 yards and two touchdowns with one interception in a 59–7 win and was named the Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week. He finished the season with 416 passing yards and two touchdown passes and two interceptions in five games played. McCord entered his sophomore season as the Buckeyes second string quarterback. He appeared in seven games, all off the bench, and completed 16 of 20 pass attempts for 190 yards and one touchdown.\nMcCord competed with Devin Brown during spring practices and preseason training camp to succeed Stroud as Ohio State's starting quarterback in 2023. He was named the starter for the Buckeyes' season opener, although head coach Ryan Day stated that the competition was still ongoing. After completing 14 of 20 pass attempts for 258 yards and three touchdowns in a 35–7 victory in week 2 vs Youngstown State, McCord was named the starter for the rest of the 2023 season. In Week 4 against Notre Dame, McCord led a game-winning drive in the final two minutes as Ohio State won, 17–14. In Week 13 against the Michigan Wolverines, McCord threw for 271 yards and 2 touchdowns, but also threw a game-ending interception on Ohio State's final drive to Rod Moore as Ohio State lost, 30–24.\nPrior to Ohio State’s 2023 Cotton Bowl Classic appearance, McCord entered the NCAA transfer portal, following Ryan Day's declining to commit to McCord as the starting quarterback.\nSyracuse.\nOn December 17, 2023, McCord announced that he would be transferring to Syracuse.\nPersonal life.\nMcCord's father, Derek McCord, played quarterback at Rutgers from 1988 to 1992."

The Cardinal were led by thirty-seventh year head coach Tara VanDerveer, and they played their home games at Maples Pavilion as members of the Pac-12 Conference.\nThe team's win over Sacred Heart marked the end of losing streak to Mid Major New England teams, the streak began back in 1998 when they lost to Harvard to become the only number 1 seed to be upset and in 1999 when they lost to Maine in the first round.\nOffseason.\nDue to COVID-19, the NCAA ruled in October 2020 that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, thus giving all players the option to return in 2021–22. Additionally, any players who have declared for the 2022 WNBA draft—including seniors, who must opt into this year's draft—have the option to return if they make a timely withdrawal from the draft and end any pre-draft relationships with agents. Thus, separate lists will initially be maintained for confirmed and potential departures.\nPreseason.\nPreseason rankings.\nSource:\nPreseason All-Pac-12 teams.\nSource:\nRoster.\n \n \nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Pac-12 Women's Tournament\n \n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA Women's Tournament\nSource:\nGame summaries.\nThis section will be filled in as the season progresses. \nAwards and honors.\nSources:\nSources:\nMidseason awards watchlists.\nSources:\nFinal awards watchlists.\nSources:\nNational awards.\nSources:"
