        "text": "Joseph Thompson Hughes (February 21, 1880 – March 13, 1951) was an American Major League Baseball outfielder for the Chicago Orphans in 1902. He went to college at Geneva College. According to \"Sporting Life\" correspondent A.R. Cratty, due to injuries to the Orphans, Hughes shared time in right field during a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates with Hillebrand, who also played his only Major League game the previous day. Cratty suggested that Hughes may have been the brother-in-law of long time Major League infielder Bobby Lowe, who was playing for the Orphans that season."

The powerful Campbell ran on the outside of her lane 7 and into the lane of Yulia Gushchina though she was so far ahead of Gushchina that she wasn't in danger of interfering. Arron held the lead as Gevaert faded from contention. Teenage sensation and Olympic silver medalist, Allyson Felix was more than a stride behind and slightly behind her was Rachelle Boone-Smith. While Campbell corrected her heading, Felix began to go by, gaining on Arron. Felix went by Arron and on to the win showing little strain. Arron and Campbell strained to get to the line against each other. Virtually unnoticed, Boone-Smith gained steadily and was able to nip both of them at the line with Arron holding on to beat Campbell for bronze.\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.\nHeats.\nAugust 10, 2005\nSemifinals.\nAugust 11, 2005\nFinal.\nAugust 12, 2005"

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Andrew Strauss",
        "text": "Andrew Strauss is an English cricketer, who plays as an opening batsman. He has captained the England cricket team in Test and One Day International cricket since 2009. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on twenty-one occasions in Test cricket, and six times in One Day International (ODI) matches. In 2005, he was named as a \"Wisden\" Cricketer of the Year for his performances the previous year, in which he made his debut and, according to \"Wisden\"'s Jon Henderson, advanced \"from tyro to stalwart\". He was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2006 as part of England's 2005 Ashes winning squad. Five years later, he was again honoured for his Ashes achievements and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his role as captain during the 2010–11 Ashes series.\nStrauss made his Test cricket debut at the age of 27 after being called into the team to replace the injured Michael Vaughan. He scored a century in the first innings of the match, played against New Zealand at Lord's, his county home ground for Middlesex. In the second innings of the match he missed out on becoming the first England batsman to score centuries in both innings of his Test debut when he was run out on 83. His second Test century came in the first match of the series against the West Indies two months later, and was also scored at Lord's. The following English winter, Strauss scored three centuries during the Test series in South Africa, earning him the man of the series accolade, and high praise from Allan Donald, who said he had \"never seen any visiting player bat as well, with so many match-winning performances\". In 2008, he passed 150 for the first time in Test cricket, scoring 177 against New Zealand at McLean Park, Napier. The innings, his highest in Test cricket, is also the only time he has scored a Test century when not playing as an opening batsman for England. Strauss was named as England captain in 2009, and responded by passing 140 four times during the year, hitting centuries in three subsequent Tests against the West Indies, and scoring his highest total during an Ashes series against Australia, reaching 161 at Lord's. After a series of low scores, Strauss scored a century against the West Indies in the first match of the 2012 series, his first in a year and a half.\nIn ODI cricket, Strauss has scored six centuries during his career, the first of which came against the West Indies in 2004 at Lord's. He scored his second century the following season, reaching 152 against Bangladesh, at the time the third-highest total by an England batsman in ODIs. Strauss was dropped from the ODI side after the 2007 World Cup, but returned in 2009 when he was named as the national captain. He scored a patient century against the West Indies in the same year, but England's success without him at the 2010 World Twenty20 led to questions about whether his batting temperament was suited to one-day cricket. Over the subsequent year, Strauss scored three centuries, twice surpassing his previous highest total. He scored 154 against Bangladesh, and during the 2011 World Cup reached 158 during a tied match against India. His three scores in excess of 150 are all among the highest five by England batsmen in ODI cricket."

In 1969, the 9-hole South Course opened featuring a par 35 playing at 2,941 yards. \nFrom 1938 to 2010, Riverside hosted 42 Maine Open tournaments, the most of any course in the state.\nIn 2007 the 3-hole practice course was built for the use for junior programming. Throughout the winter the course is used for many winter activities, including cross country skiing, sledding, snowboarding, outdoor ice rink and snowshoeing.\nBetween 2001 and 2012, the course operated at a loss that cost taxpayers almost $200,000.\nIn 2016, the group Portland Protectors released a report that showed the course spent $25,000 a year on pesticides as part of its campaign to pass an ordinance restricting pesticide use in the city. In response, the course reduced synthetic pesticide use by 60% and installed bee hives. When the City Council passed a pesticide ordinance in 2018 requiring organic landscaping, the golf course was exempted from the requirements if it was designed through Audubon International as a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. The course continues to use synthetic pesticides. \nThe course reopened for the 2020 season with restrictions in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "title": "Historical fencing in Scotland",
        "text": "There is some evidence on historical fencing as practised in Scotland in the Early Modern Era, especially fencing with the Scottish basket-hilted broadsword during the 17th to 18th centuries.\nMost of our current knowledge of these arts derives from various combative treatises or Martial arts manuals, as well as written anecdotes (i.e. battle accounts, folklore, etc.) and artistic representations from different periods and locations in Scottish history (see Penicuik Sketches).\nScottish fencing masters.\nThe following is a list of fencing masters that were very influential in their day, and have contributed to our current knowledge of the martial practices of Scotland (see \"Combat Treatises\" below):\nFencing manuals.\nScottish fencing manuals detailing the use of the basket-hilted Scottish broadsword (besides other disciplines including the smallsword and spadroon and, to a lesser extent, the targe, dirk and quarterstaff)\nwere published throughout the 18th century, with early and late examples dating to the late 17th and early 19th centuries, respectively:\nTechniques.\nThe Highland Broadsword texts of the 1700s portray 7 cuts and numerous guards. The footwork is sword leg forward (usually right leg) with the other leg behind, similar to modern fencing. Traversing footwork allows one to step off the center-line of attack, either to right or left. The following Guards are listed in these texts:\nThe Cuts are as follows:\nShifting the Leg: When an opponent cuts at the outside of your leg, it is prudent to step back (and thus avoid the cut at the leg), counter-attacking with either a cut at the head or at the wrist simultaneous to shifting the leg. This technique was taught by Angelo, Taylor and Roworth.\nFamous Scottish duellists.\nIn the 17th–18th century, there were a number of warriors and soldiers that developed a reputation as skilled duellists. In the highlands, they were known as Caterans, and were noted for cattle theft as well as black-mail, and often traveled to different villages challenging them to produce a fighter that can best them, or pay a fee. Some belonged to the Duine uasal (Warrior Class) of their Clan:\nClan styles.\nIt has been suggested that certain Scottish Clans and families had specific training systems that were distinct from one another. For example, it is said that some members of Clan Macdonald were ambidextrous, and were thus able to fence with either left or right hand. The Kerr family is reputed to have predominantly left-handed swordsmen such as in poems by James Hogg however a study concluded that the family has no increased incidence of left-handedness.\nThe Black Watch appears to be the source of Highland Broadsword technique during the later part of the 18th century, as evidenced in Captain G. Sinclair's manual."

He was posthumously elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.\nBiography.\nHogan was born in County Tipperary, Ireland, and moved to Torrington, Connecticut, with his family while young. He entered Phillips Exeter Academy in 1897, and was captain of the gridiron football team in 1899 and 1900.\nAt Yale University, Hogan played four seasons as a tackle on the football varsity, 1901–1904, and was team captain of the 1904 Bulldogs. The Bulldogs compiled an overall 43–3–2 record during his four seasons. He also was a member of Yale's track team and the Skull and Bones secret society. He received All-America honors in football each season, the final three being a consensus selection.\nAfter leaving Yale, Hogan returned to Phillips Exeter Academy and coached football. He entered Columbia Law School and while there wrote for the \"Columbia Law Review\" and the \"New York World\". He graduated from Columbia in 1908. After initially working at a law firm, he went to work for the City of New York as a deputy street cleaning commissioner, a role which he held until early 1910.

During the 1980s and 1990s he played for clubs in Sydney, Brisbane, England and France where he also coached. Elias also played and coached for the Lebanon national team.\nBackground.\nElias was born in Beirut, Lebanon. As a child, along with his two older brothers and sister, he was taken by his mother to Sydney following the death of his father. There he became an Australian citizen.\nPlaying career.\n1980s.\nAfter starting his first grade career with the Newtown Jets in their final season in 1983, Elias then played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1984. The following season he moved north, and in the 1985 Brisbane Rugby League season's grand final for the Wayne Bennett-coached Souths Magpies, Elias was named man-of-the-match for his performance in a shock 10-8 victory over Wally Lewis' Wynnum-Manly Seagulls.\nElias joined the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 1986 but departed from the club mid-way through the season to join the Western Suburbs Magpies. Early in the 1987 Winfield Cup season, Elias was sent off for a high tackle in a match against North Sydney Bears. He joined the Eastern Suburbs Roosters in 1988. Early in the 1988 Winfield Cup season while playing for Easts, Elias' jaw was fractured in a tackle during the first minutes of a match against Balmain. Part-way through the 1989 NSWRL season, he left Eastern Suburbs to join the Balmain Tigers club, where he stayed until 1994.\n1990s.\nElias left Balmain to re-join the Rabbitohs mid-way through the 1994 Winfield Cup season. That season Elias was involved in a match-fixing plot that involved four players from his Souths team and four players from Wests. Elias was jailed for nine months in 1995 after pleading guilty in the NSW District Court to two counts of supplying amphetamines, one count of possessing F1 sub-machinegun parts and one count of possessing prohibited articles, namely military-style flak vests. Elias was the inaugural captain of the Lebanese rugby league team when they made their début in the 1997 World Sevens tournament, going on to reach the quarter-finals. He later travelled to France to play for Avignon and Toulouse.\nElias was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1999 at age 38, but postponed chemotherapy to play an international match for Lebanon against France. Later he underwent surgery to remove a tennis-ball sized lymphoma which had burst inside his stomach, forcing him into retirement.\nCoaching career.\nInstead of being Lebanon's captain for their campaign to join the 2000 World Cup, he served as their coach. Elias was refused entry into the United States for Lebanon's 2000 World Cup qualifier match due to his previous firearms conviction. Elias coached French club Pia Donkeys in 2002 and 2003, taking them from last in the competition to runners-up, before returning to Australia.\nIn 2004 Elias was facing up to 25 years in jail after a jury found him guilty of maliciously shooting his business partner in the leg. He ended up serving four years in prison. In 2008, following Elias' release from prison, it was reported that he and Arthur Beetson, who had advised Elias during the 2000 World Cup, were preparing a bid for a rugby league coaching job in Europe. In June 2009, following the conviction of Greg Bird, Elias wrote an article published by News Limited detailing his time in prison. That year Elias coached Lebanon in the 2009 European Cup tournament.\nAfter football.\nIn 2010 Elias published his book, \"Sin Bin: The Untold Story of a True Footy Bad Boy\", which detailed his life of football and crime. In the 2011 pre-season, he was arrested under suspicion of involvement in the 2010 spot fixing case perpetrated by Ryan Tandy, but was found not guilty.\nIn August 2014 Elias was found guilty of assault and given a five-month suspended jail sentence."

        "text": "The 1987 NCAA basketball tournament was the 63rd season in the Philippine National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Letran Knights successfully defended their championship in the Seniors division, while the San Beda Red Cubs clinched their first Juniors championship, returning from a leave of absence.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nFormat:\nCumulative standings.\nNo other team had a better cumulative record than the two pennant winners, so playoff for the Finals berth was not played.\nSan Sebastian clinched the first round pennant via a playoff; they defeated Letran in the said playoff to win the first round flag.\nLetran denied San Sebastian the outright championship with a 94–91 overtime victory at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. With Letran up, Jerry Ruiz fouled San Sebastian's Arnold Adlawan with 0.9 seconds left in regulation. Adlawan scored on a free-throw to tie the game at 82. In the overtime period, Letran never trailed as Fil-Am William Johnson and local Roberto Ruiz prevented San Sebastian's Eugene Quilban and foreign-student Napoleon Hatton from scoring. In the final three seconds of overtime, Letran's Fernando Libed, under medication for hepatitis, secured the win with a three-point play off a foul from Hatton.\nFinals.\nGame 1.\nSSC National team player Paul Alvarez played sparingly. The Stags led early, but Letran had a 14–4 run to tie the score 58–all for the first time; Erwin Santos scored for Letran to put them up for the first time, 68–67 with 9:30 left in the game. Saturnino Garrido then scored all of his eight points in the final six minutes to bring the lead back to SSC for good at 75–68 with 6:27 left. Letran's center Alberto David fouled out which the Stags used to their advantage off quick baskets from Garrido and Eugene Quilban for an 81–70 lead. Letran cut the deficit to 79–87 but the Quilban and Napoleon Hatton scored in the final two minutes to prevent the Knights from a come-from-behind victory.\nGame 2.\nAfter taking the halftime lead 50–47, Letran and San Sebastian remained close, but Letran pulled away in the fourth quarter off team captain Fernando Libed's eight points to give Letran an 84–79 lead. The Stags rallied to tie the game 90–all after trailing by eight points: Alvarez scored on a fastbreak and two free-throws off a foul from David, Garrido scored on a jump-shot, then Quilban converted on a lay-up to tie the score. Robert Ruiz scored on two free-throws for Letran off Garrido's foul to put Letran up, 92–90. Rookie Erwin Santos, playing for Libed who was suffering from cramps, blocked Garrido's shot with 14 seconds remaining; with three seconds left, he then intercepted Alvarez' pass to Arnold Adlawan. The Stags then resorted to fouling Ruiz, who made one of his two free-throws as time expired to tie the series for a deciding third game.\nGame 3.\nSan Sebastian led 31–18 when SSC coach Tolentino placed Hatton or Allan de los Reyes as safety men to prevent Letran's fastbreaks. Hatton scored six more points to extend SSC's lead to 37–25, but William Johnson and Arthur Ayson scored for Letran to cut the lead to eight 29–37 at the half. Letran scored on fastbreaks to seize the lead 45–40 but Alvarez and Hatton scored to bring back the lead to the Stags 58–53 with 5:54 to go. Further scoring from the two gave the Stags a 62–55 edge with 4:52 left. San Sebastian then opted to dribble away at their possessions, including waiving their free-throw attempts, while Letran cut the SSC lead to one point 62–61. At the last SSC possession, Quilban dribbled away at the top of the key, but the ball got stranded at the low post that resulted in a missed shot from Rizaldo Bade. Roberto Ruiz grabbed the rebound for Letran, passed to David at midcourt who passed the ball to Ayson. Ayson passed the ball to Libed, who drove to the basket and converted a jump-shot off the Stags' Melchor Teves, de los Reyes and Hatton with 1.2 seconds left, to secure Letran's defense of the championship. Letran coach Eddie Reyes wore the same shirt he won on the 1986 championship-clinching game also against San Sebastian. The Letran faithful gave their Santo Niño a victory ride after the game's conclusion.\nJuniors' tournament.\nThe San Beda Red Cubs won the juniors' championship, their first after their return from a leave of absence from 1983 to 1985. The Red Cubs won the title by winning both pennants, with its only loss coming from the San Sebastian Staglets."

Hosted by Ateneo de Manila University, the Ateneo Blue Eagles defeated the UE Red Warriors in the finals taking their first UAAP men's basketball championship after transferring from the NCAA (Philippines) in 1978.\nElimination round.\nFedencio Oblina of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) was found to be ineligible as he failed his NCEE examinations. The board then forfeited all of UST's win where Oblina played, with the Goldies going from a 6–3 record (tied for third) to a 2–7 record, at seventh place ahead of winless National University (NU). The forfeitures benefited Adamson, Ateneo and Far Eastern University (FEU): Ateneo found themselves at the top of the standings with an 8–1 record. A source of the \"Manila Standard\" newspaper confirmed that while Oblina failed the NCEE twice, he passed it on 1985.\nNU won their first game in six years with an 89–75 win over the University of the Philippines (UP) squad that was shorthanded by injuries. Their win snapped their nine-game losing streak during the season. Meanwhile, the UAAP Board confirmed that Oblina has been meted with a lifetime ban.\nFinals.\nNumber 1 seed Ateneo only has to win once, while number 2 seed UE has to win twice, to clinch the championship.\nWith Ateneo center Danny Francisco sitting out the game due to a lung ailment, University of the East (UE) started the game strong, taking a 51–38 lead at halftime. After the Warriors extended their lead to twenty points at 83–63, Ateneo came alive and had a 22–2 run sparked by a three-point shot by Joseph Kenneth Nieto to tie the game at 85–all. Nieto and Gilbert Reyes scored for Ateneo to give them the 92–86 lead. UE tied the score anew at 92–all after free-throws from Bernie Villarias, Conrado Barilo and Modesto Hojilla, but on the succeeding possession, a driving Emilio Chuatico was blocked by Hojilla who was called for an intentional foul. After Chuatico split his free-throws and Ateneo retaining possession, the Blue Eagles dribbled the time until a driving Eric Reyes was fouled by Jerry Codiñera with three seconds left. Reyes ended the game by splitting his free-throws, and giving Ateneo their first UAAP championship."

The York Lions have won three OUA championships in their program history while making one appearance in the U Sports women's ice hockey championship tournament since its inception in 1998.\nHistory.\nOn February 11, 2000, the Ontario University Athletics women's ice hockey program saw its longest game take place. The University of Toronto's Rhonda Mitchell scored on a 35-foot slap shot. It was the 5:07 mark of the eighth period and the Varsity Blues defeated York University. Although the victory allowed the U of T to advance to the OUA gold medal game, it was the longest in the history of Canadian women's hockey (since broken). The game lasted over five hours and ten minutes. York's player of the game was goaltender Debra Ferguson, as she valiantly made 63 saves over 125 minutes.\nOn February 5, 2011, two Lions players, forward Courtney Unruh and defender Kelsey Webster (and assistant coach Stacey Colarossi) were part of the Team Canada roster that captured gold at the 2011 Winter Universiade title as Canada defeated Finland 4–1 in the gold-medal final. Autumn Mills was the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) nominee for the 2011 Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) Marion Hillard Award.\nAfter seven years of finishing out of the playoffs, the 2019-20 Lions team finished with a record and a third-place finish in the OUA. The Lions swept both the Waterloo Warriors and Nipissing Lakers in the OUA playoffs before losing the McCaw Cup championship to the Toronto Varsity Blues in a sudden death 1–3 loss. Because the Lions were an OUA finalist, the team qualified for the U Sports women's ice hockey championship for the first time in program history in 2020. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the tournament was cancelled on the day that the Lions were scheduled to play against the McGill Martlets in the opening round game.

        "text": "Ian White (born 17 August 1970), nicknamed Diamond, is an English professional darts player currently playing in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events. White is the winner of 13 PDC ranking events, and has reached many quarter-finals in majors. In 2019, he reached his first major semi final.\nCareer.\nIn 1997, White reached the final of the PDC's revived News of the World Darts Championship. He defeated Des Byrne, Gary Spedding, Peter Manley and Andy Jenkins on the way to the final, where he was defeated by Phil Taylor.\nWhite won the Antwerp Open, Denmark Open and the English National Championship in 2009. He qualified for the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship, but lost 0-3 in the first round to Stephen Bunting. Shortly afterwards, he left the BDO and joined the PDC, when fellow Stoke player Adrian Lewis offered to sponsor White and suggested he was capable of being in the world's top eight. A solid first year in the PDC saw him reach the semi-finals of a Pro Tour event in Dublin, gain an automatic Tour Card, and narrowly miss out on the 2011 PDC World Championship by £100.\nIn February 2011, he reached his first PDC final since 1997. He lost 3-6 to Steve Brown in the final of the 2011 UK Open Qualifier 1.\nWhite finished third in the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts wildcard qualifier, and was awarded a place in the tournament proper after Simon Whitlock withdrew due to injury.\n2012.\nHe qualified for his first PDC World Championship in 2012, where he was beaten 1-3 by Robert Thornton in the last 64. He threw a nine-dart finish in the opening Players Championship event of the season in a first round match against Mark Hylton. White reached the semi-finals of the event, where he was beaten 4-6 by the eventual winner Justin Pipe. In April, he earned a place in the European Tour Event 1 in Vienna by defeating Adrian Gray in the UK qualifier. He played Colin Lloyd in the first round and lost 3–6, with his opponent averaging 111. In May, he reached the final of the Players Championship Event 5 where he lost 2–6 to Dave Chisnall. He also qualified for the third European Tour Event with a win over John Scott, but was then beaten by Raymond van Barneveld 2–6 in the first round in Düsseldorf. By July, White had reached two semi-finals and two finals in PDC events in 2012, meaning he qualified for the World Matchplay for the first time in his career due to being the sixth highest player on the ProTour Order of Merit who was not in the world's top 16. He played Vincent van der Voort in the first round and took out 164 and 161 finishes in a 10–5 victory to set up a last 16 fixture with 12-time World Matchplay champion Phil Taylor, which he lost 3–13.\nWhite threw his second nine-darter of the season in the fourth European Tour event, the German Darts Masters in a last 16 win against Andy Hamilton. He continued his momentum with a quarter-final deciding leg victory over Robert Thornton and a 6–4 semi-final win against Raymond van Barneveld. In the final he faced two-time reigning world champion and occasional practice partner Adrian Lewis, and was beaten 3–6. White's exceptional form carried on at his next event, the 11th Players Championship, as he beat the likes of Simon Whitlock and Terry Jenkins to reach the final. He played Michael van Gerwen and lost in a final for the fourth time this year following a 1–6 defeat. At the European Championship he exacted his revenge over Lewis with a sensational 6–0 whitewash in the first round. However, he lost to Kim Huybrechts 5–10 in his following match. At the World Grand Prix in October, White took out finishes of 144, 132 and 112 to beat van Barneveld 2–0 in sets and then faced Wes Newton in the last 16, where he was beaten 1–3. White came agonisingly close to winning his first PDC title in November, as he held a 4–0 lead over Michael van Gerwen in the final of the 18th Players Championship event, but went on to lose 5–6. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, White finished eighth on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Players Championship Finals for the first time. He was beaten 5–6 by Michael Smith in the first round.\n2013.\nWhite was just outside the top 32 ranked players who qualified automatically for the 2013 World Championship. However, his impressive play in events in 2012 earned him the first spot of sixteen that were available for non-qualified players via the ProTour Order of Merit. White was over £18,000 ahead of the second placed Michael Smith. He was beaten by Mark Webster 1–3 in the first round. However, after the tournament he was ranked world number 30, the first time White has been inside the top 32. He was beaten by Steve West 3–9 in the third round of the UK Open. At the eighth Players Championship in September, White won his first PDC tournament by defeating Simon Whitlock 6–3 in a final with an average of almost 101. He had earlier beaten two-time World Champion Adrian Lewis 6–1 and the title saw him move up to 23rd on the Order of Merit. White faced Dave Chisnall in the first round of the World Grand Prix and missed eight darts for legs in the deciding set to lose 2–1. He made his debut in the Championship League and won his group at the first time of asking by beating Peter Wright 6–4 in the final. In the Winners Group he won three of his seven matches to finish sixth in the eight man table. Whilst the top 16 players on the Order of Merit were competing in the Masters in November, White took full advantage by winning his second PDC ranking title at the 14th Players Championship with a 6–3 success over Andy Jenkins in the final. He beat Ronnie Baxter 6–3 and Terry Jenkins 9–2 at the Players Championship Finals to reach the quarter-finals of a PDC major event for the first time. White fell 4–0 down to Andy Hamilton and could never recover the deficit as he lost 9–6.\n2014.\nWhite was the 21st seed for the 2014 World Championship and won his first ever match in the event by beating Australia's Kyle Anderson 3–1. He then survived a huge scare in the second round as Kim Huybrechts came back from 3–0 down to level, but White held his nerve to take the deciding set. He then produced a successful fightback in the third round against Richie Burnett by winning nine of eleven legs from 3–1 behind to triumph 4–3. In the quarter-finals White came up against fourth seed Simon Whitlock and trailed 3–0 and 4–1, but then won a trio of sets each by three legs to one to square the game at 4–4. White missed two darts to hold his throw in the fifth leg of the decider and lost the next leg to fall agonosingly short of reaching the semi-finals. He moved into the top 16 on the Order of Merit for the first time after the tournament. A third successive quarter-final in a major event came at the UK Open by beating Gary Anderson 9–7 in the fifth round. White faced Michael van Gerwen and trailed 6–2 and 8–5 but pulled the gap back to 9–8 before losing the next leg to fall just short of reaching his first televised semi-final.\nHis first final in the floor events of 2014 came at the fourth Players Championship, but he was whitewashed 6–0 by Phil Taylor. Another final followed at the sixth event and he led Robert Thornton 4–2 and 5–4, before missing six darts to win the match in the next leg, instead going on to lose 6–5. White ensured that he reached the second round of the World Matchplay for the third year running by seeing off Terry Jenkins 10–4, but then was heavily beaten 13–4 by Van Gerwen. White won his third PDC title at the penultimate Players Championship courtesy of a 6–2 success over Dave Chisnall.\n2015.\nWhite won six consecutive legs against Kim Huybrechts in the second round of the 2015 World Championship to take a 3–2 lead, but from there could only win one more leg as he lost 4–3. White threw a nine-dart finish in a 6–3 victory over Mervyn King in the quarter-finals of the final UK Open Qualifier and then averaged 109.37 in edging past Raymond van Barneveld 6–5, before losing 6–2 against Phil Taylor in the final. He also hit a nine darter during a 6–3 success over Jamie Lewis in the semi-finals of the 11th Players Championship, but lost 6–1 to Dave Chisnall in the final. A third defeat in a final this year came at the 14th event where he was eliminated 6–2 by Jelle Klaasen.\nWhite had a high quality game with Stephen Bunting in the first round of the World Matchplay as both players averaged over 100 (White the highest with 103.51), 17 maximums were thrown and White took out three ton-plus finishes to win 10–6. He played in the quarter-finals after ousting Simon Whitlock 13–9 and led Michael van Gerwen 6–1, before being pegged back to 7–7. White fell 12–10 behind, but produced a 12-dart leg to move 13–12 in front, before a host of missed doubles from White including seven in the final leg saw him lose 16–13. His first title of 2015 came at the 17th Players Championship when he held on from 5–1 ahead of Chisnall to win 6–5.\nIn the second round of the World Grand Prix, White averaged 97.96 in the double-to-start event in defeating reigning world champion Gary Anderson 3–1 in sets. Although he averaged 20 points lower in the quarter-finals against Robert Thornton, the match went to a deciding leg at 2–2 in sets which White lost. He was eliminated out of the European Championship at the first round stage and couldn't get out of his group at the Grand Slam. However, deciding leg victories over Raymond van Barneveld and Gerwyn Price saw White reach his third major quarter-final of the year at the Players Championship Finals. White's search for a first PDC semi-final will go on though, as he was ousted 10–6 by Mensur Suljović.\n2016.\nWhite took the first set against Dimitri van den Bergh in the opening round of the 2016 World Championship, but went on to lose 3–1. As his popularity rose, many fans began to sing The Third Rock From the Sun theme tune at his matches due to his similarity to John Lithgow. The song appeared to irritate him on stage as he was defeated 9–6 by Simon Whitlock in the third round of the UK Open, but in the final of the fifth Players Championship event whitewashed world number one Michael van Gerwen 6–0 in the final, with an average of 106.20. White also secured the 11th event with a 6–3 win over Joe Cullen. After comfortably seeing off Daryl Gurney 10–2 in the first round of the World Matchplay, White lost 11–6 to Peter Wright. He returned to win his third Players Championship crown of the year and seventh PDC tournament in his career by beating Benito van de Pas 6–4. White eliminated Terry Jenkins 6–2 at the European Championship and came back from 8–3 to force a deciding leg against Mensur Suljović, but lost it to be defeated 10–9. His titles during the year qualified him for the Grand Slam and a win over Darryl Fitton would have seen him progress from his group, but he lost 5–4 from being 3–1 up and missed three match darts in the process.\n2017.\nWhite faced Peter Wright in the third round of the 2017 World Championship after overcoming Kevin Simm 3–0 and Jonny Clayton 4–1. He lost nine of the first ten legs and could never recover in a 4–1 defeat. His quarter-final with Gerwyn Price at the UK Open went to a deciding leg and White was on 20 to win but burst his score by hitting double 15 to allow Price to edge through 10–9. White thrashed Michael van Gerwen 6–1 to reach the semi-finals of the German Darts Open, where he lost 6–3 to Benito van de Pas. His first final of the year was at the 11th Players Championship, but he missed five darts for the title in a 6–5 defeat to Rob Cross.\nPerformance timeline.\nPDC European Tour"

Austria had 652 female players in 2013.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1998, the league uses a format of home and away matches. In the 2004–05 season, the best Austrian teams additionally also competed in the international Elite Women's Hockey League (EWHL). From the following season onward, the top teams only played in the EWHL, making the Bundesliga in a sense the second-level league of Austrian Women's ice hockey. As a result, the title of Austrian champion is decided in a separate tournament titled \"\" (National Championship), featuring the three teams that play in the EWHL and the top DEBL team. Exceptions were the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons where EWHL clubs were the only competing teams. Since 2008, following the example of the men's Austrian Hockey League, the DEBL has also featured teams from Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey. \nFormat.\nThe nine teams of the DEBL are assembled into one division. The teams play each other three times a year.\nThe top DEBL team qualifies for the where it meets the three Austrian teams from the EWHL. The tournament uses a home- and away-game format. The two top teams contest the final, using a best-of-three format. The better-placed team has the right to contest the first game in its home ground. The other two teams contest the third-place play-off, also using a best-of-three format.\nTeams.\nPast participants.\nAustria\nCroatia\nHungary\nSlovenia\nTurkey\nDEBL II.\nIn 2004, due to the increasing number of teams, a second division titled DEBL II was created. There was no match play in this league in the 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons.\nThe team that finishes at the bottom of the DEBL league table at the end of the season meets the top team of the DEBL II over a best-of-three series. The winner of that contest then plays in the DEBL during the next season, while the loser is relegated to the second DEBL.\nReferences.\n\"This article incorporates information from the existing French Wikipedia article at and the existing German Wikipedia article at .\""

        "text": "The German Women's Ice Hockey League () or DFEL, also known as the German Women's Ice Hockey Bundesliga (), is the top-tier women's ice hockey league in Germany. An amateur league, it was founded in 1988 by the German Ice Hockey Federation (DEB, ).\nHistory.\nThe German Women's Ice Hockey Bundesliga was created in 1988–89. Previously, the national championship took the form of a tournament featuring the best teams from the various regional federations. The Bundesliga was initially split into two divisions, North and South, with a final championship tournament at the end of the season, but in April 2006, the participating teams voted to have only a single division, starting from the 2006–07 season.\n2022–23 season.\nSix teams participated in the 2022–23 DFEL season, following the withdrawal of Düsseldorfer EG after the 2019–20 season and the withdrawal of EC Köln (\"Die Haie\") after the 2021–22 season. The regular season began on 1 October 2022 and concluded on 19 February 2023. ECDC Memmingen were the regular season champions; the team featured both the league’s top scorer, American forward Theresa Knutson, and best goaltender, Emma Schweiger.\nThe top four teams from the regular season qualified for the playoffs, which were played on a best-of-five tournament schedule. In the semifinals, ECDC Memmingen swept ESC Planegg-Würmtal to take the series in three games and the Mad Dogs Mannheim bested ERC Ingolstadt in four games.\nECDC Memmingen did not slow down in the German Championship finals, sweeping Mad Dogs Mannheim in three games to claim the team’s fourth championship title.\nTeams.\n2023–24 season.\nWith the addition of the Amsterdam Tigers, seven teams participated in the 2023–24 DFEL season; the Amsterdam Tigers were the 2022–23 winners of the Netherlands' championship. The regular season began on 23 September 2023 and concluded on 25 February 2024. Each team played 24 games, facing every opponent twice at home and twice away.\nGerman Women's Cup.\nBeginning in the 2001–02 season, the German Ice Hockey Federation (DEB) organized an annual tournament called the DEB Women's Cup (), which would be played over several days at the end of the DFEL season. It featured the top four or six teams from the most recent DFEL season, divided into two groups of two or three teams each. The tournament has not been held since 2018. "

The club was founded in 1972 and is a member of the l'Association des Sociétés Sportives Nyonnaises, the Association Vaudoise de Rugby and the Swiss Rugby Federation. They play their home matches at the Colovray Sports Centre which is under the management of UEFA. Since its creation, Nyon Rugby Club has won the national championship and cup several times and has provided many players to the Swiss national side\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nNyon started playing in the 2nd division (League National B) of the Swiss championship in 1972 and played their home matches in La Vuarpillière area of the town. In the late 1970s, the club moved down to the lakeside at Colovray for training sessions and home matches. The Colovray Sports Centre was re-developed in 1989 and since 2010 is under the management of UEFA (The Union of European Football Associations), which has its administrative center on site.\nToday.\nToday, Nyon Rugby Club runs two senior men's sides, a ladies team and has a large junior section (U16 and U18) both playing in the national leagues. The men's teams and juniors sections train on Tuesday and Thursday and the ladies team (Mermaids) on Monday and Wednesday. All home matches are played at the Colovray Sports Centre. \nIn 2011, a veteran section (\"the KromaNyon\") was created for the older players (+35). They play on Wednesday evenings with a mix of touch rugby and contact. \nIn 2003, the rugby club joined forces with La Côte rugby club in nearby Gland, which allowed the two clubs to share resources for the development of the sport with their mini-rugby sections. \nTerre-Sainte Rugby School was created in 2018 in Coppet to foster the development of the sport in the region. Children between the ages of 5 and 14 train in Gland and Coppet. They then move to Nyon Rugby Club to join the junior section. \nOff the field, Nyon Rugby Club contributes to community life and volunteers in many local events. Since its inception, the club has run a bar at the Paelo Festival and organized an annual loto event. In 2007, a fund raising event resulted in a donation to the pediatrics service at Nyon Hospital. The club has organized training camps for foreign professional rugby teams and in 2010 organized a match on their home ground between ASM Clermont Auvergne and CSBJ Bourgoin, a game that les Clermontois eventually won in front of 4000 spectators."

        "text": "Swimming was an English art rock band formed in Nottingham, England, known for their genre-straddling output that unites a fluid and experimental sonic approach into a sound which is uniformly uplifting. They have releases on their own Colourschool Records, EVR Records and Tummy Touch Records.\nHistory.\nSwimming as a coherent experimental project emerged in 2004 as a result of previous years of dedicated writing sessions between John Sampson and Benjamin Hallatt. The duo developed the band's fluid and diverse conceptual style in writing and producing the material heard on debut EP, \"Pacific Title\". The E.P. was completed with John's brother Pete on drums, as well as Andrew Wright on keyboards. Pacific Title was released on Izumi Records in 2006. Hallatt left the 'live' band line up shortly after the E.P.'s completion but contributed to Swimming's 'Primary' EP in 2008 and debut album, 'The Fireflow Trade' in 2009. The new incarnation of Swimming, set about developing the fluid conceptual groundwork in an increasingly 'song based', direction, gaining praise in the popular indie music and mainstream press for their original approach.\nThe second EP \"Primary\" was released, again through Izumi Records, in 2008 as well as two singles, Panthalassa and Tigershark that got their first national airplay on BBC Radio1, XFM and heavy rotation on NME Radio. The band recruited a second guitarist, Jonathon \"Joff\" Spittlehouse and bass player Blake Pearson (aka G KOKO) and supported Chairlift, Pivot (PVT), Shearwater as well as their first festival appearances at Glastonbury and a world first fully binaural, headphone only gig with sonic artist Dallas Simpson at Dot to Dot Festival 2008.\nThe band's self-produced debut album The Fireflow Trade came out in May 2009 on their own label, Colourschool Records. Having a sound that proved hard to define, the band evoked comparisons to well over 50 different artists in the press around the release of the album. The Fireflow Trade was included in many best of-2009 lists including number 21 in The Fly Magazine.\nThe band toured Europe in Oct 2010 and signed to Tim 'Love' Lee's Tummy Touch Records the same month. The track \"Sun In The Island\" was the first single off their second album, \"Ecstatics International\", and was chosen to be the first release on New York's East Village Radio's new singles club, EVRRecords in March 2011.\n\"Ecstatics International\" was released in November 2011 in the UK to more critical acclaim through Tummy Touch Records; described as \"...a near faultless, cliché-free exploration of contemporary synth pop\" and made it into the top 10 debuts of the year in Clash Magazine.\nIn 2013, Swimming produced the soundtrack to the short film, \"Beyond The Scars\", about surfing in the exposed, freezing corners of the North Sea. It was commissioned by and screened on Channel 4's Shooting Gallery, in February 2013.\nBinaural Recordings.\nSwimming and Dallas Simpson have collaborated on a series of live recordings and performances. Many of these are available online as videos and in 2011 they produced a short documentary with award-winning director Simon Ellis called \"Swimming: Beach\" which premiered at the 8th Berlin International Directors Lounge in February 2012. The band have recorded in various outdoor environments to match the songs they record. They have also given select live performances to diverse audiences from cinemas, art spaces, festivals and more conventional venues. This setup has picked up the attention of \"Sound On Sound\" magazine, who ran an in-depth feature in their February 2012 issue.\nBinaural Recordings/Films:\n2007: \"Swimming: Woods\" - remix of Tigershark remix at Ambergate, Derbyshire, UK \n2009: \"Swimming: Skyspace\" live version of Sun In The Island in Skyspace, Kielder, Northumberland, UK \n2011: \"Swimming: Beach\" Documentary of binaural recordings at Bamburgh Beach, Northumberland, UK\nAssociated acts.\nSwimming's core original member, Benjamin Hallatt, has produced a wealth of minimalist abstracted sound work independently of his time with the Swimming project. Documented works date back to 2004 with an obscure 7\" vinyl pressing under the moniker SCKE// with further works and live performances dating to 2015 with various solo projects and collaborations. Notably in early 2015, Hallatt supported Russell Haswell and Painjerk on a rare collaborative performance, as well as accompanying Rudolf Eber on the 2015 Crater Lake Festival bill.\nBefore joining Swimming, keyboardist Andrew Wright played guitar for Nottingham indie rock band Panchiko, where he eventually returned a decade later.\nBefore joining Swimming, keyboardist Sam Potter was a member of Castle Donington band Late of the Pier."

        "title": "Women's European Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The Women's European Volleyball Championship is the official competition for senior women's national volleyball teams of Europe, organized by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV). The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1975 they have been awarded every two years. The current champion is Turkey, which won its first title at the 2023 tournament.\nHistory.\nThe first tournament was held in 1949 with participation of seven national teams. It was dominated by teams from Eastern Europe, who at that times were strongest teams not only at the European continent but also in the whole world. The teams from Eastern Europe dominated at the tournament for next four and half decades. The first European title was won by Soviet Union, who also won two next editions – in 1950 and 1951. At all three tournaments the Soviet team demonstrated overwhelming advantage – they not only won all matches, but also didn't lose any single set. This achievement was repeated by Soviet Union at the first Women's World Championship which was held in 1952 in Moscow.\nIn 1955, Czechoslovakia managed to break Soviet dominance and to win European gold after 3-2 victory over a Soviet Union in a decisive match at the tournament. However, Soviet team returned at first positions after victory at the 1956 World Championship next year. At the next 1958 European Championship which was held in Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union took revenge and returned European title after 3-2 victories over host team and Poland who captured silver and bronze medals respectively.\nThe victory in 1958 marked the beginning of the era of dominance of the Soviet Union which lasted for more than two decades. From 1958 to 1979, Soviet team didn't lose any tournament by winning 7 European titles in a row. At the next European Championship which was held in 1963, Soviet Union defended own title after difficult 3-2 victory over a Poland in a decisive match of the final round. But at next two European tournaments – in 1967 and 1971 – Soviet team demonstrated overwhelming advantage not losing any single set in all matches. European Championships held in 1975 and 1977 were also won relatively easy as all matches ended with either 3-0 or 3-1 victories. However, at the 1979 European Championship, Soviet Union faced with serious resistance from opponents. In preliminary round, Soviet Union lost 2-3 to Poland. It was only second defeat of the Soviet team at the European Championships and also their first defeat within 24 years. It, however, affected little at outcome of the tournament as Polish team was eliminated after preliminary round while Soviet team won gold medals after difficult 3-2 victories over a Romania and Bulgaria in the final round. During these two decades, Soviet Union was not only dominant power in Europe but also world volleyball superpower by winning two Olympic titles (1968, 1972), two World Championships (1960, 1970) and first edition of the Women's World Cup held in 1973.\nAfter victory at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, a power of the Soviet team started to decline. At the next 1981 European Championship which was held in Bulgaria, home team finally managed to break Soviet dominance. Bulgaria won their maiden European title after 3-0 victory over a Soviet Union in a decisive match of the final round which was held in Sofia. The next four European Championships were marked by rivalry between Soviet Union and East Germany. In 1983, playing at home, East Germany obtained a remarkable victory over Soviets after trailing 0-2 in a decisive match of the final round which was held in Rostock and won their maiden European title. Two years later Soviet team took revenge and returned European title after 3-0 victory over East Germany in a decisive match of the final round. But in 1987 East Germany won European Championship for second time after 3-2 victory over Soviet Union in a final match. The last European final between these national teams took place in 1989 in Stuttgart, West Germany. Soviet team won 3-1 and returned European title.\nIn the late 1980s, Soviet Union was managed to return status of volleyball superpower not only in Europe but also in the world by winning 1988 Olympic Games and 1990 World Championships. At the 1991 European Championship, Soviet team demonstrated overwhelming advantage not losing any single set in all matches – including 3-0 victories over unified Germany in semifinals and Netherlands in the final match. It however was their last participation at the competition. Soviet national team finished its history with remarkable statistics - they won 13 of 17 European Championships (not losing any single set in all matches at 6 of 13 victorious tournaments), suffered only 5 defeats in 116 matches, with set ratio 341:43.\nFollowing the Soviet Union's dissolution in December 1991, Russia (official inheritor of the Soviet team) continued to dominate in Europe. It's remarkable that their main European rival at those times (who became runner-up for the three times in a row) was Croatia strengthened by some former Soviet players such as Irina Kirillova, Yelena Chebukina, Tatyana Sidorenko and Maria Likhtenstein. In 1995, playing at home, Netherlands managed to break this dominance after 3-1 victory over a Russia in semifinals and 3-0 victory over Croatia in a final match which was held in Arnhem. This victory became historical not only for Netherlands, but also for whole Western Europe. At the next two editions – in 1997 and 1999 – Russia returned at first positions after 3-0 victories over Croatia in both final matches. But in the 2001 European Championship final Russian team faced with stronger resistance from the new rising European power – Italy (who became World Champion next year). Russia achieved difficult victory in a five-set match. Nikolay Karpol won European title as head coach for the record seventh time (starting from 1979 victory).\nAfter victory in 2001, the period of Russia's dominance came to end, and more national teams were managed to win their maiden European title. The next tournament was surprisingly won by Poland while Russia (2001 European Champion) and Italy (2002 World Champion) faced only in 5th place match. At the 2005 European Championship, Polish team proved non-randomness of this success after 3-2 victory over a Russia in semifinals and 3-1 victory over Italy in a final match. In 2007, Italy won their maiden European title by beating Serbia 3-0 in a final match. At next European Championships, Italian team repeated this success after 3-0 victory over Netherlands in a final. In 2011, playing at home, Serbia managed to win their maiden European title after remarkable 3-2 victory over Germany in a final match which was held in Belgrade. The next two European Championships held in 2013 and 2015 were won by Russia who managed to beat home teams in both the final matches (3-1 over Germany in Berlin and 3-0 over Netherlands in Rotterdam respectively).\nThe 2017 European Championship took place in Azerbaijan and Georgia. The 2019 European Championship was co-hosted by four countries for first time – Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey. Both tournaments were finished with Serbia's success who also won World Championships in 2018. However, this winning streak was ended in 2021 when Italy managed to beat Serbia in a final match which was held at the opponent's home ground in Belgrade and thus winning their third European title in history. Next year Serbian team won World Championships for second time in history. But in 2023 Serbia lost European final again – Turkey managed to beat reigning World Champions in a 5th-set tie-breaker and thus to win their maiden European trophy.\nThe 33 European Championship tournaments have been won by nine nations. Russia have won nineteen times (thirteen as Soviet Union). The other European Championship winners are Italy and Serbia, with three titles each; Germany (as East Germany) and Poland, with two titles each; and Bulgaria, Czech Republic (as Czechoslovakia), Netherlands and Turkey, with one title each.\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding two years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the . 16 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about two weeks. For the 2019 edition the number of participants in the was increased from 16 to 24.\nPoland co-holds record for the participation in the European Championships (32 times) by missing only one tournament. Russia also participated in the 32 European Championships (seventeen as the Soviet Union). Bulgaria participated in the continental championships 31 times and Netherlands – 30 times.\nMost successful players.\nBoldface denotes active volleyball players and highest medal count among all players (including these who not included in these tables) per type.\nMultiple medalists.\nThe table shows players who have won at least 6 medals in total at the European Championships."

        "text": "Zhang Nan (; born 1 March 1990) is a Chinese badminton player who specializes in both men's and mixed doubles. He found much success in mixed doubles with his former partner Zhao Yunlei. They won gold in 2012 Summer Olympics, 3 golds in BWF World Championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015 and a gold at the 2014 Asian Games. Having won all major events as a pair, they are considered one of the most successful mixed doubles pairs of all time.\nHaving found huge success in mixed doubles with Zhao, Zhang partnered Fu Haifeng with whom he won gold in 2016 Summer Olympics. After this, Fu retired and Zhang partnered Liu Cheng and became World Champion in the men's doubles at the 2017 BWF World Championships.\nCareer.\nZhang Nan is a badminton player who has achieved success in both men's and mixed doubles. In the men's doubles he has been paired with Chai Biao, Fu Haifeng, Lu Kai, Liu Cheng and Ou Xuanyi; while in the mixed doubles he has been paired with Lu Lu, Tang Jinhua, Zhao Yunlei and Li Yinhui.\n2010.\nHe participated in the 2010 Thomas Cup in Kuala Lumpur, playing for China.

Zhang and Zhao won the Japan Open title, beating compatriots Tao Jiaming and Tian Qing in the final, 21–19, 22–20. Meanwhile, Zhang and Chai's journey in Tokyo was ended by seniors Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng in the semi-finals, losing 17–21 and 16–21.\nIn China Open, Zhang attended the men's and mixed doubles finals but he lost in both events. In the men's doubles, South Korea's Jung Jae-sung and Lee Yong-dae emerged as the winners as they downed Zhang and Chai in straight sets, 21–15 and 21–12. In the mixed doubles final, Tao Jiaming and Tian Qing took revenge with a 21–18, 21–17 triumph over Zhang and Zhao.\nZhang only played in mixed doubles in the last Super Series tournament of 2010, Hong Kong Open. Seeded fifth, he and Zhao reached the final but lost in a long three-set match against Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen of Denmark 20–22, 21–14, and 20–22.\n2011.\nZhang and Zhao were qualified to play in the 2010 Super Series Finals Taiwan. They became the winner by beating Thailand's Sudket Prapakamol and Saralee Thungthongkam 21–17, 21–12 in the final. Zhang and Chai also played in the Super Series Finals, yet both were conquered by Jung Jae-sung and Lee Yong-dae in the last four 15–21 and 11–21 in just 30 minutes.\nOnce again, Zhang and Zhao met Tao Jiaming and Tian Qing, now in Korea Open final. Zhang and Zhao vanquished their teammates 21–17, 13–21, and 21–19 to become the first winners of a Super Series Premier.\n2012.\nIn July–August at the London Olympics, he won the gold medal at the mixed doubles event with Zhao Yunlei, beating compatriots Xu Chen and Ma Jin in the gold medal match, 21–11, 21–17.\n2016.\nAt the 2016 Olympics, Zhang and Zhao, the defending champions in the mixed doubles event, lost in the semi-final, but successfully clinched a bronze medal after winning a rematch of the last edition's final, beating Xu Chen and Ma Jin in straight games again. On the other hand, Zhang won the gold medal with Fu Haifeng in the men's doubles event, beating Malaysians Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong in a tightly-fought match, 16–21, 21–11, 23–21. They saved two gold medal points during the third game, and eventually converted one on their first opportunity.\n2017.\nZhang won the World Championships in the men's doubles event with Liu Cheng, defeating Indonesians Mohammad Ahsan and Rian Agung Saputro in the final, 21–10, 21–17 to win the gold medal.\n2022: Resignation from the Chinese national badminton team.\nZhang announced his resignation from the Chinese national team in late August on his Weibo account, stating that he would continue to play badminton as an independent player with the permission of the Chinese Badminton Association.\n2023.\nZhang made his return to the international badminton circuit as an independent player by participating in the men's and mixed doubles events in the 2023 Ruichang China Masters.\nAchievements.\nOlympic Games.\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nBWF World Championships.\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nAsian Games.\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nAsian Championships.\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nEast Asian Games.\n\"Men's doubles\"\nBWF World Junior Championships.\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nAsian Junior Championships.\n\"Boys' doubles\"\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nBWF World Tour (2 titles, 1 runner-up).\nThe BWF World Tour, which was announced on 19 March 2017 and implemented in 2018, is a series of elite badminton tournaments sanctioned by the Badminton World Federation (BWF).

        "text": "Rugby Borough Women Football Club is an English women's football club based in Rugby, Warwickshire. Currently they play in the FA Women's National League South, the third tier of women's domestic football in England.\nOriginally founded in 2013 as Coventry City Ladies, the club merged with non-League football club Coventry United F.C. to form Coventry United Ladies Football Club in 2015. Prior to the 2022–23 season, the club was renamed Coventry United Women Football Club. In June 2023, following the club's relegation from the Women's Championship, the second tier of women's domestic football in England, Coventry United F.C.'s association with the women's team was terminated and the club relocated from Coventry to Rugby and was given its present name, affiliating with Rugby Borough F.C.\nIn addition to the first team squad, the club operates a reserve team as well as youth teams at a variety of levels including under-11, under-13, under-15, under-16 and under-18.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1991, the club began in the West Midlands Regional League. In 1997, as Coventry City, they were promoted into the FA Women's Premier League Northern Division, where they stayed until relegation in 2002.\nIn 2002–03 the club developed closer relations with Coventry City F.C. while revamping and expanding the youth centre of excellence. In 2004 the club were promoted back to the FA Women's Premier League Northern Division, but lasted only a season at the higher level.\nAfter three consecutive runners-up finishes, Coventry won the Midland Combination again in 2010 – scoring 66 goals in 22 league games.\nThe club played at Coventry University Sports and Conference Centre, Westwood Heath and at Coventry Sphinx FC, before moving to the Oval, Bedworth. In August 2014 the club announced a move to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry for the 2014–15 season. Midway through the 2014–15 season, Coventry Ladies were forced out of the Ricoh Arena after the arrival of Wasps RFC to the Ricoh. They found themselves playing at the Bedworth Oval once again.\nIn July 2015 they merged with Coventry United and moved into the Butts Park Arena, home of Coventry R.F.C. where Coventry United play. April 2019 saw the side win the National League South, the third tier in the women's game, seeing them gain promotion to the FA Women's Championship. There followed two hard-fought seasons in 2019/20 and 2020/21 where the club established themselves in the FA Women's Championship with a 9th and 10th-place finish respectively.\nIn 2021 Steve Quinlan, Paul Marsh and Darren Langdon bought a 49% stake in the club. The club announced plans to turn professional and are beginning their first season as a fully professional club in 2021/22. The club announced plans to liquidate on 23 December 2021 however the club never entered into liquidation. The club's last fixture before the announcement on 23 December 2021 was a 1–0 home victory over fellow FA Women's Championship side, Watford. With a formal deadline set for 4 January 2022, investors Angels Group, headed up by CEO Lewis Taylor, made a bid to acquire the club and clear the debts to ensure the club could complete the season. The offer was accepted and the club was rescued although the FA handed down a 10 points deduction for triggering an insolvency event although the club did not officially enter liquidation. Coventry United Women appealed the decision on various grounds, however the appeal was unsuccessful. With few games to play in the Women's Championship, the points deduction was the equivalent of a 21 points deduction in the Men's Champions due to the available points difference.\nIn February 2022 Jay Bradford managed her 150th game as manager of Coventry United.\nUnited managed to stay up in the FA Women's Championship, despite the 10 point deduction, thanks to a famous Mollie Green free kick in the 97th minute to beat and relegate Watford.\nAt the end of the 2021/22 season, Head Coach Jo Potter, left her role followed by Manager, Jay Bradford. On 1 July, Assistant Manager, Kate Rowson also left her post. During the closed season, Coventry United Women FC announced plans to run a hybrid model, supporting both part time and full time players in a bid to stabilise the club's finances and focus on off-field structure. With the Ukraine war ongoing, this affected the club owners ability to invest larger sums. Coupled with increasing costs within the club, it was decided to run a hybrid model for 12 months whist rebuilding and becoming a sustainable club. Plans are to return to a full time professional model by the 2023/24 season.\nThe club updated its name from Coventry United Ladies to Coventry United Women, ahead of the 2022/23 season.\nIn July 2022, the club announced a triple appointment in Jack Heaselden, General Manager, Lee Burch, Head Coach and Sian Osmond, Assistant Manager. These key appointments helped to lay the foundations behind the club's 'project rebirth', designed to professionalise the club from within.\nCurrent technical staff.\nFormer players.\n\"For details of former players, see .\""

Kyrgyzstan played seven games, winning both games against the Armenian SSR and losing five to the Ukrainian SSR, the Estonian SSR, the Latvian SSR, the Georgian SSR and the Lithuanian SSR respectively. \nIn 2011 Kyrgyzstan returned to international play, when they competed in the Premier Division of the 2011 Asian Winter Games. In the first game of the tournament, Kyrgyzstan recorded their first ever win, defeating Thailand 15–4. Kyrgyzstan went on to win the Premier Division after winning all six of their games and finishing on top of the table. \nKyrgyzstan made its debut in the World Championships in 2019, playing in the Division III qualification tournament held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. They finished first after winning all five games. However, all their first four games were later voided and the results were counted as 5–0 forfeits due to Kyrgyzstan's player Aleksandr Titov being disqualified. Later IIHF acknowledged they had made a mistake, but the results would still stand.

Hosted by De La Salle University, the Ateneo Blue Eagles defeated the De La Salle Green Archers in the finals defending their first UAAP men's basketball championship: it was the first UAAP finals series for the Ateneo–La Salle rivalry that originated in the NCAA (Philippines).\nElimination round.\nAteneo abandoned its game against the University of the Philippines (UP) with the Fighting Maroons leading 83–69 1:21 left in the game when a melee broke out involving Ateneo's Joseph Canlas and UP's Joseph Marata. The referees ejected Canlas after he tripped Marata, then the two players traded punches that led to a bench-clearing situation. An unidentified spectator fired a gun, who was escorted out of the Rizal Memorial Coliseum by UP baseball coach and police officer Boy Codiñera.\nWith the system currently in place, Ateneo would've forfeited the game and received no points (a loss under ordinary circumstances merited one point, two points for a win); however, Ateneo coach Fritz Gaston appealed the decision to the UAAP Board which was granted, ruling the game as an ordinary loss for Ateneo and giving them one point.\nFinals.\nAteneo clinched the twice-to-beat advantage in the elimination round finale which served as a \"de facto\" Game 1 of a best-of-3 series with a win against La Salle.\nLa Salle, led by Dindo Pumaren, had a ten-point advantage midway through the first half, 21–11. However, Ateneo caught up with them and kept the score close until the final deadlock at 66–all when Ateneo started an 8–2 run. Joseph Canlas scored four of Ateneo's eight points in the run, which ended with a Gilbert Reyes conversion off a steal from Joey Santa Maria. Pumaren closed the gap to four points at 74–70, with two free throws off Joseph Kenneth Nieto, but the Blue Eagles prevented further scoring opportunities for La Salle; Santa Maria fouled Daniel Francisco, who converted his two free-throws to give Ateneo the win, and a successful defense of their championship. Their back-to-back title run was their first successful title defense since the 1975 and 1976 NCAA seasons."

The school's team currently competes in the Big East after moving from the Atlantic 10 following the 2012–2013 season. The Bulldogs had competed in the Horizon since joining Division I competition in the 1986–1987 season. The women’s basketball team began competing in the IAIAW in 1975–1976 under coach Xandra Hamilton and had their first winning season two years later, obtaining a 9–5 record under coach Linda Mason. The Bulldogs are currently coached by Austin Parkinson.\nHistory.\nThe women's basketball program at Butler University began in the 1975–76 season, competing in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). The Bulldogs' first winning season came two years later, earning a 9–5 record under the direction of coach Linda Mason. The Bulldogs played in the AIAW National Tournament for the first time in 1982, falling in the second round to William Penn, 77–94. The next season, 1982–83, the Bulldogs began competition at the NCAA Division II level, where they competed for four seasons until they joined the Horizon League and Division I competition for the 1986–87 season.\nThe Bulldogs qualified for Division I post-season play for the first time in 1993, competing in the WNIT under coach Paulette Stein, who revitalized the program following five losing records in six seasons in the late 1980s. Butler competed in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament for the first time in 1996 under coach June Olkowski, Butler's only coach to never record a losing season. Their last post-season appearance in the 1990s was in the WNIT in 1998.\nThe Bulldogs began a new era during the 2002–03 season, in which Beth Couture was hired as the Bulldogs' seventh head coach, a position she still holds. Couture is Butler's longest-serving head women's basketball coach. From her first season at Butler through the 2012–2013 season, she compiled a 178–158 record including four total and three consecutive WNIT appearances, and four consecutive 20-win seasons. Under Couture, Butler recorded a 23–10 mark in 2010, the most wins in team history, and recorded its first WNIT win in 2009 with a 59–58 victory over Duquesne on a layup with 2.2 seconds remaining in the game.\nThe 2013–14 season will see the Bulldogs' third conference in as many years as Coach Couture guides the team in transitioning to the Big East from its only season in the Atlantic Ten. During that season, the Bulldogs posted an 8–6 conference record (17–14 overall), giving the team winning records in two conferences during Couture's tenure.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in one NCAA tournament.

Bayless became the third player in Iowa history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season and the fourth Hawkeye to lead the team in rushing and receiving in the same year. He was second in the Big Ten in rushing and led Iowa to a victory over San Diego State in the 1986 Holiday Bowl. Bayless was named all-Big Ten and honorable mention All-American in 1986. He was also named Iowa’s one and only team MVP in 1986; it is the last occasion in which the annual award was not shared by multiple players. \nAs a senior in 1988, Rick Bayless lost his starting position before the first game after an injury in practice. He never regained his starting spot in his final season, playing in only seven of Iowa’s 13 games. He left school as the tenth-leading rusher in school history. Bayless then played one game for the Minnesota Vikings in 1989 before retiring from football."

        "text": "The 2011 World Series of Poker was the 42nd annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). The WSOP is the most prestigious poker tournament in the world with the winner of the Main Event considered to be the World Champion. It was held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada between May 31 – July 19, 2011. There were 59 bracelet events, beginning with the WSOP National Circuit Championship and culminating in the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Championship (also known as the \"Main Event\"). The November Nine concept returned for a fourth consecutive year, with the Main Event finalists returning on November 6, playing down to three that evening and then adjourning until November 8.\nCoverage.\nThe 2011 WSOP marked the first time that every event at the WSOP was covered nearly live. Due to the nature of the competition, live coverage was not allowed by the Nevada Gaming Commission. WSOP.com streamed 55 gold bracelet events on a five-minute delay via the internet. ESPN3 streamed the $25K Heads Up, $50K Poker Players Championship and the Main Event online.\nESPN also doubled the airtime given to the WSOP from prior years. For the first time ever, television coverage of the WSOP Main Event was \"live\" with a 30-minute delay. The \"live\" coverage of the WSOP Main Event ran for six consecutive days from July 14-19 and offered 32 additional hours of coverage, with Lon McEachern and David Tuchman handling the play-by-play commentary.\nPoker PROductions, led by Mori Eskandani, produced the coverage of the 2011 WSOP, with the goal to enact changes that would put poker coverage on par with the coverage delivered for live sports. It was the first year for Poker PROductions producing the WSOP.\nThe final table of the WSOP Main Event was televised in its entirety on ESPN. As per Nevada Gaming Commission stipulations, play was broadcast with a 15-minute delay and the hole cards were not shown to the television audience until after the hand was over.\nWSOP Circuit National Championship.\nSince 1970, the WSOP was held exclusively in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2004, Harrah's Entertainment purchased the rights to the WSOP and almost immediately started to expand the name brand. After the purchase, Harrah's introduced Circuit Events around the country. These events were intended to build up hype for the WSOP. In 2011, they introduced WSOP Circuit National Championship.\nThe WSOP Circuit National Championship was an exclusive tournament, limited to 100 players who qualified through the circuit events. The winner of the championship was awarded a WSOP bracelet. The event, which took place from May 27 through May 29, was won by amateur player Sam Barnhart.\nPlayer statistics.\nThrough the first 57 events, the 2011 WSOP:\nThe Main Event:\nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Championship began on July 7 with the first of four starting days. After reaching the final table of nine players on July 19, the remainder of the tournament was delayed until November 6.\nThe Main Event drew 6,865 players, creating a prize pool of $64,531,000.

        "title": "Purdue Boilermakers baseball",
        "text": "The Purdue Boilermakers baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, United States. The program's first season was in 1888, and it has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference since the start of the 1906 season. Its home venue is Alexander Field, located on Purdue's campus. Greg Goff is the team's head coach starting in the 2020 season. The program has appeared in 3 NCAA tournaments. It has won one conference tournament championship and 2 regular season conference titles. As of the start of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, 24 former Boilermakers have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe program's first season of play was 1888, and the team played without a head coach until 1892, when W. M. Phillips became the head coach. Also in 1892, the program began playing at newly dedicated home venue Stuart Field. The first game at Stuart was against Butler on April 16, 1892. Purdue won the game 14–9.\nAfter Phillips' two-year tenure as head coach (1892–1893), the program played without a head coach until 1900, when W. H. Fox assumed the position for two seasons (1900–1901). The program then had several different head coaches until Hugh Nicol began a nine-year tenure in 1906. Nicol's first season was also the program's first as a member of the Big Nine Conference (renamed the Big Ten Conference following the 1917 season, when Michigan rejoined the conference after a 12-season hiatus). In 1909, Purdue won its first Big Ten Championship. Future Major League Baseball player Walt Tragesser played on the 1909 team.\nNicol left the head coaching position following the 1914 season, and B. P. Pattison (previously the head coach at West Virginia) coached the team for the next two seasons (1915–1916).\nIn 1916, Pattison's final season, Purdue had an 8–4 record in Big Ten games. However, Purdue had generally struggled in Big Ten games since joining the conference and continued to do so. The Boilermakers had a winning conference record only 11 times from 1917 to 1978. In that span, the team opened two new home venues. On April 6, 1940, the team defeated Wabash College 7–4 in its first game at Ross–Ade Field, later renamed Lambert Field. On April 14, 1965, the Boilermakers lost 4–2 to Notre Dame in the team's first game at the modern Lambert Field. Both Old Lambert Field and the modern Lambert Field were named for Ward Lambert, head coach of the program for 19 seasons (1917, 1919–1935, 1945–1946).\nDave Alexander era.\nIn 1978, Dave Alexander became the program's head coach. When the Big Ten split into two, five-team divisions in 1981, the team finished 2nd behind Michigan, Purdue's best conference finish since 1928. As a result of the second-place finish, the team qualified for the inaugural Big Ten Tournament, which was also the program's first postseason appearance. The team finished the tournament with a 1–2 record. Purdue qualified for two more conference tournaments in the 1980s (1986, 1987) and reached its first NCAA tournament in 1987. Playing in the Mideast Regional, Purdue went 0–2, losing 13–3 to Texas A&amp;M and 8–7 to Western Carolina.\nSteve Green era.\nAlexander stepped down from the head coaching position following the 1991 season as the program's all-time wins leader with 407. He was replaced by Steve Green. During Green's tenure, the team qualified for three Big Ten Tournaments (1993, 1995, 1997). However, after a 2–9 start to the 1998 season, Green struck a player in an altercation following a loss to Evansville. He resigned following the altercation. Interim coach Bob Shepherd was the head coach for the rest of the 1998 season, and the team had a 21–20 record during Shepherd's tenure to finish 23–29 overall.\nDoug Schreiber era.\nPrior to the 1999 season, Purdue hired Doug Schreiber as its permanent head coach. In the 2000s decade, Schreiber's teams appeared in seven Big Ten Tournaments and finished second in the conference three times (2001, 2005, 2008).\nIn 2012, Purdue had its most successful season. On April 15, Schreiber won his 407th and 408th games in a doubleheader sweep of Illinois, passing Dave Alexander as the program's winningest head coach. The team, after winning both the regular season conference championship and the Big Ten tournament, was given a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament and hosted a regional. Due to Lambert Field's not meeting NCAA standards and construction delays on the program's new home venue, Alexander Field, Purdue hosted the regional at U.S. Steel Yard in Gary, Indiana. After winning its opening round game against Valparaiso, Purdue lost consecutive games to Kent State and Kentucky and was eliminated from the tournament. Purdue finished the season with a 45 wins, a school record. Following the 2016 season, Schreiber resigned as the head baseball coach at Purdue.\nMark Wasikowski era.\nOn June 24, 2016, Purdue hired Oregon Ducks baseball assistant coach, Mark Wasikowski to be the team's head coach. Purdue's 19 win improvement from 2016 to 2017 was the largest improvement in NCAA Division I baseball during the 2017 season. After leading Purdue to an 87–82 record over three seasons, Wasikowski left Purdue to become the head coach at Oregon.\nGreg Goff era.\nIn 2019, Purdue hired Greg Goff to be their latest head coach. Goff led the team to a 23–32 record through his first two seasons as head coach.\nTo begin their 2022 season, the Boilermakers produced the best start to a season since 1909, with series sweeps over Princeton and South Dakota State en route to an 8–0 start.\nVenues.\nSince the program began play in 1888, it has had four venues, each on the university's campus.\nStuart Field.\nFrom 1892 to 1939, the team played at Stuart Field on the university's campus. Currently, the Elliott Hall of Music stands on the former site of Stuart Field.\nOld Lambert Field.\nThe Boilermakers played at Old Lambert Field from 1940 to 1964. At the beginning of its use, Old Lambert Field was known as Ross–Ade Field (named for David E. Ross and George Ade, also the benefactors of Ross–Ade Stadium, the school's football venue). Old Lambert Field was located next to Lambert Fieldhouse.\nLambert Field.\nThe program played at Lambert Field from prior to the 1965 season until the end of the 2012 season. Named for former Purdue baseball and men's basketball coach Ward Lambert, the venue had a capacity of 1,100 spectators. It was torn down in summer 2012. The field was located next to the current location of Purdue's Student Fitness and Wellness Center.\nAlexander Field.\nIn 2013, the program began playing at Alexander Field. The venue was scheduled for completion prior to the 2012 season, but construction delays caused the completion date to be pushed back. The venue has a capacity of 1,500 spectators.\nHead coaches.\nThe program's most successful coach was head coach Doug Schreiber, who had 485 victories at the school. Schreiber passed Dave Alexander on the Purdue wins list on April 15, 2012, when Purdue swept a doubleheader against Illinois.\nPurdue's longest tenured head coach is Ward Lambert, who coached the team for a total of 19 seasons in three separate coaching stints.\nYearly record.\n†NCAA canceled all postseason activities for all college sports due to the COVID-19 virus.\nNotable former players.\nBelow is a list of notable former Boilermakers and the seasons in which they played for Purdue.\n2012 MLB Draft.\nIn the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, a program-record seven Purdue players were selected: C Kevin Plawecki by the New York Mets (1st round), 3B Cameron Perkins by the Philadelphia Phillies (6th round), P Nick Wittgren by the Miami Marlins (9th round), P Lance Breedlove by the Pittsburgh Pirates (23rd round), 2B Eric Charles by the San Diego Padres (29th round), OF Barrett Serrato by the Texas Rangers (30th round), and P Brad Schreiber by the Minnesota Twins (40th round). P Blake Mascarello signed with the Phillies as an undrafted free agent. Mascarello, along with six of the seven draftees (all but Schreiber) signed professional contracts."

The team moved to NCAA Division I women's ice hockey as a member of College Hockey America after many years at Division III as part of the ECAC West conference. The Bruce B. Bates Women's Hockey Coach is former RIT player and captain Celeste Brown.\nHistory.\nRIT added women's varsity hockey for the 1975–1976 season. After many years in the ECAC East, RIT moved to the ECAC West league for the 2007–08 season. The team made three NCAA tournament appearances at the Division III level, in 2007, 2011, and 2012, with a record of 5–2 in tournament games. They lost their lone game in the 2007 campaign to Amherst College. In their 2011 campaign, the lady Tigers lost at home, in the Frozen Four final, to Norwich University.\nIn 2012, the Tigers won their first national championship, on home ice, against Norwich University. It was the third-ever national championship for RIT's athletic program and first in women's sports.\nOn March 20, 2012, RIT announced that the women's team would move up to Division I for the 2012–13 season, as the men's team did six years prior. The Tigers joined the College Hockey America conference.\nAfter a successful first season at the division I level going 16–16–5, even after losing their first DI game 6–2 to the Mercyhurst Lakers, the Tigers advanced to the CHA semifinals where they fell to the Syracuse Orange 2–1 in overtime. The next season was yet another season to remember. The Tigers participated in the Frozen Frontier. A 10-day hockey festival at Rochester's Frontier Field. The Tigers fell to Clarkson University 6–2. The Tigers went on to win 11 out of their last 18 to win the CHA championship 2–1 in double overtime against the team that defeated them in their first ever division I game, the Mercyhurst Lakers.\nIn 2014–15, their first season at the 4,300-seat Gene Polisseni Center, the Tigers went 15–19–5 and finished in last place in the CHA. But they won every game in the 2015 CHA Tournament, beating Robert Morris, Mercyhurst, and then Syracuse, 2–1 in double overtime, to capture their second straight CHA championship. The trophy this year came with the CHA's first-ever automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, where the Tigers fell 2–6 to the eventual champions, #2 Minnesota.\nIn 2015, Bruce Bates, an MIT trustee emeritus and women's ice hockey season ticket holder, donated RIT's first athletic endowment to the women's ice hockey team, to support the head coach position.\nOn July 10, 2018, it was announced that long-time head coach Scott McDonald would be stepping down as head coach of the women's hockey team. He left as the all-time victory leader for the women's team, compiling a 205-154-29 record in 12 seasons. Chad Davis was announced as his replacement on August 22, 2018 with former Buffalo Beauts player Hannah McGowan being hired as assistant coach. On April 30, 2020, it was reported that RIT parted ways with Davis and McGowan as coaches. Davis compiled a 24-37-9 record in two seasons as head coach.\nOn July 17, 2020, former RIT women's hockey player and captain Celeste Brown was named the next head coach of the program.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nPlayer histories.\nSarah Dagg was recognized as the 2011 ECAC West Player of the Year after contributing to the Tigers program-record 26 wins. In addition, she helped the Tigers to their first conference regular season and post-season championships. Her points total for the season was 18 goals and 24 assists in 30 games.\nIn her senior season, Dagg advanced to the 2011 NCAA Division III Championship game. In her four seasons at RIT, the Tigers accumulated a won-loss record of 85–17–7, while finishing as the Tigers all-time leading scorer. Her career totals stand at 63 goals and 91 assists, while competing in 109 games. She is the Tigers all-time assists leader while recording three consecutive forty point seasons. In addition, she is second all-time at RIT with 20 power-play goals, while she stands tied at first place in shorthanded goals with nine."

        "title": "Maine–New Hampshire men's ice hockey rivalry",
        "text": "The Maine–New Hampshire men's ice hockey rivalry, sometimes referred to as the Border War, is a men's ice hockey rivalry between the Maine Black Bears and New Hampshire Wildcats. The proximity of the two states, the success of the two programs, and their history in high-profile games have caused one of the most intense rivalries in American college hockey. \"College Hockey News\" has ranked it as the seventh best Division I college hockey rivalry.\nHistory.\nThe two teams first played in 1979. In the early 1990s, Maine dominated, winning 18 out of 19 games in one stretch. The rivalry came to a head in 1999. UNH and Maine played a two-game series to finish the regular season at the Whittemore Center. UNH had to win the series to clinch the top seed in the Hockey East playoffs, and swept the two-game series. The two teams met again a month later in the 1999 national championship. Although Maine took an early lead in the game, UNH came from behind to force overtime. Maine then won in overtime. Afterwards the UNH fans rioted; overturning cars, performing basic vandalism on anything in sight, even launching an unmanned snowmobile engulfed in flames across the campus.\nAs of 2024, the series is tied at 20 wins and 20 losses. Three years after Maine's victory in the national title game UNH won its first Hockey East title with a victory over Maine. Maine gained revenge for this loss several weeks later, however, by defeating UNH in the 2002 Frozen Four. The series became very evenly matched for some time, before UNH became more dominant in the late 2000s and won 6 games in a row over two seasons. In 2012 Maine and UNH played in a Winter Classic type game and Maine won 5–4 in overtime at Fenway Park, after giving up the first 2 goals. Maine's ice hockey program has been more successful overall than UNH, having won two national titles and five Hockey East titles while UNH has won two Hockey East titles and has not won a national championship.\nTraditions.\nOne factor that contributes to the intensity of the rivalry is the similarity of the two states. Fans of each program often work together and frequent the same restaurants in places such as Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Kittery, Maine. Though the two schools are apart, many Maine fans from southern Maine live closer to UNH's campus in Durham, New Hampshire than to the University of Maine's campus in Orono, Maine, ensuring a high turnout of Maine fans when UNH hosts Maine. The two programs also recruit many of the same potential players from New England, though there are often very few New Hampshire natives on UNH's team and few Maine natives on Maine's team.\nIn 1999 UNH began asking their fans to dress in white each time Maine traveled to the Whittemore Center in what they dubbed \"White out the Whit\" nights. The student tickets for these games sell out faster than any others. Maine supporters often refer to UNH as the \"University of No Hardware\" due to their lack of championships. During one series in Maine, Maine fans pelted visiting UNH fans with snowballs. UNH fans often raise the issue of NCAA violations committed by Maine under Shawn Walsh. They have also brought newspapers to the games to read while Maine's starting lineup is being introduced. The two schools have announced plans to move two of their games each year to the last week of the regular season.\nIn addition to ice hockey, UNH and Maine are considered rivals in basketball and football as well.\nGame results.\n† Hockey East Tournament\nReferences.\nhttp://bangordailynews.com/2012/01/07/sports/maine-unh-battle-at-frozen-fenway/"

        "text": "Gary Kristopher Wilkinson (born October 2, 1982) is an American retired professional basketball player. He played college basketball at Utah State and has played previously for professional teams in Greece, South Korea, New Zealand, Estonia and Puerto Rico.\nEarly life.\nWilkinson was born in Salt Lake City and grew up in South Jordan, Utah. At Bingham High School, Wilkinson was cut from the basketball team and dropped out his senior year; he told \"ESPN The Magazine\": \"I really didn't have any goals. I didn't have any ambition to play college basketball, didn't have any ambition to go to the Utah State university at all. I just sat around and partied with my friends.\" One of Wilkinson's friends committed suicide eight months after Wilkinson quit school; a friend of that friend recommended the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for Wilkinson. Eventually, Wilkinson earned his GED, went on a two-year mission in Alberta, Canada, and enrolled in Salt Lake Community College. Recalling his missionary work in Canada, Wilkinson said in an interview with the \"New Zealand Herald\": \"Sometimes it was so cold I actually couldn't speak because my jaw was frozen. We had to write with pencils as the ink in the pens would freeze.\" Wilkinson now shares his life story with youth groups and schools.\nCollege career.\nSalt Lake Community College.\nFor two seasons (2005–2007), Wilkinson played for the Salt Lake Community College basketball team. He averaged 18.5 points and 8.1 rebounds per game and shot 60.2 percent from the field and 74.2 percent from the free throw line. Coach Norm Parrish was skeptical at first after Wilkinson called him for a tryout but was impressed enough to invite Wilkinson to the team.

        "text": "Anthony Griffin (born 26 August 1966) is an Australian professional rugby league coach who was most recently the head coach of the St George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL.\nAfter success in the Queensland Cup and Toyota Cup competitions, Griffin replaced Ivan Henjak as head coach of the Brisbane Broncos from 2011 to 2014 and later served as head coach for the Penrith Panthers from 2016 to 2018 and the St. George Illawarra Dragons from 2021 to 2023.\nEarly life.\nGriffin was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, and attended Emmaus College in Rockhampton.\nPlaying career.\nGriffin played for Past Brothers from 1985 to 1987 in the lower grades, largely as a . He then played for Brothers in Rockhampton from 1988 to 1992.\nCoaching career.\nGriffin coached the colts teams for Redcliffe (1995–97), winning the premiership in 1997. The following year he moved to Brisbane Norths, taking them to the colts premiership in his first year there, and also coaching the Queensland under 17s representative team in 1998. After another colts premiership with Norths in 2000, Griffin joined the coaching staff of the NRL's Melbourne Storm and was Chris Anderson's then Mark Murray's assistant in 2001 and 2002. Returning to Queensland, he coached the Souths Logan Magpies in the Queensland Cup from 2003 to 2004. He then joined the Redcliffe Dolphins, coaching them from 2005 to 2007 and winning the competition with them in 2006. He also coached the Queensland Residents side in 2007.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nGriffin coached the Brisbane Broncos' under-20s side to the 2008 Toyota Cup (Under-20s) season's Grand Final. He was appointed as assistant to head coach Ivan Henjak for the 2010 NRL season, in which the Broncos failed to make the finals series for the first time since 1991.\nLess than three weeks from the beginning of the 2011 NRL season, Griffin became the third ever coach of the Broncos when he was unexpectedly announced to be replacing Henjak. After losing their first match, the Broncos went on to win seven matches in a row, to be sitting equal top of the ladder with the St. George Illawarra Dragons at the conclusion of Round 8. Griffin employed a policy of resting key players such as Darren Lockyer and Sam Thaiday after mid-season representative matches and Brisbane's ladder position slipped. However they returned to the top four after the 2011 State of Origin series. The Broncos finished the regular season in third place, their best finish to the regular season since their last premiership in 2006. Griffin then took them to within one match of the grand final. However without injured captain Darren Lockyer, Brisbane were knocked out of contention by eventual premiers, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nDuring the 2014 NRL season, it was announced that Griffin would not be head coach of the Broncos the following season due to the return of the club's foundation coach, Wayne Bennett.\nPenrith Panthers.\nOn 21 October 2015, it was announced that Griffin had accepted the head coaching position with the Penrith Panthers on a three-year deal. On 4 October 2017, Griffin signed a new two-year extension to stay as Penrith coach until the end of 2020 after guiding the club to consecutive finals appearances. On 6 August 2018, Griffin and the Penrith Panthers club decided to part ways with immediate effect, leaving assistant coach Cameron Ciraldo as caretaker coach.\nIn the aftermath of being sacked by Penrith, Griffin and Gould proceeded to trade barbs in the media. Gould went on record as saying \"We just got the feeling that everything Anthony has brought to the club over the last three years, we’ve probably seen the best of it … I think the pressure from the media and constant speculation was eating away at him … Anthony is very old school, he likes to do everything himself. I think in the modern day age the head coach has got to rely on the expertise, knowledge and assistance\".\nGriffin later came out and said \"He hasn’t coached for 20 years. He hasn’t had his head in the fire for 20 years. If there’s anyone old school in the conversation – if I’m in the conversation about being old school, he’d need to be there as well\". Griffin then later spoke of Gould claiming that he was sad after a win and happy after a loss. Griffin told the media \"We were officially on top of the ladder, having overcome this huge run of injuries earlier in the year, but nothing. When we lost there was always an inquiry, how had we had failed in our preparation, but there was never any inquiry when we won\". \"I have never seen him so happy than when Brisbane put 50 on us. And then I’ve never seen him so agitated than when we just beat Manly (in a 28-24 thriller at Brookvale Oval on July 28, 2018)\".\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons.\nOn 7 September 2020, Griffin was appointed head coach of St. George Illawarra. He was granted a two-year contract to begin in 2021, with a third year in the club's favour, following the sacking of Paul McGregor earlier in the 2020 NRL season.\nIn round 2 of the 2021 NRL season, he earned his first win as St. George head coach as the club defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 25–18 at North Queensland Stadium.\nIn Griffin's first season as head coach, he guided St. George Illawarra to an 11th-place finish on the table. From round 13 to round 25, the club only managed to win two matches and suffered an eight-game losing streak to close out the year, which stands as a current club record for the most consecutive losses.\nBefore the start of the 2023 NRL season, many experts and pundits predicted St. George Illawarra to finish with the Wooden Spoon. After having a bye in the first round, the club defeated the Gold Coast in round 2 by a score of 32–18. In March 2023, it was revealed that Griffin had been told by club officials that they were looking for a potential coaching replacement in 2024 and that Griffin would have to re-apply for his position.\nOn 16 May 2023, it was announced that St. George Illawarra had terminated Griffin's contract effective immediately. Griffin was informed of the decision at 8AM just before the players' training session with Ryan Carr taking over as interim head-coach.\nRadio career.\nIn 2019, Griffin joined the 2GB Continuous Call Team program as one of the co-commentators for selected matches."

        "text": "The 2007 Cricket World Cup, which took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007, featured 16 teams, who were divided into four groups. Group A was made up of full ICC members Australia and South Africa, and associate members Netherlands and Scotland. Australia and South Africa each qualified for the Super Eights by winning their first two matches, which meant their final game against each other would decide who finished top of the group; Australia won by 83 runs to claim top spot. Meanwhile, Scotland and the Netherlands played off in their final match to determine which team finished bottom; the Netherlands won by 8 wickets and finished third.\nTable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAustralia vs Scotland.\nAustralia were put in to bat and made the seventh-highest total in World Cup history, It was nevertheless the third-lowest total in Scotland's ODI history and the third time a team had won by more than 200 runs in World Cup cricket. Ricky Ponting became the leading Australian run-scorer in World Cups, second overall only to Sachin Tendulkar. In reply, Colin Smith made his first ODI half-century on World Cup debut, and only ten men batted for Scotland; John Blain, one of two players in the eleven with previous World Cup experience, suffered an injury and was absent.\nNetherlands vs South Africa.\nIn a match shortened to 40 overs due to wet pitch conditions, South Africa still managed the third 200-run victory at this World Cup, scoring runs at a rate faster than that recorded by Sri Lanka when they set the world record number of runs in a One-day International in July 2006 against this Dutch team. Though Dutch wicket-keeper Jeroen Smits caught Abraham de Villiers for nought in the first over, and South Africa had made four runs in the first five overs, things went South Africa's way from then on. Herschelle Gibbs hit Daan van Bunge for six sixes in the 30th over, a first in ODI cricket, Mark Boucher scored a fifty off 21 deliveries, a World Cup record and two balls off his own South African record, and added another 25 from ten balls before time was up. South Africa also became the first team to make three century partnerships in a One-day International, and hit a World Cup record of eighteen sixes. \nFor the Netherlands, Tim de Leede, Daan van Bunge and Luuk van Troost conceded 163 runs in their 12 overs between them, and when batting, the Dutch team's only professional Ryan ten Doeschate was their only man to pass 25, making 57 before he was run out as one of three Dutch batsmen to suffer this fate. Shaun Pollock's six overs cost four runs, the most economical spell of the World Cup thus far.\nAustralia vs Netherlands.\nThe fourth 200-run win in ten games of the Cup thus far, with Australia becoming the first team to win consecutive One-day Internationals by 200 runs or more. Glenn McGrath became the second bowler in World Cup history to take 50 wickets at the tournament.\nAustralia chose to bat first, losing three wickets by the 20-over mark, with Tim de Leede having both openers caught, but Michael Clarke and Brad Hodge set a World Cup record fourth-wicket partnership with 204, and Australia eventually ended on 358 for five. Hodge's last 28 balls yielded 73 runs. Netherlands' openers Bas Zuiderent and Darron Reekers made 36 at nearly a run-a-ball in the first six overs, but Nathan Bracken had Reekers caught for 25, and four more wickets followed for ten runs. After van Bunge and de Leede had put on 40 for the sixth wicket, Glenn McGrath and Brad Hogg ended the innings.\nScotland vs South Africa.\n68% of South Africa's total was made up of boundaries, as Graeme Smith and A. B. de Villiers thumped runs and South Africa qualified for the Super Eights, and the result also confirmed Australia's place. South Africa bowled first, and after Fraser Watts and Majid Haq made it through the first ten overs, South Africa took a wicket every five overs to reduce Scotland to 84 for five after 30 overs. Andrew Hall and Charl Langeveldt took the wickets, but also got hit for runs by Dougie Brown, John Blain and Paul Hoffmann as Scotland posted their highest-ever World Cup total of 186.\nNevertheless, South Africa made their way to the total in half the required time, as Graeme Smith and A. B. de Villiers hit at a rate of more than eight an over. Scotland turned to their spin bowlers in the thirteenth over, with Majid Haq and Glenn Rogers taking three wickets, though they still cost nearly eight an over between them. Justin Kemp hit the winning runs with a six off Rogers.\nAustralia vs South Africa.\nMatthew Hayden broke the record for fastest World Cup century, taking 66 balls to notch up the hundred, and when he got out two balls later the run rate was still more than seven an over. A 161-run partnership between Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke followed, with Ponting ending on 91 and Clarke on 92, and though Andrew Hall took wickets near the end, Australia finished on 377 for six.\nSouth Africa batted through the first twenty overs without loss, as Abraham de Villiers and Graeme Smith took the opening bowlers on. De Villiers got out eight short of what would have been his first One-day International century, and a few overs later Smith retired hurt; he returned after Brad Hogg and Glenn McGrath had taken two wickets each and South Africa needed 118 in 55 balls. However, he got out four balls later, and the remainder of the batting order got out in single figures."

        "title": "2007 Cricket World Cup Group B",
        "text": "The 2007 Cricket World Cup, which took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007, featured 16 teams, who were divided into four groups. Group B was made up of full ICC members Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and associate member Bermuda. Sri Lanka won all three of their matches to finish top of the group and secure qualification for the Super Eights stage of the tournament. Bangladesh's victory over India in their opening match meant they finished as runners-up and joined Sri Lanka in the Super Eights, while India and Bermuda were knocked out. Sri Lanka went on to finish second in the Super Eights and then beat New Zealand in their semi-final before losing to Australia in the final.\nTable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBermuda vs Sri Lanka.\nBermuda's World Cup debut became the second-heaviest defeat at the World Cup, 40 runs worse than Scotland's defeat the day before. After Sri Lanka won the toss and batted, they \"capitalise[d] on the spate of loose deliveries\" served up by Bermuda's bowlers, according to Cricinfo writer Siddhartha Vaidyanathan, Bermuda did take six wickets, all caught, while Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva all collected half-centuries. Kevin Hurdle took two wickets for Bermuda, but his second over lasted 14 balls due to no-balls and wides. Bermuda fell to 20 for four after Malinga had taken three wickets in three overs, ending with bowling figures of three for 10. With the seven first men down, Lionel Cann paired up with Delyone Borden for a 25-run partnership, the largest of the innings; Farveez Maharoof removed both before Muttiah Muralitharan had Dwayne Leverock lbw to end the innings for 78, Bermuda's lowest total ever in One Day Internationals.\nBangladesh vs India.\nBangladesh, who went home from the 2003 World Cup without a single win and had been ranked bottom the 10 Test-playing nations as late as 2006, now celebrated their fifth victory against a top-eight side in their history, forcing India to win both their next games to have a chance of qualifying for the Super Eights.\nIndia chose to bat first, but lost Virender Sehwag and Robin Uthappa to Mashrafe Mortaza in his opening spell. Described by the Cricinfo journalist as \"at the heart of the impressive performance\", Mortaza took two wickets in the opening spell and returned to remove the two final wickets, though he also bowled six no-balls in a spell of four for 38. Spinners Abdur Razzak and Mohammad Rafique took the remaining six wickets.\nTeenagers Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim, with 35 international games between them, all made half-centuries as Bangladesh passed the target of 192 with nine balls and five wickets to spare, despite losing three batsmen in single figures and two batsmen stumped off the bowling of part-timer Virender Sehwag. Tamim hit seven fours and two sixes in a near run-a-ball 51, well about the required run rate of four, which meant Shakib and Mushfiqur could score at rates between three and four an over. India also dropped two easy chances and three half-chances, \"in stark contrast to Bangladesh's efforts on the field\", as they failed to bowl out their opposition. \nThe win caused mass celebrations in Bangladesh. Though the country is officially in a state of emergency and public gatherings are outlawed, thousands of people celebrated in the streets of Dhaka, waving flags and chanting, and there were also processions in Chittagong and in Mortaza's hometown, Narail.\nBermuda v India.\nAfter the upset in the first group match against Bangladesh, India came back strongly against Bermuda, breaking several records in the process. Their total of 413 for five was the first World Cup innings worth more than 400, and their margin of 257 runs the largest margin of victory in an ODI. It was also the highest score in World Cup history, breaking the 400 barrier. India also broke their team record score of 376/2, and equalled the ODI record for the maximum number of sixes in an innings by scoring 18 sixes, a feat first achieved by South Africa against the Netherlands earlier in the tournament.\nIn reply, Bermuda's only professional, Glamorgan player David Hemp, hit nine fours and one six in an unbeaten innings of 76, 50 runs more than any other batsman could contribute. Zaheer Khan bowled both openers, while Ajit Agarkar had three wickets in six balls, causing Bermuda to crash from 106 for five to 110 for eight. Hemp then put on 44 with Dwayne Leverock before Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble ended the resistance. Extras were the second-highest score of Bermuda's innings, with 27, as four bowlers conceded a total of 12 wides.\nBangladesh vs Sri Lanka.\nBangladesh's chances of reaching the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India in the 2003 TVS Cup Tri Series. Indeed, it was only due to the rain during Bangladesh's innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Sanath Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his 24th One Day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak were the only ones to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh's top-scoring batsman, Ashraful, who made 45 not out from number seven.\nIndia vs Sri Lanka.\nFour years after losing the 2003 World Cup final, India were all but eliminated from the World Cup, now relying on Bermuda to beat Bangladesh in order to qualify for the Super Eights, causing \"financial disasters\" for the Indian TV channels who had bought broadcasting rights at large prices. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, went through to the second stage unbeaten, after newcomers to the team Upul Tharanga and Chamara Silva both struck half-centuries and Muttiah Muralitharan took three wickets, including wicket-keeper MS Dhoni for a duck.\nThe first innings was described as a \"cat-and-mouse battle\" by Cricinfo reporter Siddhartha Vaidyanathan. Zaheer Khan started off with a wide, but also had Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind in his opening spell, striking at the end of the seventh over, and also had Tharanga in trouble with in-cutters. Tharanga, however, batted through nearly two thirds of the match for his 64, and none of the bowlers managed to keep the run rate below four as Sri Lanka made it to 254 for six, despite India's bowlers putting in a performance described as \"impressive\" (Cricinfo), \"giv[ing] the Sri Lankans a huge scare\" (Indian Express). Russel Arnold and Chaminda Vaas hit 38 off the final 23 balls, with five fours and a six.\nFor Sri Lanka, Chaminda Vaas struck twice within eleven overs, taking a return catch off Robin Uthappa and having Sourav Ganguly caught for a 23-ball seven. Sachin Tendulkar followed in the next over, bowled by Dilhara Fernando for his second duck of the tournament, but Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid made it through the next ten overs, before the \"turning point\" arrived, again according to Cricinfo. Muttiah Muralitharan had Sehwag caught at first slip in his third over; the next six overs yielded only 14 runs and two more wickets, after Dhoni went lbw to Muralitharan, and India needed 141 runs off 22 overs. Despite double-digit scores from Ajit Agarkar, Harbhajan Singh and Munaf Patel, they were bowled out for 185.\nBangladesh vs Bermuda.\nBangladesh advanced to the Super Eights after defeating Bermuda in this heavily rain-affected match, thus sending India home after the group stages. Bermuda opened the batting after rain had reduced the game to 41 overs per side. Four more interruptions followed, as the game was eventually cut to 21 overs a side with Bermuda at 45 for four.\nSet 96 to win after hitting from Dean Minors and Lionel Cann and a slight Duckworth–Lewis adjustment, Bangladesh fell to 37 for three after three wickets from Saleem Mukuddem, but Shakib Al Hasan went unbeaten for his second match running against Bermuda, making 26 not out and a partnership of 59 for the fourth wicket with Mohammad Ashraful. Extras made up almost a quarter of the total, with Kevin Hurdle conceding seven wides in his four overs."

The games were played on 20 November and 4 December 1985 in Glasgow and Melbourne respectively. Australia were hoping to play in the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1974 and Scotland were hoping for a fourth successive FIFA World Cup.\nBackground.\nScotland had qualified for the play-off by finishing second in their UEFA group, behind Spain. Scotland secured second place in dramatic circumstances with a 1–1 draw against Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff. Davie Cooper scored a late equalising goal with a penalty kick to give Scotland the point they needed, but manager Jock Stein collapsed and died of a heart attack. This meant that assistant manager Alex Ferguson took charge of the team for the play-off.\nAustralia finished top of a single four-team group that comprised New Zealand, as well as Israel and Chinese Taipei, both of whom were at the time members of FIFA but were outside their own regional confederations.\nPlay-off match.\nIn the first leg of the play-off in Hampden Park on 20 November 1985, Scotland took the lead in the 53rd minute from a twenty-yard free kick scored by Davie Cooper, hitting the ball around the wall and into the bottom right hand corner of the net. The second goal arrived in the 59th minute from Frank McAvennie who was making his senior debut for Scotland. He lobbed the ball over the goalkeeper after being set up by a header from Kenny Dalglish. The second leg on 4 December finished goalless which was enough for Scotland to advance to the 1986 FIFA World Cup finals in Mexico.\nAftermath.\nScotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup Finals in Mexico and were drawn into Group E with West Germany, Uruguay and debutants Denmark. Scotland lost 1–0 to Denmark and 2–1 to West Germany. Scotland had to beat Uruguay and Uruguay played with ten men and drew 0–0. Scotland finished bottom in the group on one point."

        "title": "Daytona 500 history",
        "text": "This article documents historical records, statistics, and race recaps of the Daytona 500, held annually at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.\nPre-race history.\nThe table below summarizes the pace cars, Grand Marshals, Honorary Starters, and performers of the national anthem at the Daytona 500. Since 2006, the pace car has been driven by a celebrity guest at the start of the race (mirroring the tradition used the Indy 500). During the race, however, a NASCAR official drives the pace car during caution periods. Since 2004, Brett Bodine has served as the official pace car driver. Previously, Robert \"Buster\" Auton and Elmo Langley were pace car drivers. Since 2010, the United States Air Force Thunderbirds perform two flyovers after the national anthem and after the starting command.\nRace recaps.\n1959–1969.\nLee Petty, patriarch of the racing family, won the 1959 Daytona 500 on February 22, 1959, defeating Johnny Beauchamp in a highly unusual manner. Petty and Beauchamp were lapping Joe Weatherly at the finish. Petty, Beauchamp, and Weatherly crossed the finish line three abreast with Weatherly on the outside, Beauchamp on the inside, and Petty in the middle. A photo finish in a race of that duration and speed seemed inconceivable and photo-finish cameras were not installed at the track. NASCAR initially declared Beauchamp the winner. After reviewing photographs and newsreels of the finish for three days, the call was reversed, and Petty was awarded the win. Petty received $19,050 for winning. Ken Marriott was scored as the last place driver having completed one lap and won $100.\nIn 1960, Robert \"Junior\" Johnson won, despite running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, most in Daytona 500 history through the present day. Johnson made use of the draft, then a little-understood phenomenon, to keep up with the leaders.\nAfter three years of being the best driver never to win the Daytona 500, Glenn \"Fireball\" Roberts came to the 1962 edition race of the Daytona 500 on a hot roll, he won the American Challenge for winners of 1961 NASCAR events, the pole position for the Daytona 500, and the Twin-100-mile qualifier. He dominated the race, leading 144 of the 200 laps and finally won his first (and ultimately only) Daytona 500.\nIn 1963, it was DeWayne \"Tiny\" Lund who took the victory for the Wood Brothers, however the real drama began a couple weeks before the race when Lund helped pull 1961 winner Marvin Panch from a burning sportscar at a considerable risk to himself. As a result of his heroism, the Wood Brothers asked Lund to replace Panch in the Daytona 500 and Lund took the car to the winner's circle.\nDriving a potent Plymouth with the new Hemi engine, Richard Petty led 184 of the 200 laps to win the 1964 Daytona 500 going away. Plymouths ran 1-2-3 at the finish. The triumph was Petty's first on a super-speedway.\nThe first rain-shortened Daytona 500 was the 1965 event. Leader Marvin Panch and Fred Lorenzen made contact on Lap 129, as rain began to fall; Panch spun out, and Lorenzen won when the race was finally called on Lap 133. The 1966 Daytona 500, won by Richard Petty, was also shortened, to 198 laps, due to rain.\n1967 saw Mario Andretti dominate the race. He led 112 of the 200 laps including the last 33 laps to capture his only win in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.\nThe 1968 race saw a duel involving Cale Yarborough and LeeRoy Yarbrough. For much of the day, both drivers traded the lead. With 5 laps to go, Cale made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from LeeRoy and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds. LeeRoy Yarbrough would inflict the same treatment on Charlie Glotzbach the next year, winning the 1969 Daytona 500 on the last lap.\n1970–1979.\nThe 1970s opened with Cale Yarborough qualifying at pole with a run. Fate played a major role in the 1970 race, claiming one driver after another as soon as the green flag fell. Richard Petty, then Yarborough who dropped out after leading 26 of the first 31 laps, Donnie Allison, and A. J. Foyt also dropped out of the race. Later in the race, Pete Hamilton, an unknown driver prior to this race, was contested the lead with the likes of Charlie Glotzbach and David Pearson. On lap 192, Hamilton passed Pearson for the lead, and although Pearson tried valiantly to regain the lead, it was Hamilton who took the checkered flag in front of the largest crowd to ever have seen the Daytona 500 (an estimated 103,800). It was the first of 4 victories Hamilton would have in his brief NASCAR career.\nThe 1972 race was called a One-Sided Daytona 500. A. J. Foyt cruised lanyard into the lead with about 300 miles to go and captured the victory. It was Foyt's sixth career Winston Cup Grand National victory, and it gave the famed Wood Brothers of Stuart, VA, their third Daytona 500 triumph. They had previously won with Tiny Lund in 1963 and Cale Yarborough in 1968. In the event punctuated by a weak field because of factory withdrawal, Foyt outlasted four rivals and beat runner-up Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps. Jim Vandiver was six laps down and finished third; Benny Parsons was fourth and James Hylton fifth. Only three caution flags for 17 laps interrupted Foyt's pace. He averaged 161.550 mph—an all-time record for the Daytona 500.\nDuring the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the 1973 oil crisis. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500, won by Richard Petty (his second straight, making him the first driver ever to do it), was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race \"started\" on Lap 21. The Twin 125 qualifying races were also shortened to 45 laps (112.5 miles). Richard Petty overcame tough luck of his own and capitalized on the misfortunes of Donnie Allison to win his fifth Daytona 500. The 47-second triumph was petty's 155th in Winston Cup Grand National competition. A record 53 laps were run under the caution flag, which reduced Petty's average winning speed to 140.894 mph.\nIn 1975, it appeared David Pearson was on his way to his first Daytona 500 victory as he built a sizable lead on second place Benny Parsons late in the race. However, Richard Petty, who was several laps behind the leaders, and Parsons hooked up in a draft and began reeling in Pearson who was slowed by lapped traffic. The key moment of the race occurred two laps from the end when contact with a backmarker sent Pearson spinning on the backstretch. Parsons avoided the accident and went on to take the win.\nIn the 1976 500, Richard Petty was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner, but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.\nFor Bobby Allison, the Daytona 500 prior to the 1978 race was not kind to him, in fact he came to the race with a 67-race winless streak but with 11 laps remaining, he pushed his Bud Moore Ford around Buddy Baker to take the lead and never look back as he captured his first Daytona 500 win.\nThe 1979 Daytona 500 was the first race to be broadcast live on national television, airing on CBS, whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The Indianapolis 500 was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison (along with Donnie's brother Bobby Allison) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of \"The New York Times\" Sports section. NASCAR, as a national sport, had finally arrived after years of moonshine runners."

        "title": "William Forsyth (rugby union)",
        "text": "William Forsyth was a rugby union international who represented Scotland in the first international rugby match in 1871.\nEarly life and family.\nWilliam Forsyth was born on 23 March 1850 in Logie Easter, Ross-shire. He was the son of Ann (née Bell) (died 1857) and John Forsyth (died 1898). His father, at the time of his birth, was a farmer on the Balnagowan estate, the seat of Sir Charles Ross and site of Balnagowan castle. Later, in the 1860s, his father became factor of the entire estate, some 300,000 acres, of which about 8000 acres were arable, 400 acres under wood, and 288,000 acres under pasture. In 1857, when Forsyth was seven years old, his mother died. His aunt then helped care for him and his siblings until his father remarried. Around 1869, Forsyth began attending the University of Edinburgh and is noted in 1869 University calendar (as William Forsyth of Ross-shire) for earning a certificate of merit. He was later cited in University calendars as William Forsyth of Balnagowan.\nRugby union career.\nWhile at the University Forsyth was a noted athlete and rugby footballer. He was on the Edinburgh union's rugby committee in 1871 and in 1871 was selected to represent Scotland in the first international match against England. The match was played on 27 March 1871 at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh and was won by Scotland. He was one of two representatives from the University of Edinburgh. After this match he continued to play for the University.and in the oldest known picture of any university sporting club, he is pictured alongside his teammates for the 1872/3 season. In that team were also Cathcart and Stewart.\nIn the first intercity match between Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1872, Forsyth is notably absent from the Edinburgh line-up. In the side however was a J. Forsyth, representing Wanderers. Given W. Forsyth was still playing for Edinburgh in that season, and that J. Forsyth was a Wanderers player, it is unlikely they are the same man. But there is evidence to suggest that Forsyth may have on occasion been given the initial \"J\". Certain sources for the 1871 International quote Forsyth's initial as being J rather than W. The argument that it was W Forsyth being the 1871 international is bolstered by the fact that he is the same man pictured in both the 1871 Scotland side and in the 1872 Edinburgh University side, and all records of the university show him as W or William Forsyth. In Francis Marshall's 1892 publication, \"Football; the Rugby union game\", he is once again referred to as W Forsyth in a picture of the 1871 Scotland side although on another occasion he is referred to as R Forsyth.\nIn addition to rugby, Forsyth was also a noted athlete whilst at University. In 1871 he is recorded as having won the mile walk in eight minutes at the Edinburgh University Club meet, on 23 June."

He pitched for the Chicago White Sox (1990–96) and Florida Marlins (1997, 1999–2000) in his 11-year Major League Baseball career. He was a member of the Florida Marlins when they won their first-ever World Series championship. After pitching the entire regular season for the Marlins, Fernandez was on the 1997 postseason roster for the NLDS and NLCS. However, due to a shoulder injury, he was unavailable during the World Series. Fernandez retired in 2001, citing shoulder problems that were incurred in the 1997 postseason.\nOn April 10 of that 1997 season, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Fernandez had a no-hitter broken up with one out in the ninth on a Dave Hansen single (the ball going under Fernandez' glove and under his right leg), the only hit Fernandez would allow in defeating the Cubs 1-0. The no-hitter would have been the first pitched against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965.\nFernandez was born in Miami Beach, Florida in 1969. He attended Monsignor Edward Pace High School in Miami Gardens, FL. In 1990, Fernandez won the Dick Howser Trophy for National College Baseball player of the year while pitching at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC). He previously played at the University of Miami before transferring to MDCC to be eligible to enter the Baseball Major League Draft.\nGoing on a different path after retiring from baseball, Fernandez is involved in radio and becoming active in politics in his hometown of Miami Beach, where he campaigned for and helped elect its mayor. He is the former director of baseball operations at Archbishop McCarthy High School in Southwest Ranches, Florida.\nFernandez was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on September 13, 2008. The induction took place during a pregame ceremony before a Florida Marlins vs Washington Nationals game at Dolphin Stadium in Miami, Florida."

        "title": "Counties Manukau Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Counties Manukau Rugby Football Union (CMRFU) is the governing body of rugby union in Southern Auckland and the Franklin district of New Zealand. Nicknamed the \"Steelers\", their colours are red, white, and black horizontal bands. The Steelers moniker is a reference to the Glenbrook steel factory, which is in the area. The union is based in Pukekohe, and plays at Navigation Homes Stadium.\nHistory.\nThe union was preceded by the \"South Auckland\" sub-union of the Auckland Rugby Football Union, the sub-union being founded in 1926. This became a full union, with the name \"South Auckland Counties\", in 1955. The name was shortened to \"Counties\" just a year later. The name Counties Manukau was adopted in 1995.\nThe history of Counties has been very much about adventurous football and taking risks, and this was certainly the case initially as the team strove to establish an identity and tradition. Counties' first game was against Auckland in Waiuku in 1955, which they lost 95–3, led by Barry Baxter. In that inaugural year the team defeated a Wellington XV twice, the first 19 – 6 on Bledisloe Park, Pukekohe, where the union's first All Black, Pat Walsh scored twice. Barry Bracewell, coach from 1961–63 and 1967–75, adopted a style in conflict with the ethos of the day of forward dominance and percentage safety from the backs. Bracewell, and Tauroa after him, selected mobile forwards and loose forwards with exciting backs with attacking game plans.\nThe Counties team of this era had many highlights. The first was winning the NPC championship in 1979, with wins over Waikato, Wellington, North Auckland, Thames Valley, Bay of Plenty, Poverty Bay, South Canterbury, Manawatu, Taranaki, Otago, Canterbury, and Southland, also beating Victoria and Argentina that year. Winning the Inter-Dominion Championship (forerunner to the Super 10) against Queensland in Brisbane was another achievement, while the 1982 team beat Australia 15 – 9, which included greats such as David Campese.\nIn 1982, playing Canterbury not only for the Ranfurly Shield but also the NPC championship, with Counties ahead 15 – 12 with only minutes remaining, Robert Kururangi intercepted a Canterbury pass and was about to score when the referee dubiously judged him offside, awarding Canterbury the penalty which Robbie Deans successfully kicked to win the championship and retain the shield. The previous season the shield challenge against Waikato also ended in a draw (21 all) after Counties conceded two late and controversial penalties. The third Ranfurly Shield agony came three years later in 1985 against Auckland, when Counties, down 3 – 12, were denied what appeared to be a perfectly legitimate try to Dave Trombik after the referee received some subtle persuasion by Auckland skipper Andy Haden. Later in the game Warren McClean scored a try for Counties, making the final score 9–12, with Counties on the losing side.\nCounties finally improved during the mid-1990s. A forward packing containing Errol Brain, Jim Coe, Glen Marsh, and Junior Paramore, with backs including Tony Marsh, George Leaupepe, Blair Feeney, Jonah Lomu, Joeli Vidiri and Dean Sheppard, proved one of the best Counties side ever, making the NPC finals twice, in 1996 and 1997, losing to Auckland and Canterbury respectively. A highlight of that period came in 1997 during the semi-final in Hamilton. Behind at one stage 9–33, and stung by a ground announcement advertising tickets for a home Waikato final next week, Counties fought back with a 43–40 win. After a steady decline since then, Counties lost a promotion-relegation match in 2001, and dropped to the second division, where Counties could not retain their best players and lost the likes of Stephen Donald, Sitiveni Sivivatu, Casey Laulala, and Kieran Read to other unions.\nIn 2006 Counties was selected to rejoin the top sides in the new Air New Zealand Cup Premier Division, and they still retain their exciting attacking style of rugby. Success has been limited, a win over Auckland in 2008 being a highlight. Former All Black captain Tana Umaga joined Counties as player/coach in 2010 and was appointed head coach in December 2011. In 2013, after 24 previous unsuccessful Ranfurly Shield challenges – including two draws – the Umaga-coached Counties-Manukau team gave Steelers fans something to celebrate when captain Fritz Lee lifted the Ranfurly Shield for the first time in the province's history following a dramatic 27–24 win over Hawkes Bay.\nClubs.\nThe Counties Manukau union does not include all clubs in the area of the former Manukau City. Clubs such as Manukau Rovers RFC and the Papatoetoe RFC are members of the Auckland Rugby Union.\nThe clubs in the Counties Manukau union are:\nT.P.

From 1995 till 1999, captain Errol Brain led another successful era. The \"player drain\" of stars such as Lomu (Wellington), Vidiri (Auckland), Lee (Otago), and Marsh (France), signalled a downturn in the fortunes of Counties.\nFrom 2013 to 2019 Counties Manukau played in the top division of New Zealand's national championship. Counties Manukau were more than competitive winning the Ranfurly Shield for the first time in 2013 (defending it 6 times), and making the semi-finals on two occasions. Again the bulk of the team and coaching staff moved on, and so ended the good fortunes of the team.\nCounties Manukau in Super Rugby.\nWhen Super Rugby began, Counties Manukau was associated with the Blues; but since 1999 it has been aligned to the Chiefs.\nWomen's Rugby.\nCounties Manukau has a women's team that is part of Women's Provincial Championship.\nCounties were crowned champions for the first time in 2016 taking down the eight time defending champs Auckland 41-22. \nCounties made it to the final of the 2017 competition after finishing top of the table for the second year running. They were defeated 13-7 in the final by Canterbury."

He received his education at the Aspatria Agricultural College, where he excelled at sport, winning representative honours at both association football and rugby union. For over fifteen years Davidson was a prominent member of Aspatria RUFC, playing as a forward in the old scrimmaging style. He played for Aspatria when they won the Cumberland County Rugby Union Cup in 1891, ’92, ’96 and ’99. He won forty-four Cumberland County caps; made a record number of eight appearances for the North in their annual games against the South; played several times for the Rest of England in their annual game against the County Champions, and although selected to represent England on seven occasions, would, through ill-health and injury, play in only five. In 1897, he played for England in the game against Scotland; in 1898, against Scotland and Wales; and in 1899 against Scotland and Ireland. In the Calcutta Cup match in 1898, he was, according to one journalist, the ‘man of the match’. \"When the whistle blew no man came off the field on either side fresher or more ready to renew hostilities than James Davidson.\" \nUpon retirement from the game Jim became a respected official. He was chairman of the County Selectors Committee, and the Cumberland representative to the Rugby Union. He was also one of the principal administrators in the Aspatria Club and held numerous offices. He was a stonemason and builder by trade, a man with a giant frame, noted for his great strength, sporting attitude and determination. Described in the sporting journal, Sporting Life, as ‘Hard as Nails’. In 1898 he became the first recipient of a sporting testimonial in Cumberland. He died at Aspatria on 23 December 1943."

        "text": "The Namibia men's national cricket team, nicknamed the Eagles, is the men's team that represents the Republic of Namibia in international cricket. It is organised by Cricket Namibia, which became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1992.\nA team representing South West Africa played in South African domestic competitions prior to Namibia's independence in 1990. After joining the ICC, the country soon became one of the leading ICC associate members in Africa. Namibia finished second at the 2001 ICC Trophy, thereby qualifying for the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa. The team made its One Day International (ODI) debut at the tournament but failed to win a match. Beginning in 2004, Namibia participated in every edition of the ICC Intercontinental Cup, finishing runners-up in 2007–08. It also featured at the highest levels of the World Cricket League (WCL), twice participating in the WCL Championship, and finished third at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nNamibia were runners-up at the 2019 WCL Division Two tournament to secure the ODI status and qualify for the 2019–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2. The team finished fourth at the 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier to qualify for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. It subsequently recorded its first World Cup victories, defeating the Netherlands and Ireland in the first round of the tournament to progress to the Super 12 stage.\nHistory.\nThe earliest instance of cricket being played in Windhoek dates back to 1909 when South West Africa was very much a German colony. During the First World War (1914), South African troops opened assault in the region. A game of cricket was recorded in the Okonjande prisoner of war camp near Otjiwarongo. South Africa captured South West Africa following Germany's defeat. It came under the League of Nations mandate in the Union of South Africa.\nFollowing this, cricket was regularly played in the Western Province. The South West Africa Cricket Union was formed in 1930 and the first organised matches were played in the region. South West Africa began playing in the South African Country Cricket Association's annual competition in the 1961–62 season.\nSouth West Africa (1961–1989).\nSouth West Africa competed in the South African Country Cricket Association's annual competition between 1961 and 1989. In 1966, the Namibian war of Independence was launched by the People's Liberation Army of Namibia, an armed wing of SWAPO. South West African rebels welcomed the sporting boycott of the South African apartheid regime and lent their support to the \"Stop the seventy tour\" campaign.\nSouth West Africa played their last domestic season in South Africa in January 1989. In April, PLAN launched its final guerrilla campaign and the South West Africa Cricket Union severed their ties with the South African Cricket Board (SACB).\nIn November 1989, a Namibian team toured Botswana and played their first international fixture, although the Namibian Cricket Board were not affiliated to the International Cricket Council until 1992.\nInitial years.\nAfter the Botswana tour, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club visited Namibia in March 1990, taking part in the Independence Day celebrations. This was followed by a visit from The Netherlands in April. Before the formation of the African Cricket Association, the SCSA Zone VI cricket federation was formed after two schoolboy cricket tours between Namibia and Botswana in 1989 and 1990. The inaugural ACA tournament was held in Windhoek in September 1991, with Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, Lesotho and Botswana playing as well as an Oxford University Cricket Club side.\n2003 World Cup.\nThe road to the 2003 Cricket World Cup started with the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada. Namibia reached the final at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club, losing to the Netherlands, but still qualifying for their first World Cup. Namibia then hosted the ICC 6 Nations Challenge in April 2002, finishing fourth and had a disappointing Africa Cup campaign that September, finishing fourth in their group and beating only Tanzania, before losing four matches against Zimbabwe A a few weeks later. A tour of Kenya was more successful, as Namibia beat Kenya in a four match one-day series. Following this, Namibia took part in the top level of South African domestic one-day cricket, the Standard Bank Cup, but lost all five of their games. Bangladesh toured in January 2003, winning the five match one-day series 4–1.\nThe World Cup itself started on 10 February 2003 in Harare with Zimbabwe beating Namibia by 86 runs in Namibia's debut One Day International (ODI).\nThey went on to lose to Pakistan by 171 runs, before a 55 run defeat at the hands of England in which Namibia performed with some credit, Jan-Berrie Burger winning the man of the match award for his innings of 85 runs that came close to helping the side pull off an unlikely upset. They then lost by 181 runs to India and by 256 runs against Australia, the eventual winners of the tournament, in what at the time was the biggest winning margin in One Day Internationals. The tournament finished with a 64 run loss to fellow qualifiers the Netherlands.\nAfter the World Cup.\nIn August 2003, Zimbabwe A toured Namibia. Namibia won the one-day series 2–1, but lost both three-day games. A return visit to Zimbabwe the following January saw Namibia win a five match one-day series against Zimbabwe A 4–1, also winning a match against Zimbabwe Under-19s. Bangladesh toured Namibia in February, winning all three one-day games and drawing the three-day game. Following this, Namibia travelled to the United Arab Emirates for the 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge. They finished third on run rate after beating Canada, the Netherlands and the UAE and losing to Scotland and the USA. Namibia played two ICC Intercontinental Cup matches against Kenya and Uganda in 2004, losing them both. In between the two matches, they won an African nations tournament in Zambia. Later in the year, they took part in Zimbabwe's national one-day domestic competition, in which they finished as runners-up. Whilst in Zimbabwe, they won two matches against the national side. This was followed by a visit to Namibia by England, who won both matches.\nZimbabwe A again visited Namibia in early 2005, losing both one-day matches that finished. Pakistan A were the next visitors in April, winning all three one-day matches and drawing in the three-day game. This was followed by their two regional group games in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Whilst they were unbeaten, winning against Uganda and drawing against Kenya, this was not enough to qualify for the semi-finals. They then visited Ireland to take part in the 2005 ICC Trophy. They finished 7th after beating Denmark in their final play-off game. Back at home, they hosted New Zealand at the end of July, losing both games, losing by only 29 runs after conceding 330/6. In October of that year, they hosted the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Cup, despite failing to qualify. While the final was being played, they played a two match one-day series against Bermuda after they had been knocked out of the tournament, winning both games, but the games were tarnished by controversial incidents, with the Bermuda team accusing the Namibian team of racist insults, and walking off in the second game when a flurry of bouncers were unleashed at the lower order Bermuda batsmen. The Namibian Cricket Board denied the allegations of racism.\nIn March 2006, Namibia met Nepal in a challenge match to decide who got the eighth and final spot in the 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup. The match was drawn, with Namibia getting a first innings lead, thus qualifying them for the main tournament. The main tournament itself started with an innings defeat by Scotland in Aberdeen before a five wicket defeat by Ireland in Dublin, both matches in May. In the 2006–07 South African cricket season, Namibia took part in the second tier of first-class and List A cricket, the South African Airways Challenge. They finished second in their group in the three-day tournament and third in their group in the one-day tournament, missing out on reaching the semi-finals by one win. In the midst of the matches in those tournaments, they played their third and final 2006 Intercontinental Cup match, beating the UAE by an innings. On 1 April 2007, they became part of the ICC's High Performance Program.\nIn November/December 2007, Namibia hosted Division Two of the World Cricket League where they played against Argentina, Denmark, Oman, the UAE and Uganda. Although Namibia won three of their five group matches, it was not enough for them to progress to the final. Namibia beat Denmark in the third place playoff. On the basis of their top four finish in this tournament, Namibia qualified for the ICC World Cup Qualifier in 2009, the final tournament in qualification for the 2011 World Cup.\nNamibia again took part in the second tier of South African domestic cricket between October 2007 and February 2008. They played a 2007–08 ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in October 2007, playing the remaining games against Bermuda, Ireland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Scotland and the UAE in 2008.\nNamibia won the 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Shield defeating the United Arab Emirates by six wickets in Dubai.\nIn 2011 Namibia participated in Division Two and finished as runners-up, on this occasion behind the UAE.\nIn July 2011, the country competed in the ICC Twenty20 World Cricket League Africa Division One competition in Uganda, winning all eight group matches before succumbing to the hosts in the Final by six wickets. During this tournament, all-rounder Louis van der Westhuizen struck 16 sixes in an innings of 159* against Kenya, as part of a team total of 262/1 from 20 overs.\nThe Golden Generation.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Namibia and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nNamibia's first T20I match was against Ghana on 20 May 2019 in the Regional Final of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Africa Qualifier tournament. They won the match comfortably.\nIn July 2020, the Namibia Men's team won the ICC Associate Member Men's Performance of the Year award, after gaining One Day International (ODI) status, in the ICC's Annual Development Awards to recognise developing cricketing nations.\nNamibia qualified for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates when they finished 4th in the 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in October and November 2019. They lost their first match against Sri Lanka but recorded a historic first-ever win at a World Cup event when they beat The Netherlands by 6 wickets in Abu Dhabi on 20 October 2021. On 22 October 2021 in the next match against Ireland, Namibia made history by winning the match by 8 wickets and qualified for the Super 12 stage of the tournament. On 27 October 2021, in the first Super 12 match for Namibia, they registered another historic win, defeating Scotland by 4 wickets.\nIn the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup, Namibia defeated Asia Cup champions and world number 8 side Sri Lanka in a stunning upset to open the tournament.\nNamibia are participating in the inaugural 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off, a part of the qualification process for 2023 Cricket World Cup, as the hosts. They got their maiden win in the tournament against Papua New Guinea, as they won the match by 48 runs.

        "text": "James Madison \"Red\" Roberts (August 23, 1900 – June 27, 1945) was an American football player and coach. He played football for the Centre Praying Colonels in Danville, Kentucky. Roberts was thrice selected All-Southern, and a unanimous choice for the \"Associated Press\" Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. After college Roberts, played in the early National Football League (NFL) for the Toledo Maroons and the Akron Pros. He also played in the first American Football League for the Cleveland Panthers. Roberts served as the head football coach at Waynesburg College—now known as Waynesburg University—in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, for one season, in 1923. He later made a run for the office of Governor of Kentucky as a Democrat in 1931, losing in the primary to Ruby Laffoon who went on to win the election.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts entered Centre in 1918, and was the most prominent Kentucky native on the 9–0 1919 team and the 1921 team which upset Harvard. Roberts once saved Roscoe Brumfield, the Centre College mascot, after someone pushed him into the lake and he could not swim and went down the second time.\nRoberts played fullback and end for the Centre Colonels football team along with such teammates as Norris Armstrong, Bo McMillin, Red Weaver, Sully Montgomery, and Matty Bell. Roberts was chosen as end on Centre's all-time football team chosen in 1935. He was 6'2\" and 235 pounds.\nTexans McMillin and Weaver happened to meet up with Roberts at Somerset High, and came to Centre due to boosters, meeting up with a slew of former Texas hands in coach Robert L. Myers and players Matty Bell, Sully Montgomery, Bill James, and Bob Mathias. The team posted a 7–1 record in 1917, ostensibly so good that Myers needed a better coach and hired Charley Moran.\n1921.\nMcMillin scored the one 32-yard touchdown of the Harvard game, but the interference was furnished by Roberts. After a scoreless half and early in the third quarter, Roberts told McMillin \"it's time to score, ride my hump\", and McMillin rushed for the lone touchdown of the game.\" He also scored the first touchdown in the 35 to 14 loss to Harvard the previous year. Roberts was selected by Walter Camp as a first team All-American at the end of the regular season and became the fifth first-team player designated by Camp, joining teammates \"Bo\" McMillin and Red Weaver, who were picked in prior years. Roberts received Camp's honorable mention in 1922.\nRoberts gave his blood to save his sister.\nCoaching career.\nRoberts was the head football coach at Waynesburg College—now known as Waynesburg University—in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, for the 1923 season. His coaching record at Waynesburg was 3–4–1.\nDeath.\nRoberts died on June 27, 1945, from burns suffered when a fire broke out on the third floor of the Cumberland Hotel in Middlesboro, Kentucky, where he was the manager. Mrs. Anny Teapa Roberts, a native of Vienna, Austria, whom he married the previous April, also badly burned, said she had fallen asleep in the bedroom while her husband was talking with a guest in the living room of their suite. Roberts apparently fell asleep on the living room couch after his guest had left, she said, and neither she nor Roberts awakened until fire flashed out in the living room. Roberts' wife said the flash seemed to come from an electrical fixture in the room. She said she ran into the room to bring Roberts out but he was badly burned by the time she reached him."

        "title": "Street skateboarding",
        "text": "Street skateboarding is a skateboarding discipline which focuses on flat-ground tricks, grinds, slides and aerials within urban environments, and public spaces. Street skateboarders meet, skate, and hang out in and around urban areas referred to as \"spots,\" which are commonly streets, plazas or industrial areas. To add variety and complexity to street skateboarding, obstacles such as handrails, stairs, walls, flower beds, bins, park benches, picnic tables, and other street furniture may be traversed as single tricks or as part of a series of consecutive tricks called a \"line.\"\nHistory.\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, street skateboarding evolved as a new approach to skateboarding, using elements taken from the other existing skateboarding disciplines. Instead of drained swimming pools and purpose-built skateparks, skateboarders began to use urban areas and public spaces. For example, in the 1980s, Philadelphia's LOVE Park transformed from a place where businesspeople would eat their lunch into a well-known skateboarding spot. A new style of skateboard deck (which had a kicktail at each end) became popular. Professional skateboarding became hyper-commercialized and skate shops specializing in the retail of professional grade skateboarding equipment appeared in many cities across the world. Skate shops, in turn, helped support a culture of street skateboarding by offering skateboarders a refuge where they could check out and buy copies of the latest skate videos (VHS video tapes and then later DVDs), magazines, or other skateboard products.\nMany street skaters abandoned skate parks entirely in favor of public, urban areas. Street skaters began to observe architecture and look for skate-able obstacles.\nAccording to Ben Kelly of \"Transworld Skateboarding Magazine\", the ten best cities in the World to skateboard are: Barcelona, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Paris, Melbourne, London, Shenzhen, Berlin and Tel Aviv.\nTricks.\nExamples of tricks.\nIn street skateboarding, tricks can be attempted in a variety of stances (normal, fakie, switch, or nollie) and while travelling either frontside or backside. Almost all of the tricks in street skateboarding require some amount of pop from either of the kicktails on the board to elevate the skateboard into the air. Skateboarding has unique terminology which is used by skaters to describe ride styles and trick names.\nWith practice, tricks such as many grinds and slides can be optionally combined with other aerial type tricks such as the kickflip to create variations. This creates some interesting combinations and often increases the difficulty level. The ways in which a particular skater combines various tricks, in part, forms their unique style.\nTricks can be judged in various ways. Common signs of skill include how cleanly the trick was completed, the height of the obstacle involved, how fast the rider was travelling, the length of travel while grinding or sliding, and the technical complexities involved in landing the trick. In street skateboarding, style is an important signifier of skill and individuality. For instance, professional skateboarder Tom Penny is renowned not just for his skill and ability on a skateboard but also for his smooth and relaxed style.\nThe most basic tricks in street skateboarding are grounded in the ollie. Learning to ollie and then moving onto other fundamentals such as the 180, pop shuv-it, and the kickflip creates a foundation necessary for learning slides, grinds, and variations. Discussing techniques, studying video footage, and watching other skaters are important ways for skateboarders to learn tricks.\nMany advanced skateboarding tricks are extremely hard to pull off consistently, and in some instances, the skater risks serious injury in the event of a mistake. Many tricks can take years of careful practice to master.\nEquipment.\nStreet skateboards are built using component parts sold by skateboard retailers. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, skaters increasingly began to design, manufacture, and sell their own boards and parts. This resulted in diminished market share for venture capitalists, who dominated the industry in the 1980s. The industry has since come full circle, with many grassroots companies founded in the 1990s now being sold to venture capitalist groups and enterprises. However, there are still a number of skateboarder-owned companies manufacturing skateboard products today.\nSkate shoes.\nAppropriate footwear is an important part of street skateboarding equipment. Modern professional-grade skate shoes evolved, in part, due to the need for increased durability to resist constant abrasion. Other innovations followed, such as designs meant to reduce the risk of heel bruises, increase \"board feel,\" and further improve durability. These innovations have improved not only skate shoes but also modern footwear in general.\nExamples of skate shoes.\nProminent professional skateboarders design and endorse professional skateboard shoes, often with their name or logo.\nSome of the most prolific pro skateboard shoe designers include Eric Koston, Daewon Song, Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Marc Johnson, Geoff Rowley, and Anthony Van Engelen. Each of them has several iconic \"pro model\" designs mass-produced and sold as part of endorsement contracts with various professional skate shoe manufacturers.\nWax.\nStreet skateboarders often travel with a block of wax, which is rubbed onto masonry to prepare it before a trick is attempted. The wax helps reduce the friction between the surfaces of the two materials when tricks which involve grinding or sliding are attempted.\nComplete skateboards.\nImperial measurement has become standardized for decks, trucks, nuts, and bolts, but wheel diameter is measured in millimeters.\nSkateboard parts can be individually repaired or replaced should they require maintenance. Skateboards can be serviced using a standard Imperial socket set, an Allen key set, and a small Imperial spanner set. Some skate shops stock an all-in-one tool which has all of the required tools attached. Such tools are essential for travelling professional skateboarders and are useful to skaters who do not have easy access to all the required tools.\nSpecifications.\nThe most common specifications of a modern professional-grade skateboard suitable for street practice and competition are as follows:\nThere is no specific standard which should be followed when constructing a skateboard from parts. The consensus is that the board should just \"feel right\" after a few rides. Pre-built boards are available to buy at skate shops and often provide excellent value for riders new to skateboarding.\nComponents.\nThe technical specifications of specific components vary from rider to rider and depend upon the following factors:\nRiders new to street skateboarding benefit greatly by seeking out advice regarding equipment from local skate parks and shops.\nGrip.\nGrip tape, cut to length from a roll at retail, is traditionally a black rubber sheet with an abrasive surface on one side and an adhesive (like a sticker) on the other. Grip tape is installed by peeling the backing off the rubber strip and carefully placing the entire sheet onto the top of a skateboard deck. The operation requires skill and can be tricky to perform, as it can be difficult to prevent air bubbles. Once the sheet is in position, the edges of the sheet are filed away using a hand file until the rubber is exposed so that the sheet can be cut to fit using a sharp blade to remove the excess. Once applied, grip tape is extremely difficult to remove.\nGrip tape comes in various colors and can also be adorned with a decal. Often a place of customization by the rider, a skateboarder may choose to cut out sections or shapes to decorate the top of the skateboard or simply to enable them to distinguish the nose and tail ends of their skateboard while they ride.\nDecks.\nBoard shapes have changed considerably since the 1970s, but modern pro models have remained similar in shape since the invention of the deep concave double kicktail deck. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the freestyle boards of the 1980s; these boards have a largely symmetrical shape and are relatively narrow.\nDecks can be as narrow as 7.5\" or as wide as 8.75\". Length ranges from .\nMass-produced, professional-grade skateboard decks are traditionally glued, multi-laminated, resin-covered, seven-ply pressed maple sandwiches cut and sanded to shape. The maple material traditionally comes from Canada and is usually described as \"Hard rock Canadian Maple.\"\nOften, skateboards are covered in graphics and decals. Some such decks become highly sought-after collectors' items, especially if the graphic is of cultural significance and/or was created by a prominent artist.\nStickers often come with brand new skateboard decks and can be optionally applied to the deck or elsewhere. Stickers are an important promotional tool in the skate industry and are often given out for free at competitions or events.\nWith the skateboard facing forward, a skateboarder who rides regular stance calls the kicktail of a skateboard closest to their back foot the \"tail.\" The kicktail at the opposite end of the deck is called the \"nose.\"\nTrucks.\nTrucks are the axles of a skateboard. Each truck is bolted to the underside of the skateboard deck using a set of four nuts and bolts. Rubber wheels containing bearings are positioned at each end of a truck component's axle and are secured using large threaded nuts at each end of the threaded axle rod. The maneuverability of the axle can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing tension via a large central nut and bolt called the \"kingpin.\" Adjusting the kingpin has the effect of either increasing or decreasing the turning circle of the skateboard. On the kingpin are positioned two rubber bushings used for compact movement and shock absorption, by sandwiching one above the axle and the other above the base plate. The two bushings are clamped to the kingpin with two flat, round washers to hold them in position.\nProfessional-grade trucks are commonly constructed using forged aluminum or magnesium around an iron or steel axle rod. Trucks come in various widths and heights to match deck width and riding style. Rider preference for truck height selection is commonly low for street, mid for mixed park/street, and high for vert. Truck widths do not commonly exceed deck width, so as to avoid injury from protruding axle rods while the skateboard is spinning during tricks.\nWheels.\nSkateboard wheels come in diameters between 48 mm and 62 mm and are made of polyurethane, with a hardness (durometer) above 80A. Some wheels will be made harder than measurable on the \"A\" scale and will have durometers up to 84B (about 104A). Skaters must make a compromise when choosing their wheels. A larger diameter offers lower rolling resistance and more speed, but a smaller diameter makes some flip tricks easier to attempt. A softer durometer allows wheels to travel over cracks, bumps, and rough pavements more easily, whereas a harder durometer offers less resistance during power slides, grinds, and other rail and ledge tricks.\nIn the early 1990s, as many flip tricks were being performed for the first time, smaller, harder wheels were preferred because they offered a slight competitive edge for highly technical tricks. Skateboarders would often ride 48 mm or sometimes even smaller wheels during this time. As skaters started performing tricks on larger obstacles, speed became a more important factor, and as a result, many began gravitating toward larger wheels. Today, 52 mm wheels are considered the standard size, although some skaters choose smaller or larger wheels based on their style and preferred terrain.\nBearings.\nSkate bearings come in one size. They are push-fit and can be serviced and installed in rubber skateboard wheels by hand or by using a tool. Usually consisting of a steel casing and steel or ceramic ball bearings, skate bearings are rated by ABEC, may come with a waterproof race guard, and are normally lubricated with grease.\nCompetitions.\nSkateparks.\nCompetition-level street skateboarding events are held within purpose-built skatepark arenas or cordoned-off urban areas. Within a street skateboarding competition obstacle course, concrete, plastic, metal, or wooden reproductions of obstacles naturally found within the urban environment are placed as they would be in a real urban environment. A course is usually complemented by adding transitions which permit greater travelling speed and an increased amount of \"air.\" Other forms of ramp such as funboxes, which are designed with optimal space use in mind, are commonly found within a park's layout. The course for the first auditorium-size street skating po contest, the 1987 Savannah Slamma! held in Savannah, Georgia at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Arena, was designed by Lance Mountain and constructed by renowned ramp-builder Tommy \"TK\" Kay.\nA popular street skateboarding spot, the West Los Angeles Courthouse building, was converted into a skatepark after the courthouse shut down in 2012.\nThe world's first ever purpose-built street skateboarding plaza was The Buszy in Central Milton Keynes, England.\nNew York City is home to a number of skateparks.\nThe most famous indoor street style skate park in the world is The Berrics.\nExamples of skateparks.\nModern street skateboarding competitions employ a format wherein each participant has two timed attempts or \"runs\" to attack the course and \"shred\" (perform a series of tricks as cleanly as possible). The entrants' attempts are then scored by a panel of judges to decide an overall winner. Competition entrants who perform exceptionally well are traditionally vocally congratulated and encouraged by the crowd during and at the end of their run. Spectating skateboarders commonly show their appreciation for well-performed tricks or smooth runs by slapping their skateboard on a hard surface or obstacle in a complimentary, often respectful but audibly enthusiastic way.\nNotable competitions.\nA number of major international competitions include a street skateboarding event or component. Some examples include:\nOlympic Skateboarding.\nIn March 2019, The United States announced members of their 2019 USA Skateboarding National Team.\nThe plan to run a skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan caused controversy within the skateboarding community.\nIn May 2019, the scheduled skateboarding event was removed from the Lima 2019 Pan American Games. Panam Sports announced that skateboarding was removed from the sports program because World Skate could not guarantee that the best athletes would be in attendance. World Skate had scheduled a world tour event which overlapped with the Pan American Games and would also not authorize the competition as an Olympic qualifier.\nA skateboarding event has been provisionally approved by the IOC for inclusion at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Skateboarding events will also feature at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou.\nGame of SKATE.\nThe game of SKATE is a form of competition which requires no street obstacles and simply a perfectly smooth and sufficiently large skating surface for skateboarders to use to take it in turns to attempt to land flat land tricks.\nPublic perception.\nIn some cases, local authorities have introduced initiatives which ban skateboarding, confiscate skateboards, or make skateboarding difficult or impossible via hostile architecture or by adding anti-skate devices to the environment. These deterrents are commonly targeted at BMX riders, rollerbladers, and scooter riders also—not only skateboarders.\nExamples of skate deterrents.\nLocal authorities often consider street skateboarding in public places a public nuisance. A local council or other authority meeting may be called. Such meetings allow skateboarders to make their voices heard in the event of a proposal to introduce anti-skateboarding legislation. The outcome of this type of meeting is often the formation of some sort of local skateboarding group or organization, along with a drive to fund and build a skate park.\nSuccess stories.\nIn 2002, Philadelphia city officials decided to deconstruct LOVE Park to deter skateboarders from using what officials considered \"an area meant for productive citizens that gave back to the community.\" Years later, skateboarders such as Josh Nims and others built a spiritual replacement for LOVE Park named Paine's Park. Located near the center of the city, Paine's Park attempts to recreate some of the unique obstacles and features of LOVE Park within a specially-designated skateboarding environment. The undertaking involved substantial effort by a large number of people."

        "text": "Golf, also known as One Foundation, is a patience or solitaire card game where players try to earn the lowest number of points (as in golf, the sport) over the course of nine deals (or \"holes\", also borrowing from golf terminology). It has a tableau of 35 face-up cards and a higher ratio of skill to luck than most other solitaire card games. Its easy game-play also makes it within easy reach of first-timers, while still offering scope for strategic play.\nRules.\nSetup.\nFrom a standard 52-card deck, 7 columns of 5 cards each are dealt, all face up and with indices visible. This is the tableau. One additional card is dealt as the base of the foundation. The remaining 16 cards are turned face down to form the stock.\nPlay.\nRules are as follows:\nScoring.\nPlayer scores one point for each card remaining in the tableau after the stock has run out. If the tableau is cleared, player scores a negative point for every card left in the stock. Game is nine \"holes\" (deals) and a score of 45 or lower is considered par, with a score of zero or lower being perfect.\nImpossible tableaus.\nIf a tableau is dealt that would make it impossible for the player to clear all of the cards (e.g. if all queens are covered by kings), then the cards may be reshuffled and redealt.\nVariations.\nTo make the game easier, common variations on these rules include:\nMany variants exist which utilize the same style of game-play as Golf, but adjust the starting layout. The most well-known ones including Tri Peaks, Black Hole, and Pyramid Golf (also called Escalator). Multiple decks may also be used to create larger tableaus.\nMultiplayer Golf.\nGolf Patience can also be played as a competitive game for two or more players, either by playing a hole simultaneously and calculating their total score for 18 holes, or using match-play scoring which keeps track of how many holes you are ahead or behind your opponent (e.g. \"two up\" or \"three down\").\nSpit is a real-time game for two players which employs a similar concept of game-play as Golf."

The mission of QTF is to provide young Qatari tennis players the best resources and opportunities available to reach their maximum potential and compete in renowned tennis tournaments locally, regionally and internationally. In addition the Qatar Tennis Federation (QTF) is fully committed to elevate the level of tennis in the country and to turn tennis into the preferred sport among the community of Qatar.\nQatar Tennis Federation operates all of the Qatar national representative tennis sides, including the Qatar national men's team, the Qatar national women's tennis team and youth sides as well. QTF is also responsible for organizing and hosting the all types of tennis tournaments in Qatar.\nHistory.\nQatar Tennis Federation was established on 9 April 1984 and His Excellency Dr. Issa Ghanem Al – Kuwari became the first President of the Federation appointing Yehya ElBaz as first Technical Secretary of the Federation, being the first Egyptian to officiate at Tier 1 in Wimbledon and the ITF. Under the guidance of H.E. Dr Al-Kuwari, he led the introduction of grass roots sports development in the State of Qatar with the introduction in 1987 of tennis programmes into the major sporting clubs of Qatar. During this period Tennis was established as both a sporting interest for the State but also served as a mechanism for promoting the interests of the country on the political and sporting circuits with the first ever demonstration matches in the region showcasing Vijay Amritraj, Mansour Bahrami and others.\nIn 1991 facilities at the Qatar Tennis Federation had increased including the number of tennis courts and on 16 December 1992 the ultra modern Khalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex in Doha was inaugurated by Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, The Emir of the State of Qatar.\nThe first ATP Qatar Open for men took place in January 1993. Due to the major development in the sport for women in the country, the Qatar Tennis Federation took a major steps for the development of women tennis in Qatar and organized the first women tennis championship to be held in the Middle East. Starting in 2001 the Qatar Open attracted the greatest women players from the WTA Tour including; Martina Hingis, Mary Pierce, Sandrine Testud, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario among many others. From 2008 to 2010 the Sony Ericsson Championships were held in Qatar.\nTennis in Qatar.\nAll the progress and development of tennis in the nation has brought as a result the increase of Qatari players, their participation in tennis tournaments and the opportunity to come in contact with international professional players. But still tennis is not as popular as football, still at professional level there are not so much players from Qatar. QTF opened its Tennis School for the young tennis aspirants of age group 5 to 15 in 2006 to provide the most advance and professional tennis skills.\nTournaments.\nQTF annually organizes two international tournaments for men and women, which attracts world's top players.\nQTF has also organized WTA Tour Championships three times in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\nBoard of directors.\nThis is a list of current board of directors of Qatar Tennis Federation."

        "title": "Serve (tennis)",
        "text": "A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point. A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. Normally players begin a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss). The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a \"let\"; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) although it is also not a \"fault\".\nPlayers normally serve overhead; however serving underhand is allowed. The serve is the only shot a player can take their time to set up instead of having to react to an opponent's shot; however, as of 2012, there is a 25-second limit to be allowed between points.\nThe serve is one of the most difficult shots for a novice, but once mastered it can be a considerable advantage. Advanced players can hit the serve in many different ways and often use it as an offensive weapon to gain an advantage in the point or to win it outright. Because of this, players above beginner level are expected to win most of their service games, and the ability to break an opponent's serve plays a crucial role in a match.\nFor any serve, the server stands behind the baseline without touching it. For the first point of any game, the server stands to the right of the center point of the baseline and serves diagonally across the net to the left side (from the server's perspective) of the court, into the service box which extends to the service line about midway into the opponent's court. For the second point of the game, the serve is diagonally from the left to the right side of the court, and for each subsequent point of the same game the positioning is the opposite of that on the previous point.\nRules.\nAn attempt at a serve may result in one of the following outcomes:\nAce.\nAn \"ace\" occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box or on any line bounding it without touching anything in flight and further missing contact from the receiver. This prompts the server to receive the point once the ball reaches its second bounce. This outcome usually occurs on the first serve, where players are able to take a higher risk and hit a flat and fast ball. This is because, if a player misses the first serve, they have committed an initial fault, but they have not lost the point. As long as they make the second serve which is slower and has a higher percentage of accuracy, they are still in the point.\nGood.\nA \"good serve\" occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box or on any line bounding it without touching anything in flight. Once a \"good serve\" is hit, the play begins.\nLet.\nA \"let\" occurs when a legally served ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object). In professional tennis, play stops immediately, and the serve must be redone. The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred. However, in 1997 NCAA tennis rules were modified to play all lets.\nFault.\nThere are multiple reasons why a service attempt may result in a fault.\nAfter a fault, play stops immediately. If there has been only one fault on this point, the server is then allowed another attempt. If there have been two faults on this point, the point is awarded to the receiver: this is known as a \"\".\nAward of point to the server.\nOn a service, the receiver is required to allow the ball to bounce before attempting to hit it. In the extremely rare event of the receiver's racket or body touching a legally delivered ball before it bounces, the point is immediately awarded to the server. If the ball had already touched the net, then a let is called.\nFirst and second.\nA \"serve\" is made when there has been no fault on the point; a \"second serve\" occurs when there has already been one fault on the point. On a second serve, the server is in danger of losing the point if there is another fault.\nThe rules make no distinction between the first and second serve. However, the tactics used are different. The first serve is typically struck with the maximum power, skill, and deception the player is capable of with the aim of winning the point either outright or on the next stroke, by forcing the receiver into a disadvantageous position. The second serve is usually more conservative to avoid getting a double fault and is typically hit with less power or a higher curve. The second serves often have more topspin and kick on the ball.\nStances.\nThere are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.\nIn the platform stance, the feet are kept about shoulder-width apart throughout the service, providing stable support and easy weight transfer from the back to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.\nIn the pinpoint stance, the feet start apart, but as the serve unfolds, the back foot slides or steps forward until it is adjacent to or slightly behind the front foot. As a result, the feet provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem.\nAdvantages of platform stance and the pinpoint stance.\nThe pinpoint serve provides better velocity, since the feet come together as a single unit, allowing them to push harder against the ground and gain more leg power. However, the center of gravity moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently.\nPlayers will sacrifice some power with the platform services, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve—some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.\nThe service each player uses will depend on their individual abilities and what they need the most—power or consistency.\nIf they already have good body control but would like to produce extra power, they could try the pinpoint stance. If consistency is their problem, they can use the platform stance.\nAlternative stances.\nThe platform stance and the pinpoint stance are closed stances. For a very long time, the use of an open stance to serve had been regarded as a sign of a tennis beginner. Things have changed in recent years. At the elite level, Venus Williams had used a semi-open stance to serve in the past (she went back to use a traditional closed stance and stayed to the old way currently). Beside Venus, Nikola Mektic and Viktor Troicki both have abandoned closed stance to use open stance to serve.\nTypes.\nIn the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\". All of these serves are legal in professional and amateur play.\nThe term \"kick serve\" is ambiguous. It may be used as a synonym for the twist serve or the American twist. However, \"kick serve\" is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.\nServers can gain a tactical advantage by varying the type of serve and the ball's placement. The flat serve and slice serve are used primarily as first serves because they are more likely to yield an ace or force an error, although they require high accuracy. Second serves usually have slice, topspin or kick on them, which makes them less likely to land in the net or out of bounds. Kick serves also make a good change-up as a first serve.\nFlat.\nA flat serve is hit with either a continental grip (holding the racket as if it were an axe), an Eastern backhand grip, or somewhere in between. The swing path goes directly toward the target at impact, which causes the ball to cut quickly through the air without spinning. Some professional players can hit flat serves at speeds near .\nA flat serve must come close to the net therefore having a small margin for error. Therefore, flat serves are usually hit straight across the center, where the net is lowest. They are usually delivered as first serves, when the server does not risk a double fault. The ball is thrown straight above and slightly forward for the optimal serving point.\nSlice/reverse slice.\nA slice serve is hit with a sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their dominant side with the racket. It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the Eastern backhand grip (using the forehand face of the racket). The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side.\nFor a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin causes the ball to curve leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. The curve of a good slice serve can draw the receiver wide of the singles sideline to play the ball. Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve. It can be used to ace the receiver, to draw the receiver out of position, or to \"jam\" the receiver with a serve curving sharply towards the receiver's body.\nThe reverse slice serve (or inside-out serve) is analogous to the screwball pitch in baseball. It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve. Servers must pronate their racket arm and sweep the racket across the body while striking the ball when hitting a reverse slice serve. Because the direction of spin applied is reversed relative to the standard slice serve, a reverse slice serve from a right-handed player will have the same motion as a slice serve from a left-handed player, and \"vice versa\".\nIn professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the slice struck serve.\nKick/topspin/American twist/Reverse kick.\nHolcombe Ward and Dwight Davis introduced the kick/American twist serve in the late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's non-dominant side brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high arc with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the Magnus effect because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7–8 o'clock position to the 1–2 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds. If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.\nKick/topspin serves are often used as both first and second serves. As a first serve, a player will put more pace on the ball, while it is a consistent second serve since the spin brings it into the service box with high net clearance.\nThe reverse kick/American twist serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the kick struck serve.\nUnderhand.\nThe underhand serve is struck below shoulder level. In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on courts. Although this serve is legal, it may be seen as unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include Michael Chang's in the Round of 16 at the 1989 French Open against Ivan Lendl, and Martina Hingis was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the 1999 French Open. This serve has gained some prominence since 2019 as a surprise tactic when playing deep returners, heralded by Nick Kyrgios.\nPat-a-cake.\nA pat-a-cake serve is a serve in which the racket is not swung behind the head (as in a proper serve). The player will simply toss the ball up and \"pat\" or tap it over the net to get it in play. It is often used by beginning players, or players who never had proper instruction. The term is usually employed belittlingly.\nReturning.\nSince the server has the advantage of being the initial aggressor, for his opponent to return the ball and to keep it in play often involves the defensive endeavor of minimizing the opponent's advantage.\nThis may involve simply lunging to get the racket on the ball before it passes. If a controlled return of service is possible, a hard groundstroke to one side or the other of the opponent's baseline may be performed. If the server rushes the net immediately upon hitting the serve, the returner has several options: return the ball at the feet of the server not far past the net, forcing him to hit a half volley (which is hard to do aggressively); lob the ball over the rushing server's head; or hit a passing shot hard and low over the net too far to the left or right for the server to hit it."

The team competes under the franchise name, Jamaica Scorpions in the Cricket West Indies' Professional Cricket League which comprises both the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50. Jamaica has won a sum of 12 regional first class and 9 regional one day titles. Hence the Scorpions have won the second most first class and 50 over championships in the history of West Indies cricket.\nThe most prominent Jamaican cricketers include George Headley, Allan Rae, Alf Valentine, Collie Smith, Lawrence Rowe, Michael Holding, Jeff Dujon, Courtney Walsh, Patrick Patterson, Jimmy Adams, Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor, Nikita Miller and Gareth Breese.\nHistory.\nThe team's history dates back to 1895, when they played three matches against a touring side from England led by Slade Lucas, but because of the distance to the other cricketing countries, Jamaica did not play regular first-class cricket until 1964. They played in the inaugural Shell Shield first-class competition, winning it on the fourth attempt, but then had to wait until 1977–78 for their next title – which was a shared one-day title with Leeward Islands.\nFrom 1986 to 1992, Jamaica won a total of six titles (three first class and three one-day), but in the thirteen seasons since then they have added four to the cupboard, despite completing the double in 1999–2000. In 2004–05, they came back after a two-year drought, however – with seven wins in ten regular season matches, they were 47 points ahead of runners-up Leeward Islands on the regular season table to win the Carib Beer Cup, before defeating the Leeward Islands by eight wickets in the final to take the Carib Beer Challenge title as well. However, this was followed up by a last-place finish the following season.\nThe team does not take part in any international competitions (the 1998 Commonwealth Games tournament being an exception), but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50, and the best players may be selected for the West Indies cricket team, which plays international cricket. Jamaica has won the domestic first class competition 12 times in total. They have also won the one-day competition eight times outright, sharing the title on one occasion. The team competes in the Professional Cricket Leagues under the franchise name Jamaica Scorpions.\nGrounds.\nJamaica's main ground is at Sabina Park in Kingston, which has hosted 144 first-class games since 1895. Regional and international games have also been played at the Trelawny Stadium in Trelawny."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of George B. McClellan",
        "text": "Major General George B. McClellan is an equestrian statue in Washington, D.C. that honors politician and Civil War general George B. McClellan. The monument is sited on a prominent location in the Kalorama Triangle neighborhood due to efforts made by area residents. The statue was sculpted by American artist Frederick William MacMonnies, a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts whose best known work is a statue of Nathan Hale in New York City. MacMonnies was chosen to design the statue following a lengthy competition organized by a statue commission, led by then Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The monument was dedicated in 1907, with prominent attendees at the ceremony including President Theodore Roosevelt, New York City mayor George B. McClellan Jr., politicians, generals and thousands of military personnel.\nThe sculpture is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The bronze statue, which rests on a tall granite base adorned with emblems and bronze reliefs, is surrounded by a small public park bounded by California Street, Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue NW. The monument and park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGeorge B. McClellan (1826–1885) rose to prominence as a major general during the Civil War who organized the Army of the Potomac. Although he was unsuccessful in early battles, the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam temporarily halted the Confederate invasion of the northern states. He was later removed from his post by President Abraham Lincoln, whom he unsuccessfully ran against in the 1864 presidential election. McClellan ran again for public office after the war, serving as the 24th Governor of New Jersey.\nShortly after McClellan's death in 1885, the Society of the Army of the Potomac, a fraternal organization consisting of Union veterans, began plans to erect a monument honoring the general. It wasn't until March 3, 1901, that Congress appropriated $50,000 for the erection of the statue of McClellan. The following month a statue commission, originally led by Secretary of War Elihu Root, Senator George P. Wetmore and General George D. Ruggles, was formed to oversee the project. An advisory committee, composed of sculptors Daniel Chester French and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and architect Charles Follen McKim, was also formed to provide recommendations to the commission. A resolution adopted at one of the first commission meetings stated: \"That the monument of Gen. McClellan be an equestrian statue, and that this resolution be communicated by the secretary to any commission hereinafter appointed to execute the work.\"\nIn 1902, a design competition was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art with a bonus of $500 for each of the four sculptors who submitted the best models of the McClellan statue. Twenty-three designs were submitted by May 1, which was later narrowed down to four finalists: Austin Hays, Charles Henry Niehaus, Attilio Piccirilli and Thomas Waldo Story. The four sculptors were later asked to submit larger models for further review by the advisory committee. The model submitted by Story was favored by McClellan's widow, Nelly. In 1903, the committee rejected three of the designs, citing a lack of individuality and symbolism. The fourth design, by Niehaus, was reluctantly approved by the committee, though the commission rejected all of the designs stating \"no model submitted upon the competition is satisfactory.\"\nIn August 1903, the commission chose Frederick William MacMonnies (1863–1937), an American artist and sculptor who lived in Paris, to create the statue. MacMonnies was a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts who had apprenticed with Saint-Gaudens for four years beginning at the age of seventeen. His previous works included a statue of Nathan Hale in New York City, \"Columbian Fountain\" at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and \"Bacchante and Infant Faun\" at the Boston Public Library. MacMonnies' other well-known Civil War work is the sculptural groupings on the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch in Brooklyn, New York. After his initial design was rejected due to costs overruns, he submitted a new design to the committee, which was later approved by the officials and Nelly McClellan. The accepted design reflected the influence of MacMonnies' teacher in Paris, Alexandre Falguière, rather than Saint-Gaudens. James Crocroft was chosen to design the monument while the statue was founded by Edmond Gruet Jeune. The Society of the Army of the Potomac paid for the costs associated with improving the monument site.\nThe site chosen for the monument changed several times throughout the planning process. Suggested locations included the intersection of Florida Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue NW, Sheridan Circle (current site of the Equestrian statue of Philip Sheridan) and the intersection of N Street and Connecticut Avenue NW (current site of the \"Doctor John Witherspoon\" statue). In 1906, residents of the Kalorama Triangle neighborhood, then called Washington Heights, represented by cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman and Rear Admiral Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr., asked the statue commission to consider placing the monument in their neighborhood. The commission, then led by Secretary of War and future President William Howard Taft, Senator Wetmore and General Horatio Collins King, approved the suggested site at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road NW, describing it as a \"more satisfactory and imposing\" location. An additional factor that led to the site's approval was that the area had been a Union camp during the summer of 1861 when McClellan arrived in Washington, D.C.\nDedication.\nThe dedication of the monument was first planned for October 18, 1906, to coincide with the 37th annual reunion of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. A fire at MacMonnies' polishing works prevented him from finishing the pedestal in time, so the dedication and reunion were rescheduled for the following May. During the delay, MacMonnies exhibited the statue at the 1906 Salon d'Automne in Paris before shipping it to the United States. The reunion began on May 1, 1907, with opening events held at the Belasco Theater (present site of the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building), Corcoran Gallery of Art and Thomas Jefferson Building.\nThe dedication took place on Thursday, May 2, at 2:30 pm. Prior to the ceremony, around 700 veterans gathered at the intersection of 18th Street and Columbia Road NW, and marched down Columbia Road in a military parade to the dedication site. Veterans who were unable to march were seated in reviewing stands. The area surrounding the monument included a temporary stand and viewing boxes decorated with bunting, large flags, flowers and shields, while the statue was draped with two American flags. Prominent attendees at the ceremony included the main speaker, President Theodore Roosevelt, New York City mayor and McClellan's son, George B. McClellan Jr., William Howard Taft, New Jersey governor Edward C. Stokes, Generals George Lewis Gillespie Jr., Frederick Dent Grant and Wallace F. Randolph, and Nelly McClellan. Additional attendees included members of Congress, foreign diplomats, members of the president's cabinet and thousands of citizens. The event was led by Brigadier General Henry C. Dwight, president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.\nFollowing an invocation by Episcopal bishop Henry Y. Satterlee, a brief history of the statue was given by General Horatio Collins King. McClellan Jr. then unveiled the statue to cheers and applause from the crowd. After the unveiling, the Fourth Battery of the Field Artillery saluted as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played by the Marine Band. After a military parade consisting of thousands of troops led by General J. Franklin Bell passed the statue and the reviewing stands, the main speech by Roosevelt was given. Roosevelt's remarks, which covered various topics including war, peace, national pride and family, included the following: \"Modern statuary has added a new terror to death. But I wish on behalf of those who live in the capital of the nation to express my very profound acknowledgment to those who had the good taste to choose a great sculptor to do this work. I thank them for having erected here in so well a chosen site a statue which, not only because of the man it commemorates, but because of its intrinsic worth, adds to the nobility and beauty of the capital city of the country.\" Following the president's remarks, an overture from \"Semiramide\", \"On the Field of Glory\", was played. General Oliver O. Howard then spoke about his interactions with McClellan and General Grenville M. Dodge read a letter from General Daniel Sickles (who was ill at the time) that discussed his personal experiences with McClellan General Dwight's speech included the statement: \"Statues may crumble to dust. Veterans' graves will be obliterated by time, but the grandest monument of the service of valor of the soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, the United States of America, the hope and joy of the world, consecrated to liberty by the blood and treasure of the nation, the undying testimonial of the patriotism of her people, will continue years and years.\" The benediction was given by William R. Jenvey, Episcopal archdeacon of Jersey City, followed by the band closing the ceremony with \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\"\nLater history.\nThe statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C. that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. It is also designated a contributing property to the Kalorama Triangle Historic District, listed on the NRHP on May 4, 1987. The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service (NPS), a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nIn 2009, the monument underwent a $114,000 restoration by Kreilick Conservation supervised by NPS architectural conservator Catherine Dewey. It was the first major conservation of the statue since its dedication in 1907. Scaffolding and nylon mesh were installed around the monument for several months during the restoration, which included cleaning, painting and waxing the statue. Damage to the monument that was repaired during the process included removing spray paint from the base, removing water leakage inside the horse's legs and stomach, and replicating a bronze shield that was missing from the pedestal.\nDesign and location.\nThe monument is sited on a prominent location at the intersection of California Street, Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue NW, on the southern edge of the Kalorama Triangle Historic District. The statue faces south down Connecticut Avenue toward Dupont Circle and downtown Washington, D.C. It is surrounded by a small public park. Adjacent landmarks include the Churchill Hotel to the west, Lothrop Mansion to the north and Washington Hilton to the east.\nThe bronze statue is tall. It depicts McClellan dressed in his Union Army military uniform, including gauntlets, a hat, sash and sword, while riding a horse. He is holding the horse's reins with the left hand while the right hand is placed on his hip. The granite pedestal, which measures tall and long, rests on a base measuring long and wide. Near the top of the pedestal are eight shield-shaped emblems noting Civil War battles McClellan led: Antietam, Fair Oaks, Gaines's Mill, Malvern Hill, Mechanicsville, South Mountain, Williamsburg and Yorktown. On the east and west sides of the pedestal are bronze reliefs composed of cannons, eagles, flags and swords. A bronze oak and laurel garland runs along the base of the pedestal between bronze eagles on each corner.\nInscriptions on the monument include the following:\n(front of the pedestal) MAJOR GENERAL / GEORGE BRINTON MCCLELLAN / 1826–1885\n(rear of the pedestal) ERECTED BY THE / GRAND ARMY OF THE POTOMAC / AND THE / CONGRESS OF THE VNITED STATES / 1907\n(relief on proper left side) MAC MONNIES / E. GRUET JNE FONDEUR"

He was the No. 25 draft choice in the first round in 1984 (by the Baltimore Orioles), after having led the nation in strikeouts in college baseball, pitching 205 strikeouts for Fresno State in his senior year. Also in 1984 Hoover was a starting pitcher for the United States Olympic baseball team, winning the opening game and helping the US to win the silver medal for baseball. His teammates on the Olympic team included Mark McGwire, Barry Larkin, Will Clark, and Oddibe McDowell.\nIn 1983, Hoover pitched the opening game at the IX Pan American Games, for an 8-0 victory over the Dominican Republic, helping to win the bronze medal for the United States team.\nHoover signed with the Orioles while still at the Summer Olympics on August 3, 1984. He played for the Texas Rangers in the 1990 season, but had a shortened pro-baseball career due to injuries sustained as a college player. He died on July 8, 2014, apparently of natural causes. \nPrior to attending Fresno State, he attended Fresno High School, graduating in 1980 and Cooper Junior High School in Fresno, graduating in 1977."

        "title": "Arthur Gibson (rugby)",
        "text": "Arthur Sumner Gibson (14 July 1844 – 23 January 1927) was a rugby union international who represented England in 1871 in the first international match.\nEarly life.\nGibson was born at Fawley, near Southampton on 14 July 1844 and baptised there on 11 August 1844. He was the son of priest William Gibson (1804–1862) and his second wife Louisanna Sumner (1817–1899). Louisanna was the eldest daughter of Charles Richard Sumner (1790–1874; who had been the Bishop of Llandaff, 1826–1827, and served as Bishop of Winchester from 1827 to 1868) and Jennie Fanny Barnabine [Maunoir] (1794–1849). She was therefore the niece of Charles' elder brother John Bird Sumner who served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1848 to 1862. Arthur's father William, had married Arthur's mother in 1837, the year after the death of his first wife Eliza Maria, (1808–1836). Louisanna was in fact the first cousin of William's first wife with Eliza having been the third daughter of John Bird Sumner.\nArthur was born in Fawley, Hampshire where his parents had moved in 1840 and where William became Rector. Arthur had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage: Marianne (May; 1832–1845) and John Sumner (1833–1892). From his father's second marriage Arthur was the eldest son, having four older sisters, Ella Sophia (1838–1928); Emily Louisa (1840–1887); Ada Frances (1841–1893); and Edith Harriet (1842–1922). His mother, having had four daughters in succession then had four sons consecutively, the first of which was Arthur, followed by Herbert William Sumner (1846–1923); Edgar Charles Sumner (1848–1924); and Walter Sumner (1849–1918). Three more children followed, Rosa Fanny (1850–1904); Florence Jennie (1853–1911) and finally Alan George Sumner (1856–1922).\nAt Arthur's baptism his sponsors were his grandfather, Charles Richard Sumner and his grandmother, Jennie as well as his maternal uncle, Robert. When he was eight months old he, along with all his siblings, caught whooping cough. His older sister May although suffering lightly with whooping cough then caught dropsy and died in October 1845.\nArthur began attending Marlborough College when he was 12 and he was later admitted at Trinity College, Oxford on 11 June 1863 where he received his BA.\nRugby union career.\nAfter completing his education he moved to Swinton in Lancashire where he practised as a Civil Engineer. This location gave him the opportunity to play for the Manchester Football Club. Gibson made his international debut on 27 March 1871 at Edinburgh in the Scotland vs England match, the first international rugby match. He was one of four Manchester players to be selected. As with the majority of the side, he was not selected to play for England again, their next game being the following year.\nLater life and career.\nArthur practised as a Civil Engineer in Lancashire and remained affiliated to the Institution of Civil Engineers until he was 61, in 1905. In 1884 he married Mary Hesketh, whom he had met in Swinton, where she was living with her aunt, Mrs Lempriere. They had three children: Hugh Sumner (1844–1942), who later served in the Indian Forest Service; Percy (Peter) Lemprière (1886–1950) who became a surgeon in the Royal Navy; and Edith Monica (1890–1954) who became a renowned butterfly expert.\nFollowing Arthur's father's death in 1862, his mother, Louisanna, had moved to Farnham, Surrey and then moved again after the death of her father, Bishop Sumner, in 1874, to Blackwater, Hampshire. Arthur, in 1895, chose to be closer to his mother and moved his family down to house in Binfield, roughly nine miles from his mother, which she described in her memoirs as a \"great comfort to have him near us.\" In Binfield, he became the church warden of the parish of St Mark's Church and served as such for over twenty years. On the floor of the church, near to the choir stalls, is a tablet of Cumberland stone in memory of Arthur Sumner Gibson.\nOf his siblings, Herbert William Sumner Gibson became a Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy; and Edgar Charles Sumner Gibson became Bishop of Gloucester. His brother, Walter Sumner Gibson became an academic reader at the Oxford University Press from 1914 and his nephew through his wife's youngest brother was the actor Laurence Olivier. Arthur's youngest brother, Alan George Sumner Gibson became the Coadjutor Bishop of Cape Town."

Some teams choose to have both a general manager and a President of Basketball Operations. For example, when Red Auerbach was team president of the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, Jan Volk, the team's GM from 1984-1997, reported to Auerbach regarding basketball-related decisions. Others, such as the Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA, have a general manager who is also Chief Executive Officer of the organization, effectively reporting only to the owner. Still others will place player personnel decisions in the hands of a head coach; for example, when Don Nelson became coach of the Milwaukee Bucks in 1976, he also became its general manager. In these cases, coaching staffs generally report to a different executive officer within the organization."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of George Henry Thomas",
        "text": "Major General George Henry Thomas, also known as the Thomas Circle Monument, is an equestrian sculpture in Washington, D.C. that honors Civil War general George Henry Thomas. The monument is located in the center of Thomas Circle, on the border of the downtown and Logan Circle neighborhoods. It was sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward, best known for his work on the statue of George Washington in Wall Street, Manhattan. Attendees at the dedication in 1879 included President Rutherford B. Hayes, Generals Irvin McDowell, Philip Sheridan, and William Tecumseh Sherman, senators and thousands of soldiers.\nThe sculpture is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is considered by art critics and historians to be one of the best equestrian statues in the city. The statue, which rests on an oval pedestal, and the surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGeorge Henry Thomas, a Virginian, was a Union general in the Civil War and a principal commander in the Western Theater. During the Battle of Chickamauga, he was responsible for saving the Union Army from being completely routed, earning him the nickname \"Rock of Chickamauga\". The Society of the Army of the Cumberland, composed of veterans, chose to erect a monument to Thomas utilizing bronze cannons captured from Confederate forces. John Quincy Adams Ward was selected to sculpt the statue and began the process in 1875. The sculpture, which cost $40,000, was paid for by the Society. On July 31, 1876, Congress appropriated $25,000 to pay for the pedestal and base, although the final cost was only $20,000. The contract for the statue stated three of the horse's feet had to be touching the ground. This was to make sure it wouldn't receive the same type of criticism Andrew Jackson's sculpture in Lafayette Square received and to avoid the \"stagey, theatrical animal that poses and postures in so many of the public squares of the United States.\" Thomas's widow, Frances, gave Ward photographs of her husband and lent him Thomas' uniform and saddle to help with the design. After he finished the plaster model in 1879, Ward invited Thomas' family, Society officers, and members of the press to his studio in New York to view the model. The reaction was very positive. The Society was so impressed with Ward's work, they later selected him to design the James A. Garfield Monument and the Equestrian statue of Philip Sheridan as well, though the contract for the latter was eventually cancelled. Architects John L. Smithmeyer and Paul J. Pelz, best known for designing the Thomas Jefferson Building and Healy Hall, were selected to design the monument base. The Bureau Brothers Foundry cast the sculpture while stonework was provided by contractor M. K. Chase. The traffic circle where the monument was erected was previously known as Memorial Circle because nearby residents planted memorial trees in honor of their respective home states. The name was changed to Thomas Circle when the monument was installed.\nDedication.\nThe memorial was dedicated on November 19, 1879, with an estimated 50,000 people in attendance. \"Harper's Weekly\" described the event as the grandest ceremony ever held in the city The ceremony featured a two-mile military procession, led by General Thomas Turpin Crittenden, of around 500 Army of the Cumberland veterans, 1,000 army troops, 1,000 marines and sailors, state troops from Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania, and generals Irvin McDowell, Philip Sheridan, and William Tecumseh Sherman. Music in the procession was performed by seven military bands, with the United States Marine Band in the first position. The procession began east of the U.S. Capitol and marched past President Rutherford B. Hayes at the White House on its way toward the memorial site. Most of the buildings along the line of march, including nearly every building on Pennsylvania Avenue, were decorated with flags, streamers, and other decorations. The most elaborately decorated building along the line of march was the Quartermaster General's office, located on the corner of 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which was decorated with numerous flags and a canvas bearing a portrait of Thomas. The circle and the homes surrounding it were extensively decorated. There were 38 poles, each high, placed around the edge of the circle, with the flag of every U.S. state at the time. A temporary platform seating 1,500 people was erected around part of the circle for special guests and dignitaries.\nThe ceremony began with a prayer followed by the songs \"Hail to the Chief\" and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". The statue was then unveiled accompanied by a thirteen gun salute. After the unveiling, a chorus of 100 men sang hymns with music performed by the Marine Band. General Anson G. McCook, a member of the Fighting McCooks who served under Thomas, delivered the dedication speech. Senator Stanley Matthews also gave a speech which included the presentation of the statue as an offering to the country. The statue was accepted by President Hayes on behalf of the American people. Hayes stated: \"In the name of the people of the United States I accept this noble statue, so worthy of its subject, erected in honor of Gen. George H. Thomas by his comrades of the illustrious Army of the Cumberland.\" The monument was the sixth equestrian sculpture erected in Washington, D.C.\nInfluence and historic designation.\nArt critics, historians, and Civil War monument researchers Kirk Savage and Kathryn Allamong Jacob consider the Thomas monument one of the best equestrian statues in Washington, D.C. According to Savage, it \"enhanced the circle's prestige by giving it a commemorative identity in this rapidly emerging landscape\" and \"served at once as a national monument honoring a war hero and a real estate amenity for an affluent urban setting.\" It increased development at Thomas Circle and the surrounding area, although none of the stately homes around the circle are still standing. Along with seventeen other Civil War monuments, \"Major General George Henry Thomas\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. The sculpture and the surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nDesign and location.\nThe monument is located in the center of Thomas Circle, at the intersection of 14th Street, M Street, Massachusetts Avenue and Vermont Avenue NW. Following a reconstruction of Thomas Circle completed in 2006, new sidewalks and landscaping allowed visitors easier access to the monument and surrounding park. The monument is approximately high while the statue itself is around high. The bronze figures of Thomas and the horse are around twice life-size. Thomas is depicted surveying a battlefield while at the top of a hill. He is holding the reins of the horse with his left hand and his right hand is holding his hat and gloves. Thomas is wearing a double-breasted military coat and plain riding boots, while his sword hangs from his left side. The horse looks straight ahead as its mane and tail are blown by the wind. Its \"dilated nostrils, erect ears, tense muscles, and waving, bushy tail\" demonstrate the horse's excitement. The horse was originally designed to be a mare. After it was pointed out that Thomas only rode stallions, additions were made to the sculpture, though the slender head and neck are still reminiscent of a mare.\nThe statue stands on an oval granite pedestal featuring two Baroque scrolls on each end. A bronze badge of the Army of the Cumberland, which Thomas had commanded, and a laurel wreath is also on each side of the pedestal. The circular granite base features four steps and four blocks protruding from the pedestal to the lowest step. Decorative gas lamps previously stood on the base's four blocks, but these were removed sometime around 1922.\nInscriptions on the monument include the following:"

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Winfield Scott",
        "text": "Brevet Lt. General Winfield Scott is an equestrian statue in Washington, D.C., that honors career military officer Winfield Scott. The monument stands in the center of Scott Circle, a traffic circle and small park at the convergence of 16th Street, Massachusetts Avenue and Rhode Island Avenue NW. The statue was sculpted by Henry Kirke Brown, whose best-known works include statues of George Washington in New York and Nathanael Greene in Washington, D.C. It was the first of many sculptures honoring Civil War generals that were installed in Washington, D.C.'s traffic circles and squares and was the second statue in the city to honor Scott.\nThe sculpture is one of the city's 18 Civil War monuments that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The monument and park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. The bronze statue rests on a granite base that at the time was the largest stone ever quarried in the United States. Much criticized for its depiction of Scott and the proportions of the horse, it is considered one of the worst equestrian sculptures in the city by authors and historians.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWinfield Scott (1786–1866), nicknamed \"Old Fuss and Feathers\" and the \"Grand Old Man of the Army\", served on active duty as general longer than any other American officer. During his 53-year career, he led forces during several wars, including the War of 1812, Black Hawk War, Mexican–American War, Seminole Wars, and Civil War. He served under every president from Thomas Jefferson to Abraham Lincoln. His twenty-year service as Commanding General of the United States Army was the longest in that post's history. His popularity following the Mexican–American War resulted in Scott being nominated the Whig Party candidate in the 1852 presidential election.\nFollowing Scott's death in 1866, veterans and other citizens began lobbying for a monument to honor the general. On March 3, 1867, Congress authorized $35,000 for the erection of an equestrian statue. The monument was reauthorized by Congress on July 15, 1870, and on June 10, 1872. The artist selected was Henry Kirke Brown (1814–1886), a sculptor from New York whose 1856 equestrian statue of George Washington in Union Square, Manhattan, had been well received by critics. His other works in Washington, D.C. include \"Major General Nathanael Greene\" in Stanton Park and busts of Vice Presidents George Clinton and John C. Breckinridge, poet William Cullen Bryant, Major General Philip Kearny, and Senators Henry Clay and Richard Stockton.\nThe model of the statue was completed around 1872. The federal government contributed bronze cannons captured by Scott during the Mexican–American War to use for casting the statue. Before the casting began, descendants of Scott saw the model and protested the design. Brown had designed the horse to be a small mare, which Scott preferred to ride, instead of a stallion. The descendants argued that no other general had been portrayed riding a mare and that a horse with flared nostrils and arched neck would be more suitable. Brown was annoyed by the requests and only made minimal modifications to the design, resulting in Scott, a tall and heavy man measuring and weighing , riding a small mare with the external genitalia of a stallion. The statue was founded by Robert Wood &amp; Company, whose other works in Washington, D.C. include \"Major General Nathanael Greene\", \"Major General James B. McPherson\" and \"General John A. Rawlins\".\nThe architect selected to design the base is disputed. Historian James M. Goode, author of \"Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C.\", cites General Orville E. Babcock of the Corps of Engineers as the architect, while a 1985 report by the National Park Service credits George Edward Harney. The stonework was completed by Jonas French of the Cape Ann Granite Company. The base was carved from a single block of granite weighing more than 150 tons. It was the largest single stone ever quarried in the United States at the time.\nThe original planned site for the statue was present-day McPherson Square. Scott Circle, a tract of land previously known as Jamaica, was renamed in honor of Scott when the monument was installed in 1874 at a total cost of $77,000. Although there was no formal dedication, the park surrounding the site was landscaped with trees and ornamental flowers before the monument was installed. The monument was the first of many memorials to Civil War generals in Washington, D.C.'s traffic circles and squares, although Scott is the only Civil War official to be represented by two statues in the nation's capital. The second statue, by sculptor Launt Thompson, was erected on the grounds of the United States Soldiers' Home in 1873.\nReception.\nThe statue received much criticism after it was installed. Critics said Scott was being portrayed as \"too old, too fat, too stiff, too short-legged.\" He was described as looking like \"an old sack of flour\" and irritated because his hand was resting on his hip. The horse was ridiculed even more. One reporter said the horse looked like it was \"suffering slightly from ringbone lameness and not daring to travel faster than a walk.\" The proportions of the horse received the greatest amount of criticism, with observers calling it \"too light, too delicate, too thin, too timid, and dreadfully proportioned.\" Upon seeing the monument, General Philip Sheridan reportedly told his wife to never let him be immortalized in such a manner. Kathryn Allamong Jacob, author of \"Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.\", considers it one of the worst equestrian monuments in the city, especially when compared to the nearby \"Major General George Henry Thomas\" statue, considered one of the city's best. A 2000 article in \"The Washington Post\" described it as the city's oddest equestrian statue.\nLater history.\nThe introduction of the monument spurred development around Scott Circle and the immediate area. Soon after the monument was installed, notable individuals including Secretary of the Treasury William Windom and \"The Washington Post\" founder Stilson Hutchins built mansions around the circle. The area continued to be a desirable location for wealthy Washingtonians until most of the mansions were demolished in the 1940s. In 1941, the monument was temporarily removed when a four-lane tunnel was built beneath the circle.\nThe statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C. that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nDesign and location.\nThe Scott monument is located in the center of Scott Circle, a traffic circle and park at the convergence of 16th Street, Massachusetts Avenue and Rhode Island Avenue NW, on the border of the Dupont Circle and Logan Circle neighborhoods. Scott Circle is considered the southeastern terminus of Embassy Row with the Embassy of Australia overlooking the circle and statue. The statue faces south down 16th Street towards the White House. The park is flanked by two small, triangular reservations. The Daniel Webster Memorial, listed on the NRHP, is on the west reservation and the Samuel Hahnemann Monument, also listed on the NRHP, is on the east reservation. The statue and park are not intended for pedestrian use as there are no sidewalks on or around the circle. Pedestrians use the side reservations to maneuver around the circle.\nThe bronze statue is tall and long while the granite base it rests on is wide and long. The inscription \"SCOTT\" is on the south side of the base. The statue depicts Scott wearing a field uniform of a lieutenant general, including a hat and long jacket with fringed epaulets and decorative sash. He is riding his horse while holding the reins in his left hand. Scott's right hand is holding a pair of field glasses and resting on his hip. His sword is on his left side. The tiered base is adorned with architectural decoration."

The competition was held from 4 to 6 September 1972. 71 fencers from 28 nations competed. Each nation was limited to three fencers. The event was won by Csaba Fenyvesi of Hungary, the nation's second consecutive victory in the event. His countryman Győző Kulcsár, the 1968 gold medalist, earned bronze this time to become the ninth man to win multiple medals in the men's individual épée. Silver went to Jacques Ladègaillerie of France; the French épéeists, a power in the event from 1900 to 1932, earned their first individual medal in 40 years. The three-Games podium streak of the Soviet Union was snapped, with all three Soviet fencers reaching the semifinals but eliminated there.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the six finalists (the three medalists) from the 1968 Games returned: gold medalist Győző Kulcsár of Hungary, silver medalist (and 1964 gold medalist) Grigory Kriss of the Soviet Union, and bronze medalist (and 1964 fourth-place finisher) Gianluigi Saccaro of Italy. Kriss was the reigning (1971) World Champion.\nHong Kong and Turkey each made their debut in the event. The United States appeared for the 15th time, most among nations, having missed only the 1908 edition of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1972 tournament returned to the traditional format of entirely pool-play rounds, after two Games of mixed pool-play and knockout rounds in 1964 and 1968. Five rounds were held. Bouts were to 5 touches, with double-losses possible. No barrages were held; touch quotient (touches for divided by touches against) was used to break ties.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 Pool D.\nMaier was unable to complete his first bout, collapsing during the competition. He \"was rushed to the hospital but was rendered quadriplegic from uncertain causes, although a blood clot on the brain was suspected.\" The bout was not counted in the official results, with the remaining fencers in the pool competing as if the pool had only 5 members.\nFinal.\nLadègaillerie had a touch-quotient of 1.211, Kulcsár had 1.053, and Pongratz had 0.950."

        "text": "Matthew Phillip Simms (born September 27, 1988) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at Tennessee, before being signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent in 2012. Simms is the son of former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl XXI MVP Phil Simms and younger brother of former NFL quarterback Chris Simms. He currently runs a non-NFL-sponsored private Quarterback training camp and podcast under the name \"Simms Complete.\"\nEarly years.\nSimms was born in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey to Diana and Phil Simms. His older brother, Chris, played quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following an extraordinary career at Ramapo High School. Matt attended Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, New Jersey where he played quarterback on the football team for three years. During this time, he passed for more than 6,000 yards and 60 touchdowns. Though the team lost the state championship game his junior year, he was selected as a first-team All-State player by the \"Associated Press\". The next year, they went undefeated and won the state title. After his senior year, he played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Simms received a scholarship to the University of Louisville. During his freshman year, he saw limited action, playing in two games and throwing four passes. Simms then left Louisville to attend El Camino College in Torrance, California. While at El Camino he led the team to its fourth consecutive league title and threw for over 2,000 yards in ten games.\nSimms later left El Camino for the University of Tennessee. As a child, he always had a dislike for Tennessee's rival, the University of Florida. During the 2010 season, he played in ten games and threw for over 1,400 yards.\nDuring the 2010 season, Simms was hampered by injuries to key receivers. He lost the starting job late in the season to Tyler Bray due to poor performance.\nSimms's performance was the subject of a widely reported \"heated dispute\" between Desmond Howard and Phil Simms during the week before Super Bowl XLV.\nIn the 2011 season, Simms appeared in seven games and started two. He was 27 of 62 for 319 passing yards and three interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Jets.\n2012 season.\nSimms was signed by the New York Jets on May 6, 2012. He was waived on August 31, 2012. Simms signed a future/reserve contract on December 31, 2012.\n2013 season.\nSimms received playing time during the preseason against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2013. He completed all five of his passes for 73 yards. Simms played the following week against the New York Giants completing 6 of his 10 pass attempts for 120 yards and a touchdown. On August 29, the final preseason contest, Simms started and played the entire game against the Philadelphia Eagles. He completed 33 of his 44 pass attempts for 285 yards.\nSimms threw his first career touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Cumberland in a Week 11 37–14 loss to the Buffalo Bills. During Week 13 against the Miami Dolphins, Simms came in relief of starter Geno Smith in the third quarter; he completed 9 of his 18 passes for 79 yards with an interception and a lost fumble in the Jets' 3–23 loss. Simms appeared in three games of the 2013 season and finished the year with 156 passing yards.\n2014 season.\nSimms, an exclusive rights free agent, was re-signed by the Jets on January 13, 2014. He was released on August 30, 2014, during the team's final roster cuts and signed to the team's practice squad a day later. He was promoted to the active roster on November 1, 2014. He appeared in one game, a 24–10 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, with the Jets in the 2014 season. He was 3-of-8 for 39 yards.\nSimms signed a one-year contract to remain with the Jets on December 30, 2014. However, after the team drafted Bryce Petty and signed undrafted rookie Jake Heaps, Simms requested his release and was granted it on May 28, 2015.\nBuffalo Bills.\nThe Buffalo Bills claimed Simms off waivers on May 29, 2015. Simms was not expected to compete in the three-way competition for the starting quarterback position (Tyrod Taylor, EJ Manuel, and Matt Cassel) but was in the mix as a potential backup quarterback and was given the start for the Bills' final preseason game against the Detroit Lions on September 3. Late in that game, Simms, while trying to break a tackle, inadvertently threw the ball 20 yards backward, creating a loose-ball situation and setting the Lions up for the game-winning score. Simms was released the next day.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn September 7, 2015, Simms was signed to the Atlanta Falcons' practice squad. On September 3, 2016, he was waived by the Falcons as part of final roster cuts and was signed to their practice squad the next day.\nOn May 15, 2017, Simms re-signed with the Falcons. He was waived/injured on September 2, 2017, and placed on injured reserve. He was released with an injury settlement on September 5, 2017.\nAtlanta Legends.\nOn November 27, 2018, he was selected in the second round by the Atlanta Legends in the 2019 AAF QB Draft.\nSimms started the 2019 AAF season opener against the Orlando Apollos, during which he completed 15 of 28 passes for 126 yards and two interceptions in the 40–6 loss.\nAtlanta Falcons (second stint).\nOn August 3, 2019, Simms was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to replace injured Kurt Benkert. He was placed on injured reserve on August 31, 2019."

The race saw Italy beat Norway by 0.4 seconds on the finish line, with Finland finishing third. The three had followed each other closely through the first three rounds, but in the fourth heat, Silvio Fauner and Bjørn Dæhlie managed to break with Jari Isometsä. The event was the best attended of any in the games, with an estimated 100,000 spectators at the stadium and along the tracks. About 203,000 people applied for the 31,000 seats at the stadium, and some 75,000 ultimately watched from the track-side.\nCourse.\nThe event was held at Birkebeineren Ski Stadium in Lillehammer, Norway.\nRace.\nAfter the start at 10:30, Sture Sivertsen of Norway was the fastest and was in lead when leaving the stadium. After a few kilometers, Sture Sivertsen, Norway, Mika Myllylä of Finland, Jan Ottosson of Sweden and Maurilio De Zolt of Italy had broken away from the rest of the teams. Sivertsen was in lead for four kilometers, after which he let Mika Myllylä of Finland pull when the group was approaching the stadium. At half-distance through the stadium, Sivertsen and Myllylä had gained a small gap on the other two. Sivertsen regained the lead in the hill leading from the stadium, and was followed closely by Myllylä. By seven kilometers, de Zolt had fallen slightly behind, while Ottosson stiffened and was not able to keep up with the other three. At the first change, Sivertsen and Myllylä were even, while de Zolt was 12 seconds behind, while Ottosson was 57 seconds behind. About one minute after that, a group of Jeremias Wigger of Switzerland, Torald Rein of Germany, Nikolai Ivanov of Kazakhstan, Luboš Buchta of the Czech Republic and Andrey Kirilov of Russia.\nThe second stage became a race between Vegard Ulvang of Norway, Harri Kirvesniemi of Finland and Marco Albarello of Italy. Ulvang set off in a fast pace, with Kirvesniemi and Albarello following suit. Part of the way through the lap, Kirvesniemi attempted to pull, but the other two followed suit. Two kilometers before reaching the exchange, Kirvesniemi broke his ski pole, but was able to follow along. In the approach to the stadium, Ulvang looked like he would exchange first, but Albarello cut the corner and was able to exchange just before Ulvang. Behind the first three teams, Alexey Prokurorov of Russia was one and a half minute behind.\nNorway's strategy was to pull away with Thomas Alsgaard in the third heat. However, he was not able to, and ended instead dragging Jari Räsänen of Finland and Giorgio Vanzetta of Italy. After six kilometers, Alsgaard attempted to pull away, but the pair behind him would not let him. This caused Alsgaard to stiffen, and he had difficulties following Vanzetta and Räsänen through the rest of the race. Behind the first three teams, Gennadiy Lazutin of Russia was two minutes behind.\nThe last lap started as a race between Silvio Fauner of Italy, Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway and Jari Isometsä of Finland. After a few kilometers, Dæhlie and Fauner were able to create a gap back to Isometsä, and the rest of the relay was a duel between the Norwegian and the Italian. For most of the race, Dæhlie was ahead. About two kilometers before the finish, both stopped, wanting the other to pull, and neither wanting to start the sprint. In the ascent towards the final straight stretch, Dæhlie lay right in the back of Fauner. before the finish line, Dæhli switched tracks, but was not able to keep up with Fauner, who finished 0.4 seconds before Dæhlie. Finland finished third, 1 minutes and 0.6 seconds behind Italy. Germany and Russia had a fight for the fourth place, with Johann Mühlegg of Germany finishing three seconds ahead of Mikhail Botvinov of Russia."

A left-handed pitcher, Gross stood tall and weighed . He attended Michigan State University.\nGross was signed by the Cincinnati Reds as an amateur free agent and began his professional career in 1950 in their farm system. His professional career was put on hold in 1953 due to military service. Resuming professional baseball in 1954, he was promoted to the major leagues in 1955 making his debut on July 21 against the Philadelphia Phillies.\nGross appeared in 145 games over his MLB career, including 37 games as a starting pitcher. Overall, he won 20 of 42 decisions (.476), striking out 230 batters and giving up 400 hits in 398 innings of work. His career earned run average was 3.73. He had a stellar record in minor league baseball, compiling a won-lost record of 68–39.\nAfter the 1957 season, Gross was traded to the Pirates for right-handed pitcher Bob Purkey. Gross went 6–8 (3.82) in 66 games for the Pirates, while Purkey went on to become a three-time National League All-Star, winning 103 games for Cincinnati over seven seasons, including a 23–5 (2.81) campaign in 1962.\nGross died August 10, 2017, at 86 years old."

However, the athletes had to shift their training to Norefjell by 9 February after more problems with the snow resulted in the hill \"[looking] almost like a skating rink\" according to the official report. It took a further week of work by the military, volunteers and hired help to spread of snow resulting in a new snow depth of around .\nThe event eventually took place as scheduled on 20 February, a day after the men's slalom races. It was the final alpine skiing event of the Games. There were a total of 26 gates on the women's course. A total of 14 National Olympic Committees were represented at the event by 40 skiers.\nAndrea Mead Lawrence, representing the United States, and Dagmar Rom, representing Austria, were considered to be the favourites in the event. However, both skiers suffered falls on their first run, with Mead Lawrence placing fourth and Rom finishing last, effectively putting the latter out of contention. Mead Lawrence managed to post the best time of the second runs, enough to win the gold medal. It was her second gold medal in Oslo after her giant slalom victory. By winning the title, she became the first American skier to win two gold medals at the same Olympics. Ossi Reichert, who led the field after the first run, finished two seconds behind Mead Lawrence in the second run and ended up second overall. Reichert's teammate Annemarie Buchner won bronze.\nResults.\nThe official results as published by the Organising Committee for the VI Olympic Winter Games were as follows:"

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2011 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2011 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\n2011 Consensus All-America team.\nThe following players are recognized as the 2011 Consensus All-Americans:\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn February 22, 2011, CoSIDA and \"ESPN The Magazine\" announced the 2011 Academic All-America team, with Matt Howard headlining the University Division as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.

        "title": "Four Rugby Boys",
        "text": "The 1910s saw an attempt to turn four young Tibetans – the Four Rugby Boys – into the vanguard of \"modernisers\" through the medium of an English public school education.\nLungshar, a Tibetan high official, escorted four sons of Tibetan \"respectable families\" – W. N. Kyipup, K. K. Möndö, Sonam Gonpa Gongkar and R. D. Ringang – to England, in 1913, so they could be educated at a public school. After completing their studies at Rugby School, each of the Rugby Four received professional training in a particular field and eventually returned to Tibet.\nAccording to Lungshar's son Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, \"the experiment was not a great success.\" Historian Alastair Lamb concurs: “the experiment […] can hardly be described as a success\", adding that the boys were side-tracked by the Tibetan establishment and \"made no significant contribution in later life to the development of Tibet\".\nThe experiment.\nIn August 1912, the Dalai Lama proposed that some \"energetic and clever sons of respectable families\" in Tibet should be given \"first-class educations at Oxford College, London\". The Indian government requested that Basil Gould, who was about to go on leave back to England, should guide the four young Tibetan boys (known as the \"Rugby Boys\") on their journey to the United Kingdom and assist them through the difficult first few weeks of their journey away from the roof of the world. In early 1913 the youths selected turned up at the British Trade Agency at Gyantse, where their companion, a Tibetan official called Lungshar, presented Gould with a request from the Dalai Lama for four first-class educations at Oxford College, London. The four boys were W. N. Kyipup (16), K. K. Möndö, a monk, (17), Gongkar (16) and R. D. Ringang (11).\nThe Tibetan Boys settled down at Farnham, where they began to learn English under the supervision of the Berlitz School of Languages. It was decided that Rugby would be the best place for their schooling.\nWangdu Norbu Kyipup.\nKyipup studied telegraphy, surveying and cartography. On returning to Tibet, he was assigned the task of developing a telegraph network but failed and was given other assignments.\nKhyenrab Kunzang Mondo.\nMöndö studied mining engineering in Grimethorpe and mineralogy in Camborne. Back in Tibet, he went into mineral ore prospecting but was accused of disturbing spirits and spoiling crops and so had to give up prospecting.\nSonam Gonpa Gongkar.\nGongkar went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in London and then on to a short period of officer training with the Indian Army as he was expected to later reorganise the Tibetan Army. He was attached to the Northumberland Fusiliers for a short period. However, for political reasons, he was assigned to a frontier post in Kham. He died from pneumonia in 1917.\nRigzin Dorje Ringang.\nThe youngest of the lot, Ringang, stayed in England for a longer period and studied electrical engineering at the Universities of London and Birmingham. After returning home, he assembled a hydro-electric power station in Lhasa called Dodri from equipment brought over from England, and laid an electric line to the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Lhasa, a colossal undertaking. Of the Rugby Four, he was the only one to have achieved something. However, after his death, the plant stopped being maintained for lack of money and fell into disrepair. Peter Aufschnaiter wrote in his book \"Eight Years in Tibet,\" \nThe outcome.\nAs Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, Lungshar's son, remarked to British radio operator Robert W. Ford, \"The experiment was not a great success\" but, according to Ford, the fault did not lie entirely with the boys. Alastair Lamb claims that they were effectively side-tracked by the Tibetan establishment. The experiment was not to be repeated during the remaining period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent.\nTibetologist Alex McKay observes that the three surviving Rugby boys formed, together with their fellow countrymen that had been educated in British India or at Frank Ludlow's English school at Gyantse (1923–1926), \"a growing circle of generally progressive thinkers, in whose company Europeans visitors felt comfortable\" and who were recognised by the British cadre as \"a major propaganda channel\".\nIn 1946, when Austrian war prisoner Heinrich Harrer reached Lhasa, there was only one of the Rugby boys still alive, namely Kyipup, then a high official at the foreign ministry, whose meeting he recalls in his 1954 book \"Seven Years in Tibet\". In the introduction to the book, writer Peter Fleming calls him \"the only survivor of a sensible experiment that the Tibetans never got around to repeating.\""

        "title": "Cycling in Malta",
        "text": "The popularity of cycling in Malta as a sport, a means of commuting, and as a way of exploring the island of Malta is on the increase. In recent years, the Maltese authorities, most notably the Malta Transport Authority, have worked hard to make this activity more accessible and safer .\nHistory.\nCycling is firmly ingrained in Maltese cultural heritage . As you would expect in an island whose official religion is Roman Catholic and where an estimated 95 percent profess to belong to this religion, cycling also features prominently in religious celebrations.\nMost notably, the village feast of Zabbar, which is held annually on the first Sunday after the 8 September, features a motorcycle and bicycle pilgrimage each starting from Mosta and Rabat respectively. This is because the Zabbar church is dedicated to “Our Lady of Grace” (Madonna tal-Grazzja), who is also the patron of cyclists.\nCycling conditions in Malta.\nThe island's small size – Malta's land area is just over – makes its easily accessible by bike.\nIndeed, an increasing number of areas in the capital, Valletta, and elsewhere are being pedestrianized, making cycling the ideal means of visiting them. Despite its size, however, Malta's topography is quite hilly, and cycling may be quite challenging in some areas.\nCycle lanes and paths.\nIn 2006, the Malta Transport Authority introduced bicycle lanes to promote and encourage more people to use bicycles as a greener alternative to private car use. although cyclists do not normally use the lanes due to unsafe surfaces, mainly attributed to poor planning. Although initially motorists did not always respect these lanes, the situation has improved significantly. Cyclists are also allowed to use bus lanes. However, cycling is not allowed in tunnels. The few cycle lanes tend to end and start abruptly. They rarely follow regular commuting routes and do not seem to be maintained very regularly. Sliema local council forbids cycling along its promenade However, despite citing the support of sustainable and non-polluting modes of transport, there is no cohesive and specific national programme aimed at encouraging cycling.\nOn the road conditions.\nConditions for cyclists on the road are improving although cyclists should remain wary as to which routes to use and which to avoid. Cycling on main roads may at times be dangerous. Due to Malta's party scene and poor drunk driving record, early morning rides during weekends are particularly dangerous. Children on bikes and users of motorized bicycles are legally required to wear cycling helmets.\nRoad conditions themselves are improving although potholes and lack of proper surfacing, especially in smaller towns, remain an issue.\nBicycle parking.\nThe Malta Transport Authority has installed a number of bicycle parking bays in various spots around the island, particularly, in tourist areas.\nWhile bicycle theft in Malta is not high, the usual precautions of locking the bike should be taken.\nCycling and Malta’s public transport.\nWith no trains and no underground, buses are the main means of public transport in Malta. The Maltese Government has privatized the public bus system. It is currently not possible to transport bicycles on public buses. However, it is possible to schedule the transportation of bicycles to any locations in Malta."

        "text": "David Webster (born 11 September 1987 in East Melbourne) is an Australian national champion rowing coxswain who steered Australian crews at six World Rowing Championships and won two world championship titles in 2010 and 2011.\nClub and state rowing.\nWebster was educated at Melbourne Grammar School where he took up rowing. His senior rowing was done from the Melbourne University Boat Club.\nFrom 2011 to 2016 Webster was selected to represent Victoria in the senior men's eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He steered the Victorian eight to King's cup victories in 2015 and 2016 and his in-boat call of the 2016 victory can be heard here.\nInternational representative rowing.\nWebster's Australian representative debut was as cox of the men's eight selected to compete at the 2009 World Rowing U23 Championships in Racice. That crew placed fourth.\nIn 2010, Webster's first year in senior representative Australian crews, he experienced World Championship success at Lake Karapiro 2010 in the stern of the lightweight Australian men's eight – a silver medal – and in the bow of a heavyweight coxed pair rowed by Chris Morgan and Dominic Grimm to a gold medal and their first World Championship title. The following year at Bled 2011 Webster coxed both those same Australian boats but the results were reversed. The Australian men's lightweight eight with six rowers returning from 2010 raced their final to perfection coming through the field from the 500mark, sitting second at the 1000 and the 1500, and running down the Italians in the last 200m to take the gold by 0.17seconds, winning Webster his second World Championship title. Webster recorded and published his victorious race call in the LM8+. The pair containing Webster's Victorian King's Cup teammates Will Lockwood and James Chapman led at all three marks but were pipped in the run to the finish by an Italian pair winning Webster in the bow his second silver World Championship medal.\nWebster and half the rowing members of the 2011 World Champion LM8+ were again selected (with four new members up the bow end) to race for Australia at the 2012 World Rowing Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. They placed fifth.\nWebster's chief Australian coxing competitor – his New South Wales rival Toby Lister – retired from international representation in 2013 and Webster picked up the ropes of the Australian men's senior eight at that point. Being the first year of a new Olympiad the eight was full of new faces and raced at the World Rowing Cup I of 2013 in Sydney and at the 2013 World Rowing Championships in Chungju where they failed to make the A final and finished seventh overall.\nThe 2014 World Rowing Cup I was in Sydney early in 2014, a number of experienced Australian seniors had returned to the eight and with Webster in the stern they won at that regatta. A second developmental Australian eight raced in that WRC I final in Sydney and it was steered by Webster's younger brother Timothy Webster. Tim Webster also coxed at Melbourne Uni Boat Club, earned a scholarship like David to the Victorian Institute of Sport, and was in the Australian senior squad with David in 2013 and 2014. In the Australian senior eight David Webster placed sixth at the World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne a few months later in 2014 and at the 2014 World Championships in Amsterdam they placed seventh overall.\nWebster's last national selection was in 2015. He coxed the Australian men's eight at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne and at the Olympic qualifications the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France. They finished ninth overall and did not qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics via this regatta. Webster again coxed the Victorian King's Cup eight in 2016 but when a selected Australian men's senior eight made a last ditch Olympic qualification attempt in May 2016 at Lucerne, the US-based Australian cox Stuart Sim was on the rudder.\nAccolades.\nWebster was selected as captain of the national Australian rowing squad in 2013. He won a Victoria University High Performance Sport Scholarship in 2013 and was named as Victoria University's Male Sports Person of the Year in 2013. He studied a B. Sport and Recreation Management at VU."

He represented Fiji and Auckland. He made his name during three wonderfully successful years at the English club Workington Town, where his performances were so impressive he is now in the club's Hall of Fame.\nBackground.\nPickering was born in Fiji, he was a pupil at Onehunga High School, Auckland, New Zealand.\nPlaying career.\nA Richmond junior, Pickering played for Auckland, and had a New Zealand national rugby league team trial in 1992 however was not selected. He played for Fiji at the 1992 Pacific Cup.\nHe made his first grade début for Workington Town in the 1992/93 English season in the old division 3 competition. He helped Town into second place behind Keighley Cougars, and to the final of the Divisional Premiership competition, when they were narrowly beaten by Featherstone Rovers, from the division above.\nIn 1993–94, Pickering was the driving force behind Workington Town doing the Division Two and Premiership double as they won the league in emphatic style, and beat at Old Trafford 30–22.\nBack in the game's elite, Workington enjoyed an impressive 1994-95 campaign finishing ninth out of 16 and reaching the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup. Once again, Pickering was the side's shining light with even the finest prop forwards in the game struggling to come to terms with the Fijian's swashbuckling style of play.\nHe then spent three seasons with the Canterbury Bulldogs, playing in nine first grade matches before a horrid run of injuries practically ended his career.\nPickering then spent a season each at Sydney City and Castleford Tigers (Heritage No. 760) before returning to the Canterbury Bulldogs for the 2000 season.\nLater years.\nIn 2006 Pickering was made the chairman of the Australian Fijian Rugby League. As of 2011 he currently still serves in this position.\nIn 2008, when Pickering was serving as the player-coach of the Australian Fijians side, he was inducted into the Workington Town hall of fame.\nPickering has previously served as the Sydney Roosters under-20s coach and the Canterbury Bulldogs under-18s coach."

The creek has important local Aboriginal spiritual significance, and parts of the creek are popular sites for recreation(various).\nEnvironmental condition.\nIt has been classed as being in \"moderate condition\" by Melbourne Water, but it is becoming increasingly urbanised as new developments extend across the catchment from Hoppers Crossing and surrounding areas. This new development poses a major risk to the health of the river, as does the poor quality of both the creek's water and streamside vegetation along significant parts of the waterway.\nA recent defence force study of PFAS contamination on defence bases has indicated some groundwater contamination from sites at the partially decommissioned Williams Landing airforce base. Hydrological studies show that this groundwater flows into Skeleton Creek, and caution should be taken with consuming fish and eels from this creek."

Its main aim is to popularise tennis in all parts of Sri Lanka as a professional sport and to produce top tennis players from Sri Lanka. \nHistory.\nTennis in Sri Lanka was introduced during the British Rule with the founding of the Ceylon Lawn Tennis Association in 1915. The CLTA was originally headquartered at the ‘Challet’ in Nuwara Eliya and was conducting the Nationals on clay courts located at where Hill Club now sits. CLTC held tournaments in Colombo too, especially at the Colombo Lawn Club. The Governor of Ceylon, Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers, was the first president of the association. From establishment of the association until 1946, there was a practice at the CLTA to have the Governor of Ceylon, as administrative head of the British colony, as its President. The first Sri Lankan to become CLTA president was Dr. C. H. Gunasekara in 1947 until 1949. It takes pride as being the oldest national tennis association in Asia.\nList of Sri Lankan presidents.\nIncluded:\nList of governor presidents.\nIncluded:\nTennis in Sri Lanka.\nTennis as a sport has not garnered the popular support of the common folk in Sri Lanka, whose first love in sports is still cricket but SLTA is contributing all its resources to make tennis a popular game.

        "title": "Northeastern University Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Northeastern University Rugby Football Club (or NURFC or Maddogs) is a college rugby union team representing Northeastern University. The club competes in the Liberty Conference of Division 1-A Rugby and is governed by USA Rugby.\nThe Northeastern Maddogs has approximately 70 members from all over the United States, and from countries all over the world, including South Africa, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, China and Japan. The Maddogs field a competitive team every year, and have been nationally ranked.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe club was founded by a Northeastern University student and rugby enthusiast named Bob Hubbard in 1984. He, along with 14 other students were the first team ever fielded by the Northeastern University Rugby Club. This first incarnation was not affiliated with Northeastern University, its only connection to the school was its players being students. The team's practices were held on a small triangle of dirt on Huntington Avenue across from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which is now the Wentworth Institute of Technology athletic complex.\nIn 1985, the club became more organized as another key leader named Tony Kalaijakis emerged. Kalaijakis turned the rag-tag group into a team, under him the club drafted a constitution and elected leaders yearly. The team lobbied for school recognition, hoping to become an official Northeastern club, but was denied. Disappointed by the university's decision, but wishing to maintain a connection with the school, the team chose as its mascot, the MadDog; instead of the traditional mascot of Northeastern University, the Husky.\nNERFU (1987-2010).\nIn spring of 1987, aided by Northeastern University Professor Peter Eastman, the team became an official club of Northeastern. The club then hired its first coach, Jay Dacey of the Mystic River Rugby Club. Competing in its first Beast of the East Tournament, the Maddogs went undefeated and won the 1987 tournament. The following fall the Maddogs joined NERFU Division I and made the play-offs in their inaugural year.\nThe NURFC competed in New England Rugby Football Union College Division I from 1987 to 2010, playing against teams such as Army and Boston College. Dartmouth, Harvard, and Yale competed in NERFU until fall 2009, leaving to join the new Ivy League Conference. In the years since its creation, Northeastern Rugby often competed in the Beast of the East rugby tournament, winning it multiple times in recent years including in 2005 with a 21-0 win over Buffalo in the tournament final.\nECRC (2011-2016).\nIn 2011 Northeastern along with Boston College, UMass Amherst, University of Connecticut, Middlebury College, UAlbany, and Southern Connecticut State University joined to form the East Coast Rugby Conference. In their inaugural season, Northeastern went undefeated scoring an average of 37 points and allowing an average of 4 points per game. Their undefeated season led them to the National Championship Round of 16, where they lost to Stony Brook University 24-22. Northeastern's fall 2012 season resulted in a 5-2 record, with losses to Boston College and Middlebury, to finish 3rd in the conference.\nNortheastern, as the winner of the 2012 ECRC Sevens Tournament, qualified for the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, in College Station, Texas. Assigned to Pool A with Life University, Colorado State, and Wisconsin, Northeastern went 2-1 with their only loss coming from the reigning champion Life University, to advance to the bowl bracket. Northeastern was eventually knocked out of the tournament by Cal Poly. After their strong showing at the National Sevens Championships, Northeastern received an invitation to the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship tournament at PPL Park in Philadelphia, broadcast live on NBC. Northeastern finished as winners of the bowl in their first appearance at the CRC's. In 2014, Northeastern finished as a runner up for the plate at the CRC's which represented an improvement on the year prior.\nAfter 2014 the club lost many of its talented players and went into a rebuilding stage. Head coach Edward Tubridy was hired to lead the maddogs. In 2016, the maddogs accepted an invitation to play in the Las Vegas Invitational rugby sevens tournament. The Maddogs played against teams from across the country and posted a 2-3 record on the week. In the year following they returned to Las Vegas and posted a 3-2 record beating Wheeling Jesuit University, Utah Valley University and Montana State University. After this tournament the Maddogs continued to build in confidence and reached the final of the Armory Sevens at American International College beating University of New Hampshire, University of Connecticut and University of Massachusetts Amherst. They missed out on a bid to the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships by losing to American International College in the final. Northeastern finished the season 21-7-3.\nLiberty Conference (2017-present).\nIn 2017, Northeastern were invited to join the Liberty Conference; a new competitive league of Division 1-A Rugby teams. The conference includes 18 different Universities from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. The conference itself has 3 sub-conference divisions; Empire, New England and I-95. Northeastern compete in the New England division against University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Connecticut, Tufts University, University of Rhode Island and Fairfield University. Northeastern stepped up and produced one of their best records in program history. The Maddogs finished 5-0 in conference play winning the Liberty Conference New England Division. Outside of conference play, Northeastern beat Boston College by 3 points in a very close match and came out on top against the University of New Hampshire by 61 points. To end the season, Northeastern faced SUNY Cortland in the Liberty Conference Challenge. SUNY Cortland had just won the Liberty Empire division and proved to be a tough opponent to the Maddogs. However, Northeastern had an impressive performance which saw them win the game by 32 points. The Maddogs took home the bowl trophy to cap off an impressive season which saw them finish with a record of 8-0 and a national ranking of 32."

        "text": "The Otago Rugby League Team are New Zealand rugby league team that represents the Otago Rugby League. They are known as the Whalers. In the past they have been nicknamed the Storm, the Raiders and the 45er's.\nHistory.\nIn 1908 Otago was involved in some of the first provincial matches in the country when it played a home and away series against Southland. The first game was played at Caledonia Ground in Dunedin on 3 October and used goalposts which were rented from the Otago Rugby Union. The Southland side included Ned Hughes, a former All Black. Otago won the match 11–8. A return match was played at Queens Park, Invercargill on 7 October. Southland was able to win the match 30–14 and draw the series.\nThe Otago side was made up of fullback D Bannantyne, three-quarters J Harrhy, WR Kirk and G Ogg, five-eighths EO Nees and P Walker, halfback J Coulter, and forwards J Bryant, E Manley (captain), T Mockford, W Harridge, J Campbell and Larkins.\nAlthough rugby league was played in Southland over the next two years, the code largely ceased to exist in Otago. An Auckland team toured New Zealand in 1910 playing seven matches including one against a combined Otago/Southland team on the Caledonian Ground. Auckland won the match by 30 points to 18 before a crowd of 1,500. Rugby league in the area was revived again in 1924, following the announcement by the New Zealand Rugby League that a Test was to be held in Dunedin that year. After securing a ground literally only days before the Test, due to blockades at different venues by the Otago Rugby Football Union, the Test went ahead at Tahuna Park in front of more than 14,000 spectators. The ORFU tried to sway the public away from the game and arranged a provincial Otago-Canterbury match at the same time. However the public sympathy went to the fledgling code and with it came the formation of the Otago Rugby Football League that year, chaired by Dunedin dentist, John Cooper.\n In 1926 Otago embarked on a northern tour and they played a match against the Auckland side at Carlaw Park on August 7 who only one week earlier had beaten the full New Zealand side 52-32 before their departure for England. Otago played well in their 14-4 loss. Otago then travelled south to Hamilton where they played the South Auckland team which would now be better known as Waikato on August 11. They won by 30 points to 12 over the local side at Hinemoa Park, Hamilton. In 1927 Auckland toured again and played Otago at the Caledonian Ground on September 17. Auckland won the match 20-13 before a crowd of 2,000.\nUntil the stock market crashed in 1929, the ORFL had become one of the most powerful league provincial bodies in New Zealand after its leading administrator Harry Divers founded the Art Union lottery leading to an abundance of wealth. Subsequently, the ORFL bought up a big section of land in South Dunedin, which was later subdivided, including a ground originally called Colossal Park after one of the lotteries. It soon became known as Tonga Park, which remains to this day. The ORFL also loaned the NZRL 820 pounds in 1927 to keep it out of the red as well as hosting a Test the following year at the Caledonian Ground, which by now was under a five-year lease of the code. In addition there were five clubs (Athletic, Christian Brothers, City, Kaikorai and Kaitangita) that began and in the case of Kaikorai and Kaitangita were only short lived.\nAs a provincial team, Otago was a strong side and proved to be a strong rival against its fellow South Island provincial teams West Coast and Canterbury. Four local players – Bert Eckhoff (1928), Herbert Pearce (1930), Harry Thomas (1925) and Alf Townsend (1928) all became New Zealand representatives, while others such as Gordon Blazey, Ted McKewen and brothers, John and Tom O'Connor played for the South Island against the North Island. After four glorious years, the turning point for the ORFL began in 1928 when the test at the Caledonian Ground was marred by fighting by the New Zealand and English teams, causing wide negative press in the local media. The following year the share market crashed causing local players to relocate outside Dunedin in search of work. Perhaps the biggest tragedy came in 1931 when Divers died. A most popular man who had been involved in other sports in Dunedin, Divers had held all of the main roles within the ORFL at one stage or another – President, Secretary and Treasurer, in addition to being responsible for keeping a high profile of the game in Dunedin. Falling playing numbers saw the ORFL go into recess in 1934.\nAfter 19 years of no league in Dunedin, a Christian Brothers club reunion in 1952 together with radio interviews between broadcaster Ray Cody and former Halifax player and one time Maori All Black, Enoka Macdonald, helped to reform the ORFL the following year. A large board of control (which was chaired by Cody) together with a schoolboys board (led by the future ORFL Life Member George Stuart) and a Referees Association along with four clubs – Athletic, Caledonian, Celtic and Western Suburbs all started up in the first year. The following year in 1954 saw the beginning of New Zealand's first University rugby league club along with the Kia Toa Club. Both 1953 and 1954 saw the South Island play in Dunedin against international touring team and together with a renewed interest, the ORFL also like their 1920s counterpart was able to secure a five-year lease on a ground as its headquarters. In this case it was the scene of the 1924 Test match, Tahuna Park. A year later in September 1955 Celtic played Athletic under lights at Tahuna Park and in doing so created history by becoming the first ever rugby league match in New Zealand to do so.\nThe ORFL gained a further three Kiwis over the next decade in Jimmy Haig (1947), John Walshe (1965) and Trevor Patrick (1969). In 1966 the first televised league match in Dunedin was held when Otago played the West Coast at the Caledonian Ground and two years later, the ORFL hosted a national Quarangular tournament between home side Otago along with Canterbury, West Coast and Wellington.\nThe arrival of ex Auckland and West Coast players in Dunedin in the mid 1970s helped Otago win a provincial tournament in Palmerston North in 1975. The following year rugby league began in Southland for the first time since 1910 when the Invercargill-based Leopards Club began to compete in the Otago competition. Two years later, the ORFL now became known as the Otago-Southland Rugby League and soon the clubs from the deep south began to take control over their more northern rivals. The amalgamation between the two provinces was separated in 1985, so that it once again became the ORFL. In 1993 an Otago Invitation side, including Mark Elia and Francis Leota, played New Zealand Māori. The Māori won 39–18.\nIn 1995 Otago recorded their first win over Canterbury in 35 years. In 1998 Otago defeated West Coast for the first time since 1927. They went on to make the final of the National Provincial Competition Second Division before losing 56–10 to the Bay of Plenty. Another triumph that year was having primary, intermediate and secondary school competitions run that year.\nOtago won the Rugby League Cup in 2002 when they defeated Tasman on 8 September. Otago continued to hold the cup for another three years before losing to a Midlands side in the North Island. Dwindling playing numbers caused the ORFL to go into recess for the third time in 2008, before it re-emerged again in 2010. Just before it went into recess Otago won a centenary match against Southland in 2008, defeating them 64–4. In 2014, four clubs play league in Dunedin, which includes Kia Toa and University, both of whom celebrate their 60th anniversary years, during this season."

        "text": "John Donovan (born September 11, 1974) is an American football coach who currently is the senior offensive analyst for the Florida Gators. He most recently the senior analyst for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He has been an assistant in the NFL and in four of the Power Five college football conferences (ACC, SEC, Big-10 and PAC-12). He was a defensive back at Johns Hopkins from 1993 to 1996.\nCoaching career.\nEarly years.\nDonovan played three years for the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football team. During his freshmen year, the defensive coordinator was Chip Kelly, and Donovan often served as the scout team quarterback. He later started as a defensive back. While at Johns Hopkins, Donovan worked as a summer intern for the Carolina Panthers. Shortly after, he moved on to take an assistant secondary coaching spot for the Villanova Wildcats football team in 1997. That season, the Wildcats posted a 12–1 record and were ranked number one in Division I-AA. He later moved on to finish earn his master's degree from Georgia Tech, while simultaneously serving as an assistant coach under head coach George O'Leary. He was temporarily promoted to coach the running backs in the 2000 Peach Bowl after Ralph Friedgen's departure to Maryland.\nMaryland.\nBetween 2001 and 2004, after following Friedgen to Maryland, he primarily served as a recruiting coordinator for the Terrapins. In 2005, Donovan was promoted to the running backs coach. He moved to the quarterback coach for the next two seasons, before being reassigned back to the running backs in 2008 amidst multiple coaching changes in the coaching staff. Friedgen himself was later removed as head coach of the Terrapins in December 2010, leaving many Maryland assistants to look for jobs elsewhere. With offensive coordinator James Franklin moving to take the head coaching position at Vanderbilt, Donovan was assigned with the play calling duties for the Military Bowl, Friedgen's final game as coach. The Terrapins won the game 51–20, at that time the most points ever scored by Maryland in a bowl game.\nVanderbilt.\nOn January 13, 2011, Donovan was named as offensive coordinator and running backs coach for the Vanderbilt Commodores football team, rejoining former Maryland offensive coordinator James Franklin. These were \"three of the most productive offensive seasons in the program's modern-era history\". Under Donovan's direction, RB Zac Stacy ran for 1,193 yards in 2011 and 1,141 yards in 2012 to become the first Vanderbilt player with consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in program history. Stacy earned second team All-SEC honors and was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in 2013. Donovan's offensive units earned three of the top four total yardage marks in school history dating back to 1945, gaining at least 4,400 yards each season, including a school record 4,936 yards in 2012. The Commodores averaged 30.0 points per game in 2012, marking the first time in school history they averaged 30 or more points per game, and followed with another program record of 30.1 points per game in 2013.\"\nPenn State.\nIn January 2014, Donovan followed Franklin to Penn State as the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. During his time at Penn State, Donovan coached TEs Jesse James and Mike Gesicki, both of whom were drafted into the NFL. While Donovan was the OC, Saquon Barkley won the BTN.com Freshman of the Year. \nNevertheless, Donovan came under heavy criticism from the Nittany Lion fan base for questionable play calling. In November 2015, he was fired by Penn State. Following the firing, a former graduate assistant who worked on the staff during the 2014 season claimed on Twitter that the offense was largely designed by the \"HFC\" and PennLive.com's David Jones wrote an article headlined \"John Donovan was scapegoat for rebuild that will take longer than fans can accept.\" However, Penn State won the Big Ten Championship the year after Donovan was fired, as new OC hire Joe Moorhead implemented his own system and employed a more accurate, more mobile quarterback, Trace McSorley.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn March 21, 2016, Donovan was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars to be offensive quality control coach. After the 2016 season, he was named offensive assistant. Former Jaguars' offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett credited Donovan as \"instrumental to the Jaguars' red zone plan\" in their 2017 AFC Championship appearance season, which included a game that they went a perfect 6-for-6 in the red zone. Following the 2018 season, Donovan was named the assistant running backs coach. In 2019, while being coached by Donovan and Terry Robiskie, RB Leonard Fournette had his most productive season as a professional.\nWashington.\nOn January 10, 2020, the Washington Huskies' new head coach, Jimmy Lake, added Donovan to his coaching staff as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\nOn November 7, 2021, Donovan was fired by the Washington Huskies. The hire was met with substantial criticism, and Donovan's tenure at Washington was very miserable. \nGreen Bay Packers.\nOn April 18, 2022, Donovan was hired by the Green Bay Packers as their senior analyst.\nPersonal life.\nDonovan married his wife Stacey (née Spicer) in May 2005. The couple has three children named John Patrick, Cate, and Shea. All four of Donovan's grandparents were born in Ireland.\nDonovan is a supporter of the New York Mets."

        "text": "Ooty Golf Course is located in the town of Ooty in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The golf course is set at an altitude of 7200 feet. It is owned by the Gymkhana Club in Ooty. The course extends over 193.56 acres and comprises 18 holes.\nHistory.\nColonel Fane Sewell, the then Secretary of the Blue Mountains Tennis and Cricket Club, formed the golf course in March 1891, which initially comprised nine holes. Golf enthusiasts formed a golf club nearby, called the Gymkhana club in September 1896. In 1929, hydraulic systems were installed to pump water from a nearby stream using a hydraulic ram for storage in a water tank. Feeder pipes were installed in 1970 to water the golf course.\nFeatures.\nAs the air is thinner in Ooty due to the high altitude, the balls travel comparatively farther. The course is surrounded by thick forests. The golf course contains many varieties of trees like rhododendron, oak, aromatic eucalyptus, and fir which add to the scenic atmosphere. Nine holes out of the eighteen holes are shot blind as the course has a rolling landscape. This is also the reason for the green being not visible from the tee-off area, though there are guide posts which help the players to the right direction. The fifth hole rises about 200 feet above the fourth hole and hence is considered the toughest hole of the course. The Ooty Golf Club offers fairways that are lush but also tight. The greens are well manicured and large.\nFox hunt.\na golfer at the course also has the possibility of running into an ongoing fox hunt at the 13th hole. Beagles and Foxhounds are still trained today to take part in the hunt. The fox hunt in the area dates back to 1847 and can be witnessed in the course even today. The greens are fenced in order to prevent other wild animals from straying onto the course.\nTournaments.\nAn annual amateur golf championship is held during summer, which dates back to 1906. The first winner of the championship was Major Quinton. Another golfer, R.B. Carrick, won the championship nine times between 1914 and 1929. In recent years several other major tournaments have been organized on the golf course.\nFacilities.\nAccommodation for golfers is provided by the golf club with an annex with ten rooms and six huts. Other facilities include indoor games like billiards, cards and table tennis, swimming pool, bar and a restaurant."

A former minor league infielder, he later was a minor league manager and coach, and a coach with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). As an active player, Myers stood tall, weighed , and threw and batted right-handed.\nBiography.\nMyers graduated from William Penn Senior High School in York, Pennsylvania, where he was a two-sport standout in baseball and basketball. He then attended Temple University, where he played for Temple Owls baseball coach Skip Wilson. Teammates included Pete Filson, who pitched in MLB during 1982–1990. Myers was selected by the New York Yankees in the 27th round of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. He was named the Temple Owls' most valuable player for his redshirt junior year in 1981.\nFollowing his junior year, Myers was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 13th round (312th overall) in the 1981 MLB draft. He played eight seasons of Minor League Baseball in the Seattle system, including four years at the Double-A level. As a minor leaguer, Myers appeared in 795 games, compiling a .272 batting average with 26 home runs and 348 RBIs. Defensively, he played mostly as a shortstop, while appearing at all other infield positions as well as in the outfield and at catcher. He also pitched a total of innings in five games.\nMyers then managed Mariners' farm clubs for 12 seasons, 1989–2000, the last five as skipper of the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. He next joined the major league staff of Lou Piniella for the 2001 Seattle Mariners season. In his first season as the Mariners' third-base coach, Seattle won an American League-record 116 games. Myers served as third-base coach for Seattle through the 2004 season. In 2006, he managed a final season in the minor leagues with the Everett AquaSox, Seattle's Class A Short Season affiliate. During his 13 seasons as a minor league manager, his teams compiled a 762–699 record, for a .522 winning percentage.\nMyers next became a coach in the Cleveland Indians' organization after leaving the Mariners. He spent 2010–2015 as a coach for the Durham Bulls, the Triple-A International League affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2016, Myers became a member of the Rays' professional scouting staff, based in Seattle."

        "title": "Murderers' Row (boxing)",
        "text": "Murderers' Row refers to a group of middleweight boxing contenders in the United States competing in the 1940s, primarily of an African background. Renowned for their toughness and great boxing ability, they were feared throughout the boxing world and never received a shot at the world title. According to boxing pundit Jim Murray, they were “the most exclusive men’s club the ring has ever known. They were so good and so feared that they had to have their own tournament”. \nFighters recognized under the Murderers’ Row banner include Charley Burley, Lloyd Marshall, Holman Williams, Herbert \"Cocoa Kid\" Lewis Hardwick, Jack Chase, Eddie Booker, Aaron Wade, and Bert Lytell. Avoided by many of the famous names of the day, the eight Murderers’ Row fighters faced each other a total of 62 times, the fights often classics and grueling contests. \nThe expression \"murderers' row\" had been used previously to describe the batting line-up of the New York Yankees baseball team in the late 1920s. The phrase as used in boxing was originally coined by writer Budd Schulberg.\nThe Murderers’ Row fights.\nThe greatest fighter in Murderers’ Row was probably Charley Burley, regarded by many in the boxing community as the most talented fighter never to compete for a world title. Fight writer Tom Archdeacon, wrote of Burley, “[he was] kept from title shots and ducked by many of the top fighters, he was reduced to fighting other tough - and avoided - black middleweights”. For nearly a decade Burely defeated everyone put in front of him. In the mid-1940s, world champions in Fritzie Zivic, Billy Soose and the great Archie Moore counted as Burley’s conquests. He was ranked in the top 10 in the Welterweight and Middleweight divisions for most of the 1940s, without receiving a title shot. (Burley did hold the World Colored Welterweight and World Colored Middleweight Championships.) Near the end of his career Burley took to fighting Heavyweights in a bid to find meaningful contests, including J.D. Turner and future Heavyweight champ Ezzard Charles. Eventually, Burley would retire after winning 83 bouts, without ever being able to meet in the ring the champions of the time, such as Rocky Graziano, Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta. Burley was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.\nAnother member, Eddie Booker campaigned primarily at Light Heavyweight in the 1940s. Based in California, Booker blazed a path through the division, he would be victorious in 67 bouts, only losing on 5 occasions. A physically muscular and durable fighter, he was a blend of boxing skill and formidable punching power. In his autobiography, Light Heavyweight world champion, Archie Moore, stated that Booker was one of only two boxers (the other was Burley in a 1944 bout) who beat him in his prime and rated them as the best fighters he ever faced. Booker would compete in 80 bouts without ever being stopped. \nFellow International Hall of Famer, Holman Williams fought across three weight divisions. Graduating from the same Detroit gym as Joe Louis, Williams was famed for his sublime defensive skills and stylish technique. Highly respected boxing coach Eddie Futch stated he would rather watch Williams spar than most fighters box in the ring. A popular and exciting fighter, the local New Orleans paper and Ring Magazine both reported on the large crowds that would attend Williams’ fights and that he received standing ovations for his performances. Williams would eventually compete in over 180 bouts, without ever getting a shot at the title - but the breadth of this achievement, with great success against other fighters in the Murderer's Row, has even led some to suggest him over Burley as its greatest member. (Their own series ended at 3-3 apiece, with one no-contest). Conversely, he has been noted for his lack of success, in a lengthy series with fellow Row member Herbert \"Cocoa Kid\" Lewis Hardwick.\nFellow member Jack Chase, also known as the ‘Young Joe Louis’, was frequently in trouble with the law (he was imprisoned several times and at one point was arrested for shooting fellow Murderer’s Row fighter Aaron Wade, although both men later claimed the incident was an accident). The San Francisco Chronicle sports correspondent of the time, Eddie Muller, wrote that Chase moved around the ring with speed and skill “every move a picture.” It was reported that he had at least 48 bouts in the 1930s which are not included in the official record, but this has been disproven.\nMany of these fighters would only receive the official recognition they deserved years after their careers. Six members of Murderers’ Row have since become International or World Hall of Famers."

        "title": "Michael Smith (darts player)",
        "text": "Michael Smith (born 18 September 1990) is an English professional darts player. Nicknamed \"Bully Boy\", he plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events, where he is currently ranked No. 3 in the world. He is a former world champion, having won the 2023 World Championship. \nSmith was the 2013 PDC Under-21 World Champion and has since won 17 titles on the PDC Pro Tour. He won his first PDC major title at the 2022 Grand Slam of Darts, having previously been a runner-up at the World Championship (2019 and 2022), the Premier League (2018), the World Matchplay (2019), the European Championship (2022), the UK Open (2022), The Masters (2020), and the World Series Finals (2018).\nEarly life.\nMichael Smith was born on 18 September 1990 to parents Ian and Sandra. Smith lived in Cherry Tree Drive, Parr, St Helens throughout his childhood and attended St Cuthbert's High School nearby. When he was 15, he fell off his bike on the way to school breaking his hip, which required him to use crutches for 16 weeks. During that period, Smith threw his first 180 while on crutches. After leaving school, he took a joinery course at college, but he decided to drop out with one exam remaining to play in a darts tournament instead, a decision that he has described as the best of his life. He was a regular winner of local darts events and made his debut in a PDC major at the 2009 UK Open where he lost 6–5 to Dave Ladley in the first round.\nCareer.\nSmith reached the last 32 of the 2010 UK Open, knocking out Peter Manley and Matt Clark before losing to Mervyn King. He was one of a number of young players to make a significant impact in the tournament, along with William O'Connor, Arron Monk, and Reece Robinson.\nHe was the number four seed for the 2011 PDC Under-21 World Championship, where he lost in the quarter-finals to Benito van de Pas.\nOn 26 February 2011, Smith hit a nine-dart finish in a PDC Youth Tour event in Barnsley, against Michael van Gerwen. He reached the final but lost to Shaun Griffiths. The following day, he won his first PDC Pro Tour event, defeating Dave Chisnall 6–5 in the final of the 2011 UK Open Qualifier 2.\n2012.\nSmith had now become a full-time professional on the PDC darts Circuit and made his debut at the World Championships in 2012, losing 0–3 to Co Stompé in the first round. Smith only hit 3 of his 14 darts at a double during the match.\nSmith won his second professional tournament in January 2012, at the Players Championship Event 2 in Benidorm. He won seven matches, concluding with a 6–3 victory over Justin Pipe to take the title and the £6,000 prize money. In April, he earned a place in the European Tour Event 1 in Vienna by defeating Les Wallace and Shaun Griffiths in the UK qualifier. He played Jamie Caven in the first round and hit a nine dart finish on his way to a 6–4 win, but then lost 5–6 to Mark Walsh in round two. His results meant he qualified for the World Matchplay for the first time in his career via the ProTour Order of Merit. He faced Raymond van Barneveld in the first round and was beaten 4–10. Smith also played in the World Grand Prix for the first time, losing to Phil Taylor 0–2 in the first round. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Smith was 25th on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. It was Smith's first appearance in the tournament and he beat Ian White 6–5 in the first round before losing 6–10 to Kim Huybrechts.\n2013.\nSmith's position on the ProTour Order of Merit also saw him qualify for the 2013 World Championship, as he took the second of sixteen places that were awarded to the highest non-qualified players. However, he ran into an in-form Raymond van Barneveld in the first round who averaged 108.31 as Smith could only win one leg during the match in a 0–3 defeat.\nSmith reached the final of the third UK Open Qualifier in March, but was beaten 2–6 by Michael van Gerwen.\nSmith won the 2013 PDC World Youth Championship with a 6–1 victory over Ricky Evans, which was broadcast just before the 2013 Premier League Darts Final. Smith led van Barneveld 3–0 in the third round of the UK Open but went on to lose 8–9. In October, he advanced to the semi-finals for the second time in 2013 at the 12th Players Championship but his run was ended with a 6–3 defeat to Kevin Painter. His youth title earned him a place in the Grand Slam of Darts and he produced an impressive display in his first group match against Dave Chisnall as from 3–1 down he hit legs of 11, 12, 14, and 13 darts to win 5–3 with an average of 103.17. However, he then lost 5–2 to Scott Waites and 5–1 to Ted Hankey to finish third in Group H and be eliminated from the tournament.\n2014.\nSmith broke into the world's top 32 on the Order of Merit just before the cut-off for the 2014 World Championship to qualify through the main ranking list for the first time. He beat Morihiro Hashimoto 3–1 in the first round.\nHe then defeated reigning and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor 4–3 in the second round, taking out the bullseye on a 128 finish to win the match. In the next round, Smith hit a 136 finish, with his opponent Peter Wright waiting on 41, to lead 3–2 but only won one more leg after this to lose 4–3. He was named the PDC's Young Player of the Year at the Annual Awards in January. Smith won through to the final of the sixth UK Open Qualifier of the year but averaged just 70.94 as he was whitewashed 6–0 by Michael van Gerwen. A rematch against Wright followed in the third round of the UK Open with Smith throwing for the match in the final leg, but he missed a total of seven darts at doubles to lose 9–8. His second final of 2014 was at the fifth Players Championship, which he reached by beating Raymond van Barneveld 6–3 in the quarter-finals and Gary Anderson 6–4 in the semis, but he was again whitewashed in the decider, this time by Brendan Dolan.\nAt the World Matchplay, he recorded a 10–8 victory over Justin Pipe before losing 13–6 to Taylor in the second round. At the European Darts Grand Prix, Smith eliminated Gary Anderson, Adrian Lewis, and Stephen Bunting en route to facing Mervyn King in the final. Smith missed too many doubles throughout the match, including one to claim the title, as he lost his third ranking final of the year 6–5. Another final followed a week later at the 14th Players Championship where he lost 6–4 to Van Gerwen. Smith's rich vein of form continued into the European Darts Trophy as he reached the final and came back from 3–0 against Van Gerwen to win the title 6–5, which included a 158 finish to break throw in the ninth leg. He suffered first round exits at the World Grand Prix and European Championship, but topped Group F at the Grand Slam by winning all three of his games. Smith knocked out Christian Kist 10–5 but was then beaten 16–3 by Taylor in the quarter-finals, losing 13 consecutive legs from 3–3. His year in the major events concluded with a 6–4 defeat to Andy Smith in the opening round of the Players Championship Finals.\n2015.\nAfter seeing off Mensur Suljović 3–1 in the first round of the 2015 World Championship, Smith beat Brendan Dolan 4–2 after having been 2–0 down, to set up a third round tie with fellow St. Helens player Stephen Bunting. Despite taking out checkouts of 170 and 132, Smith was 3–0 down, before finding his scoring game to restrict Bunting to one leg as he closed the gap to 3–2. Ultimately his slow start to the match proved costly as he lost the next set to be knocked out 4–2 in a game that saw each player average 102 and hit eight 180s apiece. Smith won the fifth UK Open Qualifier by beating Adrian Lewis 6–5. A rematch with Bunting followed in the third round of the UK Open, with Smith missing two match darts in the deciding leg to be beaten 9–8. He claimed the second European Tour title of his career by winning the International Darts Open with a 6–3 victory over Benito van de Pas in the final. Smith suffered a 10–4 defeat to Gerwyn Price in the first round of the World Matchplay, but retained his European Darts Trophy title by seeing off Michael van Gerwen in the final for the second year in a row. At the World Grand Prix, he punished two missed match darts from Price to beat him 2–1, but Smith then lost from 2–0 up in sets against Jamie Lewis in the second round. Wins over Wayne Jones, Lewis and Andy Fordham saw Smith top his group at the Grand Slam and he then averaged 104.59 to beat Dave Chisnall 10–7 and reach the quarter-finals. Smith's first major event semi-final soon followed as he defeated Lewis 16–11, but he was heavily beaten 16–6 by Van Gerwen.\n2016.\nAt the 2016 World Championship wins over Jeffrey de Zwaan, Steve Beaton, and Benito van de Pas saw Smith reach the quarter-finals for the first time, where he was 3–0 ahead of Raymond van Barneveld. He could only win two legs as Van Barneveld moved 4–3 up, but he took the next to take the match to a ninth and final set. Smith finished 130 on double five to move within a leg of the match and missed one dart to win it, before Van Barneveld won four legs in a row to end Smith's event. Smith made his debut in the Premier League after receiving a wildcard from the PDC. On the opening night, he played twice due to Gary Anderson being ill. Smith lost his first matches 7–2 to Peter Wright and 7–1 to Adrian Lewis. His first point came in week three courtesy of a 6–6 draw with Dave Chisnall. Michael van Gerwen scored a world record three-dart average of 123.40 against Smith in a 7–1 win, but the following week, Smith got his first Premier League victory by beating Van Barneveld 7–5. However, Smith lost his last two matches to finish bottom of the table and be eliminated from the event.\nSmith played in the final of the 2016 Austrian Darts Open and lost 6–4 to Phil Taylor. He saw off Simon Whitlock 10–6 at the World Matchplay before losing 11–7 to Steve Beaton in the second round and was knocked out 2–1 in sets by Alan Norris in the first round of the World Grand Prix. Smith was also eliminated in the first round of the European Championship and Players Championship Finals.\n2017.\nSmith entered the 2017 World Championship without a match win since September 2016 having lost 10 in a row. He took the deciding set of his first round match with Ricky Evans without dropping a leg and said he had been \"fighting his demons\" recently. In the next round, he missed five darts to eliminate Mervyn King 4–1, but kept his composure to eventually see him off 4–3. Smith went 3–1 up on James Wade in the third round, but after Wade took the next set, Smith lost six legs in a row to be eliminated 4–3. He missed two darts to win the third UK Open Qualifier as Peter Wright beat him 6–5. Four 6–5 wins saw him reach the final of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy and at 4–4 he took out a 132 finish with Mensur Suljović waiting on 56 to break throw and took home his first title in nearly two years with a 6–4 victory. Smith qualified for the 2017 European Championship as third seed, losing in the quarter-final to Rob Cross.\n2018.\nSmith was thirteenth seeded at the 2018 World Championship, losing in the second round to eventual champion Rob Cross, having missed two match darts. Following the championship, Smith was invited into the 2018 Premier League, the second invitation to the Premier League he had received. Smith finished the league phase in second place, qualifying for the play-offs. He beat Gary Anderson in the semi-final before losing in the final 4–11 to Michael van Gerwen.\n2018 also saw Smith win his first event on the World Series of Darts, taking the 2018 Shanghai Darts Masters with an 8–2 win over Rob Cross in the final. Smith reached the final of the 2018 World Series of Darts Finals, missing five darts to take the title in a 10–11 defeat to James Wade.\n2019: World Championship and World Matchplay finals.\nSmith was tenth seed at the 2019 World Championship. In the second round, he eliminated Ron Meulenkamp before beating John Henderson and Ryan Searle to reach the quarter-final. He reached his first World Championship semi-final with a 5–1 victory over Luke Humphries, then beat Nathan Aspinall in the semi-final to set up a final against Michael van Gerwen. Smith was defeated in the final, 7–3.\nHe reached the final of the 2019 World Matchplay, where he faced Rob Cross. Smith lost the first 9 legs of the match and eventually succumbed 18–13.\n2020.\nSmith suffered an early exit at the 2020 World Championship, losing to Luke Woodhouse in the second round. Smith missed three match darts to beat Peter Wright in the final of the 2020 Masters, losing 11–10 in a last leg decider. He had previously defeated Mensur Suljović, Adrian Lewis, and Nathan Aspinall to reach the final. \nOn 27 February 2020, in week 4 of the 2020 Premier League, Smith hit his first televised nine-dart leg in a 7–5 victory over Daryl Gurney.\n2021.\nSmith had another early exit at the 2021 World Championship, losing again in the second round, this time to Jason Lowe.\nAt the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts, he beat Michael van Gerwen 16–13 to reach the semi-finals, where he eventually lost 16–12 to Peter Wright. Smith led 12–8, but Wright won eight consecutive legs to clinch a place in the final against Gerwyn Price.\n2022: First major title.\nSmith began his 2022 World Championship campaign with a comfortable 3–0 win over Ron Meulenkamp, before defeating William O'Connor 4–2. The next two games saw him take on two of the most in-form players from the 2021 season; first defeating Jonny Clayton in a last-set shootout that went to extra legs; and then triumphing over defending champion Gerwyn Price, surviving two match darts and a 9 darter before winning the final set. In the semi-final Smith took an early lead over James Wade and eventually triumphed 6–3, reaching the final for the second time in his career. Smith lost the final 7–5 to Peter Wright and claimed £200,000 as runner-up.\nSmith reached the final of the UK Open in March, but lost 11–10 to Danny Noppert despite Noppert only averaging 84.82 to see his 7th final defeat. He recovered well to win a night event on the final standard night of the 2022 Premier League, but came 7th in the table and did not qualify for the playoff places. His good form after the UK Open continued, winning 3 Pro Tour titles in a short period and performing well in the European Tour and was victorious at the US Darts Masters at Maddison Square Gardens beating Michael Van Gerwen in the final 8-4 . \nIn July, Smith reached the last 16 of the 2022 World Matchplay, where he was beaten 11–7 by Dirk van Duijvenbode.

        "title": "Cricket paralysis virus",
        "text": "Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is a paralytic disease affecting crickets. It was initially discovered in Australian field crickets (\"Teleogryllus commodus\" and \"Teleogryllus oceanicus\") by Carl Reinganum and his colleagues at the Victorian Plant Research Institute (Burnley, Melbourne, Australia). The disease spread rapidly through a breeding colony as well as through a laboratory population causing about 95% mortality. This was the first recorded isolate of the virus and is generally referred to as CrPVvic to distinguish it from subsequent isolates.\nDescription.\nThe spheroidal, non-enveloped virus particles of CrPV are about 27 nm diameter in negatively-stained electron micrographs and contain a single piece of positive-sense ssRNA. The virion is composed of four capsid proteins with molecular masses generally reported to be 33, 31 and 30 kilodaltons with a minor VP4 protein of about 8 kDa. The particles resemble those of the mammalian picornaviruses but CrPV virions sediment at a faster rate (167 S) than poliovirus particles (158 S) in sucrose rate-zonal gradients and, in isopycnic neutral cesium chloride gradients, CrPV particles are denser than those of poliovirus (1.368 g/cm3 vs 1.340 g/cm3 respectively).\nRange.\nCrPV has been detected in a number of insect species from at least five different orders of the class Insecta, in both natural and laboratory populations, and is usually identified by standard serological methods. The infections include not only the Australian cricket species but the New Zealand cricket, \"Pteronemobius nigrovus\", as well as the European house cricket, \"Acheta domesticus\". CrPV does not appear to infect locusts. It is a commonly detected virus in honeybees as an inapparent infection.\nThe strain CrPVbrk was isolated from the cricket \"A. domesticus\" , following a major population collapse at a cricket rearing farm in Georgia in the US. A related virus from Arkansas, US, initially called \"Pseudoplusia includens\" virus and redesignated CrPVark, was recorded in the mid-1980s. The brk and ark strains are closely related serologically but appear to be very distantly related to the other CrPV isolates so, despite their physical and chemical similarities, it remains speculative that these two American isolates are actually strains of CrPV.\nReported detections and/or isolations of CrPV have been made in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Indonesia. CrPV has one of the widest host-ranges of any virus, insect or not. The potential for the use of CrPV as a biological control agent for insects has been suggested. In laboratory experiments CrPVbrk proved to be extremely infectious and pathogenic for adult \"Ceratitis capitata\" (Mediterranean fruit fly). Detailed studies have also been made on the use of a CrPV strain to control the European olive fruit fly (\"Dacus oleae\").\nAmerican outbreaks.\nIn 2011, a \"cricket paralysis virus\" was reported to be involved in other catastrophic collapses in American cricket rearing facilities. A similar report from the UK and European cricket breeders, however, refers to a \"cricket paralysis virus\" but has identified the causative agent as a small DNA-containing virus, \"Acheta domesticus\" densovirus; thus, the North American outbreaks are probably not due to the small RNA virus taxonomically referred to as CrPV. Over 60 million crickets died as a result of the outbreak. Whatever the causative virus, switching to a different species for American breeders is more difficult than it is in Europe, as \"Acheta domesticus\" is currently the only cricket approved for commercial distribution, and any new proposals are scrutinized through a permitting process.\nStudies.\nCrPV has been shown to replicate in continuously cultured cell lines derived from the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and other insect cell lines. This ability enabled detailed studies on the replication strategy of the virus. The fact that a demonstrable cytopathic effect was also produced in these cultured cell infections led to the development of sensitive titration assay methods similar to those employed in studies of mammalian picornaviruses. In the 1990s large-scale production of the virus in cell suspension cultures of \"Drosophila\" or \"Trichoplusia ni\" cells made x-ray crystallographic studies feasible. CrPV was the first insect virus to have its crystal structure determined.\nEarly studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s showed the occurrence of post-translational processing of a large polyprotein produced during the course of infection of \"Drosophila\" cells with CrPV. This was reminiscent of the post-translational cleavages occurring when mammalian cells are infected with vertebrate picornaviruses such as poliovirus. However, the relative amounts of the resultant proteins resulting from the cleavages were puzzlingly unequal with CrPV in contrast to the equimolar levels produced by picornaviruses. Thus, despite some of the physical and genomic translation similarities that CrPV shared with mammalian picornaviruses, classifying CrPV as an insect \"picornavirus\" was justifiably contentious.\nIn the later 1990s the elucidation of the crystal structure of CrPV showed that while the conformation of its capsid proteins closely resembled those of picornaviruses, detailed analysis of the complete CrPV genome exposed critical differences. Picornavirus genomes contain only a single open reading frame (ORF) which is translated into a single polyprotein, but CrPV, as well as several other related insect viruses, is translated from two ORFs each driven by a respective internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Also the capsid proteins are encoded at the 3' end of the CrPV genome, the opposite of that for picornaviruses as well being differently ordered within the genome. These crucial characteristics led to the formation of the family \"Dicistroviridae\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). CrPV is in the genus \"Cripavirus\" within this family."

        "title": "2015 World Men's Handball Championship",
        "text": "The 2015 World Men's Handball Championship was the 24th staging of the World Men's Handball Championship, organised by the International Handball Federation (IHF). The final tournament was held for the first time in Qatar, from 15 January to 1 February 2015. The Qatari bid was selected over those of Norway, Poland and France after a vote by the IHF Council on 27 January 2011, in Malmö, Sweden. \nThis was the third time that the World Championship was hosted in the Middle East And North Africa, after Egypt in 1999 and Tunisia in 2005. \nFrance won the final against Qatar 25–22 to win their fifth title, a first in handball history while Qatar won their first ever medal.\nPoland captured the bronze medal by defeating Spain 29–28 after extra time. Denmark secured the fifth place by winning against Croatia which finished sixth and thus had the worst result in the past 13 years of international handball competing.\nThe competition was marred by numerous controversies throughout.\nVenues.\nThe games of the tournament were played in 3 cities: Doha, Al Rayyan and the newly created town of Lusail.\nThree new venues were constructed for the tournament:\nQualification.\nTwenty-four teams participated in the final tournament. Qatar, as hosts and Spain, as world champions, were automatically qualified, which left 22 places available for the best teams of each continental qualification tournament and the winners of an additional European qualification competition.\nIn a decision taken by the International Handball Federation on 8 July 2014 the spot allocated for a nation from Oceania was revoked on the grounds that Oceania has no continental confederation. The national team, qualified for this spot through the 2014 Oceania Handball Championship, was Australia. The spot was instead handed out as a wild card to the nation with the highest ranking at the previous world championships not qualified for the Qatar tournament. This nation was Germany. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates withdrew on 7 November 2014. Iceland and Saudi Arabia were chosen as the replacements.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 20 July 2014 at 21:30 local time in Doha, Qatar.\nSeedings.\nThe seedings were published on 11 July 2014.\nSquads.\nEach team selects 16 players for the tournament.\nReferees.\n18 referee pairs are selected:\nPreliminary round.\nThe schedule was published on 21 August 2014. A new schedule was released on 12 December 2014. The top four teams from each group advanced to the knockout stage.\nTie-breaking criteria.\nFor the group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group tied on an equal number of points, the finishing positions will be determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:\n\"All times are local (UTC+3).\"\nFinal ranking.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-Star Team.\nAll-Star Team of the tournament:\nOther awards.\nThe final rankings were used in the 2016 Summer Olympics qualification process. France, as World Champion, qualified for the Olympics. The next 6 teams earned a place in the Olympic Qualification Tournaments. Qatar and Germany, however, won their continental tournaments (qualifying them directly for the Olympics) and thus their spots in the Olympic Qualification Tournaments went to Slovenia and Macedonia.\nControversy.\nWithdrawal of teams.\nAs mentioned under qualifications, Australia lost its spot in the tournament due to an IHF decision, being replaced by Germany, who had not originally qualified. Further, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates withdrew.\nQatar player naturalisation.\nA large number of players in the Qatar team had been naturalised in the years leading up to the championship. According to IHF rules, to gain eligibility for a new national team, a player cannot have played for another nation for three years in an official match. This allowed several foreign-born players, including Spanish-born Borja Vidal, Goran Stojanović and Jovo Damjanović from Montenegro, and Bertrand Roiné who previously played for France, to play for the Qatar team at the championship. According to the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\", only four of the 17 players in the squad were native to Qatar.\nHead of the Qatar Handball Federation, Ahmed Mohammed Abdulrab Al Shaabi, acknowledged the policy in a statement in June 2013, saying \"We're a small nation with limited human resources, so we had to bring players from outside in the past.\" He also announced an end to the policy at the time, adding however that they \"[might] make an exception only in the case of an experienced goalkeeper.\" In January 2014, Danish sports agent Mads Winther said he had met with \"contacts involved with Qatar\" regarding the possibility of naturalising Danish players.\nThe practice was criticised by Austrian goalkeeper after his team's loss to Qatar in the round of 16, saying \"It [felt] like playing against a world selection team\" and \"I think it is not the sense of a world championship.\" At a press conference during the championship, Qatar head coach Valero Rivera declined to comment on the matter. Spanish player Joan Cañellas did not think it was an issue, saying \"If they can do it, why not.\"\nAfter the controversial semi-final against Poland, and reaching the final as a result, the practice was even more criticised, with players such as Danijel Šarić having now represented four different national teams.\nPaid fans.\nQatar flew in about 60 Spanish fans to cheer for Qatar during the championship.\nRefereeing.\nDuring the first 12 matches of the tournament, 143 two-minute suspensions were awarded by the referees, a figure that came under strong criticism from teams, who had not been informed of the IHF Referee Committee's instructions to referees commanding them to keep a strict disciplinary line.\nThe referees were widely accused of being one-sided in favour of the hosts. Especially at the matches against Austria, Germany and Poland. After the final whistle, the Polish players showed their discontent by ironically applauding the three referees."

The club was formed in 1954 and soon found themselves on the top. \"Spari\", as the fans call the team, have won all but one league titles between 1960 and 1967, and in addition, they have won two domestic cup titles in 1963 and 1968. They also enjoyed a good run in the European Champions Cup, having been marched to the finals in 1965, only to fall short against HG København.\nIn the seventies the club have fallen back, and eventually slumped to relegation in 1975. However, the team promoted back immediately and under the guidance of head coach István Szabó a new success period has begun. Spartacus have won the national championship title in 1983 and 1986, and lifted the Hungarian cup trophy in 1988. Beside the domestic hit they also took the EHF Cup Winners' Cup in 1981.\nFrom the nineties the club slowly relapsed and turned into a mid-table team. Parallel to this, their financial potential is narrowed and it all ended up in a relegation to the Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B in 2007.\nSince they are co-operating with another Budapest-based club, \"Pénzügyőr SE\", the team is officially known as Pénzügyőr-Spartacus SC.\nHonours.\nDomestic competitions.\nNemzeti Bajnokság I (\"National Championship of Hungary\")\nMagyar Kupa (\"National Cup of Hungary\")"

        "title": "Ice hockey contract",
        "text": "The following are the types of hockey contracts that players may be signed to when they play professional ice hockey.\nNHL contracts.\nTwo-way contract.\nA two-way contract is a professional sports contract which stipulates that an athlete's salary is dependent upon the league in which the athlete is assigned to play.\nOne-way contract.\nA one-way contract means that the player is paid the same amount of money regardless of whether he plays in the National Hockey League (NHL) or American Hockey League (AHL).\nStandard player contract.\nAHL/ECHL.\nThis is what a player signs to lay out the terms of their playing status and salary. This is not transferable to the NHL and would require the player to sign a new contract with the NHL team.\nProfessional tryout.\nA Professional tryout (PTO) contract exists in the AHL and NHL. In the AHL, this type of contract is limited to 25 games. Teams may sign players to multiple PTOs at any time during the season, provided that after the completion of the PTO, the player has the right to sign a regular AHL contract or a PTO with another AHL team.\nAmateur tryout.\nAn Amateur tryout (ATO) contract exists in the NHL, the AHL and the ECHL. This type of contract is for players who are leaving college and attempting to turn professional, are done with college or are graduating from the junior leagues. An ATO is a very common practice near the end of the professional seasons as they go deeper into the year than college or junior schedules. In the NHL, an ATO may only be used for one day on an emergency basis, with no pay or compensation for skaters, per Exhibit 17 of the NHL–NHLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). ATOs in the NHL are typically only used for goaltenders since, in practice, teams always retain more than the needed 18 skaters on their NHL rosters, making it highly likely any skater who becomes unavailable for a game on short notice can be replaced by another player who otherwise would have been a \"healthy scratch\".\nFor goaltenders and skaters, the ATO may only be used according to section 13-13(m)(ii) of the NHL-NHLPA CBA, when Emergency conditions shall be established when the playing strength of the Loaning Club, by reason of incapacitating injury or illness or by League suspension to its Players is reduced below the level of two (2) goalkeepers, six (6) defensemen and twelve (12) forwards. Proof of the existence of the emergency conditions including the incapacity shall be furnished to the Commissioner of the League upon request made by him.\nEvery team in the League is required to maintain a list of emergency goaltenders who reside in their respective club's home market. These goaltenders can be signed when needed by either home or visiting teams.\nRecent ATOs.\nOn December 16, 2010, the Phoenix Coyotes signed Tom Fenton to a one-game amateur contract.\nAnother use of an ATO was when the Minnesota Wild signed 51-year-old Paul Deutsch on November 23, 2011. Deutsch was signed because the Wild were unsure their minor league goaltender, Matt Hackett, would arrive in time for the game. Deutsch wore number 33 and only participated in warm ups, as Hackett arrived just before the game started. Deutsch said the last time that he played organized hockey was in 1978 as a defenseman on his junior varsity high school hockey team. He first played goaltender at age 37 in a \"beer league\" in Minnesota.\nOn March 28, 2012, former University of Michigan goaltender Shawn Hunwick was signed to an ATO by the Columbus Blue Jackets after starting goaltender Steve Mason was injured during practice.\nOn February 28, 2014, the Buffalo Sabres signed their former video scout, Ryan Vinz, to an ATO after starting goaltender Ryan Miller was traded before warm-ups.\nOn February 15, 2016, the Arizona Coyotes signed emergency goaltender Nathan Schoenfeld, the son of former Coyotes coach and New York Rangers senior vice-president Jim Schoenfeld, to an ATO after backup goaltender Anders Lindbäck was injured in an off-ice activity before warmups.\nOn December 3, 2016, the Chicago Blackhawks signed emergency goaltender Eric Semborski, a former Temple University club goaltender, to an ATO after starting goaltender Corey Crawford presented acute appendicitis and underwent an appendectomy before a game in Philadelphia.\nOn December 31, 2016, the Carolina Hurricanes signed emergency goaltender Jorge Alves, who serves as the team's equipment manager, to an ATO after goalie Eddie Läck came down with food poisoning hours before face off for the game in Tampa Bay. Alves replaced starting goalie Cam Ward in net with 7.6 seconds remaining in the game and a faceoff at the other end of the rink, after the Lightning were called for icing the puck.\nOn March 29, 2018, Chicago Blackhawks signed emergency goalie Scott Foster, a former Western Michigan University goalie, to an ATO after Anton Forsberg injured himself playing soccer during warm up. During that night's game against the Winnipeg Jets, the starting goaltender Collin Delia (who also made his NHL debut that night) was injured early in the third period, and Scott Foster played, becoming the first emergency backup goaltender to be forced to play in the NHL due to injuries. He wore #90 and stopped all seven shots he faced in 14:01 ice time, including one powerplay shot to kill a one-minute power play, and was named the first star of the game.\nOn April 12, 2018, the San Jose Barracuda signed goaltender Nick Cafreli to an ATO after the San Jose Sharks recalled Antoine Bibeau for an out-of-town playoff game.\nOn November 14, 2018, the Washington Capitals signed goaltender Gavin McHale to an ATO after Braden Holtby sustained an upper body injury.\nOn February 22, 2020, the Carolina Hurricanes signed goaltender David Ayres to an ATO after both of the Carolina Hurricanes' goaltenders, James Reimer and Petr Mrázek, were injured during a game against the Maple Leafs., \nOn October 10, 2021, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed goaltender Alex Bishop to an ATO after Petr Mrázek sustained a lower body injury.\nOn January 28, 2023, the Edmonton Oilers signed goaltender Matt Berlin of the University of Alberta Golden Bears to an ATO on an emergency basis, after regular goaltender Stuart Skinner was pulled from the lineup before game time due to illness. Berlin served as the backup to Jack Campbell and entered the game for the final 2 minutes in the Oilers' 7-3 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. Berlin made one save on one shot. \nOn April 8, 2023, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed goaltender Jett Alexander to an ATO. He played 70 seconds at the end of their game against Montreal that day.\nOn April 12, 2023, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Mathias Onuska to an ATO as a back up goaltender as Ilya Samsonov and Matt Murray were both injured and unable to play. He plays for the Windsor Spitfires currently.\nAll of the goaltenders listed above served as backups to the team's remaining available goaltender. As of the 2022–23 season, only Scott Foster, Jorge Alves, David Ayres, Matt Berlin, and Jett Alexander have actually played in an NHL game. Ayres entered his game in the second period following an injury to goaltender Petr Mrázek and became the first emergency goaltender to record a win in NHL history."

His brother, George, also was a dual-international.\nEarly years.\nSpencer attended Mt Cook School in Wellington.\nRugby union career.\nFrom the Melrose club, Spencer represented Wellington along with four of his brothers. He, along with his brothers, contributed significantly to the club's six Wellington club championship wins between 1896 and 1908.\nSpencer was only 17 when he first represented Wellington in 1898 and remains one of the youngest to ever have played for the union. Spencer played for Wellington against the 1903 New Zealand team before joining it for the tour of Australia. However Spencer injured himself aboard the ship and played in only two tour matches.\nSpencer missed most of the 1904 season as a result but returned in 1905 to play for Wellington against the departing Originals side. He then captained a combined Wellington-Wairarapa-Horowhenua selection to a 23–7 win over the touring Australian side and was made captain of the New Zealand side which played an official test against the tourists, despite the absence of the Originals squad.\nSpencer, along with his brother George, made the All Blacks' tour of Australia in 1907, playing in only three of the eight matches. In the first Test match he became the first New Zealander to win a test cap as a replacement when he came of the bench to replace an injured John Colman.\nRugby league career.\nIn 1908 he and his brother George switched to league, being part of the first ever provincial match in the country when they both played for Wellington against Auckland on 24 August.\nIn 1909 he toured Australia with the New Zealand rugby league side. He played in all three test matches. The Spencers are the only brothers to have been both All Blacks and Kiwis.\nHe played in Wellington's 1913 victory over Auckland.\nLater years.\nSpencer returned to rugby union in later years and became a club coach for Berhampore in Wellington."

A native of Shannon, Georgia, Griggs stood tall, weighed and batted right-handed.\nGriggs was a workhorse as a minor league pitcher, logging over 200 innings pitched for his first six seasons (1950–1955) in professional baseball, including stints with Washington's Charlotte Hornets and Chattanooga Lookouts minor league affiliates. In the Majors, he was a starting pitcher in 45 of his 105 total appearances. Pitching for second-division and cellar-dwelling Washington teams, he compiled a poor .188 winning percentage, winning six games and losing 26, and surrendering 372 hits in 347 innings pitched. He also walked more batters than he struck out, 209 to 172.\nAccording to a 1993 \"Sports Illustrated\" article, Griggs was married on a Hickory, North Carolina, pitching mound before a minor league game in 1952. Asked why, he said: \"I couldn't hit, so there was no sense getting married at home plate.\"\nGriggs enjoyed the night life of a Major League player, telling a Washington teammate, \"I'm only going to be here once on this earth, and I'm really going to live it up.\"\nGriggs pitched professionally into the 1963 season before retiring from the game, and died at age 76 in Tucson, Arizona."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson (Washington, D.C.)",
        "text": "Andrew Jackson is a bronze equestrian statue by Clark Mills mounted on a white marble base in the center of Lafayette Square within President's Park in Washington, D.C., just to the north of the White House. Jackson is depicted dressed in military uniform, raising his hat with his right hand, while controlling the reins with his left hand as his horse rises on its rear legs.   \nOther original castings stand in Jackson Square in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at the Tennessee State Capitol building in Nashville.\nDescription.\nThe statue depicts Andrew Jackson, the general who commanded US forces in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, and who served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. It was commissioned in May 1847, almost two years after Jackson's death at The Hermitage, his plantation near Nashville, Tennessee, by the Jackson Monument Committee chaired by John Peter Van Ness (who died before the statue was completed). Although Mills had never met Jackson and had also never seen an equestrian statue, his proposal won the commission ahead of Hiram Powers and Robert Mills. Mills taught himself the technical skills to finalize the design and cast the statue.\nJackson's horse at the Battle of New Orleans was named \"Duke\"; but Mills modeled the horse from his own horse named \"Olympus\". Mills trained his horse to pose on its haunches. He also borrowed Jackson's uniform from the U.S. Patent Office, where it was being preserved. He completed a plaster model, and he established a new bronze foundry to produce the casting at his studio on 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, south of the Treasury Building. \nMills produced six castings of the statue of Andrew Jackson until the final one was completed, with ten pieces, six for Jackson and four for the horse. In his casting, he was assisted by an enslaved apprentice, Phillip Reid, who also assisted Mills with other castings, including the 1860-1862 casting of the \"Statue of Freedom\" designed by Thomas Crawford which sits atop the United States Capitol dome. The casting was completed 1852, making this the first equestrian statue made in the US, and also the first bronze statue cast in the US. It has been described as the first equestrian statue made with the horse rearing on two legs with no additional support – earlier equestrian bronzes, such as Pietro Tacca's statue of Philip IV, and Étienne Maurice Falconet's statue of Peter the Great, use the horse's tail as a third support. Tests in 1993 showed that the rear legs have central cores of iron covered with bronze, giving them additional strength and weight to support and counterbalance the suspended parts of the statue.\nThe statue is about a third larger than life, and weighs about 15 tons. It was installed on a tapering rectangular marble base on a raised circular grassed area with railings on the alignment of the North Portico of the White House and 16th Street NW. The narrow face of the marble base, to the west, bears the inscriptions \"JACKSON\" and \"OUR FEDERAL UNION / IT MUST BE PRESERVED\", the latter added in 1909 and quoting a toast offered by Jackson at a Democratic Party banquet in 1830 to celebrate the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. The south face has the inscription \"\". \nThe marble base is surrounded by four cannons that Jackson captured from the Spanish at Pensacola, Florida in 1818. The original intention has been to cast the statue itself using metal from captured cannons, but the tin content was too high. The metal barrels of the cannons initially rested on the grass for several years, before they were raised on new wooden gun carriages, subsequently replaced several times. \nHistory.\nThe statue was dedicated on January 8, 1853, the 38th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, with procession from Judiciary Square followed by an address delivered by Senator Stephen A. Douglas to a crowd of 20,000 people, including President Fillmore, Major General Winfield Scott, members of his cabinet and of Congress, the monument committee, and the sculptor. Cannons from the US Army fired a salute. Mills reputedly quelled concerns about the stability of the statue by throwing himself against the raised front legs of the horse at the dedication: it did not move. \nOver time, the landscaping of the square has been simplified, and statues of figures from the American Revolutionary War have been added, one in each corner of the square, first a statue of the eponymous Lafayette after whom the square is named erected in the south east corner in 1891, and then, working clockwise, a statue of Rochambeau in 1902, and then in 1910 statues of Von Steuben and Kościuszko. The view from the White House is now framed by the bronze Navy Yard Urns, cast in the Washington Navy Yard and based on the ancient Medici Vase, each mounted on a marble plinth. \nThe statue of Jackson faced a bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson that had been installed on the White House North Lawn in 1847, until Jefferson's statue was returned to the Capitol in 1874. There have been proposals, particularly in the early 20th century, to move Jackson's statue and swap it with Mill's 1860 equestrian statue of George Washington in Washington Circle, to reunite Washington with the other the Revolutionary War generals in Lafayette Square, and give the statue of Andrew Jackson more space, but these proposals have been resisted on the grounds of the historical importance of the statue of Andrew Jackson and the desire to keep it in its original location. \nA crowd unsuccessfully attempted to topple the statue on June 22, 2020, during the George Floyd protests. Former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Native American, defended the monument, advocating for it to remain and called for the addition of plaques to explain the complicated history of Jackson. Several days later, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) charged four men with destruction of federal property for allegedly trying to bring down the statue. The Justice Department alleged that a video showed one of the men breaking off and destroying the wheels of the cannons located at the base of the statue as well as pulling on ropes when trying to bring down the statue. The Justice Department also alleged that a man videotaped trying to topple the Jackson statue had, a few days earlier, participated in the destruction of the 1901 Albert Pike Memorial statue near Washington's Judiciary Square.\nThe statute was vandalized with the words \"Expect Us\" on Indigenous Peoples' Day (also Columbus Day), Monday, October 11, 2021. Protestors had been chanting \"respect us or expect us\" in response to protesting the Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota that runs through lands owned by Indigenous tribes who are concerned that the pipeline could spill and ruin the land they use to farm.\nOther castings.\nMills made two other castings of the statue. One was dedicated in February 1856 in the former Place d'Armes in New Orleans, renamed Jackson Square. A second was dedicated on May 20, 1880, on the Tennessee State Capitol grounds, in Nashville, Tennessee, commissioned by the Tennessee Historical Society to celebrate to city's centennial . Mills attended both dedications: the one in Nashville was his last public event before his death in 1883. \nA fourth copy of the statue was erected in Jacksonville, Florida in 1987, near Jacksonville Landing. It was cast by the Modern Art Foundry of Long Island City, New York."

        "title": "Wheelchair Tennis Masters",
        "text": "The Wheelchair Tennis Masters refers to a pair of end of year tennis events for wheelchair athletes held on an annual basis under the jurisdiction of the International Tennis Federation.\nThe Wheelchair Tennis Masters for singles is an end-of-year wheelchair tennis tournament, broadly analogous to the ATP Tour and WTA Championship finals. Initiated in 1994 for men and women's singles, and 2004 for quad players (quad tennis being a mixed gender sport) both genders compete at the same event.\nThe top eight players (men and women), and the top six quad players, are invited to the Masters. The ranking is based on their ranking after the US Open is played. The round robin format is comparable to that which operates at the ATP World Tour Finals and WTA Championships. The Masters is described as the official ITF year-end singles championship.\nSeparately, the Wheelchair Tennis Masters for doubles performs a similar function for men's, women's and quad doubles players. Initiated in 2000 (2003 for quad players), each year the top eight men’s pairings, top six women's pairings and top four quad pairings are accepted into the draw in which all three events follow a round-robin format.\nNEC Wheelchair Tennis Single Masters.\nFrom 1994 until 1999 the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters took place in the Indoor Sport Centre in Eindhoven, Netherlands. From 2000 until 2005 the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters took place in Amersfoort, Netherlands. From 2006 through 2010, the singles tournament took place in the Frans Otten Stadium in Amsterdam. The tournament was renamed the NEC Singles Masters in 2010, and moved to Mechelen, Belgium from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, the NEC Singles Masters took place at the Marguerite Tennis Pavilion in Mission Viejo, California. From 2014 to 2016 the NEC Singles Masters were held in London, UK, while in 2017 the tournament moved to Loughborough, UK. From 2018 the Masters is held in Orlando, Florida. Esther Vergeer holds the record, having won 14 titles between 1998 and 2011, followed by David Wagner with 11.\nWheelchair Doubles Masters.\nFrom 2000 until 2001 the Wheelchair Tennis Doubles Masters took place alongside the singles event in Amersfoort. From 2002 until 2003 the Wheelchair Tennis Doubles Masters took place at the Invacare World Team Cup by Camozzi in Tremosine, Italy. From 2003 until 2004 the Camozzi company became sponsor of this tournament and it took place in Brescia, Italy. Since 2005 the event took place in the Centro Sportivo Mario Mongodi close to Bergamo, Italy. In 2011 the title sponsorship was taken up by Invacare in a two-year deal and the 2011 tournament was held in the Frans Otten stadium in Amsterdam. From 2013 to 2016, the ITF Wheelchair Doubles Masters took place at the Marguerite Tennis Pavilion in Mission Viejo, California In 2017 and 2018, the event took place in Bemmel, Netherlands. As of 2018, Taylor and Wagner are the most successful partnership across all categories, with a total of 11 titles."

        "title": "2013 Six Nations Championship",
        "text": "The 2013 Six Nations Championship, known as the 2013 RBS 6 Nations because of the tournament's sponsorship by the Royal Bank of Scotland, was the 14th series of the Six Nations Championship, the annual northern hemisphere rugby union championship. It was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.\nIncluding the competition's previous incarnations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 119th edition of the tournament. Wales won the tournament for the second time in two years, the first time they had won back-to-back championships since their 1978 and 1979 wins. France collected the wooden spoon by finishing last for the first time since 1999. It was also the first time every team managed to win at least 3 competition points (the equivalent of a win and a draw or three draws) since 1974.\nParticipants.\n2 Except the round 3 match as he was suspended.\nOverview.\nAt the start of the 2013 Six Nations Championships England were favoured to win by many pundits after they beat the world champion New Zealand team in December 2012. France, enjoying a winning streak prior to the competition, were also considered strong contenders. In contrast defending champions Wales had suffered seven consecutive defeats (4 versus Australia) and were without their regular head coach Warren Gatland. Expectations regarding England and Wales were confirmed in the first round of matches, played on 2 February, with England enjoying a convincing 38–18 victory against Scotland and Wales losing 22–30 against Ireland despite a Welsh comeback from 3-30 down just after half time. France however were upset in their first game, going down 23–18 against Italy. The following week both England and Wales won their matches, against Ireland and France respectively. Scotland meanwhile beat Italy 34–10 in the other game, their first Six Nations victory since 2011. In round three Wales defeated Italy 9–26 and England beat France 23–13. In the remaining match, Scotland defeated Ireland for a second consecutive victory. Wales won their round four clash against Scotland 26-13 and in the process achieved a record fifth consecutive away win in the Six Nations. England remained undefeated after beating Italy 18-11. Ireland and France tied 13–13, giving France their first points in the competition.\nEngland having won all four matches to this point (on 8 points) and Wales with three victories (6 points) meant that their match against each other in the final week, on 16 March, would determine the champions. A victory by Wales would give them two points and put them on equal footing with England. If they won by more than seven points they would move ahead on points differential and retain the title. England were slight favourites heading into the game due to their unbeaten run, although Wales had the advantage of a more experienced side and playing at home in the Millennium Stadium. Going into the final round Scotland were on 4 points, Ireland on 3, Italy on 2 and France on 1. Italy ended up beating Ireland and Scotland lost to France, giving Scotland and Italy 4 points each (with Scotland finishing ahead on points differential) and Ireland and France 3 points each (with Ireland finishing ahead on points differential). France ended up with the wooden spoon, the first time they had finished last in the competition since 1999.\nWales defeated England by an emphatic 30–3, their biggest ever win over England. At half time Wales had just a 9-3 lead, with three penalties to fullback Leigh Halfpenny against one from England's Owen Farrell. The first 20 minutes of the second half saw Wales score points through a try to winger Alex Cuthbert, and another penalty goal to Halfpenny. This gave them a comfortable 17-3 lead heading into the last quarter of the game. Wales fly half Dan Biggar dropped a goal, which was then followed by a second try to Cuthbert in the 66th minute to put the game beyond England. Biggar kicked a final penalty with 10 minutes to go to give Wales their 30–3 victory.

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by David Gower",
        "text": "David Gower is an English former cricketer who batted with a graceful style as part of the top order for the England cricket team for over a decade. He scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 18 occasions in Test cricket, and 7 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He was named as a \"Wisden\" Cricketer of the Year in 1979 for his performances the previous year, which included being the youngest batsman to score a century for England since Peter May in 1951. He was appointed to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992 for services to sports, and in 2009 was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nGower made his Test debut for England in June 1978 against Pakistan at Edgbaston, Birmingham. He achieved his first century in Test cricket later that year, scoring 111 runs against New Zealand at The Oval, London. The following summer, Gower scored his first double-century, remaining unbeaten on 200 off 279 deliveries, in a batting innings described as \"effortless\" by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". He did not pass a hundred again until 1981, when he scored 154 not out against the West Indies, his runs coming off 403 deliveries at a strike rate of 38.21 – his lowest when scoring a century. Across 1984 and 1985, Gower struck five centuries in Test cricket, and on each occasion he passed 150 runs. Three of these centuries were scored during the 1985 Ashes, in which Gower was named as Man of the Series. In the fifth match he reached his highest score in Test cricket, amassing 215 runs and sharing a partnership of 331 with Tim Robinson. At the time, it was the sixth largest partnership for England, but in the next match Gower and Graham Gooch surpassed it, putting on 351 runs together. Gower's final Test century was scored in January 1991, when he reached 123 against Australia. In total, nine of Gower's eighteen Test centuries came during Ashes series, the fourth most by any batsman.\nIn ODI cricket, Gower's first century came in his second match for England, played against Pakistan in 1978, when he was 114 not out at the close of the innings. He was most prolific in 1983, when he scored four of his seven centuries in ODIs. Three of these centuries were scored against New Zealand during the 1982–83 World Series Cup, earning him the accolade of Man of the Preliminary Series. In the fourth match of the competition he scored 158 runs, which in the context of ODI cricket was both his highest score, and at the time, the highest score by any England batsman. Despite playing ODI cricket for England until 1991, Gower's final century in the format came in June 1985 against Australia, when he scored 102."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Nemzeti Bajnokság I was the fifty-ninth series of the national team handball championship for Hungarian women. Győri ETO KC were the defending champions and they retained the championship by going undefeated throughout the season. The competition began on 2 September 2009, and ended on 27 March 2010. The playoffs ended on 15 May, with Váci NKSE beating Békéscsabai ENKSE thus taking the bronze medal.\nOverview.\nTeams.\nVasas SC and PTE-PEAC were relegated to the 2009–10 Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B after finishing the 2008–09 season in the bottom two places. 1982 European Champions Cup winners, Vasas SC, ended a forty-two-year spell in the top division, having played in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I since 1967. Newcomers PTE-PEAC, the handball team of the University of Pécs, suffered relegation after just one season.\nDespite ranking seventh in the last year's championship, Tajtavill-Nyíradony had to leave the competition, after they lost many of their sponsors and faced serious financial trouble. Team president János Tajta, who spent about 200–300 million Hungarian forint (about 1 million Euro) on the team during his five-year ownership, announced on 8 July 2010, that the club was finished and withdrew from all competitions.\nThe three teams were replaced by newly promoted Hunnia KSK, Veszprém Barabás KC and Siófok KC.\nThe league comprised two teams from Budapest (Ferencvárosi TC, Hunnia KSK), three clubs from Central Transdanubia (Alcoa Fehérvár KC, Dunaújvárosi NKKSE and Veszprém Barabás KC), three teams from the Southern Great Plain (ASA-Consolis Hódmezővásárely, Kiskunhalas NKSE-Bravotel and Mondi Békéscsabai ENKSE); and one each from Western Transdanubia (Győri Audi ETO KC), Southern Transdanubia (Siófok KC), Central Hungary (Váci NKSE) and the Northern Great Plain (DVSC-Korvex).\nIn the regular season, the sides played twice against each other side, on a home leg and an away leg. The top four teams qualified for the playoffs, in which a best-of-three system was used. Teams ranked fifth to ninth, and tenth to twelfth, decided their final rank in a classification round, using a round robin system, playing six additional rounds. They were also awarded bonus points according their final position in the regular season.\nLeague champions and runners-up enter the 2010–2011 EHF Champions League, while the next two teams following them have the right to take part in the 2010–11 EHF Cup. The bottom two clubs get relegated.\nPostseason.\nThe postseason was officially called \"Arany Ászok Rájátszás\", after brewing company SABMiller bought the naming rights and changed its name to promote the Arany Ászok beer. The playoffs started on 10 April 2010 and ran until 15 May 2010.\nClassification round 9–12.\nBottom four teams after the regular season entered a classification round, in which they tried to avoid relegation. The sides faced each other in a double round robin system and were given additional points according to their final position in the regular season. Ninth placed Veszprém Barabás KC got four points, tenth placed Hódmezővásárhely were awarded three, Kiskunhalas took two points and even last placed Hunnia KSK were given one point.\nTable.\nAdditional points that were awarded after the final positions in the regular season (minus any point deductions) are indicated in the bonus points column.\nClassification round 5–8.\nTeams ranked between fifth and eighth place, after the first part of the season, were drawn into another group. Similar to the classification round for 9–12 places, clubs were rewarded with bonus points depending on their position in the regular season.\nTable.\nAdditional points that were awarded after the final positions in the regular season are indicated in bonus points column.\nChampionship playoff.\nThe top four teams of the regular season continued the battle for the title in a best-of-three playoff system, in which if a match ends with a draw, the winner is decided by penalty shootout. Top ranked Győr met with Békéscsaba, while Vác enjoyed home court advantage over DVSC, after topping the Debrecen-based club by one point in the regular season."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of George Washington (Washington Circle)",
        "text": "Lieutenant General George Washington is an 1860 equestrian statue of George Washington, at Washington Circle, at the edge of the George Washington University's campus, in Washington, D.C. The statue was sculpted by Clark Mills, who also created the equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson in front of the White House. The traffic circle where the statue is located was one of the original city designs by Pierre Charles L'Enfant. The statue and surrounding park are in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood at the intersection of 23rd Street, New Hampshire Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. The K Street NW underpass runs beneath the circle.\nThe idea of honoring George Washington, the first U.S. president, one of the Founding Fathers, and military leader of the American Revolutionary War, was first authorized by the Congress of the Confederation in 1783. Despite periodic calls for the erection of a statue honoring Washington, nothing happened until future President James Buchanan made inquiries into why the statue was never installed. Congress authorized the statue and its installation in 1853 at a cost of $50,000, which was later increased to $60,000. Mills' original design included a three-tier pedestal with intricate designs. Due to a lack of funding, that was never built. The final product was a marble pedestal that is somewhat simple. The horse's design was praised, but Washington's portrayal was frowned upon by critics.\nThe unveiling and dedication ceremony occurred in February 1860, not long before the American Civil War began. The keynote speaker at the ceremony, U.S. Representative Thomas S. Bocock, would become Speaker of the Confederate States Congress within a year. Amongst the notable attendees at the event included the president, the vice president, members of the Supreme Court, and members of the Senate. The event was delayed due to weather, but a half-mile long (0.8 km) procession marched from the District of Columbia City Hall to the statue. Many of those who marched were active members of the military and veterans. \nThe statue was almost moved twice to Lafayette Square to be replaced with the Mills' statue of Jackson. It was repaired in the 1920s and moved in the 1960s when the underpass beneath Washington Circle was built. The statue is one of 14 American Revolution Statuary that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. The statue is also a contributing property to the L'Enfant Plan, listed on the NRHP in 1997.\nHistory.\nBiographies.\nGeorge Washington.\nGeorge Washington was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732, to a privileged family. Although he did not attend a well-known school or university, Washington received education at the Lower Church in Hartfield, Virginia. He was an avid writer and later surveyed what was then the frontier of the Thirteen Colonies. He later trained as a soldier and led the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. Washington then served in the House of Burgesses before war broke out between the colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and played a major role in winning the American Revolutionary War. After resigning as commander-in-chief in 1783, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, helping draft the Constitution and becoming one of the Founding Fathers. He served two terms as President of the United States, setting precedents that were followed by future presidents. After his second term was over, Washington retired and spent his last two years at Mount Vernon.\nClark Mills.\nClark Mills was born September 1, 1815, in New York. He received limited education and later worked a number of jobs, including as a lumberjack and carpenter. In 1837, Mills moved to Charleston, South Carolina, and became an ornamental plasterer, working at his studio. His techniques improved in the 1840s and he began making plaster life-masks. With these masks, he then began making busts. According to historian and educator E. Wayne Craven, \"What [Mills] learned he acquired from the life-mask itself, and this established his style as one strongly dependent upon naturalism.\" His first notable client was former Vice President John C. Calhoun, whom he made a bust of in 1845. In addition to his studio in Charleston, Mills built a studio on The Ellipse nea the White House in 1849. It was at that studio Mills sculpted the equestrian statue of President Andrew Jackson and the George Washington equestrian statue. One of his most prominent death masks was that of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. After his retirement, Mills continued living in Washington, D.C., and died in 1883.\nMemorial plans.\nOn August 7, 1783, the Congress of the Confederation voted for a statue to be erected in honor of Washington. Nothing happened though, and despite officials calling for a statue during the next few decades, the plan never came into fruition. Future President James Buchanan led the cause for a statue to be erected, referencing the earlier resolution made by the House of Representatives in 1799. After Mills debuted his equestrian sculpture of Andrew Jackson, the U.S. Congress commissioned Mills to make another memorial, this time honoring Washington. The Act of Congress passed on January 25, 1853, for the Washington statue, and $50,000 was appropriated for the installation. It was expected to be just as good if not more grand than the Jackson statue. The first site chosen, beside the Washington Monument, was eliminated. It is unknown why the location of the statue was chosen, but the circle, nicknamed \"Round Tops\" at the time, was improved in 1855 by adding wooden fences. The following year, shrubs and trees were planted.\nThe pedestal for the statue was to be a large and elaborate work. Plans included a three-tiered base with bas-reliefs panels and small equestrian statues of Washington's generals from the war. The plan for that was cancelled due to a lack of funding. The result was a smaller pedestal with no elaborate details. On February 24, 1860, an additional $10,000 would be approved by Congress for the work, just a few days after it was unveiled. The statue and pedestal were finished by the end of 1859, and plans were made for the unveiling and dedication ceremony of the city's second outdoor monument at that time.\nDedication.\nThe unveiling and dedication ceremony took place on Washington's birthday, February 22, in 1860. The \"Alexandria Gazette and Virginia Advertiser\" described the ceremony as \"the event of the season.\" According to historian Constance McLaughlin Green, the ceremony was the \"last great public nonpartisan demonstration in the ante-bellum capital\" as the Civil War began the following year. Researcher Jason Bezis said \"It came at a moment of great tension as John Brown's failed raid on Harper's Ferry occurred just a few months earlier.\"\nOn the morning of the ceremony, a significant amount of rain fell, causing Pennsylvania Avenue to be very muddy. Due to the weather and the delay of the 7th Regiment's arrival, the event was postponed until 3pm. A contingent met at the District of Columbia City Hall and proceeded to march up Pennsylvania Avenue to the statue. Those that participated in the march included a large number of active military members and veterans. Along Pennsylvania Avenue, building were decorated with flags and other patriotic items. When the marchers walked past the White House, President Buchanan and others joined them to the ceremony site. In total, the procession was approximately a half-mile long (0.8 km). When the ceremony began at 5pm, the temporary stands were full of people, as was the surrounding area.\nAmongst the prominent attendees were the president, Vice President John C. Breckinridge, the Speaker of the House William Pennington, members of the Supreme Court and Senate, and foreign diplomats. Reverend Barnard H. Nadal began the ceremony with prayer. Senator James H. Hammond of South Carolina introduced U.S. Representative Thomas S. Bocock of Virginia, who would become the Speaker of the Confederate States Congress the following year, to give the keynote address. His remarks included the location of the statue was an \"appropriate spot where the summer sunbeams latest linger, and where the breezes from the blue hills of [Washington's] own native and beloved Virginia delight to play.\" Following Bocock's speech, President Buchanan spoke. According to the National Park Service, \"President Buchanan's remarks were far more foreboding: \"May Washington City, which [Washington] founded, continue throughout many generations to be the seat of government of a great, powerful and united confederacy. Should it ever become a ruin by a dissolution of the Union, it will...teach the lesson to all the dwellers upon earth that our grand political experiment has failed, and that man is incapable of self-government...\" Buchanan wore Washington's Masonic apron and used his gavel to officially dedicated the statue.\nLater history.\nThe surrounding area slowly developed after the statue was installed. Some improvements were made to the circle, including an iron fence replacing the wooden one in 1869, and in the 1880s, the hiring of a watchman to monitor and maintain the park. The park had 48 different species of trees by the early 1900s. When additional Revolutionary War statues were being installed on the corners of Lafayette Square, including the statue of the Comte de Rochambeau and the statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, it was suggested the statue of Washington should be relocated to one of the corners. The plan also called for moving the equestrian Jackson statue to Washington Circle and renaming it Jackson Circle. Despite some support, the plan was eventually cancelled. Due to weather damage, in 1923 the Washington statue was taken to Roman Bronze Works for repairs. During this time, the plan to switch the memorials came up again, this time being supported by President Warren G. Harding. Because Jackson was a Democrat and the Washington statue was dedicated by Buchanan, a Republican, the changes were adamantly opposed by Southern Democrats, and the plan once again was cancelled.\nIn the early 1960s, the K Street underpass was built below Washington Circle. This required the removal of the statue. It was returned to its original location in 1963. On July 14, 1978, the Washington statue and 13 other Revolutionary War statues were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The statues were added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites (DCIHS) on March 3, 1979. In addition, the statue is a contributing property to the L'Enfant Plan, which was added to the DCIHS on November 8, 1964, and to the NRHP on April 24, 1997. In 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, the statue was vandalized with the words \"FREE GAZA\" painted in red on the pedestal.\nLocation and design.\nThe Washington statue is located on the city's Reservation 26, in the center of Washington Circle, a traffic circle and park in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The busy traffic circle is where 23rd Street, New Hampshire Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue NW intersect. K Street NW passes through in a tunnel under the circle. The circle is across the street from George Washington University Hospital and Schneider Triangle. The park and statue are both owned and maintained by the National Park Service.\nThe bronze statue of Washington and his horse is 9-feet tall (2.7 m), 14-feet long (4.3 m), and faces east towards the White House. Washington is depicted sitting erect and wearing his miliary uniform as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. His face is modelled after the sculpture of Washington by Jean-Antoine Houdon. The uniform includes a long jacket with fringed epaulets and a three-cornered hat. He is holding a sword in his left hand and the right hand is holding the reins of his horse. He is approaching the opposing forces at the Battle of Princeton in 1777.\nThe wild horse is depicted as one that was taken from a prairie near Fort Leavenworth. It is standing on three legs and looks as if it has been startled. The horse's details including veins, a mane, and tail, have been admired by historians. There were critics as well who disliked the startled look on the horse's face compared to Washington's relaxed appearance. The statue stands on a marble pedestal measuring 9.8-feet tall (3 m) and 15-feet long (4.6 m). The pedestal has been repaired with cement when cracks appear. On the front (east side) of the pedestal, just below the statue, is the inscription \"WASHINGTON\". Also on the pedestal's east side is the inscription \"CLARK MILLS/SCULPTOR\". The name of the founder is located on the left leg of the horse."

A native of Charleston, South Carolina, Moore finished his career as one of the greatest players in Southern Conference history.\nDuring his four-year tenure at Furman, Moore averaged 16.9 points per game, became one of only three players in conference history to be named First Team All-SoCon four times, was a two-time SoCon Basketball tournament MVP and was twice named the Southern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He scored 2,299 points and grabbed 1,242 rebounds, placing him on an exclusive list of NCAA Division I men's basketball players to achieve both of those milestones. Through the 2009–10 season, his rebounds total is sixth all-time in conference history, while his points total ranks eighth.\nAfter his collegiate career ended, Moore was selected in the third round (64th overall) in the 1980 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. However, he never played a game in the league. Moore spent the first season out of college in Italy playing for Nuova Pallacanestro Vigevano with another Furman alumnus, Clyde Mayes. He was hoping to become more NBA-ready by playing a year of professional basketball abroad and then try to make the Pistons' roster for the season, but ultimately it never worked out. Moore played 14 seasons in Finland's Korisliiga from 1983 to 1998, and holds also a Finnish citizenship."

The start of the final was aggressive but slow as a lot of elbows were flying as athletes maneuvered for position at a slow pace. 1991 champion and Olympic champion Hassiba Boulmerka wanted to go into her customary second spot but found it difficult to find a leader. After 200 meters, Yvonne Graham ran around the crowd to self nominate herself into the lead, followed by Boulmerka. The leaders remained in that position for a kilometer, with the chasers right behind jockeying for position. Coming in to the final lap, Kelly Holmes had positioned herself in third place. Crossing the start line for the final time, the fireworks began. Boulmerka ran past Graham with Holmes less than a metre behind. With 200 to go, Boulmerka and Holmes were running stride for stride, Holmes on the outside of the turn. Carla Sacramento was the next chaser and the medalists were decided with a breakaway. By the end of the turn, Boulmerka had won the battle, but she pulled into lane 2.

        "title": "Lions Municipal Golf Course",
        "text": "Lions Municipal Golf Course, nicknamed Muny, is a municipal golf course at 2901 Enfield Road in Austin, Texas. The golf course occupies 141 acres of land the City of Austin leases from the University of Texas since 1937 as part of the greater Brackenridge Tract. The golf course has been subject to ongoing controversy due to the recommended termination of the current term by the University of Texas in 2019. A report commissioned by the city found that Muny's burdensome property lease payment is a primary challenge in operating Austin's public golf courses.\nHistory.\nLions Municipal Golf Course was established in 1924 by Austin Lions Club members with a vision for a modern, inclusive municipal golf course. Lions Municipal was the first public golf course and clubhouse in Austin and would remain so until July 1949 when Austin's “North Side” Municipal Golf Course—today Hancock Golf Course—opened on the grounds of the old Austin Country Club.\nB. F. Rowe, recognized as the first Lions Club member to propose the municipal golf course, volunteered to oversee its design and construction. By the fall of 1924 the heavily wooded tract had been converted into an attractive nine-hole golf course. Construction of the back nine holes completed the course by September 1925. The course clubhouse, designed by Edwin C. Kreisle, opened in 1930.\nThe University of Texas golf team first competed in the Southwest Conference in May 1928 in a tournament held at Lions Municipal. Inaugural coach of the Longhorns golf team, Tom Penick earned two conference titles during his 1927–30 tenure. He also served as the head golf professional at Lions Municipal from 1927 to 1961. He was succeeded at UT by his brother Harvey Penick, the legendary golf coach who earned twenty NCAA conference titles during 1931–63. Lions Municipal would remain a favorite hometown course for the UT Golf Team. In April 1948, the UT golfers voted to play home matches with other Southwest Conference schools, as well as their own weekly challenge matches, at the Lions Municipal course.\nOn December 17, 1936, the Austin Municipal Golf and Amusement Association transferred their lease for the course to the City of Austin. Ever since the Association was dissolved on April 21, 1938, Lions Municipal Golf Course has been known by several names but often summarized with the nickname “Lions Muny” or, more succinctly, “Muny.” After assuming the lease from the Austin Lions Club, the City of Austin initiated a series of improvements to the course and grounds in 1936–39.\nIn 1972 UT regent Chairman Frank Erwin wanted to turn a profit on the 150-acre property. He sought to end the lease and sell the land to developers.\nGolfers and neighborhood activists joined forces with the city to stop the sale. \nOne activist, Mary Arnold, was familiar with land-use history and knew that in 1910 when the George Brackenridge family donated the land there were conditions to prevent UT from selling the land.\nIn 1973 after months of wrangling, the city and UT struck a deal that allowed the city to lease the land for 1$ a year until 1987. In return the city paid to upgrade and move Red River Street for UT.\nThe Save Muny organization was created in 1987 to assure Muny remained city owned and open to the public. Save Muny, the city and UT came to another temporary agreement in 1987. Rent would go up $175,000 a year and then would increase every five years, until it would be $425,000 a year in 2017. Save Muny sought a new deal in 1989. After negotiations the city's lease was extended to 2019. By 2008 the city was paying UT $345,600 a year.\nAs of 2019 the city was paying UT $500,000 per year to lease the golf course land.\nHogan's Hole.\nWorld Golf Hall of Famer, Ben Hogan, played with Harvey Penick (against Ed Hopkins and Morris Williams Jr.]) in an exhibition match at Muny in 1950 prior to the 1950 US Open. During the match, it is said that Hogan stood on the tee box of the daunting seventh hole (currently #16) and asked “Where’s the fairway?”.\nAlbert Warren “Tilly” Tillinghast, eminent golf course architect, is said to have “emboldened” the seventh hole by moving the green up a hill and adding space for a water hazard. Tillinghast began a national tour of golf courses in the summer of 1935 as a consultant for the Professional Golfers' Association of America. He consulted at Lions Municipal in December 1936, praising the course as “very prettily situated” and suggesting changes to tees and greens on the third, seventh, and eighth holes. Hogan went on to birdie this now-famous Par 4, known as ‘Hogan’s Hole’. After the match, Hogan apparently signed a few autographs and commented that the course was “so good, it makes you think you’re not in Texas.”\nDesegregation of Muny.\nMuny was the first public golf course in the South to desegregate. As such, the course also plays a pivotal role in the history of race relations in public recreational spaces. The story of Muny's desegregation and its historical context strongly reverberates in our nation's culture and democratic traditions. African Americans helped to construct Muny and later worked at the course as caddies. But until 1950, African American golfers in Austin were relegated to playing golf in places like Rosewood Playground where there were complaints of golf balls hitting children as well as breaking windows and windshields.`\nIn late 1950 – following the Supreme Court’s decision in Sweatt v. Painter but well before Brown v Board of Education – Muny quietly became the first desegregated public golf course in the southern United States.\nMayor Taylor Glass recalled rushing to City Hall sometime during late 1950 to consult with two other council members (Mayor Pro Tem Bill Drake and Will Johnson) about whether to arrest two young African Americans who had walked on to play Lions Municipal Golf Course (Figure 18). Together they decided to let them play, and the two youths completed their round without interference or arrest.\nAccording to interviews with former African American caddies, blacks could play freely thereafter at Muny. The course regularly attracted black golfers from the region and across Texas. Joe Louis, the former heavyweight-boxing champion and, at that time, golf’s ambassador to black America, played the course in July 1953, shooting near par.\nThe desegregation of Muny and then other local facilities during 1950–1954 occurred without publicized debate or conflict, in contrast to the hostile resistance against the desegregation of public facilities that characterized many communities in the South. What occurred at Muny in late 1950 and early 1951 is without question the first instance in the Southern states of the old confederacy when a municipal golf course was integrated.\nFollowing Muny’s desegregation, the racial integration of other public facilities in Austin also occurred well before Brown v. Board of Education. In December 1951, the Austin public library system was integrated. And in 1952, three “precedent-breaking Negro fireman” were appointed and assigned to an integrated fire station on Lydia Street.\nNotable Tournaments and Players.\nLions Municipal has hosted the Firecracker amateur tournament every year in July since 1945. Notable past champions include: Bill Penn (Texas Golf Hall of Fame), Randy Petri (PGA Tour), Ben Crenshaw (World Golf Hall of Fame and PGA Tour), Tom Kite (World Golf Hall of Fame and PGA Tour), and Omar Uresti (PGA Tour).\nDuring its long history, Muny has hosted (and drawn praise from) numerous distinguished golfers. In 1948, World Golf Hall of Famer Byron Nelson played at Lions Municipal and declared it to be “one of the finest courses in this part of the country”.\nWorld Golf Hall of Famer Ben Crenshaw grew up in Austin, just blocks from Lions Municipal where he honed his game as a youth. He was the youngest player to win the Austin Men's City Championship in 1967, earning two more victories in 1968 and 1969 before retiring from the event. He played golf at the University of Texas, supporting team championships in 1971 and 1972. Crenshaw is the only player to win the NCAA individual championship in three consecutive years (1971–73). In 1972 he shared the honors with teammate Tom Kite. Winner of nineteen PGA Tour events and two-time Masters Tournament champion in 1984 and 1995, Crenshaw still returns regularly to play at Muny where he shares the course record at 61. Tom Kite is another World Golf Hall of Famer who developed as a player at Lions Municipal. After moving to Austin at age 13, he was Crenshaw's friend and All-American teammate at the University of Texas where he was coached by Harvey Penick. Kite won nineteen events on the PGA Tour, including the 1992 U.S. Open, and played on seven U.S. Ryder Cup teams, serving as captain in 1997.\nSave Muny Initiative.\nThe SaveMuny initiative has slowly gained traction as the current lease over the course expires in May 2019. Potential commercial development of the course has been explored, which prompted the National Trust for Historic Preservation to include the course on its annual list of \"11 Most Endangered Historic Places in America\" in 2017. Ben Crenshaw has been adamant in his support for the preservation of Muny."

        "text": "Samuel James Harris (born 3 May 1984) is an Australian former professional basketball player. He played 10 seasons in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) and spent two seasons in the National Basketball League (NBL). At 221 cm, he is the tallest player ever to play in the NBL.\nEarly life.\nHarris was born in Launceston, Tasmania, and grew up in the suburb of Newnham. He started playing basketball in the late 1990s and attended Launceston College.\nIn 2001, Harris moved to Canberra to attend the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and play for the program's SEABL team. With Lake Ginninderra College at the 2001 National Schools Basketball Tournament in Ballarat, the 17-year-old Harris stood at 219 cm—4 cm taller than the previous student record. He continued on with the AIS in 2002, 2003 and 2004, playing in the SEABL each year.\nCollege career.\nBetween 2004 and 2008, Harris played college basketball for Old Dominion University in the United States. As a freshman, on 27 November 2004, he scored a career-high 14 points. In 126 games for the Monarchs over four seasons, he made 17 starts and averaged 1.8 points and 1.5 rebounds in 7.5 minutes per game.\nProfessional career.\nHarris returned to Tasmania in May 2008 and played out the SEABL season with the NW Tasmania Thunder.\nIn late April 2008, Harris signed with the Singapore Slingers for the 2008–09 NBL season. However, the team withdrew from the NBL in late July 2008 to pursue competitions closer to home. Harris remained with the squad that was kept together, with the Slingers engaging in a series of touring matches during the 2008–09 season, most notably the Singapore Challenge Series that ended in January 2009. In 11 games during the Challenge Series, Harris averaged 6.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game.\nFor the 2009 SEABL season, Harris returned to the NW Tasmania Thunder, where he averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds while finishing with 73 blocked shots.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2009 SEABL season, Harris moved to Perth to train with the Perth Wildcats ahead of the 2009–10 NBL season. He was elevated to the full squad in mid-October as an injury replacement for Paul Rogers, and was later replaced in the line-up by American Galen Young in late December. He remained a member of the Wildcats' shadow squad for the rest of the season, and in March 2010, he became an NBL champion when the Wildcats defeated the Wollongong Hawks in the grand final series. He totalled six points and seven rebounds in six games for the Wildcats.\nHarris remained in Perth during the 2010 off-season and played for the East Perth Eagles in the SBL.\nIn June 2010, Harris began to dabble in the prospect of switching to Australian rules football, as he was recruited by West Perth Football Club with the plan being to debut in the WAFL with the Falcons in 2011.\nAhead of the 2010–11 NBL season, Harris had been in contention for a full NBL contract with the Wildcats but missed out due to the club's need to satisfy a league rule to sign an under-24 player. As a result, in August 2010, he joined the training squad of the Adelaide 36ers. He played two games for the 36ers in November 2010.\nFollowing the 2010–11 NBL season, Harris joined the Bendigo Braves for the 2011 SEABL season. He went on to split the 2012 SEABL season with the Hobart Chargers and NW Tasmania Thunder. He returned to the Thunder in 2013 for one final season.\nNational team career.\nHarris was a member of the Australian under 18 squad in 1999 and 2000, and a member of the Australian under 20 squad in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, he helped Australia win gold at the FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Greece. In 2005, he played for Australia at the FIBA Under-21 World Championship.\nPersonal.\nHarris' father is 196 cm and his mother is 177 cm."

        "title": "1999 Cricket World Cup 2nd semi-final",
        "text": "The second semi-final of the 1999 Cricket World Cup was a One Day International (ODI) match played on 17 June 1999 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham, England. It was played between South Africa and Australia. The match ended in a tie after a run out between Allan Donald and Lance Klusener ended the match which resulted in Australia winning a place in the final where they would play against Pakistan.\nBackground.\nThe two teams had faced each other in a Super six match, which would eventually prove to be the deciding factor in determining which of the two teams would qualify for the final. South Africa batted first and put up a competitive total, with Herschelle Gibbs scoring 101. In reply, Australia began losing wickets at regular intervals. The turning point of the match occurred when captain Steve Waugh was dropped by Gibbs at short mid-wicket, as Gibbs attempted to throw the ball up into the air in celebration, only for the ball to slip through his fingers. After the dropped chance, Waugh was reported to have famously said to Gibbs \"You've just dropped the World Cup\". Waugh denied saying this, but the quote has lived on in cricketing folklore. Waugh went on to score an unbeaten 120 and guided Australia home by 5 wickets. \nHad Australia not won this game they would have been knocked out of the World Cup. However, with this victory they tied with South Africa on six points at end of the Super Six round and the teams finished in second and third places, respectively, when net-run-rate was used to differentiate them. Thus Australia finished ahead of South Africa in the table, which meant that, under the rules for this competition, in the event of a tie in the semi-final Australia would proceed to the final.\nThe match.\nDetails.\nSouth Africa won the toss and elected to field. In steaming conditions, Australia managed to put up a total of 213 with Michael Bevan and Steve Waugh scoring vital half-centuries. Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald tore through the middle and lower order picking up 9 of the ten wickets between them. South Africa began their chase steadily with Kirsten and Gibbs putting on a good opening partnership. Wickets then fell at regular intervals as South Africa collapsed to 61–4. Jonty Rhodes and Jacques Kallis then put together a vital partnership taking South Africa within 69 runs of victory. Through some valuable runs from Mark Boucher and Pollock, and some big hitting from Lance Klusener, South Africa moved closer to the target\nFinal Over.\nSouth Africa entered the final over at 205/9, needing a further nine runs to win. The two men at the crease were Lance Klusener who was on strike and Allan Donald at the other end. Damien Fleming was the bowler.\nAt that point, the Australian captain, Steve Waugh, brought his field up inside the circle to prevent a single being taken.\nAustralia tied the match and went into the final against Pakistan.\nLegacy.\nAustralia went on to win the final at Lord's, beating Pakistan by eight wickets after bowling them out cheaply. They would then go on to win the 2003 and 2007 World Cups, and achieve a run of 34 World Cup matches without losing (which finally ended when they lost to Pakistan in the group stage of the 2011 World Cup).\nSouth Africa, on the other hand, maintained their trend of choking or bad luck at the World Cup: in 1992 they had lost to England in the semi-finals when rain forced them to score 21 runs off the final ball, and in 1996 they had won all their group matches before losing to West Indies in the quarter-finals. The trend also went on to continue, as in 2003 as hosts, a Duckworth/Lewis miscalculation meant they tied Sri Lanka in their final group game at Kingsmead when victory would have seen them advancing to the Super Six. In 2015, they won their first knockout game against Sri Lanka and set co-host New Zealand a record World Cup knockout game chase target in their semifinal at Eden Park – and it might have been bigger had rain not shortened the South African innings – but miscues and the heroics of South African-born Grant Elliott undid them as New Zealand advanced to their first Cricket World Cup final.\nSouth African coach Bob Woolmer resigned after this match. In 2007, shortly before his death, he revealed that Donald and most of his team-mates were in tears after the result and put towels over their heads so no-one could see them.\nThe \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" opened its report of the match with: \"This was not merely the match of the tournament: it must have been the best one-day international of the 1,483 so far played. The essence of the one-day game is a close finish, and this was by far the most significant to finish in the closest way of all – with both teams all out for the same score. But it was a compressed epic all the way through, and it ended in a savage twist.\" In 2000, the match featured among CricInfo's 100 great matches of the 20th century. Steve Waugh called it \"the best game of cricket I've played\", while in 2004 \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" ranked it the 20th-biggest moment in Australian cricket. In 2010, \"The Times\" rated South Africa's choke in the final over as the second-biggest sporting choke of all time. In 2009, Shaun Pollock revealed that when betting at the Durban July horse race shortly after the match, he was told \"Whatever you do, don't bet on number 10, he doesn't run\", a reference to Donald not running (he was wearing jersey number 10).\nThe twists, turns and close finish resulted in many observers regarding the match as the perfect One Day International from an entertainment perspective. The record-breaking ODI between Australia and South Africa seven years later, in 2006, continued the close rivalry between the two teams."

It is the successor of the Thailand Cricket League, which was formed in 1971 and elected to ICC in 1995. Since 2005, it's one of the associate member of the ICC. The main aims of the organization is to promote and popularize Cricket throughout all the provinces of Thailand and to propagate the “Spirit of Cricket”.\nCricket Association of Thailand operates all of the Thailand's national representative cricket sides, including the Thailand national cricket team, the Thailand national women's cricket team and youth sides as well. CAT is also responsible for organising and hosting the cricket matches of different formats with other nations, and scheduling the home international fixtures.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Thailand by the children of elite Thai families who learnt the game during education in England. They founded the Bangkok City Cricket Club in 1890, and the side played its first game in November of that year at \"Pramane\" ground (Later named Sanam Luang).\nBut cricket has never been a popular sport in Thailand, where other sports like football, Muay Thai, tennis and golf have high visibility. In 1971, after the establishment of Thailand Cricket League, cricket has been organized as competitive sport. The Sports Authority of Thailand renamed the TCL to the Cricket Association of Thailand in 2004. Since then many constructive efforts are made to popularize cricket among the Thai people. The past ten years has seen a heartening growth of the game at grass root level.\nBangkok Cricket League.\nThe Bangkok Cricket League is a professional league in Bangkok, which has run under the guidance of the Cricket Association of Thailand since 2002. It's the most premier and largest league of Cricket in Thailand which is also officially recognized by the Sports Authority of Thailand. It is run voluntarily and independently by a dedicated group of people in Bangkok and is completely self funded."

        "title": "2012 Ryder Cup",
        "text": "The 39th Ryder Cup was held September 28–30, 2012, in the United States at the Medinah Country Club in Medinah, Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago. This was the first time that the Ryder Cup was held in Illinois. Europe went into the competition as the cup holders, having won in 2010 to regain it. The team captains were Davis Love III for the U.S. and José María Olazábal for Europe.\nAt the start of the final day's play, the U.S. led 10–6 and required 4 points to win; Europe required 8 points to retain the cup and 8 to win it outright. Europe achieved one of the greatest comebacks in Ryder Cup history by winning eight and tying one of the 12 singles matches. Martin Kaymer's five-foot putt on the 18th hole to defeat Steve Stricker took the score to 14–13, allowing Europe to retain the cup with one match still in progress. Tiger Woods missed a putt on the final green and conceded the hole to Francesco Molinari, halving the final point and securing outright victory for the European team, 14–13. It was named by European media covering the event as the \"Miracle at Medinah\", and is widely regarded as one of the best sporting comebacks of all time and the greatest in Ryder Cup history.\nThe victory was Europe's second consecutive and fifth in the last six contests. European captain Olazábal dedicated the victory to his countryman Seve Ballesteros. The five-time major champion, who had scored 22 points in 37 matches and been part of four victorious European sides before captaining them to victory on home soil at Valderrama in 1997, had died of brain cancer in May 2011 at the age of 54, and in his memory, Team Europe wore navy blue and white garments – his traditional Sunday colors – on the final day. Additionally, the team's kit also bore the silhouette of Ballesteros famously celebrating his win at the 1984 Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format was:\nOn the first two days there were 4 foursome matches and 4 fourball matches, with the home captain choosing which were played in the morning and which in the afternoon.\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches are played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nCourse.\nAs part of its 2012 preparations, Medinah commissioned a $1.5 million greens renovation project on their Course No. 3, led by golf course architect Rees Jones. The project included a dramatic redesign of the 15th hole.\nThe redesigned 15th offers players with a 'risk-reward' opportunity with a driveable par-four by reducing its length by 100 yards and adding a two-acre lake that borders the right side of the fairway and green. The forward tee allows the hole to be set up as short as 280 yards. The original tee area of 392 yards from the championship tees will be preserved to provide the club with flexibility in course set-up.\nJones, who has overseen all architectural design aspects of Medinah's three golf courses since 2000, moved the 15th green to the left (south), which made way for the creation of a new back tee for the 16th hole. The tree-lined par-four now measures 15 yards longer – playing approximately 470 yards from the championship tees.\nThe major greens renovation took place on eleven of Course No. 3's original 18 greens and its main putting green, which was rebuilt to USGA specifications. Course No. 3's other six greens were re-grassed and the 15th green rebuilt.\nMedinah's Course No. 3 has hosted multiple major championships. The U.S. Open has been held at the course three times: 1949 (won by Cary Middlecoff), 1975 (Lou Graham), and 1990 (Hale Irwin). Tiger Woods has won both PGA Championships held at the course (1999 and 2006). Gary Player won the U.S. Senior Open in 1988.\nBefore the 2012 Ryder Cup, Europe players Lee Westwood and Sergio García criticised the course, particularly for its lack of rough, trees and other hazards. García said: \"There's not a lot of thinking when you get on the tee. You can pretty much hit it nice and hard and, even if you miss, pretty much every time you'll have a shot.\"\nThe course measures off the 'gold' tees.\nTelevision.\nAll matches were covered live in the United States. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange and Sean McDonough calling holes, and on-course reporters Andy North and Billy Kratzert. Scott Van Pelt hosted recaps during coverage. On Saturday, Golf Channel covered the first half-hour of the morning matches with Kelly Tilghman, Brandel Chamblee and Nick Faldo. NBC covered the remainder of the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch and Peter Jacobsen calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper. To bring a European perspective to the telecasts, former European Ryder Cup player Colin Montgomerie was utilized as a guest analyst by NBC on Saturday. NBC had previously used guest analysts for the Ryder Cup in 1999, 2002, and 2006\nThe matches were covered live in Europe by Sky Sports, with the BBC screening highlights later.\nTeam qualification and selection.\nUnited States.\nThe United States qualification rules remained the same as for 2010 and the team consisted of:\nThe leading players on the US Ryder Cup points list were:\nEurope.\nThe European team qualification rules changed after the 2010 contest. The European Points List took precedence over the World Points List, while the captain's picks were reduced from 3 to 2 with the top 5 players in the World Points List now qualifying rather than the top 4.\nThe team consisted of:\nOnly members of the European Tour could earn points in the above two lists. They could be full or affiliate members and must have also satisfied (or to be planning to satisfy) their membership obligations.

Captain Davis Love III came under scrutiny for his player selections, and \"USA Today\" centered its criticism on Tiger Woods, calling him a player the U.S. \"could not rely on\" and \"who at times appeared to be barely here\". Some American newspapers elected not to dedicate back-page columns to the event.\nThe European victory was met with elation across the continent. Spain's daily sport newspaper \"Marca\" ran the headline: \"This one is for you, Seve\". Britain's \"Daily Telegraph\" wrote that after an unprecedented summer of sporting achievements, including the Olympic Games in London, Bradley Wiggins' victory in the Tour de France and Andy Murray's first tennis major at the US Open, the Ryder Cup was incapable of \"dullness, one-sidedness, and hollow drama\" despite the looming anti-climax at the start of the singles matches on the final day. In a reference to the economic crisis on the continent, \"The Irish Times\" said that German Martin Kaymer had given Europe \"a massive bailout that contributed to the most unlikeliest comeback in Ryder Cup history\"."

        "text": "Phillip Eugene Taylor Sr. (born April 7, 1988) is an American former professional football player who was a nose tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected in the first round of the 2011 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions and Baylor Bears.\nHigh school career.\nA native of Clinton, Maryland, Taylor attended Gwynn Park High School, where he was a two-way lineman for head coach Dan Hayes.

Taylor took official visits to Maryland and Penn State only, despite also holding offers by Florida, Ohio State, and Virginia Tech, among others. In January 2006, Taylor committed to Penn State.\nCollege career.\nAfter sitting out the first half of his true freshman year at Penn State, Taylor made his collegiate debut against Michigan and went on to play the season's final seven games for the Nittany Lions. In his sophomore year, he sustained a knee injury during preseason drills but still managed to play 12 games on the season, starting the Nittany Lions' final five games. He was credited with 20 tackles, 12 solo efforts, with 6.5 tackles for loss resulting in loss of 26 yards. He also tallied 3.0 sacks, good for loss of 18 yards, and recovered two fumbles. His finale game for Penn State came at the Alamo Bowl against Texas A&amp;M with five-tackle performance that included one tackle for loss.\nIn October 2007, Taylor was among several Nittany Lions involved in a brawl during a fraternity party at HUB–Robeson Center. He pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct misdemeanor, and was put on probation by Joe Paterno. In the summer of 2008, Taylor and Chris Baker were involved in a minor pool party fracas, which resulted in both being ejected from the team. Taylor eventually transferred to Baylor in September 2008 and sat out the season in compliance with NCAA Division I transfer policy.\nAs a junior in 2009, Taylor earned his first Baylor letter, playing all 12 games and started nine.

He entered his senior year having shed almost 30 pounds, and started all 13 games at nose guard. He totaled 62 tackles (35 solo)—the most by a Baylor interior lineman since Ethan Kelley in 2002—, seven for loss including two sacks, three QB hurries, two pass breakups and one forced fumble. In his final college career game, the Texas Bowl against Illinois, Taylor had a career-high 10 tackles.\nProfessional career.\nFor his physical abilities, Taylor was projected a safe first-round selection in the 2011 NFL draft. He was drafted 21st overall by the Cleveland Browns. Taylor was the highest-selected Baylor defensive tackle since Daryl Gardener in 1996.\nCleveland Browns.\nAfter a four-day holdout, Taylor signed a four-year contract worth $8.1 million. During his rookie season, Taylor started every game and finished the season with 59 tackles, 4 sacks, and a forced fumble. Taylor was a major standout in his rookie season, outperforming higher picks of the same position such as Nick Fairley and Corey Liuget.\nTaylor was also selected to the \"Pro Football Weekly\" All-Rookie team of 2011, with teammate Jabaal Sheard.\nOn September 1, 2015, the Browns released Taylor.\nTaylor started 42 games for the Cleveland Browns, posting seven sacks and 69 tackles.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn February 22, 2016, Taylor signed with the Denver Broncos.

        "text": "Carl David Watson (January 6, 1941 – March 13, 2021) was a former a professional American football player who played offensive lineman for two seasons for the Boston Patriots.\nBiography.\nWatson is considered one of the best athletes in the history of Eufaula High School where he starred for the Tigers in football and basketball (1954-1958). He played under legendary Eufaula High coaches A. W. \"Bill\" Buchanan in football (the Tigers record was 27-9 during Watson's playing career at Eufaula) and basketball under Jack Powell where he played on a district championship team during his senior year. Watson was a two time All-State selection in high school, as a two-way lineman, and was a three time All-SEC performer at Georgia Tech (1959-1963). He was chosen AP lineman of the week in 1961 for his outstanding play against Duke University. In the game, he recorded 12 individual tackles, numerous assists, and a fumble recovery while playing on both sides of the ball. Watson was chosen Most Valuable Lineman in the 1962-1963 Hula Bowl college all-star game and is a member of the All Time Gator Bowl team.\nIn 1962, Watson played in one of Georgia Tech's biggest wins in their storied football history. The Bobby Dodd coached Jackets upset Bear Bryant's Alabama Crimson Tide, in Atlanta, on November 14 of that year. The Tide was ranked #1 in the country and led by All-America quarterback Joe Namath. The 7-6 Jackets' victory gave Alabama its only loss of the year and ended the Tide's quest for a second straight national championship in what many Tech fans consider the greatest game ever played at Historic Grant Field.\nHe went on to play professional football with the Boston Patriots in the old American Football League (1963-1964) and the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (1965). He is a member of the Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame (the Wiregrass is a region in southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia, and northwest Florida; it is also known as the peanut growing capital of the world).\nAfter his playing career ended he returned to Georgia Tech and earned a master's degree in Electrical Engineering. Dave had three children, Lynne, Neal, and Amy. He retired and lived near Pine Mountain, Georgia until his death in 2021."

One of the rationales was to improve working conditions. For NBA beat writers, the league did not have a specific policy regarding access to locker rooms, team practices, players, coaches, general managers, and other executives.\nOn January 18, 1972, interested sportswriters gathered formally for the first time, to begin organizing what was to become the Pro Basketball Writers Association of America (PBWAA). The meeting occurred at the Century Plaza Hotel, in Los Angeles, California, during the NBA All-Star Game weekend. The PBWAA organized formally one year later, on January 23, 1973, at a meeting in the O'Hare Hyatt Regency Hotel, in Chicago, Illinois."

Group C featured full ICC members England and New Zealand, and associate members Canada and Kenya. New Zealand beat England by 6 wickets in their opening match before beating Canada and Kenya by more than 100 runs each to finish top of the group, while England also managed comfortable wins against the two associate nations to join New Zealand in qualifying for the Super Eights. Kenya finished in third place by virtue of their opening victory over Canada.\nTable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCanada vs Kenya.\nKenya captain Steve Tikolo was named man of the match after playing all the way through the chase, coming in at 52/2, with David Obuya and Ravindu Shah dismissed in single figures with a strike rate below 25. Nevertheless, only Canada's captain John Davison conceded less than 3.5 runs an over, as the three first Canadian bowlers, Umar Bhatti, Anderson Cummins and Henry Osinde conceded 16 wides among the 107 runs in 22.2 overs. The Kenyan spinners, on the other hand, took five for 78 from 29 overs, \"strangling the scoring rate\". Cummins became the second man to play World Cup cricket for two different countries, having represented West Indies in 1992.\nEngland vs New Zealand.\nBoth teams had recently enjoyed series wins over Australia, but it was New Zealand who got revenge over England, who had beaten them for a place in the final of the January tri-series in Australia. England lost Ed Joyce for a duck off the first legitimate delivery of the match, and only Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett, the numbers eight and nine, managed a strike rate above 70. With the fall of Paul Collingwood at the end of 35th over, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming brought on Shane Bond, and he removed Kevin Pietersen, England's top scorer, and Andrew Flintoff in the same over. Jamie Dalrymple followed three overs later, as England had lost four wickets for five runs, but Nixon and Plunkett batted out the remaining 12 overs, making 71.\nIn reply, New Zealand lost two wickets in eight balls to James Anderson and Liam Plunkett, and also had captain Fleming back for a single-figure score. However, from then on they made 191 for the loss of only one wicket, Craig McMillan caught off Monty Panesar's bowling. Scott Styris and Jacob Oram added an unbeaten 138 for the fifth wicket, just ten runs off the New Zealand record from the 1999 World Cup, resulting in a man-of-the-match award for Styris.\nEngland vs Kenya.\nEd Joyce's second fifty in as many matches helped England qualify for the Super Eights in what was essentially a play-off match, eliminating 2003 semi-finalists Kenya. Steve Tikolo came in at four after James Anderson had removed both openers, and though he made his 20th half-century, none of his team-mates passed 20. Extras were the second-highest contributor, with six wides and eight no-balls, most of the latter coming from Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff, who bowled three no-balls each. Flintoff did get Tikolo out with a yorker, while three of Kenya's players were run out as they were bowled out on the last ball of the rain-reduced innings. \nKenya's opening bowler Peter Ongondo extracted \"tennis-ball bounce\" to remove Michael Vaughan for one with the 19th ball of the game; however, despite Ian Bell getting caught for 16, England had reduced the equation to 126 off 34.2 overs after Joyce and Bell's partnership. With Kevin Pietersen also getting a fifty, England made it through with 10 overs to spare."

        "title": "2007 Cricket World Cup Group D",
        "text": "The 2007 Cricket World Cup, which was played in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007, featured 16 teams, who were divided into four groups. Group D featured the hosts, the West Indies, fellow full ICC members Pakistan and Zimbabwe, and associate members Ireland. The West Indies won all three of their matches to finish top of the group and qualify for the Super Eights. Ireland's rain-affected win over Pakistan in their second match, as well as their opening tie with Zimbabwe, meant they joined the West Indies in the next round, while Pakistan failed to qualify from the group stage for the second consecutive tournament.\nTable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Indies vs Pakistan.\nHosts West Indies won the opening match of the tournament, exacting revenge for the 3–1 series defeat in Pakistan the previous year. The local newspaper, the Jamaica Observer, said that the day \"was as good as it [could] get.\" The Observer also pointed out that the result \"will have provided a considerable advantage for West Indies\" if, \"as expected\", they and Pakistan go through to the Super Eights. Cricinfo described the West Indies' efforts with the bat as \"staccato\", but credited \"a disciplined bowling performance\", while criticising Pakistan's bowlers for \"let[ting] the batsmen dismantle their confidence.\"\nAfter 28 overs, Pakistan were actually ahead of West Indies, with 97 for three compared to 94 for three; then Dwayne Smith took wickets with three of twelve deliveries, and Pakistan never got ahead again.\nIreland vs Zimbabwe.\nIreland had a much better first outing than fellow World Cup debutants Bermuda, managing a tie against the Test nation of Zimbabwe after Jeremy Bray scored his second One Day International century in the space of six weeks. Bray put on 43 with Eoin Morgan for the second wicket, but two wickets from Elton Chigumbura set them back to 64 for four after 15 overs.\nBray remained in, however, carrying his bat to 115 not out and sharing partnerships of 54 with Andrew White, 37 with captain Trent Johnston and 39 with Dave Langford-Smith. Zimbabwe used spinners Prosper Utseya, Sean Williams and Stuart Matsikenyeri at the end, who conceded few runs, ending with combined figures of 56 runs from 17 overs. Chigumbura, who had taken the top order wickets, was not reintroduced at the death.\nIn reply, Zimbabwe made their way to 20 overs with the loss of one wicket, slightly ahead of Ireland's total. However, Johnston broke through when he had Chamu Chibhabha caught, while Vusi Sibanda crept back on the stumps, dismantling a bail to be out hit wicket for 67 as he took off to make a single, not realising his misfortune. Another misfortune struck when Brendan Taylor was run out, essentially by the batsmen on strike (Matsikenyeri) who returned McCallan's ball with a fierce straight drive, taking Taylor's wicket down in the process. \nNevertheless, after Stuart Matsikenyeri's half-century, they required 15 runs with 36 balls remaining; however, they only got six of those runs off the next 30 balls, with Gary Brent and Chris Mpofu rarely managing to get off the strike. Kevin O'Brien, whose only over had cost eight runs, was brought back in the 49th, and he took one wicket and had Mpofu run out in a maiden over. Zimbabwe now needed nine off the last over with only a wicket in hand. Matsikenyeri hit two twos and a single, Ed Rainsford got off the strike with a single off his only ball, before Matsikenyeri tied the scores with a cut for two. With one ball, one wicket and one run in contention, Rainsford's desperate dash caused him to be run out and the match a tie – the third of World Cup history.\nIreland vs Pakistan.\nPakistan, ranked fourth in the ICC ODI Championship tables before the tournament, were eliminated from the tournament after five days, an event described by BBC in an online report as \"unthinkable\". Niall O'Brien made 72, but was out stumped with 25 runs still to get and had to watch as his brother Kevin O'Brien and Trent Johnston put on 20 for the eighth wicket to win the game. \nPakistan were put in to bat, and were bowled out for 132, with extras being the top scorer as Ireland offered 23 wides. Pakistan's captain Inzamam-ul-Haq still credited Ireland's bowlers with bowling \"tight lines\", while taking the blame for \"too many poor shots\", as all ten batsmen were out caught. Boyd Rankin took the most wickets, including Younis Khan and top-scorer Kamran Akmal, while Andre Botha's spell of five runs from eight overs also yielded the wickets of Inzamam and opener Imran Nazir.\nWhen Ireland batted, Bray, who had made a hundred in the previous match, fell lbw to Mohammad Sami, who took three for 29 after being left out of the side four days earlier. Ireland fell to 15 for two, but O'Brien and William Porterfield added 37 before Porterfield played a ball from Mohammad Hafeez onto his stumps and was bowled. O'Brien made shots off Hafeez, however, who ended with 15 runs off four overs, one of the three most expensive bowlers of the game. He was eventually stumped for 72, before Iftikhar Anjum struck twice in two balls, Ireland now needing 20 with three wickets in hand. Kevin O'Brien and Trent Johnston got there, however, with Ireland captain Johnston winning the game with a six, the second of the game.\nFollowing the defeat and early exit from the World Cup, there was a huge negative reaction from the millions of passionate Pakistani fans and government, calling for the captain, coach and the president of the board to resign. \nOn the morning after the game, Pakistan's coach Bob Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room, and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead soon afterwards. Players, experts and the rest of the cricketing world mourned the death of \"the cricket scholar\", in the words of former South African Test bowler Fanie de Villiers, while commentators such as Cricinfo's Dileep Premachandran criticised the \"effigy-burners\" in Pakistan who, in his opinion, did not \"possess common sense\". On the same day, Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his retirement from one-day cricket.\nPakistan vs Zimbabwe.\nPakistan were considering forfeiting the game, but have been ordered to complete it by the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Imran Nazir led the way for Pakistan, an almost solo performance of 160 from just 121 balls as Pakistan made 349 all out, bowled out on the second last ball. No other players made 40; Inzamam-ul-Haq made 37 in his final One Day International, while number nine Iftikhar Anjum came in with four overs to spare and hit 32 from 16 balls before being last out to Elton Chigumbura.\nZimbabwe lost Vusi Sibanda, Justice Chibhabha and Friday Kasteni before rain arrived after 10.2 overs with the score at 33 for 3. Play eventually resumed with the innings cut to just 20 overs, leaving Zimbabwe with a reduced target, though they still needed a further 160 runs from 58 balls.\nWest Indies v Ireland.\nThe match was interrupted by rain near the end of Ireland's innings; West Indies were set an adjusted target of 190 from 48 overs."

        "text": "The Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships, known as the Dunlop Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships from 2008 to 2013 with Dunlop as the title sponsor, and renamed the Metropolia Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships from 2013 onwards, is a prestigious junior tennis tournament, one of five that are rated by the ITF as 'Grade A'. Established in 1947 in Miami Beach, the tournament has for years featured both boys and girls singles and doubles draws at both '18 and under' (under-19) and '16 and under' (under-17) age categories. From 1999 to 2010, the tournament had been held each December at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Florida. Since 2011, it has been held at the Frank Veltri Tennis Center in Plantation, Florida.\nHistory.\nThe Orange Bowl Tennis Championship began at Flamingo Tennis Center, Miami Beach. This facility, still in use today, hosted the tournament until 1998, when it was moved to Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Florida. The Orange Bowl was started by Eddie Herr, who wanted to bring some winter competition to South Beach for his tennis playing daughter, Suzanne. The tournament soon grew in prestige and importance, being considered the initiation rite of future world tennis champions. Decades of tournament winners are posted on a brass plaque at the entrance to Flamingo Tennis Center.\nPlayers who have competed at the Orange Bowl reads as a virtual who's who of modern tennis, including Andre Agassi, Arthur Ashe, Boris Becker, Björn Borg, Jimmy Connors, Jim Courier, Stefan Edberg, Chris Evert, Roger Federer, Steffi Graf, Justine Henin, Ivan Lendl, Hana Mandlíková, Andy Roddick, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles, Guillermo Vilas, and Mats Wilander. As of 2017, Miami's Mary Joe Fernandez is the only player, male or female, to win in every age division of the Orange Bowl and Junior Orange Bowl tournaments: 12s, 14s, 16s, and 18s. However, Miami's Lynn Epstein, won the 12s, 14s and skipped the 16s to play up winning the 18s two years in a row. Epstein is the only player, to this day, to have achieved this feat.\nIn 1983, during the tournament's heyday, a professional stadium was built in Flamingo Park. The Abel Holtz stadium seated 9,000 fans. During the 1990s however, Flamingo Park Tennis Center fell victim to poor maintenance. The standards of the Orange Bowl could not be maintained so in 1999 the tournament was moved to the Tennis Center at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, home of today's professional tour event, the Miami Open (tennis). Since 2011, the City of Plantation has restored the Orange Bowl Tournament's allure and luster, hosting the best administered and best managed tournament in decades. .\nRecently, there has been a tennis revival in Miami Beach. A $5.5M master plan to renovate the Flamingo tennis facility has begun. The project includes a new tennis building and 17 clay hydro-courts. A large bronze plaque containing the names of all the great tennis champions who began their career playing in the tournament in Flamingo park will be restored, along with a plaque honoring local players who went on to tennis fame, such as Jerry Moss.\nSince 1962, the two younger age groups ('12 and under' and '14 and under') are held at a separate site in Coral Gables. Hence today, the Junior Orange Bowl is in Coral Gables. And the Orange Bowl (under 16 and under 18) has moved in 2011 from Miami to Plantation, FL thus changing surfaces from Hard Courts to Clay, the first time since 1998 that the tournament will be on clay.\nDunlop has been the tournament's title sponsor since 2008. From 2013 onwards, Metropolia International Holdings became the title sponsor of the tournament.\nTournament features.\nPlayers must be at least 13 years old to compete, unless competing in the 12 and unders."

        "text": "David Humphreys MBE (born 10 September 1971) is a former Irish rugby union player. He played 72 times for Ireland, scoring 560 points, including 6 tries, and at the time of his international retirement was Ireland's most capped out-half. He played his club rugby for London Irish and Ulster, winning the 1998-99 Heineken Cup, the 2004 Celtic Cup and the 2005–06 Celtic League with the latter. Since retiring as a player he has served as director of rugby for Ulster and Gloucester, as a performance consultant with the Georgian Rugby Union, and is currently Director of Performance Operations with the England and Wales Cricket Board. He will succeed David Nucifora as the IRFU Performance Director in 2024.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nHumphreys started playing rugby while at Ballymena Academy, and represented Ireland Schools, captaining them to the Triple Crown in 1990. In the amateur era, he played for Queen's University RFC, with whom he won the Dudley Cup in 1994, Ballymena R.F.C., and Oxford University RFC, for whom he scored all 19 points in a losing effort in the 1995 Varsity Match. He also played provincial representative rugby for Ulster, making his senior debut in an away victory over Cumbria in 1992, and his Interprovincial debut against Munster the same year, and was selected for Ireland under-21, 'A' and development teams.\nLondon Irish.\nAfter rugby union was declared open to professionalism in 1995, Humphreys was approached by Clive Woodward to sign for London Irish, then in Division Two of the Courage League. He made his debut for the club in January 1996, with Ireland coach Murray Kidd in attendance. They were promoted to Division One the following season, but after poor results in the top flight, Woodward was replaced as coach by Willie Anderson, who helped them avoid relegation, with Humphreys described as the \"catalyst\" for their \"Houdini-like escape\", scoring 18 points in the relegation play-off victory over Coventry. The following season, London Irish struggled again. Anderson was sacked in mid-season, replaced by Dick Best, and they again avoided relegation in a playoff against Rotherham.\nUlster.\nHumphreys continued to be selected for Ulster while at London Irish, starring in a win against New South Wales in February 1996, in which he scored 17 points - a try, three conversions, a drop goal and a penalty. He appeared for Ulster in the 1996–97 Heineken Cup, defying London Irish to do so, but was unavailable for the province the following season, after the English clubs declared that they no longer considered the Irish provinces to be representative sides. Warren Gatland, the new Ireland coach, led a drive by the IRFU to bring Irish players who had signed contracts with English clubs back to Ireland for the 1998–99 season, Humphreys being one of them. He joined Dungannon RFC, making him available for selection for Ulster, and agreed a contract with the IRFU. After Mark McCall sustained a serious neck injury, Humphreys was named Ulster's captain, and led them to win the 1998–99 Heineken Cup.\nHe won the All-Ireland League with Dungannon in 2001, and was man of the match in the final, scoring five penalties, four conversions and a drop goal, 26 points in all, against Cork Constitution. For Ulster, he was the leading scorer in the inaugural Celtic League in 2001–02 with 122 points, and the league's leading marksman with 39 successful goal kicks. He set a Heineken Cup record for the most points scored in a single game, with 37 in Ulster's 42–16 win against Wasps in 2002. With Ulster, he won the Celtic Cup in 2004, scoring 17 points in the final, and the Celtic League in 2006, scoring a last-minute 40-metre drop goal in the final game to clinch the title.\nHe won Ulster's player of the year and supporters' club player of the year awards in 2002, and the team's personality of the year award in 1999, 2000 and 2008. He won a supporters' poll for Ulster's all-time favourite player in 2008. He retired in 2008 as Ulster's most capped player with 163 appearances, having scored 27 tries, 179 conversions, 326 penalties and 38 drop goals, 1,585 points in all. At the time of his retirement he was the Celtic League's top scorer with 786 points, and the Heineken Cup's fourth top scorer with 583 points.\nInternational career.\nHumphreys made his senior debut for Ireland against France in the 1996 Five Nations Championship. For several years he vied with Munster's Ronan O'Gara for the out-half position on the Ireland team, with O'Gara ultimately making the position his own. Nevertheless, Humphreys won 72 caps for Ireland, captaining the side five times. He retired from the international game in 2006 as Ireland's most-capped out-half and second highest points scorer, having scored six tries, 110 penalties, 88 conversions and eight drop-goals, 560 points in all. He also represented Ireland at the 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens, and played six times for the Barbarians between 2003 and 2005, once as captain, and scored 33 points.\nPost-playing career.\nOn retiring as a player, he was appointed to the new role of Operations Director of Ulster, with responsibility for contract negotiations. The following season, he became the team's Director of Rugby, overseeing the senior team, the 'A' team, the under-20s and the academy. His role included player recruitment, and he is credited with signing South African stars Ruan Pienaar, Johann Muller and John Afoa, and persuading Tommy Bowe and Roger Wilson to return to Ulster. In 2014 he became Director of Rugby at Gloucester. He left this role at the end of the 2019–20 season. He had a high performance consulting role with Georgia at the 2020 Autumn Nations Cup. In 2021 he launched a sports recruitment company, SportsWork. He was also in involved in cricket in Ireland and England, serving on the high performance committee of Cricket Ireland before becoming director of cricket operations for the England and Wales Cricket Board in February 2023. In November 2023 it was announced that he would join the Irish Rugby Football Union as Performance Director Designate in March 2024, before succeeding David Nucifora as Performance Director in June.\nPersonal life.\nHis sister Karen is a former international hockey player, and his younger brother Ian was a professional rugby player, who played out-half for Leicester Tigers, London Irish and Ulster. His son James is an Ireland under-20 international, and joined the Ulster Rugby academy in 2021.\nHe studied law at Queen's University Belfast, He trained as a solicitor with Belfast law firm Tughans, under former Ulster and Ireland rugby international Mike Gibson.\nHe received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Ulster in December 2003 for Services to Sport and an MBE in the Queens New Year's Honours List in January 2004. He was inducted into the IRUPA Hall of Fame in 2008."

        "title": "BWF World Championships",
        "text": "The BWF World Championships, formerly known as IBF World Championships, and also known as the World Badminton Championships, is a badminton tournament sanctioned by Badminton World Federation (BWF). The tournament is one of the most prestigious in badminton, offering the most ranking points, together with the Summer Olympics badminton tournaments which was introduced in 1992. The winners of this tournament are also crowned as \"World Champions\" of the sport, and are awarded a gold medal.\nThe tournament started in 1977 and was held once every three years until 1983. However, the IBF (International Badminton Federation) faced difficulty in hosting the first two events as the World Badminton Federation (which later merged with the IBF to form one badminton federation) hosted the same tournament a year after the IBF World Championships with the same goals. \nSince 1985, the tournament became biennial and played once every two years until 2005. Starting 2006, the tournament was changed to an annual event on the BWF calendar. The tournament is not held during the Summer Olympics years to avoid schedule conflicts.\nLocation of the World Championships.\nThe table below gives an overview of all host cities and countries of the World Championships. The most recent games were held in Copenhagen. The number in parentheses following the city/country denotes how many times that city/country has hosted the championships. From 1989 to 2001 the world championships were held immediately after the Sudirman Cup at the same location.\nPast winners.\nAs of 2022, only 21 countries have achieved at least a bronze medal in the tournament: 11 from Asia, eight from Europe, and one each from Oceania and North America. Africa is the only confederation that has not won a medal.\nAt the age of 18, Ratchanok Inthanon became the youngest winner of a singles title at the Championships. Ratchanok was less than 3 months older than Jang Hye-ock was when she won the women's doubles title at the 1995 Championships.\nMost successful players &amp; national teams.\nMost successful players.\nSeveral players have won gold medals in more than one category in a World Championship; this includes:\nFrom 1977 up to 2001, the medals were usually divided among five countries, namely China, Korea, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia. However, in 2003, the winners included seven countries and in 2005 the medal board contained a record high of ten countries.\nTony Gunawan also bears the distinction of winning a gold medal in Men's Doubles, representing two countries, 2001 partnering with Halim Haryanto for Indonesia and in 2005 partnering with Howard Bach to give the United States its first medal in the competition.\nThe 2005 edition also brought new faces to the mixed doubles event which had been dominated by China and Korea since 1997. With the retirement of defending champions and two-time winners Kim Dong-moon/Ra Kyung-min (Korea), Nova Widianto/Liliyana Natsir won Indonesia's first mixed doubles gold since 1980 when Christian Hadinata/Imelda Wiguna won it last for Indonesia.\nBelow is the list of the most successful players ever, with 3 or more gold medals.\nBelow is the list of the most successful player(s) in each category (listed according to their last title):\nMost successful national teams.\nBelow is the gold medalists shown based by category and countries after the 2023 BWF World Championships. China has been the most successful in the World Championships ever since its inception in 1977. They were the only country ever to achieve a shutout of the medals which they did in 1987, 2010 and 2011.\n\"BOLD means overall winner of that World Championships\"\nMedal distribution.\nMen's singles.\nDue to the disqualification on suspicion of violation of anti-doping regulations, the 2014 silver medalist Lee Chong Wei was stripped of his medal and thus the medal count does not add up."

        "title": "United States Women's Amateur Golf Championship",
        "text": "The U.S. Women's Amateur is the leading golf tournament in the United States for female amateur golfers. It is played annually and is one of the 13 United States national golf championships organized by the United States Golf Association (USGA). Female amateurs from all nations are eligible to compete and there are no age restrictions. It was established in 1895, one month after the men's U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open. It is the third oldest USGA championship, over a half century older than the U.S. Women's Open, which was first played in 1946. Along with the British Ladies Amateur, the U.S. Women's Amateur is considered the highest honor in women's amateur golf.\nRobert Cox Cup.\nSince 1896 the Robert Cox Cup has been awarded annually by the USGA to the winner. The trophy was donated by Robert Cox of Edinburgh, Scotland, a member of the British Parliament and a golf course designer. It remains the oldest surviving trophy awarded for a USGA championship. Along with a gold medal, a replica of the silver case of Etruscan design is given to the tournament winner. The original trophy is on permanent display at the USGA Museum and Library. The Robert Cox Cup is the only USGA trophy donated by someone from another country.\nThe first tournament attracted a field of 13 and was played over 18 holes. As in the case of the men's U.S. Amateur, entry was originally restricted to members of USGA-affiliated private clubs (and, presumably, international players who were members of clubs affiliated with their nations' golf governing bodies); this policy remained in place until the 1979 tournament. Several thousand women now enter the event, and the USGA conducts sectional qualifying to reduce the number of contestants to a more manageable number. The main tournament opens with two rounds of stroke play. The leading 64 players then compete in a match play competition. The matches are played over 18 holes except for the final, which is played over 36 holes.\nIn 1956, Ann Gregory became the first African American to compete in the Championship, held that year at the Meridian Hills Country Club in Indianapolis. \nThere are no age restrictions on entry. Players must have a handicap index of 5.4 or less. Morgan Pressel qualified as a 13-year-old in 2001 and won in 2005 at the age of 17. The 2006 winner Kimberly Kim was only 14 years old, breaking the record previously held by Laura Baugh. In 2007, Pearl Jin and Alexis Thompson became the first 12-year-olds to qualify and the first to advance to match play. Jin and Thompson faced one another in the third round match play. Thompson beat Jin, but then lost in the quarterfinals. \nBecause the tournament is dominated by teenagers and college-age players who are working toward careers as tournament professionals, the USGA introduced a separate tournament in 1987 for players age 25 and over, called the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur. It gives older amateur players an opportunity to compete among themselves for a national title; entrants must have a handicap index of 9.4 or less. \nThe USGA rates Glenna Collett Vare as the most noteworthy champion who won the Robert Cox Cup a record six times. Several U.S. Women's Amateur champions who have gone on to become leading professionals including Patty Berg, Babe Zaharias, Louise Suggs and Beth Daniel.\nThe two finalists win exemptions to the ensuing U.S. Women's Open, and the winner also wins exemptions to The Women's Open Championship and upon turning 50, the U.S. Senior Women's Open (one year exemption for players who eventually turned professional, and five years for players who did not turn professional).\nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\nNineteen players have won more than one U.S. Women's Amateur, through 2023:\nSeven players have won both the U.S. Women's Amateur and Open Championships, through 2023:\nEleven players have won both the U.S. Women's and British Ladies Amateur Championships, through 2023:\n^ Won both in same year.\nFuture sites.\nSaucon Valley Country Club is slated to host in 2038.&lt;br&gt;\nCanterbury Golf Club is slated to host in 2039.&lt;br&gt;\nBandon Dunes Golf Resort is also slated to host in 2041.&lt;br&gt;\nPinehurst Resort is also slated to host in 2044.&lt;br&gt;\nOakmont Country Club is slated to host in 2046.&lt;br&gt;\nSource"

        "title": "Battle of Quebec (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Battle of Quebec () is a former National Hockey League (NHL) rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques. The rivalry lasted from 1979–80 to 1994–95. The teams played against each other five times in the NHL playoffs, and the Canadiens won three of the series. One meeting in 1984 resulted in the Good Friday Massacre, a game in which multiple brawls happened. The Battle of Quebec extended to politics, in which the Canadiens and Nordiques became symbols for rival parties, and beer distribution, as the teams were both owned by competing breweries.\nBackground.\nThe Nordiques began play in 1972, in the World Hockey Association (WHA). As part of the new league's raid on NHL talent, the team signed J. C. Tremblay, a Canadiens defenceman, to a five-year contract. Quebec also hired former Montreal players Maurice Richard and Jacques Plante as head coaches. The Canadiens–Nordiques rivalry began in the 1979–80 season, when the Nordiques became one of four former WHA teams to join the NHL as part of the NHL–WHA merger. The Canadiens originally were one of five teams to vote down the merger. However, the Canadiens' owner, Molson Brewery, feared that Canadian cities with WHA teams in the deal would boycott the brand, and the team supported the merger in a subsequent vote. At first the teams were placed in different divisions; Montreal was in the Norris Division, while Quebec was given a spot in the Adams Division.\n1979–80 to 1981–82.\nThe teams played their first game against each other in Montreal on October 13, 1979, and the Canadiens won 3–1. The Nordiques hosted the rivalry for the first time on October 29, and upset the Canadiens 5–4; the \"Ottawa Citizen\" wrote that \"The victory marked the end of a decades-old Quebec belief that Montreal was unbeatable.\" The rivalry was fairly even in its first few years; from the 1979–80 to 1981–82 regular seasons, the Canadiens were 6–5–5 in the series, and had just one win away from the Montreal Forum.\nThe NHL realigned before the 1981–82 season, and the Canadiens were placed in the Adams Division with the Nordiques. In the 1982 playoffs, the teams met in the postseason for the first time. After a Game 1 loss, the Nordiques won the next two games, putting them in position to win the best-of-five series. Montreal won the fourth game 6–2; the contest featured a combined 251 penalty minutes, including 159 from one first-period altercation. The Montreal Forum was the site of Game 5, where the Canadiens scored twice in the third period to force a 2–2 tie and a series-deciding overtime period. The game, and series, came to a quick end 22 seconds into the extra period when Quebec's Dale Hunter scored after a 2-on-1 odd-man rush to give the Nordiques the victory.\n1984 playoffs: Good Friday Massacre.\nTwo years later, the teams met again in the playoffs; by this time the rivalry had been given the Battle of Quebec nickname. The teams split the first four games of the best-of-seven series before Montreal won game five in Quebec City, 4–0. Game six, which became known as the Good Friday Massacre, took place in Montreal on April 20, 1984. The Canadiens rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third period to win 5–3 and clinch the series, but the game is best known for having multiple brawls in the last two periods. The fighting started as the second period was ending, after an incident between the Nordiques' Hunter and the Canadiens' Guy Carbonneau, who was \"pinned to the ice\" by Hunter. More than 10 minutes of brawling followed, and the teams were given 222 penalty minutes for the second period. Ten players were thrown out of the game between both brawls, but several were not immediately told of their ejections after the first one, as the officials had not finished recording all of the penalties during the intermission. A 10-minute-long bench-clearing brawl occurred after the announcement of the ejections, and the total number of penalty minutes in the game exceeded 250.\n1984–85 to 1986–87.\nIn eight games between the teams during the 1984–85 season, the Canadiens lost only once, posting six victories. The 1985 playoffs saw the Canadiens and Nordiques face each other in the postseason for the third time in four years. The Nordiques won the first and third games in overtime and jumped out to a 3–2 lead after winning Game 5 in Montreal, 5–1. The Canadiens responded with a 5–2 win in Quebec City in the sixth game, sending the series to a decisive game seven back in Montreal. After regulation play ended with the score tied 2–2, the game entered overtime. Peter Stastny scored for the Nordiques at 2:22 of the extra period, giving the Nordiques the game and the series.\nThe teams did not meet in the 1986 playoffs, as the Nordiques lost to the Hartford Whalers in the first round, while the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup. In 1987, however, Montreal and Quebec had their fourth playoff matchup. The Nordiques won the first two games in the Montreal Forum, before the Canadiens evened the series with a pair of wins in Quebec City. Game four was decided in overtime, and featured a pregame fight. Montreal won game five at home, though not without controversy. With the score tied 2–2 late in the third period, Alain Cote scored what appeared to be the go-ahead goal for the Nordiques, only to see it waved off due to offsetting penalties on both teams. Ryan Walter netted the game-winner for the Canadiens 14 seconds later. Quebec coach Michel Bergeron called his team's loss \"a crime\", saying \"No one wants to let us win.\" One attorney in Quebec City offered to help the Nordiques challenge the final result of the game, which the team decided against. The Nordiques won game six at home, but the Canadiens won the deciding game seven 5–3, scoring all of their goals in the second period.\n1993 playoffs and Nordiques' relocation.\nIn the 1993 playoffs, the Canadiens and Nordiques met in the opening round. The Nordiques took a 2–0 lead in the series, but Montreal won four straight games after that to capture the series. Three of the six games went to overtime; the Canadiens won two of those, including game five in Quebec City, which gave them the lead in the series. A 6–2 victory in Game 6 clinched the series for the Canadiens, who later won the Stanley Cup. The rivalry came to an end following the 1994–95 season, when the Nordiques relocated to Denver, Colorado, and became the Colorado Avalanche.\nHowever, the rivalry never completely died out. In 2002, the Avalanche held an exhibition game against the Canadiens in Quebec City. When Joe Sakic, a former Nordique, entered the arena with the Nordique blue, the fans gave him a thundering ovation. He said that \"you're not going to find a better hockey city. It was really moving. There are no words.\" In 2010, \"La série Montréal-Québec\", a TVA television series featuring games between amateur teams from the two cities, premiered.\nCauses.\nBoth of the teams in the rivalry were based in the province of Quebec. Montreal is the province's largest city, while Quebec City is its capital. One Nordiques employee said of the disparity between the size of the two cities, \"Quebec City has always had a relationship of frustration with Montreal. This rivalry is the first time that Montreal and Quebec City can compete head to head in one event.\" Michael Farber wrote that hostility towards the Canadiens in Quebec City dated back to the team's signing of Jean Beliveau, who previously played with the Quebec Aces. According to the Canadian Press, the Battle of Quebec also matched teams with opposite backgrounds. The Canadiens were a traditionally strong team, while the Nordiques were relatively new to the NHL during their playoff series in the mid-1980s. Stastny said of the rivalry, \"It's like two camps, each representing something, you're not just playing for your team, you're playing for your half-a-million supporters and they're playing for their one or two million supporters.\"\nThe teams took on political symbolism during the rivalry. The Canadiens were seen by some as reflective of those in favour of keeping the province as part of Canada, while the Nordiques were seen as a symbol of Quebec independence. The Nordiques gained a large francophone fan base in Quebec, and their uniforms contained the colours and crest from the province's flag. One early-1980s survey by the \"La Presse\" newspaper found that, outside of east Montreal, support for the Canadiens and Nordiques tended to mirror where support existed for the Quebec Liberal Party and Parti Québécois, respectively.\nA concurrent rivalry took place between the teams' owners, which were both breweries. Molson had purchased ownership of the Canadiens before the NHL–WHA merger, and the Nordiques were controlled by Carling O'Keefe. In May 1982, following the Canadiens' elimination from the NHL playoffs at the hands of the Nordiques the previous month, a 9.5 per cent decline in Quebec's beer consumption was recorded. Montreal reporter Red Fisher credited Molson and Carling O'Keefe for expanding the rivalry, saying, \"The breweries have carried the red flags in this.\"\nThe Canadiens and Nordiques fought multiple battles over league television rights. When the Nordiques joined the NHL in the merger with the WHA, a clause in the contract forced the Nordiques to forfeit revenue from \"Hockey Night in Canada\" telecasts for a five-year period. Molson was a leading sponsor of the broadcasts, and Nordiques president Marcel Aubut cited the agreement as an extension of the Molson–Carling O'Keefe rivalry. The teams also wound up on opposite sides of a dispute over the Trans-Border Agreement, which allowed the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs to receive most of the proceeds from television rights in Canada. The Nordiques joined U.S.-based franchises in 1984 in trying to have games played in the U.S. televised; this led to a $22 million lawsuit by the other Canada-based teams, which was settled out of court."

It is open to amateur boys who are under 19 on the last day of the competition and have a USGA Handicap Index of 4.4 or less. The competition was established in 1948. It consists of two days of stroke play, with the leading 64 competitors then playing a match play competition to decide the champion.\nThe first tournament in 1948 was won by Dean Lind from a field of 495 entries. In 1999, the tournament set a record with 4,508 entries. Only two players have won the championship multiple times: Tiger Woods won the tournament for three consecutive years beginning in 1991; Jordan Spieth won in 2009 and 2011. In 2010, Jim Liu, at 14 years, 11 months, became the youngest champion ever, breaking Woods' mark of 15 years and 220 days.\nThe number of winners who have gone on to become PGA pros is considerable. Apart from Woods, well known winners include Johnny Miller (1964), David Duval (1989), Hunter Mahan (1999), Jordan Spieth (2009 and 2011), and Scottie Scheffler (2013). Jack Nicklaus's best result was a semifinal loss.\nThe equivalent competition for girls is the U.S. Girls' Junior Championship."

During the first two decades following the war, many of Oswestry’s friendly matches were against Welsh opposition, and games with Welshpool, Newtown and Brymbo were particularly keenly fought.\nFootball took precedence at the ground after the war, and in 1947 the club moved to its present site in Morda Road. The pavilion was the former canteen of the Coventry Climax factory, which was initially sited in Victoria Road and transported to Morda Road. It served on that site as the club's pavilion until a major redevelopment of facilities in 2005–06. During the winter of 2005, a £350,000 pavilion was built at Morda Road.\nThe club was one of twelve founder members of the Shropshire Cricket League in 1970. Two years later Oswestry shared the Division One title with Shifnal. Having won the Shropshire Premier Cricket League in 2007 the club was elevated to Division 3 of the Birmingham &amp; District Cricket League for the 2008 season. They were immediately relegated, but regained Birmingham League status in 2009 by securing the Shropshire Premier Cricket League title for a second time.\nNotable players.\nThis list is compiled of cricketers who have played representative cricket before, during or after their time at Oswestry,\ntherefore making them notable to the club, county and international cricket scene.\nEngland\nCanada\nAndy Lloyd went on to play for and be captain of Warwickshire and also represented England. John Davison, Canadian-born but raised in Australia, was the club's overseas player in 1993. Several Oswestry players have represented Shropshire at minor counties level, including Digby Owen, John Hare, Ramesh Sethi, Dave Vart, Ben Platt, Jim Phillips, Mark Robinson, Alex Huxley, Joe Clarke, Jonathan Miles, Joseph Carrasco, Robbie Clarke, Charlie Morris and most recently Matt Gregson."

        "text": "John Eddie Long (born August 28, 1956) is an American former professional basketball player.\nAmateur career.\nLong played high school basketball at Romulus High School, and signed to play for Dick Vitale at the University of Detroit. Long established himself quickly with a Detroit program that would produce an unprecedented run during his time with the Titans (1974-1978). Vitale added future NBA players such as Terry Duerod, Terry Tyler and Dennis Boyd and built a dominating independent program at the Jesuit university. Long played shooting guard for the team, averaging 23.3 ppg on a .525 shooting percentage as a senior.\nUD advanced to the 1977 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament in his junior year, defeating Middle Tennessee in the first round before losing to Michigan in the Sweet 16 86-81 to end a stellar season, finishing #12 in the polls.\nThe team was left out of the NCAA in Longs's senior year, 1977–78, playing in the 1978 NIT, despite a 25-4 record and a #18 ranking. In four seasons at Detroit, Long scored 2,167 points, the first Titan to score more than 2000 points, and was inducted into the Detroit Mercy Titans Hall of Fame in 1993.\nProfessional career.\nAfter starring at the University of Detroit, the shooting guard was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the second round of the 1978 NBA draft. The move was largely influenced by Pistons Head Coach Dick Vitale, who coached Long at UD before going to the Pistons in 1978. He played eight seasons for the Pistons, and averaged a career-high 21.9 points per game in 1981–82. Long was the original backcourt partner to point guard Isiah Thomas before Joe Dumars was drafted. During his time with the Pistons, Long would also play alongside University of Detroit teammates Duerod, Boyd and Tyler. On December 13, 1983, Long scored 41 points, recorded eight assists, and grabbed six rebounds during a 186–184 triple overtime win over the Denver Nuggets.\nLong left Detroit to play for the Indiana Pacers in 1986, where he paired with Reggie Miller, and then returned to the Pistons in the 1988-89 Detroit Pistons season, helping the team win the NBA championship. He spent the next season with the Atlanta Hawks and then returned to Detroit in 1990-91, played in France, the Continental Basketball Association, and even played with a touring team for Magic Johnson. Not done, Long signed with the Toronto Raptors in 1996, played with the Raptors for one season, and then retired in 1997 with 12,131 career points. At the time, the 41-year-old Long was the second oldest player in the NBA behind Robert Parish, who was 43.\nPersonal life.\nTwo of John Long's nephews, Terry Mills and Grant Long, also played in the NBA. The nephews were teammates in Detroit during the 1996–1997 season. All three men played two seasons or more for the Detroit Pistons. Long has worked as a radio analyst for the Pistons.\nLong was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2016."

It is the successor of Tennis Federation of the RSFSR (1959–1989) and the Tennis Federation of the USSR (1959–93, known before as All-Union Tennis Section, 1929-1959).\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Tennis Federation suspended the Russian Tennis Federation. In addition, Tennis Europe suspended the federation's membership. Teams representing Russia were therefore ineligible to compete at all Tennis Europe events (including Winter &amp; Summer Cups, European Beach Tennis, and Senior Club Championships). All Tennis Europe events in Russia were suspended, including the European Junior Tennis Championships (16 &amp; Under) in Moscow, and delegates from Russia were not eligible to attend the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Tennis Europe.\nHistory.\nArthur Davidovich McPherson (1870–1919), a native of Petersburg, was the founder and president of the first All-Russian Union of Lawn Tennis Clubs, the forerunner of today's Russian Tennis Federation. In 1903 he organized the first St. Petersburg tennis championship, and four years later he set up the first national tournament. By 1913 the Russian championship was on the international tour and the game was thriving."

The competition was held from 29 to 30 August 1972. 57 fencers from 25 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Witold Woyda of Poland, the nation's second victory in the men's foil in three Games. Jenő Kamuti of Hungary repeated as the silver medalist, the seventh man to win multiple medals in the event. France took bronze for the third consecutive Games, this time with Christian Noël earning the honor.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the six finalists from 1968 returned: silver medalist (and 1964 fifth-place finisher) Jenő Kamuti of Hungary, two-time bronze medalist Daniel Revenu of France, fourth-place finisher Christian Noël of France, and sixth-place finisher Mihai Țiu of Romania. Vasyl Stankovych of the Soviet Union was the reigning world champion; Friedrich Wessel of West Germany had won the previous two. Another significant contender was Witold Woyda, who had ten world championship and Olympic medals for the Polish foil team (and an individual silver at the 1962 world championship).\nHong Kong and Israel each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its 15th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nAfter two Games of hybrid pool/knockout play, the 1972 tournament returned to an all-pool format, with each fencer facing the other fencers in the pool in a round robin. Bouts were to 5 touches. There were no barrages; ties were broken by touch quotient: touches scored divided by touches received. Unlike previous Games, all bouts were finished in the round robins. The 1972 format also eliminated the 8-fencer final pools of previous Games; for all rounds after the first, the number of fencers was set at 6.\nThere were five rounds:\nResults.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 Pool E.\nThe four-way tie for 3rd place was broken by touch quotient (touches scored divided by touches received). Benko was highest at 0.950, then Losert at 0.944; those two qualified for the next round at 3rd and 4th place. Salvat (0.933) and Darricau (0.714) were eliminated.\nRound 1 Pool F.\nThe three-way tie for third place was broken by touch quotient (touches for divided by touches against). Paul (1.250) and Simon (1.182) each scored more touches than they received, while Lupiz (0.917) was hit more often than he connected. The former two advanced.\nRound 1 Pool I.\nThe three-way tie for third place was broken by touch quotient (touches for divided by touches against). Nakajima, despite losing more matches than he win, had actually scored more touches than he received—a quotient of 1.125. Gil was second among the tied fencers, with a quotient of 0.875; he advanced along with Nakajima. Obst was eliminated, at 0.700 and last among the tied men.\nRound 2.\nRound 2 Pool E.\nThe three-way tie for third was broken by touch quotient. Serizawa was even on touches for and touches received, at 1.000. Wessel was at 17–21 (0.810), beating Breckin by one touch for at 16–21 (0.762). Breckin, at fifth place, was eliminated.\nFinal.\nThe tie for bronze was determined on touch quotient, with Noël (1.000) winning it followed by Țiu (0.850) and Denisov (0.810)."

The event was won by Viktor Sidyak of the Soviet Union, the nation's first victory in the event (tying the nation with Cuba, France, Greece, Italy, and Poland for second-most all-time, behind Hungary's 11). Hungary had lost its nine-Games gold medal streak in 1968 but remained a power in the event; Péter Marót took silver to extend Hungary's podium streak to 11 Games.

All six of the finalists from 1968 returned: gold medalist (and 1956 bronze medalist and 1960 finalist) Jerzy Pawłowski, silver medalist Mark Rakita of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist (and 1964 gold medalist) Tibor Pézsa of Hungary, fourth-place finisher Vladimir Nazlymov of the Soviet Union, fifth-place finisher Rolando Rigoli of Italy, and sixth-place finisher Józef Nowara of Poland. The three world champions since the last Olympics were Viktor Sidyak of the Soviet Union (1969), Pézsa (1970), and Michele Maffei of Italy (1971).

The tie was resolved by touch quotient (touches for divided by touches against), and the three fencers were very close. Marót had the best quotient (21/20, or 1.050) and took silver. Nazlymov had scored the same number of touches, but had been hit once more (21/21, or 1.000) and took bronze. Maffei had the same number of touches against as Nazlymov, but one fewer touch scored than the other two (20/21, or 0.952) and took fourth place."

        "text": "William Howard Sharp (born January 18, 1950) is a former outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers.\nSharp graduated in 1968 from Lima Senior High School where he played baseball, basketball and football. As a senior basketball player, he led his team in assists en route to an appearance in the state tournament semifinals. He was a member of the school's inaugural athletics hall of fame class in 2018.\nSharp earned a scholarship to play college football at Ohio State. After playing for Woody Hayes, he suffered a separated shoulder which convinced him to give up football and focus on baseball. He was taken with the first pick of the second round of the 1971 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox. He was the first college player taken and was selected before future Hall of Famers George Brett and Mike Schmidt.\nSharp made his Major League debut on May 26, 1973, in a 22-inning game at White Sox Park in Chicago. He recorded his first hit on May 28, a first inning triple off of Dick Tidrow. Sharp became the team's starting right fielder the following season, taking over for Pat Kelly beginning in June.\nSharp was traded from the White Sox to the Brewers for Bob Coluccio on May 8, 1975. He started in center field for the Brewers that night and then again for the majority of the team's remaining games that season. Sharp's least successful Major League season came in 1976 when, in 78 games, he would slash .244/.288/.267. Due in large part to knee injuries, Sharp's professional career ended at age 27 in the minor leagues in 1977 after five games for the Spokane Indians.\nAfter retirement, Sharp worked as an executive for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and managed the Dakota Rattlers of the independent Prairie League in Bismarck, North Dakota to losing records in 1995 and 1996. He and his wife, Guyneth, had three sons, James, Matthew and Gavin."

It is a continental body of national tennis associations of Asian countries. The ATF's main objectives are to raise the quality standard of Asian tennis and to popularize tennis sport among the peoples of Asia. There are currently 44 member associations who represents their respective nations. The ATF works closely with the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and supports its member associations through the implementation of a wide range of programs.\nBoard of directors.\nThe board of directors is the elected group of members from national tennis bodies of Asian nations, the current list of members is:-\nChallenges.\nAsia is by far the most populous continent but tennis still remains a sport under development. Besides a couple of Asian nations like India, China and Japan who have produced some world class players, tennis does not have a very long and fruitful history. The only Asians to ever win a single tennis grand slam are Li Na from China ( French Open 2011 and Australian Open 2014), Naomi Osaka from Japan (Australian Open 2019 and 2021, US Opens 2018 and 2021), and Elena Rybakina from Kazakhstan (Wimbledon 2022). The only 2 nations that ever qualified for a Davis cup final are India(3) and Japan. No Asian nation has ever won the Davis Cup (excluding the Junior Davis Cups, 2 of which are won by Japan in 2011 and 2019). \nLi Na grew up playing badminton and only switched over to tennis because a coach saw her potential for the sport. But the backward Chinese tennis coaching she received in her early days actually turned her against the game and she eventually quit for two years only to come back when China tennis authorities allowed her to take the reins and hire a coach to her liking without regards of the costs. \"After Li Na had won the two grandslam tournaments, everyone start to know tennis in China. Especially in a country like China interest in the tennis sport is very much at the lead level compared to other Asian countries. If you weren't a lead level player, maybe you are wasting your time, taking away from study or education. But we've really seen in the last couple of years that mindset changing, in China in particular\", said Ben Slack, Tennis Australia's head of international business. \nThe Women's Tennis Association announced in 2017 that it has signed a 10-year deal to move its finals tournament to Shenzhen, a dynamic city in China south, starting from next year. The deal will also see the total prize money on offer double to a whopping US$14 million.\nTennis is expensive and most Asian countries are still a developing economy, which means the standard of living is comparatively less and people spend their money on necessities rather than tennis racquets. There are currently 289 futures and challengers in a year in Europe, while Asia in comparison only has 61 of these tournaments. Even South America, where there are only twelve nations and players from the other continents rarely go due to remoteness of the location, has 81 ATP recognized tournaments The number of tournaments in Asia is increasing and with it the level of the sport. In the next 10 years, the Asian region, should produce some exciting players.\nSponsors of ATF.\nThis is a list of official sponsors of ATF:"

        "title": "Horse racing in Wales",
        "text": "Horse racing in Wales has a long tradition dating back to the 18th century. Wales has held flat racing, National Hunt and harness racing, and presently has three racecourses, at Chepstow, Bangor-on-Dee and Ffos Las. The Welsh Grand National is held annually at Chepstow between Christmas and New Year and is the highlight of the Welsh racing calendar.\nHistory.\nOrganised horse racing in Wales originated with the gentry and aristocracy and among the earliest organised racing were point-to-point meetings. By 1833 there were internationally recognised flat races at many locations around the country, including Cowbridge, Haverfordwest, Conwy, Aberystwyth, Brecon and Wrexham. The Cowbridge races were very popular and attracted entries from as far away as Yorkshire. Steeplechasing began at Bangor-on-Dee racecourse in the 1850s and is still a racecourse to this day.\nWhen diarist John Byng in 1787 mentioned that he was passing 'not far from Cowbridge race ground' he was acknowledging the fame of the race meetings, which had grown from a family occasion into 'the Glamorgan races'. Early races were the scene of heavy betting and attracted other entertainments as diverse as exclusive balls, pig racing and prostitution. This brought large crowds to races and a mingling of the social classes though the sport itself remained in the control of the gentry. The Welsh gentry used horseracing to integrate themselves with their English counterparts, to gain a place for themselves in an elite British culture. In the mid and later 19th century there was growing pressure from religious quarters due to what was seen as the immoral and drunkenly behaviour that accompanied race days. This led to the Wrexham Races being abandoned between 1862 and 1890.\nThe 20th century saw the Welsh working class embrace the sport, mainly due to newspaper coverage and the spread of off-course betting. 1926 saw the opening of Chepstow Racecourse at St Arvans, and although remaining on the margins of British horseracing until the opening of the Severn Bridge in 1966, it is now the country's premier course. Chepstow holds the Welsh National, which is held annually between Christmas and New Year. Due to the growth of other leisure activities and the cost of keeping and breeding horse, flat and national hunt racing went into long-term decline in Wales from the middle of the 19th century. From the middle of the 20th century most of the country's racecourses had closed. Today only three racecourses survive in Wales, Chepstow, Bangor-on-Dee and Ffos Las which was opened in 2009.\nHarness racing.\nA popular, if unusual, form of horseracing in Wales is harness racing, known in Wales as 'trotting'. The sport involves horses racing at a non-galloping gait while being driven by men or women poised on two wheeled 'sulkies'. The sport grew in Wales in the late 19th century, originally involving Welsh cobs competing along roads. As the popularity of the sport rose, the races were transferred to grass tracks and 'standard bred' horses were imported from America to replace the native breeds. The oldest trotting meet in Wales is the Llangadog which has been held every Easter Monday since 1884. In 1990, 'Tir Prince' an American-style raceway was opened in Towyn which now holds 13 races a year, many of which are shown on Welsh language television channel S4C on its programme \"Rasus\".\nTregaron Trotting Club is host to the biggest festival of harness racing in the UK, an annual three day meeting on the last weekend in August.\nNotable Welsh jockeys.\nWales has produced several jockeys of note, including Jack Anthony who won the Grand National on three occasions (1911, 1915 and 1920), Hywel Davies who won it in 1985 and Carl Llewellyn who won the race in 1992 and again in 1998. Another notable Welsh jockey was Dick Francis, who was British jump racing Champion Jockey in the 1953-54 season and was famous for riding Devon Loch when the horse slipped close to the winning post when leading the 1956 Grand National. In retirement Francis became a best-selling author of crime novels set in the racing world.\nTwo jockeys have been inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. Jack Anthony and Geoff Lewis, who in 1971 won both the Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on Mill Reef.\nRacehorse training in Wales.\nTwo horses trained in Wales have won Britain's premier steeplechase, the Cheltenham Gold Cup; Patron Saint in 1928 and Norton's Coin in 1990. Norton's Coin, at 100-1, is the longest-priced winner of the race and won in a then-record time. He was trained by his owner, Sirrel Griffiths, a dairy farmer from Nantgaredig in Carmarthenshire.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, several trainers based in Wales have made an impact in National Hunt racing. Evan Williams, based in the Vale of Glamorgan, and Peter Bowen from Pembrokeshire have established themselves as successful trainers while Tim Vaughan, also from the Vale of Glamorgan, has started out on a training career with some success. Nigel Twiston-Davies, trainer of two Grand National winners and Imperial Commander, the 2010 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, is Welsh, although his training stables are in England."

        "text": "Donald Hopkins (born January 9, 1952) is an American former professional baseball player. An outfielder during his minor league baseball career, he was used almost exclusively as a pinch runner by the American League West Division champion Oakland Athletics. He stood tall and weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nAlthough a native of West Point, Mississippi, Hopkins attended Benton Harbor High School in Benton Harbor, Michigan where he played baseball with Dave Machemer. and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Montreal Expos in . A speedy baserunner, Hopkins stole over 40 bases four times in his minor league career, and was acquired the Athletics from Montreal just prior to the 1975 campaign. At the time, Oakland owner Charlie Finley — one of the early proponents of the designated hitter rule, adopted in the American League in — was also advocating the creation of the \"designated runner\" in baseball, and he regularly employed fast players on his 25-man roster to specialize in pinch running. Hopkins fulfilled that role during the 1975 season. He appeared in 82 games, largely pinch-running for future Baseball Hall of Fame member and veteran Billy Williams, who was Oakland's designated hitter. Hopkins stole 21 bases and scored 25 runs, but had only eight plate appearances. He drew two walks and had one career hit, a single, off the Detroit Tigers' Fernando Arroyo in a lopsided, 16–4 Oakland win on July 22.\nHopkins spent much of 1976 in the minor leagues, although he made three more pinch-running appearances for Oakland during September 1976. He retired after the 1977 minor-league season."

        "text": "Thomas George Bartlett (June 6, 1928 – October 19, 2016) was an American college basketball and tennis player, as well as a college basketball and tennis head coach. After graduating from the University of Tennessee, Bartlett served as the men's basketball head coach for Carson-Newman College, the University of Chattanooga (now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga), and the University of Florida, and also as the men's tennis head coach at the University of Tennessee and UT-Chattanooga.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBartlett was born in Homerville, Georgia, and graduated from Knoxville High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he played for the Tennessee Volunteers basketball team from 1949 to 1952 and the Volunteers men's tennis team from 1950 to 1952. In basketball, he was a three-year varsity letterman, team captain, and an All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection at guard as a senior; in tennis, he was a three-year letterman, a two-year starter, and the team captain and an All-SEC selection as a senior. Memorably, Bartlett was undefeated in three seasons on the Volunteers varsity men's tennis team, and won SEC singles tennis championships at No. 6 in 1950, No. 5 in 1951, and No. 3 in 1952, and SEC doubles championships at No. 3 in 1950 and 1951, and No. 2 in 1952. As a senior, Bartlett and was also the third-ranked college basketball player in the percentage of foul shots completed (80.2%), and led the Vols to their first-ever SEC team championship in men's tennis. He graduated from Tennessee in 1952.\nCoaching career.\nBartlett began his coaching career at Lenoir City High School in Lenoir City, Tennessee, in 1953. In four seasons as the Lenoir City Panthers head coach, he compiled an overall win–loss record of 97–20, and led the Panthers to the state high school championship semifinal game before losing to Kingsport High School in 1957.\nHe subsequently served as the head basketball coach for Carson-Newman College in 1957–1958, and the University of Chattanooga from 1958 to 1962. In 1962, he returned to his alma mater, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, as an assistant basketball coach under Ray Mears. In 1963, while continuing as a Volunteers basketball assistant, he also became the head coach of the Volunteers men's tennis team. In 1966, he led the Vols tennis team to their second SEC tennis team championship, and their first since 1952—when Bartlett was a member of the team.\nIn 1966, Bartlett began a seven-year tenure at Florida after Norm Sloan left for North Carolina State. Unlike Sloan, Bartlett emphasized defense from the start. Bartlett's first Gators squad, including Gary Keller and Neal Walk, was the best Florida had produced until that time; they finished 21–4 overall (the school's first 20-win season), and 14–4 in the SEC. It was also the first Gators basketball squad to ever be ranked in the national polls. In an era when only conference champions were guaranteed bids in the 23-team NCAA Tournament, the Gators missed their first SEC title and NCAA Tournament appearance by a single game after losing to coach Ray Mears' Tennessee Volunteers twice in the regular season. Although Bartlett's 1968–1969 Gators received an invitation to the 1969 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), none of his subsequent Gators teams equaled the success of his first. He was also responsible for recruiting Florida's first African-American player, Steve Williams. He finished with an overall win–loss record of 95–85 and 62–64 in the SEC.\nBartlett returned to collegiate coaching in 1979, serving as the men's and women's tennis head coach for the Chattanooga Mocs for twelve seasons until 1990. His Chattanooga Mocs teams won eight Southern Conference men's tennis championships (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989); his Lady Mocs teams won five Southern Conference women's tennis championships (1984, 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1990) and three NCAA Division II women's tennis championships (1983, 1984 and 1985).\nBartlett was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. He died on October 19, 2016, at his home in Chattanooga.\nTennis family.\nBartlett's daughter-in-law, Sue Bartlett, was an All-American for the Chattanooga Lady Mocs tennis team in 1978; his granddaughter, Claire Bartlett, played for the Florida Gators women's tennis team from 2008 to 2011."

        "text": "Stance is the position an American football player adopts when a play begins. There are three common stances used by linemen: two-point, three-point, and four-point. The stance names reference the number of points where a player's body is touching the ground while down in the stance. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses; therefore, each one is used accordingly in different situations. Furthermore, stances are taught and used differently depending on the level of competition (little league football, high school football, college football, etc.).\nOverview.\nIn the National Football League (NFL), the average amount of plays per game is over 60 per team. This means that, in one game, a lineman playing the entire time could enter a stance more than 60 times. However, it is not likely to be the same stance every time. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the offensive team must remain still for one second prior to the ball being snapped. This means that once an offensive player has become set in a stance, he must stay in it until the ball is snapped and the play begins. Additional motion can result in a false start penalty. Defensive players, on the other hand, are permitted to shift as much as they want before a play. It is possible for a defensive lineman to line up in one stance and then change to another just before the play begins. He can even shift his body to another place.\nTwo-point stance.\nThe two-point variation is the most upright stance. Another name for the stance is the universal stance. The two-point is used by offensive linemen to facilitate better pass blocking because it increases their initial field of vision and gives more reaction time (to stay in front of a rushing player). Consequently, it is usually only used in a situation that will require passing. Some defensive linemen employ this stance to pass rush because they naturally obtain more quickness and agility out of it (particularly the defensive ends).\nTechnique.\nThe \"two-points\" on the ground in this stance are just the feet. They are placed shoulder width apart pointing forward. One of the feet is staggered back, for an offensive-lineman this will be the foot away from the ball; for a defensive-lineman it will be the foot towards the ball. While in this stance the player's center of gravity will be slightly lowered by bending at the knees and waist. Weight is kept away from the heels to promote quickness and agility out of the stance in any direction.\nThree-point stance.\nThe most common variation is the three-point stance. The purpose of this stance is to give the player leverage and allow more of their legs' power to be used. This is the offensive lineman's most used stance. It allows them to easily stay low and move in any direction at the snap of the ball. The interior defensive lineman use this stance for the same reason; however, it is usually slightly adjusted.\nTechnique.\nThe added \"point\" is the player's strong hand on the ground (the down-hand). In higher divisions of play, ambidexterity between down-hands is required. A player entering the stance begins in a two-point stance; the player's staggered foot will be on the same side as the down-hand. The player then bends the knees and waist until the thighs and back are nearly parallel to the ground. The down-hand is merely an anchoring point for offensive linemen; typically, very little weight is put onto it. Offensive linemen may have to move in any direction so it is counterproductive to put weight on their down-hand (this only facilitates forward movement.) However, defensive players usually put more weight on their down-hand to have a more explosive start as they almost always go forward. This gives them the power of their legs coupled with forward momentum for a stronger push.\nFour-point stance.\nThe least common variation is the four-point stance. This stance is used for maximum explosion and leverage in one direction (straight ahead of the player). Offensive linemen will typically only use it if they need to force the line forward only inches. Interior defensive linemen will use it to keep this push from happening.\nTechnique.\nThe added \"point\" in this stance is the other arm. It is simply a three-point with the other hand put down. However, the hands in this case are allowed as much of the body's weight as the feet.\nProposed bans.\nThe three-point stance has become a staple in every football game. However, this has drawn attention to the danger it puts players in. The NFL has gained bad reputation because of the players' long-term and sometimes life-threatening complications brought about by head injuries. The NFL's commissioner, Roger Goodell, has stated the possibility of banning the three-point stance because it makes linemen more likely to initiate head-to-head contact."

        "text": "The Never Miss a Super Bowl Club (or the NMASB Club) is a group of football fans (outside of owners and staff) who have gone to every Super Bowl since 1967. Visa popularized the original group of four in a commercial that aired in 2010. Since then, two members have died and one has been retroactively added, bringing the total to three surviving fans—Don Crisman, Tom Henschel, and Gregory Eaton—who most recently attended Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. Photojournalist John Biever is the only known person outside of the group of fans to have attended every Super Bowl.\nHistory.\nThe club was first popularized by Visa as part of an advertising campaign called \"Go Fans\". The commercial was narrated by Morgan Freeman. Surveys have shown that most respondents would be willing to miss or postpone major events in their life, including the birth of their child or a wedding date, to see the Super Bowl. As a result, Visa came up with an advertising campaign to feature four men who have attended every Super Bowl since the first one in 1967. The four men were New England Patriots fan Don Crisman, San Francisco 49ers fan Larry Jacobson, Pittsburgh Steelers fan Thomas Henschel, and Green Bay Packers fan Robert Cook. The commercial itself featured the four men holding up tickets for 44 years of Super Bowls.\nIn early February 2011, it was announced that 79-year-old Cook would be unable to attend Super Bowl XLV after being hospitalized in Wisconsin. His daughters were expected to attend the game in his place. He died a few days after the game.\nAt Super Bowl LI, in February 2017, another person who had gone to every Super Bowl game, Gregory Eaton, met the three remaining members and officially joined the club. Eaton is a fan of the Detroit Lions.\nIn October 2017, Jacobson died, reducing the club to three members.\nLifetime tickets promotion.\nA promotion was also run during the 2010 commercial. \"The Super Bowl Trip for Life Sweepstakes\" stated that anyone who used their Visa card between September 9 and December 31, 2010, would be entered to win a chance to see the Super Bowl for life. Winners would receive round-trip airfare, accommodations, and tickets to the Super Bowl. In 2011, it was announced that Tyler Weber, then 24 years old, won the contest.\nOwner and staff attendees.\nGroundskeeper George Toma assisted in preparing the field for the first 57 Super Bowls. Super Bowl LVIII was the first game Toma did not attend or serve as a groundskeeper.\nNorma Hunt, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs founding owner Lamar Hunt, was the only woman to attend every Super Bowl game. She attended every Super Bowl until her death in June 2023. Her final Super Bowl she attended, Super Bowl LVII, was won by the Chiefs. She was also on the podium for the Lombardi Trophy presentation for the Chiefs Super Bowl LIV victory. Her husband Lamar Hunt helped establish the championship game and coined the term \"super bowl\".\nAs of Super Bowl LVIII, photojournalist John Biever has attended every Super Bowl.\nSports journalist Jerry Green attended every Super Bowl until choosing to not go to Super Bowl LVII due to declining health. Green died the month following the game, on March 24, 2023."

        "text": "James Ryan Marshall (born 7 December 1988) is a former New Zealand rugby union player. He played in the First five-eighth, Fullback and occasionally Second five-eighth positions for the in Super Rugby and in the Bunnings NPC. He also captained the Taranaki Bulls in the ITM Cup. He is the older brother of Crusader Tom Marshall. He announced his retirement on his What a Lad Podcast in January 2021 due to an ongoing injury to his hip. He is currently the assistant coach for the Crusaders.\nEarly life.\nMarshall was born in Auckland but moved to Nelson as a child, playing his junior rugby for Stoke and Nelson. He was educated at Nelson College from 2002 to 2006 and played for the school's top side in his final two years there. Marshall also came to the attention of national selectors. However, he failed to make the New Zealand Under 17s and Under 19s. It was the same with the New Zealand Under 20s, losing out to Daniel Kirkpatrick of and Trent Renata of .\nDomestic career.\nMarshall started his career with after he made his debut for the Mako in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup competition, coming on as a replacement against Bay of Plenty. In 2009 he suffered an injury in the first match which kept him out for most of the season, but went on and made his first full game against Taranaki. During the 2010 ITM Cup he made an immediate impact with his decisive running and ability to spot a gap. His strong performances saw him take over Fly-half, mainly starting in the number 10 position throughout the season.\nMarshall left for Italy to begin a six month contract with Aironi Rugby after his name was missing from Super 15 squad selections. He spent five months playing for the side, making several Heineken Cup appearances and also featuring in the Celtic League. However he continued his career with Tasman during the 2011 season before he headed north on a two year contract with Taranaki, having played 36 games and scored 46 points for the side. He made his debut for Taranaki, playing the season's first two Ranfurly Shield matches against King Country and Wanganui. His performances didn't go unnoticed by the national media or the Super Rugby coaches as he went on to play all 12 matches and score 5 tries. Marshall's versatility and high standard of performance in several positions, including wing, first five-eighth, fullback and second five-eighth helped him win Taranaki back of the year for 2012 ahead of finalists Frazier Climo and Jamison Gibson-Park.\nHis form for Taranaki in the number 10 jersey in Beauden Barrett's absence saw him pick up a Hurricanes contract in late 2012. He played his first Super Rugby match in the Hurricanes 29–28 victory over the Crusaders in Week 4 of the 2013 competition. He had an eye catching debut season, starting the season as the Hurricanes backup first five-eighth behind Taranaki teammate Beauden Barrett and ending it by making three straight starting appearances at fullback. In all, he started or came off the bench in eight matches out of 16 in 2013.\nMarshall made two starts for the Hurricanes at fullback in 2014, before captaining Taranaki to win their maiden ITM Cup premiership title.\nOn 6 January 2016 it was announced that Marshall would join the Greene King IPA Championship side London Irish ahead of the 2016-17 season. The Hurricanes went on to win the 2016 Super Rugby season for the first time.\nHe returned to the Hurricanes for the 2019 Super Rugby season. He was not named in the Hurricanes squad for the 2021 Super Rugby season.\nMarshall returned to for the 2020 Mitre 10 Cup but it was announced he would miss the season with injury. The Mako went on to win their second premiership title in a row.\nInternational career.\nIn 2011, Marshall played for New Zealand at the Sevens World Series on the Gold Coast and in Dubai. However, he missed the competition's third leg, in Port Elizabeth, because he returned New Zealand to join the Hurricanes Wider Training Group."

Djabir Saïd-Guerni led the chase through the final turn, with William Yiampoy on his heels. Through the turn, Rashid Ramzi went around the outside, passing Saïd-Guerni as they hit the home stretch. Saïd-Guerni faded allowing Yiampoy to pass him on the inside. Further back Borzakovskiy was dealing with traffic of Mehdi Baala and Ali still in sixth place coming off the final turn. Ramzi easily sprinted past Bungei and on to victory. Bungei was struggling to hold on to second with Yiampoy sneaking through, again on the inside. Borzakovskiy's late rush caught everybody else, passing Yiampoy just before the line but was too late to catch Ramzi.

Returning silver medalist Mehdi Baala didn't make it out of the semi-final round.\nThe race was led from the start, as it had been two years earlier, by Reyes Estévez who was known as a kicker, leading the field though a casual 60+ second first lap. Alan Webb marked Estévez, nervously trying to figure out a way to take the kick out of the faster runners. Rams added to his tension by coasting up to Webb's shoulder as the second lap began with the rest of the field bunching up behind. Just after the end of the second lap, Webb took off sprinting, timed in 12.3 between 800 and 900 meters. He opened up a four mere lead but Alex Kipchirchir and Ramzi followed by the rest of the field were in hot pursuit. Webb was unable to maintain his breakaway. In the penultimate turn he was passed by Ramzi who did have a breakaway, chased most closely by returning bronze medalist Ivan Heshko. Down the final backstretch Kipchirchir went by on the outside and Olympic bronze medalist Rui Silva squeezed by on the inside, Webb was cooked. From 9th place, deep in the field, Adil Kaouch began a final sprint, passing three as the slowing Webb was an obstacle. Continuing through the final turn, Kaouch passed everybody except Ramzi. Down the final stretch Ramzi's lead looked like it might not be enough but Ramzi was able to hold on for the win. Following Kaouch, Silva was also sprinting, after passing Heshko the medalists were decided. As Kaouch's gaining diminished he continued at his same pace, but Silva finished with an all out rush to the line missing the silver medal by a mere .02 of a second.\nLagat would return to competition to beat Ramzi to silver in 2007. But Ramzi took the Olympic gold medal in 2008. That gold was short-lived as Ramzi was disqualified for having CERA in his system. While Ramzi's World Championship medals have not been disqualified, the Olympic disqualification puts a taint on Ramzi's accomplishments.\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.\nHeats.\nAugust 6, 2005\nSemifinals.\nAugust 8, 2005\nFinal.\nAugust 10, 2005"
