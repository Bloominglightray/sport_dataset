        "text": "Corey Webster (born 29 November 1988) is a New Zealand professional basketball player for the Auckland Tuatara of the New Zealand National Basketball League (NZNBL). He joined the New Zealand Breakers of the Australian National Basketball League (NBL) for the first time in 2008 after a season of college basketball in the United States for Lambuth University, and won championships with the club in 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nHe has also been a regular in the New Zealand NBL, winning championships with the Wellington Saints in 2011, 2014 and 2017, and with the Canterbury Rams in 2023. He has had stints in Serbia, Greece, Israel, China, Italy and Egypt, winning the 2023 BAL championship with Al Ahly.\nEarly and college career.\nWebster attended Westlake Boys High School in Auckland, New Zealand, and played junior basketball for North Harbour Basketball Association. He moved to the United States in 2007 and played a season of college basketball for Lambuth University of the NAIA. He averaged 11.5 points per game and was named the TSAC Freshman of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nAustralian NBL.\nNew Zealand Breakers.\nIn June 2008, Webster joined the New Zealand Breakers of the Australian NBL for the first time, signing as a development player. He spent two seasons as a development player before joining the full-time roster ahead of the 2010–11 season. He won his first championship with the Breakers that season before missing the 2011–12 season due to a drug violation. The Breakers brought him back on a three-year deal ahead of the 2012–13 season and won his second NBL championship that season. He averaged a then career-high 8.5 points per game during the 2013–14 season.\nThe 2014–15 season saw Webster develop into one of the league's premier scorers as he moved to a starting role and averaged a team-best 15.3 points per game, including scoring a career-high 24 points in the first semi-final against the Adelaide 36ers. He helped the Breakers win their fourth title in five years.\nAfter re-signing with the Breakers on a three-year deal, Webster's 2015 off-season saw him attend a pre-draft tryout with the Indiana Pacers and later spent NBA preseason with the New Orleans Pelicans. With the Breakers in 2015–16, Webster scored a career-high 39 points in November and helped the team return to the NBL Grand Final series, where they lost to the Perth Wildcats. He earned All-NBL Second Team honours after he finished second in scoring with 21.09 points per game during the regular season.\nAfter missing the second half of the 2016–17 NBL season due to a hip injury, Webster was released by the Breakers in March 2017. He subsequently played for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2017 NBA Summer League.\nOn 24 May 2018, Webster returned to the Breakers on another three-year deal. He started the 2018–19 NBL season strong, but had a form slump in December that saw him present as a shadow of the figure who was once a premier scorer in the league. He returned to form in the 2019–20 NBL season, averaging 19.5 points in 11 games, before being bought out of his contract in December in order to sign in China.\nWebster re-joined the Breakers for the 2020–21 NBL season, but he missed the first two weeks of the season after slicing a nerve in his hand with a knife in his kitchen. He was later sidelined for four weeks with a knee injury.\nOn 20 August 2021, Webster parted ways with the Breakers.\nPerth Wildcats.\nOn 30 March 2017, Webster signed a two-year deal with the Perth Wildcats. However, he soon requested a release from his contract, which was granted by the Wildcats on 13 July 2017.\nOn 15 June 2022, Webster reunited with the Wildcats on a two-year deal. On 12 December 2022, in his 250th NBL game, he hit the game-winning 3-pointer to lift the Wildcats to a 90–89 win over Melbourne United.\nOn 3 May 2023, Webster re-signed with the Wildcats on a new two-year deal. After playing 27 minutes per game in 2022–23, he fell out of favour in 2023–24 to average 13 minutes per game. The Wildcats did not pick up their team option on his contract for the 2024–25 season.\nNew Zealand NBL.\nWebster debuted in the New Zealand NBL in 2009, playing two seasons for the Harbour Heat. In 2011, he joined the Wellington Saints and helped them win the championship. His second season with the Saints came in 2013. In 2014, he won the league MVP and another championship with the Saints. He spent the 2016 season with the Super City Rangers. In 2017 with the Saints, he won his second MVP award and third championship. In 2022, he played for the Franklin Bulls. He joined the Canterbury Rams in 2023 and won his fourth NZNBL championship. He joined the Auckland Tuatara for the 2024 season.\nOverseas.\nFollowing both the 2014–15 and 2015–16 NBL seasons, Webster played in Europe. He played in Serbia in 2015 with Mega Leks and in Greece in 2016 with Koroivos.\nWebster played the 2017–18 season in Israel for Ironi Nahariya. He won the Three-Point Shootout during the league's All-Star Event. Following the Israeli season, he joined the Guizhou Shenghang Snow Leopards of the Chinese NBL.\nIn December 2019, Webster returned to China to play for the Zhejiang Lions in the CBA. He played in seven games before leaving China on 3 February 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He moved to Italy later that month to play for Virtus Roma of the Lega Basket Serie A, but that season was also cut short due to the pandemic. He appeared in just one game for Roma.\nWebster played the 2021–22 season in Egypt for Al Ittihad.\nIn February 2023, Webster joined KK Mornar Bar of the Montenegrin League for the rest of the 2022–23 season. He returned to Egypt in April 2023 and joined Al Ahly. He helped Al Ahly win the Basketball Africa League championship for the 2023 season. He scored 13 points in the 80–65 win over Douanes in the final.\nNational team career.\nWebster joined the New Zealand national basketball team for the first time in 2008 at the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. He later played for New Zealand at the 2009 FIBA Oceania Championship, 2013 FIBA Oceania Championship, 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, 2015 FIBA Oceania Championship and 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nPersonal life.\nWebster is the son of Tony and Cherry Webster. Tony, who is from New York, was a standout basketball player in his own right, earning first-team All-WAC honours at Hawaii in 1983 and ranking fourth on Hawaii's career steals list before playing professionally in New Zealand. Webster's younger brother, Tai, played four years of college basketball for the University of Nebraska and has played professionally in New Zealand and Europe."

        "text": "The 1988 UCI Road World Championships took place in Ronse, Belgium. As this was an Olympic year all the Olympic cycling events served as World Championships, leaving just the Professional road race and the Women's Team Time Trial to be contested. The men's road race was decided in a sprint involving three riders, Maurizio Fondriest, Claude Criquielion and Steve Bauer. 200 meters from the uphill finish, Bauer began the sprint and Fondriest was unable to respond. However, Bauer realised his gear was too heavy, quickly sat down, and shifted down gear. As a result, his speed temporarily dropped, and Criquielion accelerated to the right of Bauer, close to the barriers.\nUnfortunately, at exactly that place, the barriers on the right hand side of the road (from the riders' perspective) were set up in an irregular manner by the organisers of the race, narrowing in width for about 1-1.5 meters. The riders were aware of this, since the championship consisted of 18 laps over the same circuit, and the riders had already passed that point 17 times before during the race. It is quite common for UCI world championship road races to have several laps over the same circuit.\nAs a result of Criquielion's temporarily higher speed and the sudden narrowing of the barriers, Criquielion had effectively trapped himself. Bauer did not alter his course after he started sprinting and kept his line. However, since the frontal TV camera was placed at an angle at the left side of the road (from the riders' perspective) and not perpendicular, it seemed from that point of view as if Bauer moved to the right to block Criquielion. This impression was strengthened by the narrowing of the barriers, which was at a similar angle as the angle of the camera.\nAs a result of his slightly greater speed and Bauer keeping his line, Criquielion came into contact with the back of Bauer's right elbow, pushing it out. Consequently, Criquielion veered a bit to the right, and his head hit against the body of a police man who has standing before the barrier. Next, Criquielion's bike hit the concrete block at the bottom of the barriers, and he fell. Bauer was able to \"jump\" his bike about a meter to the left, a remarkable manoeuvre of riding skills, but as a result of this lost much speed, making it easy for Fondriest to overtake him and claim the world title. Criquelion's bike was damaged too much to cycle again and he was passed by the pursuing group while walking to the finish line. Bauer finished second but was a couple of minutes later disqualified after the race. \nCriquielion was later convinced to press criminal charges for voluntary and involuntary battering against Bauer. His first lawyer who pressed the criminal charges on his behalf was Orphale Crucke, who was also the president of the organising committee of the race, and therefore directly responsible for the irregular placement of the barriers, and, incidentally, also the mayor of the locality where the race took place (Ronse/Renaix), and running for re-election in the communal elections scheduled two months later.\nThe case came before the criminal court of Oudenaarde, where Bauer was cleared of all charges. Criquielion appealed before the court of Appeal of Ghent, which re-ran the case in all full details, as is normal in Belgian criminal law, and also fully cleared Bauer. In these criminal cases, even an involuntary push by Bauer would have been sufficient for establishing a criminal fault in principle (even if no intent was shown), and thus liability. No such fault was proven on the basis of detailed analysis of the TV coverage (including helicopter images), and Bauer was completely cleared."

It is located 10 minutes from downtown Gatineau/Ottawa and is one of the oldest clubs in the National Capital Region. In 2010, the club celebrated its centennial anniversary.\nHistory.\nRivermead Golf Club was established in 1910 and opened in 1911 as a nine-hole course, under the direction of architect Charles Murray. The course was expanded to 18 holes in 1915 following the purchase of additional land in 1912. George Cumming directed the expansion.\nThroughout its first 100 years, Rivermead Golf Club has hosted many national, provincial and local championship events, including:\nIn 1948, Rivermead, along with the Ottawa Hunt and Royal Ottawa golf clubs, formed the Ottawa District Golf Association, which became the Ottawa Valley Golf Association in 1981. The three clubs (in rotation) have hosted the Alexander of Tunis tournament every three years since its inception in 1950.\nIn 1989, golf course architect Ken Skodacek (working with Ken Venturi) modernized and re-designed the course resulting in the present course layout. The golf course is par 72 for men and par 75 for women. The course yardage varies from 5,359 to 6,559 yards. In 2008, the Club spent $2.4 million to refurbish the clubhouse facility and to create a new outdoor patio overlooking the 18th green. In 2010, as part of its centennial celebrations, the club dedicated a bridge near the 18th green to commemorate the milestone and to honour past and current members.\nRivermead Cup.\nRivermead Golf Club donated the Rivermead Cup to the Royal Canadian Golf Association in 1920. It was awarded to the Canadian Open champion until 1935, when the RCGA obtained a sponsor and a new trophy. The Rivermead Cup is now awarded annually to the low Canadian in the RBC Canadian Open."

France defeated Ukraine 2-1 to secure a spot among the 10 national junior teams competing at the 25th IIHF-sanctioned World Junior Hockey Championships held in Pardubice, Czech-Republic in 2001-02. France opened their first game against Canada and lost 15-0, which still stands as their largest margin of defeat. The French would never recover with losses to Russia (5-1), Finland (8-0), Switzerland (8-0). France would automatically be sent down to the relegation round with back-to-back games against Belarus. France won the first game 3-2, but would end up losing 4-2 the following game sending France packing back to Division I. \nFrance had a powerful start to the 2003 World Junior Division I championships held in Almaty, Kazakhstan as they won their first game 10-1 against Croatia, but losses to Japan (4-2), Kazakhstan (3-0), and Ukraine (3-0) cost France their chance to return to the top level. Ukraine would go on to win the tournament and return for the first time since 2000. \nBriancon, France was host to the 2004 World Junior Championships Division I. France won the opening game 4-1 over Japan, but would not recover as Belarus earned its second promotion to the top division. Since then, France has never been promoted out of Division I and nearly relegated to Division II. \nPhillipe Bozon, who is the only France-born player to suit up for the NHL's St. Louis Blues was named head coach of the U20 program in 2009. France hosted the 2010 Division I championships in Megeve &amp; Saint-Gervais, France. With Bozon appointed as head coach to replace Dave Henderson, who led the squad to the top division for 2002. Many predicted France would easily be promoted to top division for 2011, but Germany won the tournament and France was relegated to Division II for 2011. "

        "text": "The Swansea University Rowing Club (SURC) is the rowing club of Swansea University, Wales, and is situated on the west bank of the River Tawe in Swansea. It is unknown when the club was founded, but was re-founded in 2004. Rowing with SURC is open to all members of Sport Swansea, who provide a nominal level of funding and insurance for all university clubs.\nAlong with Cardiff University Boat Club, it is considered one of the biggest and most active rowing clubs in Wales.\nLocation.\nThe club trains on the River Tawe and enjoys almost exclusive use of the 3 km of rowable water, with two long straight sections. Land-based training takes place at the University Sports Centre, along the seafront and sometimes on the beach in Swansea Bay itself.\nAlthough the club has few of its own facilities due to the extensive redevelopment along the river by Swansea City Council, the members use the facilities kindly provided by Swansea Yacht and Sub Aqua Club to launch and change. The Sail Bridge, with its 40m high mast, is one of the recent additions to the river, having been opened in 2003.\nCompetition.\nThe club competes at a number of regattas and head races throughout the academic year (September – August). Before Christmas, the club sends its senior crews to Cardiff Small Boats Head and thereafter tries to send all crews to the Welsh Indoor Championships and Bristol Head Race. These events provide the 'fresher' crews with some initial race experience. Senior crews will sometimes compete at the Fours head of the River Race, held on the Tideway in November.\nAfter Christmas, the club enters a number of events during the season for head races. These include Cardiff Head of the Taff, BUCS Head Race (often on the Trent), Women's Eights Head of the River Race and the Head of the River Race, the last two of these being held on the Tideway.\nThe Welsh Boat Race is the main training focus before the BUCS Regatta, the start of the \"regatta season\", where Swansea University Rowing Club race Cardiff University Boat Club side-by-side along a set distance on either the River Taff or the River Tawe.\nHistory.\nThe club was started in the 1970s and closed in the early 1980s. Since then Will Edmondson and his sister Anne-Marie restarted the club by breaking into the shed and getting out the old boats in 1989. They were helped by Andrew Williams (of Mumbles ARC). Rob Jones joined the club at the end of 1989 and the club set about buying some kit. Will Garnier was President, Rob Jones was secretary and after a bit of work, they got an eight out for the Head of the River Race and raced at various events including Reading Town where they reached the final of the Senior 2 event. At this stage there were about 25 racing members and had a huge social section with parties at their boathouse on the Cwm Lleidi (Swiss Valley reservoir) reservoir near Llanelli. The President and Secretary looked into moving the club to the River Tawe by the Morfa Stadium and secured a small space to keep boats there. The club dissolved around 1995 and did not start again until 2004. In that time, the stadium had been demolished, with a number of university boats going with it.\nThe club was revived in 2004 by Tim Stickley, who found just one river-worthy boat in a shed by the university playing fields. An area was organised in the car park next to the River Tawe on which to put the club trailer and permission obtained from Swansea Yacht and Sub Aqua Club to use their slipway to launch. Membership has increased dramatically and the club's fleet of boats has grown over subsequent years, with different captains bringing new things to the club, notably a training camp and The Welsh Boat Race under Henry Hilsdon, a new trailer under Sophie Clarke-Hackston (club captain for 2 years) and a first boat race win under Jenny Staight. Club captains since then have been Steven Gray and Ania Negele. In more recent years the club has gone from strength to strength. Moving from a social club to a performance based club. With help from Welsh Rowing and the university, SURC has purchased a number of new racing shells for the fleet, allowing the expanding membership to perform at the highest level they can. Membership numbers from the 2014/15 season are around 80–100 members, both performance and social.\nAlumni and members.\nThe club has produced Paralympic and World Championship finalist rowers such as James Roberts. Also from SURC have been Welsh International rowers Daniel John, Kate Evans, Edward Hares and Aidan Thompson. Dan John won the coxless four event at the 2009 Home International Regatta. Kate Evans also placed 2nd at 2009 BUCS regatta in the women's lightweight singles event, and represented British Universities at the European Universities regatta.\nTawe Phoenix Boat Club.\nIn 2010 the Tawe Phoenix Boat Club was set up as an alumni club. It is affiliated with British Rowing and hopes to provide a name to race under for members who are continuing the Swansea spirit. The club aims to support the interests of Swansea University Rowing Club, to enter some races and to meet up socially at various points throughout each year."

The first North West team to join the new league were the Chester Wolves; more teams from the North West joined the following season and a Northern Division was set up with teams from the North West and the North Midlands. Following a big expansion to the Rugby League Conference in 2003, the North West got its own regional division.\nThe Premier Division were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and were able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. The new Premier Divisions included the North Premier, the South Premier, the Central Premier and the Welsh Premier. The Central Premier had two Midlands clubs and the rest of the clubs were from Yorkshire or Lancashire whilst the North Premier had clubs from the North East of England and Cumbria. The Premier divisions saw a change in boundaries in 2006 leaving the North Premier division covering a larger area to give the Midlands clubs their own premier division.\nThe North West Premier came into existence in 2009 when the North Premier was replaced by the North West and Yorkshire Premiers.\nRugby League Conference Pyramid.\nAbove the North West Premier is the National Division and below is the North West regional division followed by the North West Merit League.\nOther Premier divisions are the South, Welsh, Midlands and Yorkshire."

Medals were awarded for military patrol in 1924, but it was a demonstration event for the other three Winter Games.\nThe official website of the IOC now treats military patrol at the 1924 Games as a separate discipline, without mixing it with the sports of skiing or biathlon. However, the 1924 Official Report treats it as an event within the sport of skiing.\nMedal table.\nSource:"

It was released on Philips CD-i, Macintosh, and DOS. It was a pack-in game for some CD-i models. The UK version of the game is available in French and English as it is a French game.\nPlot.\nPlayers take on the role of \"Victor Player\" - An experienced player whose nationality depends on what language has been selected. There are several different gameplay styles. Match - Allows players to play a single game of tennis. Tournament - Allows players to play a series of games against various opponents. Training - Allows players to practice before playing a game. This involved playing against a ball throwing machine.\nIn between or at the start of games, sports commentator George Eddy would comment on the game.\nReception.\n\"GamePro\" gave the CD-i version a perfect score, lauding the game for its \"awesome, realistic, rotoscoped graphics and animation similar to, but more fluid than, Delphine Software's \"Flashback\"\", its realistic sounds, and its challenging AI opponents."

        "text": "Alain Courtois, a Belgian Member of Parliament, announced in October 2006 that a formal bid would be made on behalf of the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to host either the 2018 FIFA World Cup or 2022 version, but later decided to concentrate solely on the 2018 version (see 2018 European World Cup bids).\nIn June 2007 the three countries launched their campaign not as a joint bid in the manner of the Korea-Japan World Cup in 2002, but emphasizing it as a common political organization.\nLuxembourg would not host any matches or automatically qualify for the finals in a successful Benelux bid, but would host a FIFA congress.\nDevelopments.\nBelgium and the Netherlands registered their intention to bid jointly in March 2009. A delegation led by the presidents of the Belgian and Dutch national football associations met FIFA president Sepp Blatter on 14 November 2007, officially announcing their interest in submitting a joint bid.\nOn 19 March 2008 the delegation also met with UEFA President Michel Platini to convince him that it was a serious offer under one management. Afterwards they claimed to have impressed Platini, who supports the idea of getting the world cup to Europe.\nFIFA tends to favour bids from single nations. In 2009, Blatter suggested that joint bids would be rejected if a suitable individual bid was available. Another factor that is against the Benelux bid is the lack of an 80,000 capacity stadium to host the final.\nHowever, the city council of Rotterdam gave permission in March 2009 for development of a new stadium with a capacity of around 80,000 seats to be completed in time for the possible World Cup in 2018.\nBelgian prime minister Yves Leterme met the mayor of the city of Brussels Freddy Thielemans and NMBS/SNCB leader to discuss plans for a new 60,000-seater stadium in Brussels, for which there are three possibilities: the first would be to renovate and expand the current King Baudouin Stadium, the second would be to build a new stadium on the Heysel, and the third would be to build one on the property of the SNCB in the municipality of Schaerbeek. As a whole, Leterme stated that Belgium should get 4 stadia with a capacity of 40,000 together with the new 60,000-seater stadium in Brussels.\nEuro 2000 was also jointly hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands.\nOn 23 June former French football international Christian Karembeu was presented as official counselor for the joint bid.\n2018 World Cup European bids.\nAfter eventual withdrawals from both Australia, and the United States in bidding for the 2018 World Cup, and in practice with FIFA's current policy of the same continent unable to win both bids, the Belgium/Netherlands bid is effectively disqualified from eligibility for the 2022 edition.\nCandidate venues.\nIn November 2009, the venues were presented. In Belgium, matches will be played in 7 venues: Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Charleroi, Genk, Ghent and Liège. In the Netherlands, only five cities would host matches: Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Enschede, Heerenveen and Rotterdam, but both Amsterdam and Rotterdam will provide two stadiums. Eindhoven will function as the 'capital city' of the World Cup."

        "title": "Tommy Thompson (rugby union)",
        "text": "Gerald \"Tommy\" W. Thompson (4 October 1886 – 20 June 1916) was a South African rugby union player who played for Somerset West Rugby Club. He was selected for the provincial team of Western Province in 1912. He was selected to participate in the 1912–13 South Africa rugby tour to the British Isles and France, and was capped in three tests, against , and , all in 1912. He played in a further 12 matches against club sides. He was considered one of the two best of an outstanding pack of South African forwards.\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Thompson willingly volunteered for service, first in South West Africa, and then in the German East Africa campaign, with the 5th South African Infantry. He was killed in action at Kangata, taking a bullet in the neck. He is buried in the Dar es Salaam War Cemetery, near his fellow countryman and teammate Jacky Morkel, who died a few weeks before him.\nEarly life.\nTommy Thompson was born on 4 October 1886, in Carnarvon, Cape Colony, and attended Rondebosch Boys' High School.\nRugby career.\nThompson played rugby for Somerset West Rugby Club, and in 1912 was selected for his provincial club Western Province. He was a member of the n rugby team that toured the British Isles and France in 1912–13. The team won all four of its international matches against the Home Nations, and against . Thompson played against , , and , and in a further twelve matches against other teams. He was considered to be one of the two best amongst the 'finest pack of forwards'. The contemporary rugby journalist and author E. H. D. Sewell recounted seeing the game against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 23 November 1912, and said of Thompson: \"I have never seen a better individual performance than his on that frost-bound pitch... Only a few have I seen to equal that all-round display\". Thompson played \"like one possessed\" en route to a 38 point to zero victory.\nMilitary service.\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Thompson volunteered for service in South West Africa. At the conclusion of that campaign, he responded to the call for recruits to serve in East Africa, and was drafted into the 5th Regiment of the South African Infantry. In April 1916, Thompson contracted malaria and was hospitalised. The troops, who had to march hundreds of miles through difficult terrain, cutting their way through dense bush, suffered greatly from malaria and a shortage of rations.\nOn 19 June, the 5th South African Infantry, under the command of Colonel J.J. Byron, was sent in pursuit of German forces, to occupy Kangata, 8 miles south of Pongwe. They found the Germans entrenched in a concealed position in dense bush. During the firefight that ensued, Byron's forces took heavy losses, but sustained the attack until night, when the Germans retreated. Thompson was killed in action the following day, 20 June 1916, after a bullet pierced his neck.\nThompson is buried at Dar es Salaam War Cemetery (Grave 8. A. 3.). His grave lies near that of his fellow countryman and teammate, Jacky Morkel, who died on 15 May 1916 in East Africa."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre backstroke",
        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place on 22 September at the Jamsil Indoor Swimming Pool in Seoul, South Korea. There were 44 competitors from 32 nations. Each nation had been limited to two swimmers in the event since 1984. The event was won by Igor Polyansky of the Soviet Union. Frank Baltrusch of East Germany took silver, while Paul Kingsman of New Zealand earned bronze. The medals were the first in the men's 200 metre backstroke for the Soviet Union and New Zealand; East Germany had not medaled in the event since Roland Matthes won gold in 1968 and 1972. For the first time, the United States competed and did not earn at least silver.\nThe award ceremony did not go smoothly. Kingsman was erroneously introduced as being from the Soviet Union. When his nationality was corrected to New Zealand, it was also announced that the New Zealand national anthem would be played. This had to be corrected as well, and the Soviet anthem (for the winner, Polyansky) was played.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nNone of the 8 finalists from the 1984 Games returned. The medalists at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships had been Igor Polyansky of the Soviet Union, Frank Baltrusch of East Germany, and Frank Hoffmeister of West Germany. All three competed in Seoul. Polyansky was also the world record holder, having set it in a Soviet-East German dual meet in 1985. He was the heavy favourite in the event, with his only loss since 1985 being the European championship (to fellow Soviet Sergei Zabolotnov).\nCosta Rica, Guam, Iceland, Lebanon, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their seventh appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. A \"consolation final\" had been added in 1984. There were 6 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The next 8 (9th through 16th) competed in a consolation final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe eight fastest swimmers advanced to Final A, while the next eight went to Final B.\nFinals.\nThe finals were held in the evening of 22 September.\nFinal A.\nZabalotnov led at the halfway mark. Polyansky took the lead during the third length, with Baltrusch and Kingsman also passing Zabolotnov."

        "text": "Robert Blair Robinson (born 22 August 1989 in Westport, New Zealand) is a professional rugby union player who represents Toyota Industries Shuttles Aichi in the Japan.\nPlaying career.\nRobinson made his debut for Southland in round three 2008 Air New Zealand Cup against the Hawke's Bay Magpies. He played majority of his games at fullback rather than his favoured first five-eighth position due to the competition's top scorer Blair Stewart having cemented the role for the season.\nIn 2009 Robinson was selected for the New Zealand Under 20s team for the Junior World Cup in Japan. Robinson played the majority of the tournament at fullback due to the team's captain Aaron Cruden being a specialist first five-eighth. The team went through the tournament unbeaten, defeating England 44–28 in the final.\nHis season continued with Southland making a great start to the competition after being second after 8 rounds of the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup. However a string of bad performances led to the team needing to win their final round Ranfurly Shield challenge against Canterbury. The team came out of the game victorious with Robinson kicking three penalties leading the Stags to a win and ending the 50 year shield drought.\nHis form led to him securing a Highlanders contract for the 2010 and 2011 Super Rugby seasons. In 2012, after two years with the Highlanders, he signed with the Chiefs, with his contract extending until the 2014 season.\nHe scored the Chiefs' winning try in the 2013 Super Rugby final in a 27–22 win against the Brumbies.\nHe was released by the Chiefs in 2014 after a frustrating injury that kept him out for the entire campaign.\nOn June 24 2022, he was announced as having signed for the Southland Stags for the 2022 Bunnings NPC."

        "text": "The Papua New Guinea national under-19 cricket team represents the country of Papua New Guinea in Under-19 international cricket.\nPNG has qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup on eight occasions, the most for any associate team in the ICC East Asia-Pacific region. However, the team has only won three matches in World Cup history and has never made it past the first round.\nHistory.\nPapua New Guinea finished third in the 2009 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier which was held in Canada. The team gained victories over the Under-19 teams of Hong Kong, Canada, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Vanuatu, the United States and the Netherlands. The team lost only two matches to Ireland and Afghanistan. Papua New Guinea's performance in this tournament gained them qualification for the 2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.\nAt the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup qualification EAP event, Papua New Guinea were undefeated going into the final game against Japan (also undefeated). However, they forfeited the match after Cricket PNG suspended eleven members of the squad due to breaching the team's code of conduct. The Papua New Guinea Cricket Board later suspended ten of the players for a year, for bringing the game into disrepute, following a shop-lifting incident.\nList of captains.\nTen people have captained Papua New Guinea in under-19 One Day International (ODI) matches. Chris Amini, who captained the Papua New Guinea senior team in its inaugural ODI series in November 2014, is the only player to captain Papua New Guinea in both under-19 and regular ODIs."

The team represented Belarus at the International Ice Hockey Federation's World Junior Hockey Championship. Prior to independence in 1991, Belarusian players played for the Soviet Union, which played in the World Juniors from its inception in 1974. Belarus has played in the top division eight times, first in 1999 and most recently in 2018, with their best finish being ninth overall in both 2001 and 2002.\nDue to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Ice Hockey Federation banned all Belarusian national and club teams from its events indefinitely, and Hockey Canada banned Belarus's “participation in events held in Canada that do not fall under the IIHF’s jurisdiction.”\nHistory.\nBelarus became an independent nation in 1991, and the team made their first appearance at the World Junior Hockey Championships in 1998, when Belarus won Pool B (now Division I). The U20 team played at the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Winnipeg, but the Belarusians never won a game. Belarus finished 10th and were relegated to Pool B for 2000. The team returned to the top level by defeating Germany in the final. The Belarusians avoided relegation by winning and tying a game against the Kazakhs.\nBelarus competed in the 2002 and 2003 World Junior Championships, until finally being relegated under the new IIHF format. Belarus returned to the top division in 2005, but were relegated again. Belarus has mainly been in the second-tier Division I level since then, though have been promoted to the top division on occasion, most recently in 2018."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Don Bradman",
        "text": "Australian cricketer Sir Don Bradman,often recognized as the greatest batsman of all time, scored twenty-nine Test cricket centuries during his international career which lasted from 1928 to 1948. However, his cricketing career was interrupted from 1940 to 1946 due to the outbreak of World War II, followed by poor health. He assumed captaincy of the Australian side in 1946, and scored fourteen of his centuries as captain. Bradman holds the world record for the most double centuries scored by a single batsman, with twelve to his name. He was the first of four batsmen to have twice scored triple centuries, Brian Lara, Virender Sehwag and Chris Gayle. His total of nineteen centuries against England remains the world record for the highest number of centuries against a single team.\nWhen he made 334—his first triple century—against England in the 1930 Ashes, Bradman scored 309 of those runs on 11 July 1930, which remains as the highest number of runs scored by a single batsman in one day. It was the highest individual Test score until Wally Hammond scored 336 in 1933. Len Hutton then surpassed Wally Hammond with 364 in 1938 which stood until 1958 when Garfield Sobers scored 365 not out. Later Brian Lara scored 400 in 2004. In the same series, Bradman went on to score a further century and two more double centuries, accumulating 974 runs in 7 innings—the most runs scored by one batsman in a single series. In 1937, Bradman, suffering from influenza and coming in at the seventh position, scored 270 to guide his team to victory against England. It was rated as the best Test innings of all time by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2001. It is also the highest score made by a number 7 batsman, while his 304 against England in 1934 was the highest score made by a number 5 batsman, until January 2012, when Michael Clarke made 329* against the touring Indians.\nBy the time of his retirement in 1948, Bradman had made twenty-nine centuries in eighty innings. These centuries, with which he had accumulated 5,393 of his 6,996 Test runs, were scored with a 36.25% ratio of centuries per innings played. This allowed him to maintain a career batting average of 99.94, while no other batsman has been able to reach 62. He would have retired with an average of 100 had he scored four more runs in his final innings."

It was their twenty-fourth season in the County Championship and they won six matches to finish eleventh.\n1922 season.\nDerbyshire played all their twenty two first-class games in the County Championship in 1922 and won six, to finish eleventh in the table.\nGuy Jackson took over as captain and led Derbyshire for nine seasons \"with masterly judgment\". Although he was a stern disciplinarian, he earned the respect and affection of his players. When he retired at the end of the 1930 summer he had laid the foundations of the team that won the Championship six years later. Wisden noted \"For his work in leading and inspiring the team, Jackson deserves immense thanks. He took over control when the fortunes of the county were at a very low ebb, steadily raised the standard of the cricket, and now retires with Derbyshire well established amongst the leading teams of the day.\"\nThere was an occurrence considered unique in county cricket during the season. When Billy Bestwick and Robert Bestwick shared the bowling against Willie Quaife and Bernard Quaife of Warwickshire, father and son were bowling against father and son. Gilbert Curgenven was noted for his fast scoring rate and at Gloucester, he scored 65 in the first innings at little more than one run a minute and in the second innings his 68 out of 119 took less than twenty-five minutes.\nThe most significant newcomer for Derbyshire was Leslie Townsend a gifted all-rounder who played for seventeen years. Others who made their debut were Repton schoolmaster John Crommelin-Brown who went on to play several matches over four seasons and footballer Stuart McMillan who appeared intermittently over three seasons. Colin Leech made his only career appearance in the first class game for Derbyshire during the season."

        "title": "James Madison Dukes men's basketball",
        "text": "The James Madison Dukes men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The school, a member of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, joined the Sun Belt Conference on July 1, 2022, after having been a member of the Colonial Athletic Association since that league's establishment in 1979. The Dukes are led by head coach Preston Spradlin. The Dukes play their home games at the on-campus Atlantic Union Bank Center which seats 8,500 fans and opened in November 2020. The Dukes have appeared six times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe James Madison Dukes men's basketball team was founded in 1945, but was not a fully developed program until the late 1960s as James Madison University became a fully coeducational institution. The 1969–1970 season was the first as a varsity intercollegiate program. The Dukes were led by Cleve Branscum during the team's first two seasons, compiling a record of 20–17. The program was guided by new Administrative Director Dean Ehlers for the 1971–1972 season. Ehlers hired Lou Campanelli following the season, but remained at James Madison as the A.D. until 1993.\nLou Campanelli era.\nTaking over as the James Madison head coach in 1972, Lou Campanelli led the Dukes program for thirteen years (1972-1985). Campanelli coached the Dukes to two NCAA Division II basketball tournaments and then three NCAA Division I basketball tournaments after the school transitioned from Division II to Division I. In the Dukes' first ever appearance in the NCAA Division I tournament in 1981, Campanelli coached the team to a win over Georgetown. The Dukes would win a game in each of the Dukes’ following appearances in the NCAA Division I tournament under Campanelli, and lost by two points to eventual national champions University of North Carolina in the second round of the 1982 tournament.\nLou Campanelli was hired as the head coach at California in 1985. Campanelli finished at James Madison with a record of 238–118.\nJohn Thurston era.\nJohn Thurston was hired as the fourth head coach of the James Madison Dukes men's basketball team in 1985. Thurston had previously served as an assistant coach under Campanelli with the Dukes since 1975. Thurston successfully turned the program around in his second season at the helm, guiding the Dukes to a 20–10 record, a berth in the National Invitation Tournament, and was named Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. However, with a 6–11 start to the 1988 season, James Madison University President Ronald E. Carrier announced that Thurston's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and Thurston resigned hours later. The Dukes replaced Thurston with interim head coach Tom McCorry to finish the 1988 season.\nLefty Driesell era.\nIn 1988, the Dukes hired former Davidson and Maryland head coach Lefty Driesell to lead the program. Driesell led the Dukes for nine seasons, compiling a record of 159–111 and taking the Dukes to the NCAA tournament in 1994.\nSherman Dillard era.\nIn 1997, James Madison hired Sherman Dillard to lead the men's basketball program. Sherman Dillard played basketball at James Madison under Lou Campanelli from 1973 to 1978. Prior to accepting the position at JMU, he had been the coach at Indiana State. He led the Dukes through the 2004 season, guiding the program to one regular season title in 2000 and compiling a record of 93–106.\nDean Keener era.\nThe Dukes hired Dean Keener in 2004 to be the program's next men's basketball head coach. Keener came from Georgia Tech, where he was an assistant on the 2004 National Runner-Up team. He had also been a one time assistant coach at JMU under Sherman Dillard for the 1999–2000 season.\nUnder Keener, the Dukes compiled a record of 31–85. During the 2008 season, Keener resigned as the head coach, but he led the team through the end of the season.\nMatt Brady era.\nJames Madison hired Matt Brady to be the head coach of the men's basketball program in 2008. In his first season, Brady led the Dukes to an 18-win regular season and earned the program's first postseason berth since 1994 in the newly created CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament.\nUnder Brady in 2013, the Dukes won their first CAA tournament since 1994, earning a berth in the NCAA tournament. As a 16 seed, the Dukes defeated Long Island in the First Four before being defeated by Indiana in the second round.\nMatt Brady led the Dukes to a share of the regular season CAA title in 2015 but the Dukes did not win the CAA Tournament and were invited to the CIT tournament. Brady was fired following the 2016 season, despite winning 21 games.\nLouis Rowe era.\nIn 2016, James Madison hired JMU men's basketball alumnus and former assistant coach Louis Rowe to be the program's tenth men's basketball coach. Rowe led the Dukes for four seasons before being let go at the end of the 2020 season. Under Rowe, the Dukes compiled a record of 43–85.\nMark Byington era.\nIn March 2020, James Madison hired Mark Byington to lead the Dukes men's basketball team. Before coming to JMU, Byington was the head coach at Georgia Southern. In his first season at JMU, Mark Byington lead the Dukes to a share of the regular season title, the team's first since the 2015 season.\nIn the first season of his tenure at James Madison, the Dukes opened their new on-campus arena, the Atlantic Union Bank Center.\nOn December 7, 2021, Byington's Dukes defeated Virginia for the first time in program history in front of a sold-out home crowd.\nThe 2023—24 season started with a road wins at Michigan State and Kent State, both of which broke home winning streaks held by the teams. The Dukes followed up those wins with a win at home over Howard, propelling the Dukes into the AP Top 25 for the first time in program history. On December 9, 2023, the team broke their record for best start to a season by defeating Old Dominion University to start 9-0. After a 14—0 start to the season, the best start in program history, the Dukes dropped their first game of the season on January 6 at Southern Miss. The Dukes won the 2024 Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament, securing an automatic bid to the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. As the 12 seed in the South region, the Dukes upset 5 seed Wisconsin in the First Round, before losing to Duke in the Second Round. This was the first time that the Dukes advanced to the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament since the 1993-94 season. The Dukes finished the 2023—24 season with a record of 32—4, the best in program history.\nFollowing the Dukes' loss in the NCAA Tournament, Mark Byington accepted the head coach position at Vanderbilt. Byington guided the Dukes to a 82–36 record across his four seasons as head coach.\nPreston Spradlin era.\nOn March 29, 2024, James Madison hired Preston Spradlin as the new head coach of the men's basketball team. Spradlin previously led the Morehead State Eagles for eight seasons.\nRivalries.\nHistorically, James Madison's rivals had been in-state members of the Colonial Athletic Association: William &amp; Mary, VCU, George Mason, Old Dominion, and Richmond. Now members of the Sun Belt Conference, the Dukes only remaining conference rival from the old CAA is Old Dominion. However, James Madison has continued to schedule its former conference rivals in non-conference play. James Madison and Old Dominion's basketball rivalry is also a part of their all-sports rivalry known as the Royal Rivalry.\nJames Madison vs. Sun Belt Members.\nThis reflects the Dukes' record against the current Sun Belt Conference's membership as of the 2022–23 season.\nJames Madison vs. CAA Members.\nJames Madison also maintained competitive series against the other members of the Colonial Athletic Association during their tenure in the CAA.\nSource:\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament six times. Their combined record is 5–6.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament twice.

        "title": "2011 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2011 Rose Bowl was the 97th edition of the annual bowl game played on January 1, 2011, as part of the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Played in Pasadena, California, the TCU Horned Frogs of the Mountain West Conference defeated the Wisconsin Badgers of the Big Ten Conference by a score of 21–19. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association was the organizer of the game. Vizio Inc. was the corporate sponsor and the game was officially named the Rose Bowl Game presented by Vizio. This game marked the first time a team from a non-Automatic Qualifying Conference won the Rose Bowl since the 1934 game when Columbia beat Stanford 7–0.\nThe offensive MVP named was TCU senior QB Andy Dalton.\nThe defensive MVP named was TCU junior LB Tank Carder.\nThe contest was broadcast on cable television station ESPN with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio and ESPN3 streaming video over the internet. Coverage began at 1:30 PM (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 PM (PST). This marked the first time that the game was not broadcast nationally \"over-the-air\" (terrestrial television) since the games prior to the 1952 Rose Bowl, which was the first nationally televised college football game.\nThe Rose Bowl Game, themed \"Building Dreams, Friendships, &amp; Memories\", was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. Ticket prices for all seats in the Rose Bowl are listed at $145. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. The Rose Bowl stadium capacity is listed at approximately 91,000.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2011 Rose Queen and the Royal Court and the Grand Marshal. Evanne Friedmann of La Cañada High School, located in La Cañada Flintridge, California, was named the 2011 Rose Queen on October 19, 2010. On October 26, 2010, Food Network star Paula Deen was picked as the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl Game, and performed the official coin toss.\nAfter the teams' arrivals in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day (December 26) at Disneyland in nearby Anaheim.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the early morning Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats representing the two conferences.\nOn December 30, 2010, Brad Budde (USC), Hayden Fry (Iowa), and Leroy Keyes (Purdue) were inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the Pasadena Convention Center.\nThe Argonauts of Strike Fighter Squadron VFA-147, based in Lemoore, California, saluted American service men and women by flying over the stadium. They operated the F/A-18 Super Hornet, Navy's premier Strike Fighter.\nThe Navy Leap Frog Parachute Demonstration Team delivered the game ball and flip coin to Rose Bowl Game President Jeff Throop and special guest Marcus Luttrell, a recipient of a Purple Heart and the Navy Cross for combat heroism and the author of a number-one \"New York Times\" bestseller \"\" (2007) — the story of his heroic service to the U.S. as a U.S. Navy SEAL and his experience in hostile enemy territory. He is the founder of the Lone Survivor Foundation providing support for returning military members and their families.\nIn support of Luttrell's heroism, the Tournament of Roses recognized The Boot Campaign, an organization that works directly with Luttrell and his foundation to raise awareness for our military by its sale of combat boots purchased and worn by supporters with proceeds benefiting military charities.\nTeams.\nThe teams that traditionally play in the Rose Bowl game (since 1947) are the champions of the Pacific Coast Conference, and subsequently Pacific-10, representing the \"West\" (which was renamed the Pac-12 in 2011 with the addition of the University of Colorado and the University of Utah) and Big Ten conferences, unless one team (or both teams) play in the BCS National Championship Game. Then, according to the BCS rules, the first year the Rose Bowl loses a team to the National Championship Game and a team from the non-automatic qualifying group is an automatic qualifier, that team will play in the Rose Bowl. Should the non-AQ qualify for the BCS Championship, and face either the Big Ten or Pac-10 Champion, the Rose Bowl may replace the Big Ten/Pac-10 Champion with a team from same conference, so long as it is in the Top 14 of the final BCS Standings. The teams, which were based on the final BCS Standings released on December 5, 2010, were selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association.\nSince the Pac-10 Champions, the BCS #2 Oregon Ducks, would play in the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, the Rose Bowl was forced to select the non-AQ team, BCS #3 TCU Horned Frogs, to face off against the Big Ten Champion, the BCS #5 Wisconsin Badgers. Consequently, the Pac-10 runner-up, BCS #4 Stanford, went to the Orange Bowl. The two teams' only previous meeting was in the 1970 season opener, when TCU and Wisconsin tied 14–14 in Madison. Both teams practiced at The Home Depot Center (now known as Dignity Health Sports Park) in nearby Carson, California.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin started their season by sweeping their nonconference slate, with wins over UNLV in Las Vegas, San Jose State, Arizona State, and Austin Peay at home. However, a loss in their conference opener against Michigan State put a dampener on their season. The Badgers would recover and win seven consecutive games, including a win over then-No. 1 Ohio State and a win in Iowa City over a ranked Iowa squad. Bret Bielema's squad brought in a solid defense that had allowed just 7 rushing touchdowns this season. On the other side of the ball, Wisconsin had 3 running backs with at least 13 touchdowns (John Clay, Montee Ball, and James White) and had the top rushing attack in the Big Ten. Wisconsin QB Scott Tolzien, who led the nation in completion percentage (by completing 74.3% of his passes), played his final game as a Badger.\nThis was the seventh Rose Bowl appearance for Wisconsin and their first since the 2000 Rose Bowl. It was the ninth consecutive bowl game appearance for Wisconsin. Head coach Bret Bielema also played on the 1990 Iowa Hawkeyes football team that went to the 1991 Rose Bowl.\nTCU Horned Frogs.\nThe Horned Frogs finished the regular season with a perfect 12–0 record, winning eight conference games and the Mountain West Conference title. The game not only marked their first trip to Pasadena but the first by a team from the conference to play in a New Year's Day bowl game. The Frogs had completed their second consecutive perfect regular season, and were making their sixth consecutive bowl appearance. The Rose Bowl was their second consecutive BCS bowl game and the fourth appearance by a Mountain West conference member (the Frogs lost the 2010 Fiesta Bowl to Boise State and Utah played in the 2009 Sugar Bowl and the 2005 Fiesta Bowl, winning both). The team was situated on the West sideline.\nTCU finished the regular season as the conference leader in scoring offense (520 points, 43.3 average) and scoring defense (137 points, 11.4 average). TCU came into the game with the nation's #1 ranked defense. The Frogs were led by senior quarterback Andy Dalton, who completed 194 of 293 passes for 2,638 yards for 26 touchdowns, and tailback Ed Wesley, who carried 162 times for 1,065 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. Dalton, playing in his final game as a Horned Frog, led the nation in career wins for an active quarterback at 41. TCU became the fifth team outside of the conference partnership to play in the Rose Bowl game since the formation of the BCS."

Although he has coached several players both on the ATP and the WTA tour, Rodríguez is most notable for his long-time collaboration with the former World No. 1 and multiple grand slam winner Justine Henin. As of 2011, the pair had been together for 15 years, but a portion of that span includes Henin's brief retirement from the pro circuit. Upon Henin's comeback, she insisted that she could not have any other coach than Rodriguez. Rodriguez obliged. He has since commented that her aspiration to return to the highest echelon of the women's game – and rankings, as she retired while holding the No. 1 ranking – has as much to do with factors off the court, that is, mental preparedness and her private life, as it does with her physical fitness or shot-making abilities.\nBefore Rodríguez became Henin's coach, he coached Belgian tennis player Dominique Monami from 1994 to 1996. On the men's tour he is notable for coaching Olivier Rochus and Dick Norman.\nIn July 2012, Rodríguez was hired by former French Open champion Li Na on a trial basis. After becoming Li's full-time coach, he was credited for her late career surge during which she ascended to world No. 2 and won her second Major title at the 2014 Australian Open. In July 2014, Rodríguez and Li parted ways. Rodríguez resided in Beijing and works at a tennis academy there. In December 2014, he started coaching Daniela Hantuchová. In late 2019, Rodriguez and Amanda Animisova joined forces and worked together for a trial until the 2020 Australian open where they parted ways. "

        "title": "Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison, Wisconsin. The team plays at the Kohl Center and is currently coached by Mike Hastings. The Badgers ice hockey team competes in the Big Ten Conference.\nThe Badgers have won three WCHA regular season conference titles and 11 conference tournament titles. They have also made 24 appearances in the NCAA men's ice hockey tournament, advancing to the Frozen Four 12 times. The team's six national titles rank fourth best in college hockey history.\nTheir most recent national championship came in 2006 when the Badgers defeated the Boston College Eagles 2–1 at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nPond hockey had been played on Lake Mendota in Madison since the late 1800s. The University of Wisconsin formed an informal hockey program in the 1910s. The 1921 season saw the development of intercollegiate hockey at Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Michigan and Wisconsin scheduled four games to be played on consecutive weekends from February 18 to 26, 1921.\nModern era.\nThe modern era of Badger hockey began in 1963 with the decision of athletic director Ivan B. Williamson. The Badgers played home games at the Hartmeyer Ice Arena before moving to the Dane County Coliseum in 1967. The program began as an independent NCAA Division I team and scheduling 8 games against Western Collegiate Hockey Association teams, losing all 8 games. Late in the 1965–66 season, the Badgers finally broke through, beating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 5–4 in overtime, their first win over a WCHA opponent. At the end of that season, Coach John Riley retired.\nJohnson era.\nIn 1966, Wisconsin hired \"Badger\" Bob Johnson. Under Johnson, Wisconsin was offered WCHA membership for the 1969–70 season. In that same season the Badgers received a bid to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The Badgers won their first national championship at the 1973 Frozen Four. Badger Bob's 1977 team was one of the most successful to date, as the team swept through WCHA tournament and 1977 NCAA Tournament. Behind the efforts of four first team All-Americans, Mike Eaves, Mark Johnson (Bob's son), Craig Norwich and Julian Baretta, the 1977 team won the title with a 6–5 victory in overtime against Michigan.\nDespite losing one of their top players, Mark Johnson, to the 1980 American Olympic Team, the Badgers reached the NCAA title game three consecutive times in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Winning the program's third title in 1981 by defeating rival Minnesota in the championship game 6–3. After again reaching the championship game in 1982, where the Badgers lost to North Dakota, the program was dealt a second blow with the departure of Johnson. He would later coach in the NHL and win the Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He left Wisconsin after 15 seasons with 3 NCAA championships, a record of 367–175–23, and having built the program into an NCAA powerhouse. Johnson died in 1991.\nSauer era.\nFormer Badger assistant coach Jeff Sauer was hired in 1982 to replace Bob Johnson as head coach. Sauer won the 1983 NCAA championship in his first season. Wisconsin defeated Harvard 6–2 to earn the program's fourth NCAA title. Under Sauer's leadership, the Badgers qualified for eight consecutive NCAA tournaments from 1988 to 1995, and won the program's 5th NCAA title in 1990, with a 7–3 victory over Colgate. Also, Sauer presided over the team's move from the aging Coliseum to the new, on-campus Kohl Center in 1998. The Badger men led the nation in college hockey attendance every year from moving to the Kohl Center through the 2011 season.\nWisconsin again reached the 1992 NCAA Championship game against Lake Superior State, losing 5–3. The game, which featured some questionable calls by the referee that continually put the Badgers at a two-man disadvantage, irked several players so much that they lashed out beyond Sauer's control, verbally abusing the referees and earning Sauer a one-game NCAA suspension. Assistant Coach Bill Zito received a two-game suspension, while players Blaine Moore and Jason Zent each received a one-game suspension. That game was later vacated by the NCAA for rules violations unrelated to the incidents in the championship game. In the mid-1990s, Badger hockey earned NCAA bids in 1998 and 2000, but generally underachieved compared to the high standards of the 1970s and 1980s. The 1999–2000 team featured a duo of second overall NHL draft pick Dany Heatley and Steven Reinprecht, won the MacNaughton Cup, and earned a No. 1 position in the polls for most of the season, only to be upset by Boston College in the NCAA regionals. Two seasons later, during the 2001–02 season, coach Sauer announced his retirement. Jeff Sauer left Wisconsin with two NCAA titles and a record of 489–306–46 at Wisconsin, and a 655–532–57 overall record as a head coach.\nEaves era.\nSauer's replacement was Mike Eaves, a former player who was a captain on the 1977 NCAA championship team and still holds the record as Wisconsin's all-time leading scorer. In 2003–04, Eaves brought the Badgers just short of the Frozen Four, falling in overtime to Maine in the 2004 NCAA Tournament. The Badgers returned to national prominence by winning the 2006 NCAA championship in Milwaukee with a 2–1 win over Boston College. In 2010, the Badgers returned to the NCAA championship, vying for a seventh NCAA title but lost 5–0 to Boston College at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, in front of a then-record crowd for an indoor ice hockey game of 37,592. In 2011, they missed the WCHA Final Five and NCAA tournament completely. In 2012, the team missed the NCAA Tournament again. In 2013 they were winners in their last-ever appearance in the WCHA Final Five before the team joined the newly established Big Ten Hockey conference for the 2013–14 season. In the inaugural season of the Big Ten Hockey conference, the Badgers won the Big Ten Tournament, their second consecutive conference tournament championship. The 2014–15 season was the worst season in team history. They finished the season with a record of 4–26–5, setting school records for fewest wins and most losses in a season. Eaves was fired on March 18, 2016 after finishing the 2015–16 season with an 8–19–8 record.\nGranato era.\nAthletic director Barry Alvarez hired Detroit Red Wings assistant Tony Granato to replace Eaves in late March 2016. Also hired were Tony's younger brother Don Granato, coach of the U.S. National Team Development Program's under-17 team, and Mark Osiecki, associate head coach of the American Hockey League's Rockford IceHogs and former assistant coach at Wisconsin for six years in the 2000s. Tony Granato signed a five-year contract worth $2.75 million while Osiecki and his brother signed three-year deals worth a total of $660,000 a piece. The hires were seen as getting UW Men's Ice Hockey back on track, and was noticed by media, such as the Wisconsin State Journal, when they said \"Alvarez answered the critics who think UW no longer cares about men’s hockey in the best way he could\" during the press conference introducing all three coaches Alvarez stated \"I’m very confident that we’ve taken the right steps today in re-establishing the dominance of our hockey program\" All three coaches are Wisconsin alums; Tony Granato played from 1983 to 1987 where he was an All-American, Don Granato played from 1987 to 1991, and Osiecki played from 1987 to 1990. After all three coaches were hired the phrase \"Dream Team\" came to be used when referring to UW's new coaching staff, it was first used by Barry Alvarez when he said \"It was more than I could dream for to get all three of those guys. To me, it's the Dream Team.\"\nIn Granato's first season, he led the team back to respectability with a 20-15-1 overall record and a 12-8 conference record, good enough for second place. On March 18, they lost the conference championship game to Penn State 2–1 in double overtime.\nOn March 6, 2023, University of Wisconsin Director of Athletics Chris McIntosh announced that Granato would not return for the 2023-24 season. \nHastings era.\nOn March 30, 2023, former Minnesota State University, Mankato Mavericks head coach Mike Hastings was named Granato's replacement as head coach.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Wisconsin alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nDerek Hines Unsung Hero Award\nMike Richter Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nMost Valuable Player\nFreshman of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nDefensive player of the year\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond team all-wcha\nBig Ten.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nFreshman of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nScoring Champion\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-Big Ten\nSecond team all-big ten\nBig Ten All-Rookie Team\nWisconsin Badgers Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Wisconsin men's ice hockey program who were elected into the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nBadgers in the NHL.\nSource:"

According to the 8th Duke of Beaufort in his book \"Driving\" (1889), the club was founded in 1875 at 100 Piccadilly by a sporting doctor called Hurman. According to the Duke, \"this was a thorough coaching establishment, having all the year round a coach, a brake, a team or two... capital stabling and coach-houses, as well as chambers and bedrooms kept for the use of members\".\nThe club was named after Badminton House, the country seat of the Dukes of Beaufort. The 10th Duke was Master of the Horse (1936–1978) to three British monarchs, King Edward VIII, King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth II. Since 1949, Badminton House has hosted the prestigious annual Badminton Horse Trials, a three-day competition event.\nIn 1883, the club also acquired the adjacent premises at 98 and 99 Piccadilly and a new clubhouse was built on the site, designed by the architect Robert William Edis. The principal internal feature was the \"Flower Court\", approached through the narrow entrance from Piccadilly.\nThe club flourished so long as the horse remained supreme in London but, by the late 1930s, driving was only the pastime of a few. The club had lost its raison d’etre and decided to disband in 1938. At about that time the Public Schools Club was on the lookout for larger premises and they took over the clubhouse immediately.\nThe clubhouse was finally closed in 1972, when the Public Schools Club merged with the East India Club in St James's Square, and was demolished a few years later. The last surviving parts of the clubhouse are the war memorial plaques for members of the Public Schools Club from World War I and World War II and the Badminton Club's plaque for World War I, which are still preserved at the East India Club."

        "text": "Sarah Thomas ( Bailey; born September 21, 1973) is an American football official, currently for the National Football League (NFL).\nThomas was the first woman to officiate a major college football game, the first to officiate a bowl game, and the first to officiate in a Big Ten stadium. On April 8, 2015, Thomas was hired as the first full-time female official in NFL history, and for the 2020 NFL season, she was on the officiating crew headed by referee Shawn Hochuli. She wears uniform number 53. In January 2021, she became the first woman to earn an on-field assignment for an NFL playoff game. In February 2021, she became the first woman to officiate in a Super Bowl.\nPersonal life.\nThomas was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She attended Pascagoula High School, where she lettered five times in softball, the first student to ever do so. She attended the University of Mobile on a basketball scholarship and was an academic all-American. In her three seasons on the basketball team, Thomas amassed 779 points, 441 rebounds, 108 assists, and 192 steals. This ranks her fifth in the school’s history.\nBefore becoming a referee, she worked as a pharmaceutical representative.\nShe is married to Brian Thomas. They have three children together. Thomas lives in Brandon, Mississippi.\nOfficiating career.\nEarly years.\nThomas began her officiating career in 1996, when she attended a meeting of the Gulf Coast Football Officials Association. She worked her first varsity high school game in 1999.\nConference USA.\nIn 2006, Gerry Austin, Conference USA's coordinator of officials who also refereed Super Bowls XXXI and XXXV, invited her to an officials' camp, due to Thomas proving her dedication and skills in the advancement of the industry. Austin was impressed with her skills and hired her for the Conference USA staff. In 2007, Thomas became the first woman to officiate a major college football game, working a game between Memphis and Jacksonville State. Before that game, Austin said, \"She came highly recommended by two NFL scouts. She has a good presence and demeanor. I feel like she has the ability and courage to make a call, and the guts to not make one, too.\"\nBowl-game breakthrough.\nDuring the 2009 season, Thomas was one of five female officials in major college football and the only one at the Football Bowl Subdivision level. She was assigned to a crew and given a full schedule of 11 games. At the end of the season, she was selected to work the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl between Marshall and Ohio, making her the first woman to officiate a bowl game. Regarding her presence, Marshall running back and game MVP Martin Ward said \"I noticed her before the game, but that was it. Once the game started, she was just doing the job that the line judge does in every game we play. It didn't matter that she was a woman at all.\"\nOn November 12, 2011, Thomas became the first woman to officiate in a Big Ten stadium, working as a line judge when Northwestern hosted Rice.\nWhen asked about the challenges associated with being a football referee, Thomas claimed there have \"not been any challenges\" being a female in football and stated, \"Everybody has been very professional, and they look at me just like another official\", aiding in Thomas's defense to be viewed as equal to her colleagues.\nUnited Football League.\nThomas has officiated United Football League games, and in 2010 worked the league championship game.\nNational Football League.\nIn 2013, Thomas became one of 21 finalists in contention for a permanent NFL officiating position.\nThomas worked New Orleans Saints scrimmages, and was part of the NFL officiating development program, spending three days at the Indianapolis Colts minicamp.\nOn April 8, 2015, the NFL announced that Thomas would become the first permanent female official in NFL history. Thomas made her NFL regular season debut in a game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans at NRG Stadium on September 13, 2015, as part of Pete Morelli's crew as the line judge.\nOn December 24, 2016, Thomas broke her wrist in a mid-game collision on the sideline of a Vikings-Packers game. After being looked at for a brief concussion protocol, Thomas returned and finished the game with the broken wrist.\nIn 2017, Thomas moved to the down judge position. The change in the position name from head linesman coincided with the move in order to use a gender-neutral term.\nThomas is the first woman to earn an on-field assignment for an NFL playoff game. She was named to the crew for the game between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers on January 13, 2019. She was an alternate for the 2018 Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams Wild Card game. She appeared in a Super Bowl LIII commercial in 2019 with referee Ron Torbert (Thomas was the down judge on Torbert's crew during the 2018 season) for the NFL.\nThomas was selected for the Super Bowl LV officiating crew and became the first woman to officiate a Super Bowl, also in the down judge position."

Therefore, the strict route requirements of the WSSRC are not being followed for this list, and it is deemed sufficient for the sailors to cross all longitudes and the equator, before crossing their own path again.\nUnassisted sailing essentially means that the sail boat does not dock in harbors, or with other boats and does not get equipment from outside during the voyage."

The event was sometimes called Cup of the European Leagues (', ', \"\").\nHistory.\nThe Six Nations Tournament is an offshoot of the Alpenliga, an international league created in 1991, featuring teams from Northern Italy and the adjacent nations of Austria and Slovenia.\nIn 1994, the Alpenliga was temporarily merged into the newly created Six Nations Tournament. The Alpenliga (or \"Alpine League\" in English) retained teams from Northwestern Italy and Western Austria, and added teams from the French Alps. 3 new leagues were created:\nThe Adriatic League for teams from Northeastern Italy and Southern Austria.\nThe Atlantic League for teams from Northern France, the Netherlands and Denmark\nThe Danube League for teams from Eastern Austria and Slovenia.\nTop ranked teams from the four leagues met in a joint tournament, which ended with HC Bolzano of Italy (led by star winger Jaromír Jágr) defeating Rouen HC of France in a 2-legged final.\nIn 1995, the Adriatic League and the Danube League were merged back into the Alpenliga, losing teams from the French Alps in the process. Thus the Alpenliga became an Italian-Austrian-Slovenian affair again. Meanwhile, the Atlantic League continued with its lineup of teams from Northern France, the Netherlands and Denmark.\nFor the 1995-96 season, the Alpenliga announced that it would hold its own playoffs again, and resurrect the Alpenliga title. The news came to the surprise of Atlantic League members. The Atlantic League schedule only consisted of a regular season, and table leader Rouen HC fully expected some kind of post season confrontation between the best Atlantic and Alpine teams for the Six Nations crown. A late agreement was reached between Rouen HC and Alpenliga playoff champion VEU Feldkirch to play a grand final for the unified title. Rouen HC took both games of the home and home series to win the second and final edition of the competition.\nThe Atlantic League did not play the following season and never resumed operations. The Alpenliga remained active until 1998-99 before morphing into the Interliga, another crossborder competition with an increased focus on Central European Slavic nations.\nBataillon de Joinville.\nAmong French-based organizations that joined the Alpine League for the 1994-95 season was the Bataillon de Joinville, a short-lived team consisting of players serving in the army (France then used a compulsory military service). The now defunct Bataillon de Joinville was a unit designed to house athletically gifted servicemen. Its headquarters were in the Paris suburbs. Previously, Joinville servicemen in need of ice time had used the Palais des Sports de Paris. For practical reasons, the Bataillon de Joinville Six Nations Tournament team used Patinoire René Froger in Briançon, as its primary venue. The young squad went winless in its only season of competitive hockey."

        "text": "Clitic climbing is a phenomenon first identified in Romance languages in which a pronominal object of an embedded infinitive appears attached to the matrix verb. Pronominal objects in Romance languages are typically expressed as clitics. The following Italian example illustrates the phenomenon. The object pronoun, lo, a clitic, is attached to the infinitive in the embedded or subordinate clause in (1a). In (1b), the clitic has \"climbed\" to the main or matrix clause and is attached to the matrix verb. There is no discernible difference in meaning between the two forms.\nClitic climbing is found in almost all Romance languages. It is notably absent in French.\nOther language families.\nAustronesian.\nTagalog.\nClitic climbing is also found in Tagalog. As in the Italian example in (1) above, the embedded clause clitic, \"siya\" \"her\", in (2a) can optionally appear in the matrix clause as in (2b). \nOnly clitics from embedded clauses in which the verb does not exhibit any aspectual morphology can climb to the matrix clause in Tagalog.\nSo, the sentence in (2b) is grammatical because the embedded verb, \"dalawin\" \"to be visited\", is not marked for any aspect, whereas the sentence in (3b) is ungrammatical because clitic climbing has occurred out of the embedded clause in which the verb, \"dinalaw\" \"was visited\", is marked for the perfective aspect.\nReferences.\nRizzi, Luigi. 1978.

        "title": "Athletics at the 2010 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The athletics competition at the 2010 Commonwealth Games was held in New Delhi, India between 6 and 14 October. The track and field events took place between 6–12 October at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium while the marathon contests were held on a street course running through the city on 14 October.\nA total of 46 athletics events were contested, which made it the sport with the second greatest number of medals on offer after the aquatics competition. The programme was almost identical to that of the 2006 edition, with the sole exception being the men's 50 km race walk, which was dropped. As in 2006, three men's and three women's disability athletics events were contested alongside the open competition.\nEach of the Commonwealth Games Associations could send a maximum of three participants per event and a team of six for relay events. Kenya topped the medal table, with eleven gold medals and 29 medals in total. This was the first time that the nation achieved the feat, beating the typically dominant nations Australia (eleven golds, but 20 overall) and England (seven golds, 26 medals). Canada and Jamaica rounded out the top five while hosts India enjoyed their greatest ever haul at the Games, taking home two golds and twelve medals altogether.\nFour failed doping tests have so far been announced: Nigerian Oludamola Osayomi was stripped of the women's 100 m title, and her compatriot Samuel Okon, a 110 m hurdler, was also disqualified. Both athletes tested positive for methylhexanamine. Rani Yadav, India's representative in the women's 20 km walk, was the third athlete to fail a test as 19-Norandrosterone was detected in her sample. Osayomi's 100 m stripped gold initially went to Sally Pearson of Australia but a delay in the appeals process saw Pearson disqualified for a false start some time after the race. Folashade Abugan of Nigeria tested positive for Testosterone prohormone following the final of the women's 400 metres. She was disqualified from the 400 metres and the Nigerian team, of which she was a member, were disqualified from the women's 4 x 400 metres relay where they had originally placed second.\nPreparation.\nA test event for the competition was scheduled in late July: the Asian All-Star Athletics Meet featured a number of prominent Asian athletes and demonstrated the stadium's readiness for games usage.\nMany of the most prominent athletes from the Commonwealth were absent from the competition. Caster Semenya, Commonwealth champion Christine Ohuruogu, and Olympic medallist Lisa Dobriskey were among the athletes missing due to injury, but others including Usain Bolt, David Rudisha and Shelly-Ann Fraser opted to miss the competition out of choice – all ten of the year's fastest Commonwealth men's 100 m runners (including defending champion Asafa Powell) were not present. Further to this, two reigning world champions (English jumper Phillips Idowu and Australian thrower Dani Samuels) declared themselves out of the running on grounds of the security and accommodation conditions in Delhi. The competition's late scheduling within the track and field season was a primary factor in many athlete withdrawals.\nIn spite of this, a number of Olympic champions and other prominent names were selected to compete, including Australian Olympic/World champion Steve Hooker and New Zealand's Olympic/World Champion Valerie Adams, top Kenyan runners Nancy Langat, Vivian Cheruiyot and Ezekiel Kemboi, Bahamian high jumper Donald Thomas, and South Africa's Commonwealth champions L.J. van Zyl and Sunette Viljoen. Former world record holder Steve Cram emphasised the Games' role in developing younger athletes: \"That's what it was for me, at 17 years old I went to the Commonwealth Games because Coe and Ovett didn't go. Nobody at the time was telling me it was bad that Coe and Ovett weren't there.\"\nThe stadium's track and field was damaged during the opening ceremony and major works – including the re-laying of the tarmac on the track and grass on the infield – took place in the 24 hours leading up to the first day of athletics events at the stadium. Three training venues were allocated for the athletics events: the Commonwealth Games Village 2010, Thyagaraj Sports Complex and the Delhi University sports complex.\nGames statistics.\nAt the competition Amantle Montsho (Botswana) and Cydonie Mothersill (Cayman Islands) all won the first ever Commonwealth gold medals for their respective countries. Natasha Mayers (St. Vincent and Grenadines), won the first gold medal ever by a female for her country. The number of medal sweeps in the athletics (6) was at an all-time high for the competition: Kenya took all top three spaces in four events, England beat all in the men's hurdles while hosts India completed a 1–2–3 in the women's discus.\nParticipating nations.\n61 Nations competed leaving 11 that did not."

From an early age basketball was his first love. As a youngster he sneaked into the gym to watch Kentucky basketball practices under the legendary coach Adolph Rupp. He played high school basketball at Lafayette for coach Ralph Carlisle, and as a senior was the team's leading scorer. With Carlisle's encouragement he developed an ambition to become a high school coach.\nDuring Sutherland's high school coaching career he took teams from three different schools to Kentucky's state high school basketball tournament (the Sweet Sixteen): Gallatin County High School in 1959, Harrison County High School in 1966 and Lafayette High School in 1979.\nAfter his Lafayette team won the state tournament in 1979 Sutherland retired from coaching, and for twenty years worked as a color man and analyst for University of Louisville basketball broadcasts on WHAS Radio in Louisville.

        "title": "Cycling in Auckland",
        "text": "Cycling in Auckland is a mode of transport in Auckland, New Zealand. The dominance of the car in the city, the negative attitudes of car drivers and general changes in transport patterns have made it a very marginal transport mode in the early 21st century, with remaining cyclists often riding for leisure and sports purposes.\nWhile political and infrastructure initiatives are underway to revive cycling, success is still to be solidified. As of 2005/06, only 16% of the Regional Cycle Network had been completed, which also included routes that had been built before the plan for a regional network had been adopted. In 2014, results showed that cycling mode share had stopped declining compared to previous census results, though from 0.9% in 2006, it had only risen to 1.2% of all work trips on census day. However, statistics and automatic counters show the success of cycling where higher-quality infrastructure has been installed, with nine counters across Auckland reporting annual cycle number increases of an average of 10% in 2014, a growth trend that continued in subsequent years.\nHistory.\nThe first Auckland bicycle ride was undertaken on 23 August 1869, using a velocipede made to order by a local company, and ridden down Grey Street, then being one of the smoothest roads in the city.\nAttitudes.\nAuckland has a much less positive popular attitude towards cycling and new cycling infrastructure than some other cities of New Zealand like Wellington and Christchurch. An Otago University study showed that fear of rude and actively hostile behaviour from drivers was the main reason New Zealanders were not using their cycles more. Some 59% of all respondents in an Auckland Transport study of a cross-section of Aucklanders noted safety as a barrier to cycling.\nThis, and to some degree the hillier nature of Auckland, have caused cycling to so far remain a marginal pursuit – only 1% of all morning peak trips were being made by bicycle in the late 2000s. However, in Wellington, with an even hillier topography, the cycling numbers are approximately twice as high.\nWhile Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) have undertaken some works since the introduction in 1998 of a \"Walking and Cycling Plan\" for the city, cycling connections between different areas of the wider city are still often missing. Some cycle lanes have met vocal opposition, mostly from locals who consider them unneeded due to the low level of cycling in Auckland and due to the removal of on-street parking for their implementation. However, Council representatives note that cycling will not gain in popularity until the corresponding infrastructure is gradually introduced.\nFacilities.\nWhile most cycling takes place on normal public roads, there are a small number of dedicated off-road facilities available in Auckland. In many other places, plans for on-road or off-road routes have been mooted, but not yet realised. These include recreational mountain bike trails, pump tracks (short dirt tails) and BMX tracks which are scattered around Auckland and suit different cycling abilities. One of the largest and most well known mountain bike facilities in Auckland is Woodhill Forest, which is commercial.\nSurveys show that a significant part of the population desires protected cycle facilities (i.e. off-road or separated from vehicle traffic), such facilities being desired by 55% of all respondents in an Auckland Transport study of a cross-section of Aucklanders.\nAs of early 2014, the target in the Auckland Plan was for 70% of the Auckland Cycle Network to be completed by 2020, however with the current funding, Council estimates that only 40–50% will be complete at that time.\nCycleways.\nExisting cycleways in Auckland primarily parallel motorways. They currently (as of 2010) consist of the Northwestern Cycleway, which was created along the Northwestern Motorway between the Auckland CBD and Lincoln in West Auckland (with some on-road sections on the way) and the Waikaraka Cycleway, from Wesley, Auckland to Southdown, most of it along State Highway 20 through southern Auckland City, before continuing along Mangere Harbour to the east.\nWaitakere City Council also constructed a number of longer-distance off-road cycle paths, such as the routes that are part of the Project Twin Streams through the Henderson area, as well as the new cycle path along the Te Atatū Peninsula.\nOverall, as of early 2014, Council notes an approximate of cycle ways, \"consisting of 95 km of cycle metros, 130 km of cycle connectors and 57 km of feeder routes that varying levels of service and cycle infrastructure provision. Parts of the existing network require cyclists to use bus/bike lanes and consist of short sections of unconnected cycle lanes, which advocacy groups do not consider to be an optimal solution in terms of safety\".\nAs of September 2021, Auckland Transport has not been able to meet its targets for newly constructed cycleways since 2017, even though the targets have decreased in subsequent years. \nBicycle rental.\nAuckland has a small bike rental scheme, Nextbike. It began with around 170 bicycles available at rental stations mostly in the CBD and the inner suburbs. The scheme ceased operation in 2010, and restarted in 2013 with only 13 bikes in 3 locations in downtown Auckland. In 2017, Auckland Transport began to investigate the feasibility of implementing their own bike rental scheme.\nA dockless bikeshare operator, Onzo, launched in 2017. Their yellow bikes were deployed without any prior arrangement with local government. As of April 2021, Onzo has not renewed its license with Auckland Transport and the Companies Office has attempted to remove the business from its register.\nProposals.\nHarbour link.\nOne of the links most called-for by local cycling groups is a connection over the Waitematā Harbour between the Auckland city centre and the North Shore, where cyclists currently only have the option of a very distant detour, or of taking a ferry. There have been many recent history of attempts to provide walking and cycling access on Auckland Harbour Bridge.\nThe political and public relations campaign to provide a link led to one of the largest ever demonstrations of its kind in New Zealand, when in May 2009, several thousands of walkers and cyclists ignored police barriers and peacefully marched onto the motorway bridge, calling for the New Zealand Transport Agency to reconsider the walk/cycleway proposal.\nFollowing years of campaigning a Harbour Bridge crossing, known as Skypath, was promised funding by the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 2017 general election. Once Labour was in government, the project was passed to the Waka Kotahi / NZ Transport Agency which released a revised design in 2019. In 2021 Waka Kotahi revealed that they were no longer able to build Skypath due to technical problems.\nFollowing this news, non-profit cycle advocacy group Bike Auckland led the 2021 'Liberate the Lane' rally, advocating for one lane of the Harbour Bridge to be reallocated for walking and cycling. After the rally around 1000 people ignored police barriers and peacefully walked and cycled onto the motorway bridge calling for Waka Kotahi to have a three month trial of walking and cycling on one lane. Following the rally, Transport Minister Michael Wood released plans for a separate walking and cycling bridge across to the North Shore. Just months later, the plan was scrapped.\nIn July 2023 Bike Auckland released a report by SmartSense Limited, addressing key concerns about reallocating a lane on the motor bridge to walking and cycling, and proposing a design solution to mitigate safety concerns. \nOn 6 August 2023, Waka Kotahi announced their Waitematā Harbour Crossings plan which includes a tunnel for light rail and a tunnel for motor traffic under the Harbour, and walking and cycling on two lanes of the existing Harbour Bridge. Construction is expected to start by 2029. Waka Kotahi's forecast is that 6400 people would walk and cycle across the Auckland Harbour Bridge every day. \nBike Auckland continues to advocate for Waka Kotahi to Liberate the Lane, stating that Waka Kotahi's Waitematā connections project will take too long to deliver a walking and cycling connection across the Harbour. Their campaign has attracted the support of a diverse array of organisations, calling for Waka Kotahi to liberate the lane now to give Aucklanders more affordable and sustainable transport options, and that it would be a key symbol of climate action."

        "title": "2010 World Series by Renault",
        "text": "The 2010 World Series by Renault was the sixth season of Renault Sport's series of events, with four different championships racing under one banner. Consisting of the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, the Eurocup Mégane Trophy and F4 Eurocup 1.6, the World Series by Renault ran at eight different venues, where fans could get into the meetings for no cost whatsoever, such is the uniqueness of the series.\nThe series began on 17 April at the Ciudad del Motor de Aragón in Alcañiz, and finished on 10 October at the Circuit de Catalunya, just outside Barcelona. 2010 saw the season-opening and season-closing rounds from 2009 reverse, with Catalunya hosting the season finale rather than the season opener, with the opposite occurring for Aragón. The series also visited Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Germany and the United Kingdom during the season, while Formula Renault 3.5 had an extra race on its own, in support of the in May. The F4 Eurocup – making its debut on the World Series by Renault programme in 2010 – did not visit Brno, and thus that championship's calendar was only seven rounds. The Eurocup Mégane Trophy began at Spa-Francorchamps.\nReview.\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series.\nThe 2010 season began with a race of attrition at Motorland Aragón, with just nine of the 24 starters running at the race's conclusion. Russian driver Mikhail Aleshin, returning to the series from a year in the FIA Formula Two Championship took the spoils ahead of rookie Daniel Zampieri and pole-sitter Daniel Ricciardo. In race two, Sten Pentus took his first victory, ahead of Jan Charouz and Ricciardo. However, Charouz was disqualified after the race due to a technical irregularity, which promoted Ricciardo to second place and Nathanaël Berthon to third. Aleshin took a second win in the first race at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps ahead of Pentus and Stefano Coletti. In the second race, Esteban Guerrieri took the first win for ISR Racing in the series, after taking advantage of drive-through penalties for several of his rivals. Zampieri took his second runner-up placing with Coletti again finishing third. Ricciardo took his first victory in the -supporting round, ahead of Aleshin and Epsilon Euskadi rookie Albert Costa, while Guerrieri missed the round due to budgetary concerns and was replaced by GP3 frontrunner Alexander Rossi, who retired from the race.\nGuerrieri returned to the series at the next round at Brno, which hosted its first event. Guerrieri's team-mate Filip Salaquarda had qualified on pole for both races, but it was Guerrieri who led the field to the flag each time, taking his victory total for the season to three and moved himself back in the running for the championship as he lay seven points behind Aleshin. Aleshin took his third victory of the season at Magny-Cours, while Berthon picked up his only win of the season in the second race, and thus Aleshin extended his championship lead at the halfway stage, leading with 75 points to Ricciardo's 66 and Guerrieri's 59. Guerrieri's title chances hit a snag, after ISR elected to miss the meeting due to damaged chassis; Ricciardo and Aleshin took advantage scoring 20 and 22 points respectively, while Pentus took his first victory since Aragón to move ahead of Guerrieri in the championship standings.\nAfter a two-month summer break, Hockenheim held the next round of the championship, in which Ricciardo and Guerrieri claimed the victories with Aleshin's championship lead cut to ten points over Ricciardo with Guerrieri a further sixteen behind. At Silverstone, Guerrieri took his fifth victory on the road in the opening race, but was disqualified on a technical infringement, giving victory to Ricciardo's team-mate Jean-Éric Vergne. Vergne was making only his third start in the series after replacing Brendon Hartley at Tech 1 Racing, having already secured the British Formula 3 Championship in dominant fashion. Ricciardo himself was in the wars after rolling his car just yards after the start of the race, due to a collision with Fortec Motorsport's Jon Lancaster. Guerrieri did secure his fifth win at Silverstone, taking the second race ahead of Ricciardo and Vergne and moved within 16 points of Aleshin with a round to go. In Barcelona, Ricciardo won the opening race with Aleshin second to leave both drivers going into the final race with 128 points apiece and mathematically eliminated Guerrieri from title contention. While Guerrieri won the final race ahead of Vergne, Ricciardo and Aleshin did battle over third position and the championship, with Aleshin prevailing thanks to a move with three laps to go, giving Aleshin his first major championship title. Tech 1 easily claimed the teams' championship, 72 points ahead of closest rivals ISR.\nEurocup Formula Renault 2.0.\nThe series had a new look for 2010, with the introduction of the Barazi-Epsilon chassis to replace the original Tatuus chassis which had been the mainstay of Formula Renault 2.0 during the 2000s. Both season-opening races at Motorland Aragón were won by Eurocup debutant Kevin Korjus, who had moved up from the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup over the off-season. Four other drivers appeared on the podium over the weekend, as Korjus left Spain with a 12-point championship lead. Arthur Pic took his first Eurocup win at Spa, but Korjus finished second in order to extend his championship lead over Luciano Bacheta. He extended this further, with his third win of the season at Spa. Pic dominated at Brno winning both races from pole position, as Korjus finished off the podium in both races, losing eight points to Bacheta who finished third in each race. Korjus returned to form at Magny-Cours taking his fourth win as well as a third place finish, giving him a 30-point lead over Bacheta at the midway point with Pic two points behind in third. Giovanni Venturini claimed the other race win, for his only victory of the season.\nPic and Bacheta shared the wins at the Hungaroring with Pic moving into second place behind Korjus after Bacheta's 18th in the opening race, after being involved in an accident with Korjus, who suffered his only retirement of the season. He finished the other race in sixth – fifth-placed points due to guest driver Will Stevens finishing in fourth – and thus still held an 11-point lead over Pic, with Bacheta a further ten behind in third. It would be as close as the pair would get as Korjus unleashed a dominating finish to the championship, amassing a tally of 87 points out of a possible 90 at the final three meetings, with five wins and a second place. Bacheta took the other victory – although second on the road behind guest Javier Tarancón – but it was not until the final race before the runner-up placing was decided. Pic held a five-point advantage over Bacheta before the final race, but was decided in Bacheta's favour after Pic was disqualified for failing to observe a drive-through penalty for short-cutting a chicane while attempting to pass team-mate Carlos Sainz Jr. who was competing as a guest.\nEurocup Mégane Trophy.\nThe opening race of the series was cancelled after a technical problem during the start procedure. The race was not made up, thus reducing the calendar to 13 races. Dimitri Enjalbert, the driver with the most wins in 2009, claimed the victory in the single race to be held, which was ultimately his only victory of the entire season. At Brno, Stefano Comini added a first and a second to his third from Spa, and moved into an early championship lead ahead of Pierre Thiriet and Nick Catsburg, who won the other race. Thiriet and Catsburg each won a race at Magny-Cours and the Hungaroring to move themselves ahead of Comini in the championship, who struggled to keep with the pair, amassing just ten points over the two meetings. Catsburg then dominated the rest of the season, winning four of the remaining six races with two second places to take TDS Racing's first title since Michaël Rossi in 2008. Thiriet finished second, 27 points behind Catsburg with four further podiums in the same period. Comini finished third taking the two victories that Catsburg did not take over the final three meetings. TDS easily won the teams' title, amassing nearly double the points tally of the second-placed Oregon Team.\nF4 Eurocup 1.6.\nIn its only season on the World Series package, 1600cc Formula Renault cars provided two wet races in Spain, with Stoffel Vandoorne and Norman Nato sharing the race victories. Vandoorne took two wins at Spa, as he extended his championship lead yet further. Franck Matelli took his only victory of the season at Magny-Cours, while Vandoorne took his fourth win in six races to leave the meeting with a comfortable 35-point lead over Matelli. Mathieu Jaminet took both wins at the Hungaroring, as Vandoorne suffered his worst weekend of the season, amassing just eight points but with Matelli only scoring two more, Vandoorne still had a 28-point lead over Nato by the time the series returned after its summer break. A double win for Vandoorne at Hockenheim moved him within sight of the championship, which he ultimately clinched with a meeting to spare, thanks to a second place finish in the second Silverstone race, where both races were won by Paul-Loup Chatin, moving into third place in the championship in the process. Nato and Jaminet clinched second and third in the championship by each taking a win in Barcelona."

        "text": "The 2009 World Series by Renault was the fifth season of Renault Sport's series of events, with three different championships racing under one banner. Consisting of the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 and the Eurocup Mégane Trophy, the World Series by Renault ran at seven different venues, where fans can get into the meetings for no cost whatsoever, such is the uniqueness of the series.\nThe series began on 18 April at the Circuit de Catalunya, just outside Barcelona and finished on 25 October at the Ciudad del Motor de Aragón in Alcañiz. The 2009 calendar featured two changes to the calendar from 2008, with Monza and Estoril being replaced by two new circuits in the Algarve and the season-ending round in Aragón. Catalunya moved to the season-opening round, having been the 2008 season finale. The series also visited Belgium, France, Hungary, Germany and the United Kingdom during the season, while Formula Renault 3.5 had two extra races on its own, in support of the in May, and also the 1000 km of Algarve in August.\nReview.\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series.\nThe early pacesetter in the championship was Marcos Martínez of Pons Racing, scoring more points in the first two races than he did in the entire 2008 season. Martínez won both races at the opening round in Barcelona, and added a third in succession at Spa, opening up a fourteen-point lead over International DracoRacing's Bertrand Baguette. Baguette remained in contention with Martínez despite not winning a race in the first half of the season, finishing in the top three four times. Indeed, Martínez and Baguette were level on 56 points after the Hungaroring, which earned Martínez a chance to drive a Renault Formula One car at the Silverstone meeting.\nMartínez added his fourth win of the season at Silverstone, while P1 Motorsport's James Walker moved ahead of Baguette after a second place at Silverstone, to go along with an earlier win at Spa. However, Martínez's season hit the buffers after that, and Baguette moved into the championship lead after a double win at Le Mans. This was a lead that he was ultimately not to lose. With Baguette seemingly uncatchable, the battle for second place in the championship started to heat up. After the Algarve round, six drivers were split by just fifteen points with Walker, Carlin Motorsport's Jaime Alguersuari, Martínez, Charles Pic of Tech 1 Racing (a race winner at Silverstone), Alguersuari's team-mate Oliver Turvey (winner of the Monaco Grand Prix-support round) and Ultimate Motorsport's Miguel Molina were all in the running for the honours. Molina's season ended after the Algarve, with Ultimate pulling out.\nAlguersuari had made his Formula One debut for Scuderia Toro Rosso the previous week at the Hungaroring, and promptly recorded his best weekend of the season in the Algarve, amassing 27 points for the feature race pole, a win in the feature, and a third-place finish in the sprint race. A third win for Baguette at the Nürburgring took him to within reach of the title, and did so with a fifth in the feature race. Fairuz Fauzy, a winner in Hungary, moved into contention for second, with a second and a third in the same round. Pic's second win of the season, gave him the advantage heading to Alcañiz, leading Walker by seven, Alguersuari by nine, and Fauzy and Turvey by seventeen. Martínez's challenge had faded to a distant memory, with four retirements in six races dropping him to seventh.\nDespite the pressure being off the Belgian, Baguette finished the season in style with a double win. But the main focus of the weekend was the battle for second in the championship. Even going into the final race of the season, it remain unresolved. Five drivers were separated by eight points, with a maximum of fifteen available. As it turned out, the driver furthest back going into the race came out in second place, as Fauzy finished second behind Baguette, and with none of the other drivers in contention scoring more than six points, the Malaysian edged out Pic by just four points. That said, he was nearly 60 points behind the runaway champion Baguette, who amassed fifteen consecutive points-scoring finishes and 90 points in the final eight races of the season, including five wins. Other drivers to win races were Pasquale Di Sabatino of RC Motorsport and Jon Lancaster of Comtec Racing.\nEurocup Formula Renault 2.0.\nThe 2-litre Formula Renaults were dominated by just three drivers; teenagers Albert Costa of Epsilon Euskadi, SG Formula's Jean-Éric Vergne and Motopark Academy figurehead António Félix da Costa. The trio combined for thirteen of the fourteen pole positions, twelve fastest laps and twelve wins, with only Costa's team-mate Nathanaël Berthon and Félix da Costa's team-mate Adrian Quaife-Hobbs breaking the stranglehold. Costa dominated early in the season, winning the first four races on the road. However, he lost his first victory in Barcelona due a technical problem with the gearbox of his Epsilon Euskadi car, gifting victory to Berthon. Félix da Costa was the only driver keeping up with the Spaniard, having finished the first four races on the podium, with three seconds and a third. Vergne was in a lowly eighth, after a non-scoring weekend in Barcelona. Félix da Costa took over the championship lead at the Hungaroring, as Costa retired from the first race which Vergne won.\nOne of Félix da Costa's endless teammates at Motopark, Marco Sørensen took his first win during the second Hungaroring race, but was latterly disqualified from the weekend a couple of weeks later due to a non-compliance on his car during the Super Pole session. Motopark appealed but would lose their appeal, but was the start of things to come that would eventually lead to their pulling out from the Eurocup and all other Formula Renault 2.0 series. Sørensen's loss was another Motopark driver's gain as Quaife-Hobbs took his first Eurocup victory.\nFélix da Costa then took his first Eurocup victory at Silverstone, to take a five-point lead at the halfway stage of the championship. Vergne moved back into contention as he won the second Silverstone race, with non-scores for Costa and Félix da Costa, after the two collided with each other. Vergne continued his good run at Le Mans, doing the double and moved into second in the championship, as Costa retired from the second race. As it stood, Félix da Costa had a seven-point lead over Vergne, who in turn had a seven-point advantage over Costa. The key incident of the season occurred during the Super Pole session at the Nürburgring. Félix da Costa and Kevin Magnussen both ran under appeal during the weekend, due to technical infringements. Again, Motopark would appeal and would lose again. This meant that if Félix da Costa was to win the title, he needed Vergne and Costa to both slip up. Sadly for the Portuguese driver, Costa dominated the whole weekend: two pole positions, two fastest laps and two wins; moving into a decisive championship lead. As it stood, Costa had 114, Vergne 112 and Félix da Costa 97.\nFélix da Costa had to do as best as he could, and had to rely on his rivals messing up. He won the first race in Alcañiz, but unluckily for him, Costa and Vergne followed him home. Félix da Costa completed the double in the second race, taking his championship tally to 128 points. Guest driver and 2009 Formula Renault UK champion Dean Smith was second but was not eligible for points, which meant third place for Costa gave him second-place points (twelve) and gave him the title by ten points, as Vergne finished sixth. That placing was vital for the French driver, as he and Félix da Costa finished tied on points, with Vergne taking second due to an extra win on countback. Quaife-Hobbs took fourth in the championship, after edging a final race battle with Vergne's team-mate Miquel Monrás.\nEurocup Mégane Trophy.\nThe Eurocup Mégane Trophy offered up a title fight between McGregor by Equipe Verschuur's Mike Verschuur and TDS Racing's Jonathan Hirschi. Hirschi started the season on fire, taking three of the first four races to lead Verschuur by some twenty points, with Verschuur only eight clear of Pierre Thiriet. This was due to the Dutchman not starting the second Spa race after a problem on the formation lap. Verschuur cut that advantage to five at the Hungaroring, despite not winning either race; finishing behind Dimitri Enjalbert of Boutsen Energy Racing on both occasions. Hirschi was disqualified from the second race due to two collisions in the first eleven laps of the race. Enjalbert added a third win in a row at Silverstone, the race to mark the halfway stage of the season. He was closing fast on the lead two with 48 points in third, with only Hirschi on 76 and Verschuur on 75 ahead of him.\nThree in a row became four in a row for Enjalbert, as the French driver continue his procession towards the lead duo. Verschuur took the championship lead for the first time as he finished second behind Enjalbert again, while Hirschi finished down in sixth. Hirschi finally ended Enjalbert's streak at Le Mans, and took back the championship lead from Verschuur by a solitary point with a first and a second compared to the Dutch driver's second and fourth. Four races remained, and the two could be caught by only Enjalbert or Fabrice Walfisch, but that could only be done with bad runs for the top two.\nEnjalbert took his win tally to seven at the Nürburgring with his third double win of the season, and was followed home on both occasions by Verschuur, putting him back into the championship lead. A retirement for Hirschi in race one also meant that Verschuur's championship lead heading to Alcañiz was a comfortable fourteen points. Enjalbert had closed to within ten points of Hirschi, despite scoring in only eight races. Verschuur took the title with a double win, and Hirschi took second after Enjalbert suffered a costly retirement from the final race of the season. Walfisch finished best of the rest in fourth place, ahead of Thiriet. In the Gentlemen drivers class, Jean-Philippe Madonia was a comfortable champion, winning nine races."

The course comprised 12 laps around 23.8-kilometre route, making a total distance of 285.6 km.\nThe race.\nIn the penultimate lap Wout Wagtmans attacked. He had a gap of 1 minute at it maximum. Then Marcel Janssens reacted, together with Rik Van Looy they closed the gap. Van Looy and Janssens left Wagtmans behind. In the final lap the duo had a gap of 30 secondes. At that time, it looked like Rik II (Rik Van Looy) would become the new World Champion, but Janssens got cramps.\nIn the peloton Louison Bobet and Jacques Anquetil were leading the chase. Before Anzegem they could catch the two leaders. Subsequent Fred De Bruyne attacked. Rik Van Steenbergen didn't react, but Bobet did. There was a new leading group: the Frenchman Bobet and the Belgian De Bruyne. Because Bobet was a faster sprinter and would likely win from De Bruyne, there was a reaction of Van Steenbergen. Together with Van Looy, Jacques Anquetil and André Darrigade he could close the gap. A group of six rides could sprint for the victory.\nAt 400m of the finish Darrigade started the sprint. At 150m Rik Van Steenbergen came nearby and he won the sprint with six. Rik I won for the third time the World Championship.

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured India in the 1964-65 cricket season. They played four Test matches against the Indian cricket team, with India winning one match and the other three being drawn.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand travelled to India after a three-match drawn Test series against Pakistan at home. \"The Indian Express\" pointed out that one of the \"several lessons\" they learnt from the series was the lack of genuine spin bowlers. In this regard, Vic Pollard and Graham Vivian were included in the squad to support left-arm spinner Bryan Yuile. It also added that \"lapses in temperament\" and a \"shortage of batsmen with stroke and enterprise\" were the two other weaknesses in the side. On the positives, their fast bowlers were in good form, alongside batsmen Ross Morgan and John Reid. The latter were to be complemented by Bert Sutcliffe, once considered the best left-handed batsman in the world. Before the series, captain John Reid mentioned that it was \"hard going straight into the series without a loosening up match in Indian conditions.\" However, he rated his team better than the one that toured the country in 1955–56.\nSquads.\nTouring party.\nA 15-member New Zealand squad for the tour of India, Pakistan and England was announced by the New Zealand Cricket on 14 February 1965. John Reid was named the captain and Graham Dowling, his deputy. Bert Sutcliffe made a comeback to the side coming out of retirement after five years. Four players — Terry Jarvis, Vic Pollard, Bruce Taylor and Graham Vivian — made the squad for the time. The team manager for the tour was Walter Hadlee. The party arrived in Madras, the venue of the First test, on 24 February.\nThe team members were:\nIndia squad.\nThe Indian selectors picked the same squad that played Australia at home earlier that season, with the exception of Indrajitsinhji, who was replaced by Farokh Engineer as the wicket-keeper in the playing eleven. The former was included in the reserves. The Nawab of Pataudi Jr. was retained as the captain. The squad was announced on 15 February 1965.\nThe team members were:"

        "title": "Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey team plays for the University of Minnesota at the Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis. The team is one of the members of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I. The Golden Gophers have won six NCAA Championships as well as the final American Women's College Hockey Alliance Championship. In the WCHA, they have also been regular season champions 11 times and tournament champions 8 times. In addition to their overall success as a competitive team, the Gophers have also been ranked in the nation's top two teams for attendance since becoming a varsity sport, and the team holds the second largest single-game attendance record for women's collegiate hockey, drawing 6,854 fans for the first Minnesota women's hockey game on November 2, 1997. The team also holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in women's or men's college hockey at 62 games from February 17, 2012 to November 17, 2013, winning back-to-back NCAA titles during the stretch.\nIn 2004–2005, Minnesota also won back-to-back NCAA Championships. Natalie Darwitz was a three-time All American, and three-time finalist for the Patty Kazmaier award. Darwitz left the program with the career scoring mark at Minnesota in three years and set two NCAA single-season record with 114 points (42 Goals, 72 Assists) and most assists in 40 games in her final season. Minnesota Gophers women's hockey players have won the Patty Kazmaier Award three times (Krissy Wendell [2005], Amanda Kessel [2013], and Taylor Heise [2022]), as well as having all three finalists in 2013.\nCoaches.\nThe Gophers have had two head coaches to date: Laura Halldorson and Brad Frost. Halldorson was the head coach for eleven years, from the 1997–1998 season to the 2006–2007 season. Her overall coaching record was 278–67–22 with the Gophers, a winning percentage of .787. During that time, the Gophers won four of their five WCHA championships and three of their national championships. They averaged 28 wins per season and appeared in eight out of ten national tournaments, reaching seven finals. In addition, the Gophers experienced their best season in 2004–2005 with a 36–2–2 record.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Brad Frost became the temporary head coach. He had previously been an assistant coach. In his first year as head coach, Frost led the Gophers to a 21-game winning streak, with the season's record ending with 27 wins, 7 losses, and 4 ties but also ended with a conference record of 21–5–2, which ranked second in the WCHA. The Gophers made another NCAA regional appearance and post-season Frost was awarded WCHA Coach of the Year. In the 2008–2009 season, his temporary coaching status was lifted and he was named permanent head coach of the Gophers. That same season he led the Gophers to a record of 32–5–3 and to another WCHA championship. Frost then coached the Gophers into back-to-back NCAA Frozen Four championships in 2012 &amp; 2013, which were encompassed in their 62-game winning streak. The Golden Gophers have had a cross state rivalry with the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs. The Gophers handed the Bulldogs their first ever conference loss 4–3 in a sold-out game at Pioneer Hall on February 11, 2000.\nTeam history.\nMinnesota put its first women's team on the ice in 1997–98. Nadine Muzerall, a Canadian who graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, was among its initial recruits.\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Krissy Wendell set an NCAA record (since tied) for most shorthanded goals in one season with 7. After graduating from Minnesota, she had the career record for most shorthanded goals in a career with 16. Ironically, both marks were tied by Meghan Agosta.\nIn 2009–10, Noora Räty was just the second freshman to be a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award. Räty led the NCAA in several goaltending categories. She led the NCAA in goals-against average (1.24), save percentage (.951) and shutouts (7), while ranking third in winning percentage (.792). Her won loss record for the year was 17–3–4. In addition, Räty was the WCHA goaltending champion and earned numerous honours including All-WCHA First Team and All-WCHA Rookie Team. During the season, she was named the WCHA Defensive Player of the Week four times and WCHA Rookie of the Week on two occasions. She set a school record for most assists in one season by a goaltender (3). Räty played on national championship teams in 2011–12 and 2012–13. The 2012–13 team finished 41–0–0, and the team won the last 49 games of Räty's career. Räty finished with both the career and single-season record for shutouts.\nMinnesota Duluth rivalry.\nMinnesota-Duluth, had been a traditional rival to the Gophers in men's hockey. In 1998, Minnesota Duluth announced that it was going to assemble a women's team for the 1999–2000 season. Duluth gave a three-year, $210,000 contract to Shannon Miller, who coached Canada to the 1998 Olympic final in Nagano. Miller recruited players from Canada, Finland and Sweden, including four Olympians. The rivalry was fuelled when Miller took two players from Minnesota: star forward Jenny Schmidgall, whose 93 points led the nation, and defenseman Brittny Ralph, who would serve as the Bulldogs' captain. In the 1999–2000 season, Duluth would lose just once to the Gophers in their first five meetings, which included a 2–0 Bulldogs victory in the final of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association tournament.\nArenas.\nThe Golden Gophers have called two ice rinks home. From their 1997–1998 season to their 2001–2002 season the Golden Gophers shared their home ice with the men's team at Mariucci Arena. The Golden Gophers moved into Ridder Arena in the 2002–2003 season, a facility dedicated solely to a women's hockey team, and named for team benefactors Robert Ridder and Kathleen Ridder.\nChampionships.\nConference.\nWestern Collegiate Hockey Association Women's Regular Season Champions\nWestern Collegiate Hockey Association Women's Tournament Champions\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nOlympians.\n2002 Winter Olympics.\nUnited States national team\n2006 Winter Olympics.\nFinland national team\nUnited States national team\n2010 Winter Olympics.\nFinland national team\nUnited States national team\n2014 Winter Olympics.\nFinland national team\nUnited States national team\n2018 Winter Olympics.\nFinland national team\nUnited States national team\n2022 Winter Olympics.\nUnited States national team\nFinland national team\nSweden national team\nExternal links.\n "

Denis Smith scored most runs and Bill Copson took most wickets.\nNearly all the players had been members of the 1936 championship winning team and the only player to make his debut was Cliff Gladwin whose low scores and failure to take a wicket gave little inkling that he would turn out to be Derbyshire's main wicket-taker in the years after World War II."

        "text": "The men's individual road race was an event at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. 115 cyclists from 32 nations took part. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was four. The event was won by Sergei Sukhoruchenkov of the Soviet Union, the nation's second victory (after 1960; tying France for second-most behind Italy) in the men's individual road race. His teammate Yuri Barinov took bronze. Czesław Lang's silver put Poland on the podium in the event for the second straight Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). The traditional western powers (Italy, France, Belgium, Sweden) in the sport participated in the Moscow Games amid the American-led boycott. In previous years, the boycott would have had little effect on the competition, but in the late 1970s, the United States had its first international cycling star: Greg LeMond (who would turn professional in 1981 and never compete in the Olympics) who would have been the favorite. Instead, host-nation cyclist Sergei Sukhoruchenkov was the pick to win. Gilbert Glaus of Switzerland (1978) and Gianni Giacomini (1979) had won world championships and were also significant contenders. \nLibya and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 11th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 189 kilometre course at the Krylatskoye Sports Complex in Moscow.\nResults.\nSukhoruchenkov broke away on lap 3, with a chase group including Glaus and Giacomini catching him on lap 5. Sukhoruchenkov broke away from that pack with 32 kilometres to go, riding by himself the rest of the way to the largest margin of victory in the event since 1896."

After working in the Melbourne advertising industry together for just over 3 years and winning an MADC award the creative team downed pens and pads and began as a full-time comedy duo in 2006. They played around the Australian comedy scene for a while but it was not until 2007 when they made it through to the national final of the Raw Comedy Award, a nationwide open mic competition, that they started to get widely recognized on the mainstream comedy scene.\nAnyone for Tennis? performed shows in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, recorded an EP 'Acey Deucey' and released numerous YouTube clips including 'Let's get Famous', a parody of the famous OK Go treadmill video. Anyone for Tennis recorded their first and only full-length album in June 2011 titled \"Prepare to be tuned\" which is a live recording of the 2011 Melbourne and Edinburgh Comedy Festival show of the same name.\nAs a writing team Andrew Doodson and Jason English-Rees contributed material to numerous Melbourne publications such as Melbourne street press Beat Magazine, and wrote comedy sketches for Channel 31 comedy variety programme Planet Nerd in which they also appeared."

Late in 1970, several of the \"old-timers\" began to show up at the Yale boathouse in Derby, CT, and thus began the Masters program of the New Haven Rowing Club .\nNew Haven Rowing Club used the Yale University Boathouse until 1991, when Yale needed more space and New Haven Rowing Club was also looking to increase its size. In 1992 land was acquired four miles north of the Yale boathouse, just over the Oxford Town line, on the Housatonic River. Over the next two years the boathouse was built by its members using a design by architect and fellow member Stuart Lathers.\nNew Haven Rowing Club hosts two annual regattas, the Derby Sweeps and Sculls and the Head of the Housatonic. Derby Sweeps and Sculls is a sprint race along a straight 1000 meter long course that is held in June. It runs upstream (north) and finishes at the southern end of Indian Well State Park. Head of the Housatonic is a 2.3 mile head race held in October. It starts south of Indian Well State Park and finishes at the New Haven Rowing Club Boathouse."

        "title": "1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team represented the City College of New York. The head coach was Nat Holman, who was one of the game's greatest innovators and playmakers. Unlike today, when colleges recruit players from all over the country, the 1949–50 CCNY team was composed of \"kids from the sidewalks of New York City,\" who had been recruited by Holman's assistant coach Harold \"Bobby\" Sand from Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) schools such as Taft, Clinton, Boys, Erasmus, and Franklin High Schools.\nBackground.\nThe team’s starting five was composed of two Black and three Jewish players. The team is the only team to win both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA tournament in the same year, by defeating Bradley University in the championship game of each tournament. The 1950 City team was also the first NCAA champion to have black players in its starting lineup. The players on the team were Ed Warner, Norm Mager, Irwin Dambrot, Alvin \"Fats\" Roth, Ed Roman, Floyd Layne, Herb Cohen, Ron Nadell, Leroy Watkins, Joe Galiber, and Arthur Glass. Students at CCNY, dubbed the poor man's Harvard because of its lofty academic standards, lived and died with every game, raising arena roofs with their unique school cheer:\n\"Allagaroo garoo gara,&lt;br&gt;\nAllagaroo garoo gara,&lt;br&gt;\nEe-yah ee-yah,&lt;br&gt;\nSis boom bah,\nTeam! Team! Team!\"\nNIT tournament commentary.\nCCNY had posted a 17-5 record during the regular season, but had failed to attract any support in the final AP Top 20. The team was made up mostly of sophomores and was the last squad selected to play in Madison Square Garden's famed NIT, which had a 12-team field and was at that time more prestigious than the NCAA tournament. People took notice when the Beavers thrashed defending champion San Francisco 65-46 in the opening round. CCNY then faced 3rd ranked and two-time defending NCAA champion Kentucky and their 7-foot center, Bill Spivey, in the second round. Kentucky was a racially segregated school from the Southeastern Conference, and several Wildcats refused to shake hands with the black and Jewish CCNY players before the game. This incensed the CCNY players, who then proceeded to dismantle the Kentucky team in every aspect of the game. The final score was CCNY 89, Kentucky 50, which was the worst ever defeat for an Adolph Rupp coached team. The blowout win over Kentucky was even more impressive due to the fact that Kentucky had won the NCAA tournament in 1948, 1949, and would win the tournament again the following year in 1951. A Cinderella Team had now emerged in the tournament. City College then defeated Duquesne 62-52 in the semi-final round. In the title game, the Beavers squared off against top ranked Bradley, who had All-American Paul Unruh and the 5'8\" speedster, Gene \"Squeaky\" Melchiorre. CCNY came out on top 69-61 to win the tournament. Ed Warner of CCNY was awarded Most Valuable Player honors.\nNCAA tournament commentary.\nAfter CCNY's run to the NIT title, the Beavers were immediately selected to participate in the NCAA tournament. In the first round, City College nipped second ranked Ohio State, 56-55. The Beavers then defeated fifth ranked North Carolina State 78-73 to reach the title game. CCNY again faced top-ranked Bradley and won the tournament, 71-68, to score the only Grand Slam in the history of college basketball. Irwin Dambrot of CCNY was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and Nat Holman appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. CCNY's victory was voted the most exciting event in the history of college basketball at Madison Square Garden. \nFollow-up commentary.\nThe championship games of the NCAA tournament and the NIT were played at Madison Square Garden. The NCAA later ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, to avoid having another double champion.\nIn 1950, CCNY was implicated in a point-shaving scandal. The players had taken money from gamblers in the point-shaving scandals during the 1948-1949 season and also during some regular-season games in the 1949-1950 season. No games were fixed during the post-season tournaments. This sent shock waves throughout college basketball. The scandal prompted the suspension of the basketball program. The school was moved from Division I to Division III and was banned from playing at Madison Square Garden. As a result of these sanctions, the CCNY basketball program was de–emphasized, and the school has never again appeared in either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. CCNY is the only NCAA Basketball Championship team that is no longer a member of Division I. The 1950 City team is still the most celebrated college basketball team in the history of New York City. Every one of the C.C.N.Y. players involved in the scandal eventually went back to school to earn his degree. Ed Warner and Alvin Roth played professionally in the Continental Basketball Association.\nThe NCAA tournament did not have another game at any Madison Square Garden facility from the 1961 tournament until 2014, when its successor, Madison Square Garden IV, hosted the East Regional Finals. This might be related to the point-shaving scandal of 1951 and the existence of gamblers in New York City. In 1996, the Final Four was held outside of New York City at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. After a hiatus of more than half a century, the Big Dance finally returned to the most famous indoor arena in the United States.\nNat Holman stayed on as CCNY coach until 1959, and the school's arena was named the Nat Holman Gymnasium. Holman was 98 years old when he died at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, NY, in 1995.\nProfile of the players.\nIrwin Dambrot was a 6-foot-4, 175-pound All-American forward and the only senior in the starting lineup. His free-throw defeated Ohio State 56-55 in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. He also made a game-saving play at the end of the title game against Bradley to earn MVP honors. After the scandal broke, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, ended his basketball career, and enrolled at Columbia University Dental School. He served in the U.S. Air Force Dental Corps and then practiced dentistry in Forest Hills, Queens and Manhattan. In 1989, Dambrot went to Kansas City for the 50th anniversary of the NCAA tournament, when all previous MVPs were invited; he met a lot of coaches and was treated royally. In December 2009, a month before his death, Dambrot was on hand in a wheelchair at Madison Square Garden when the Garden cited the double championship as the No. 1 college basketball moment in the game's 75-year history there. He had been living in Mendham, N.J. and died of Parkinson's disease at age 81 on January 21, 2010 and was interred at Locust Hill Cemetery in Dover, New Jersey.\nNorm Mager was a 6-foot-5 senior and the top reserve on the team. He joined the Baltimore Bullets after graduating from CCNY, but his professional basketball career ended when the scandal broke. He became an executive with a janitorial supply company, Perfect Building Maintenance, and retired in 2000 as its president. In 2005, Mager died of cancer at age 78 at a hospital in Boynton Beach, Florida.\nEd Roman, the team's 6-foot-6-inch center, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to fix the outcome of games at Madison Square Garden. After serving two years in the Army, Roman earned his undergraduate degree in physical education at Seattle University. He returned to New York to do work at City College and New York University toward a master's degree and a doctorate in psychology. He worked in the city public school's system in Queens. Ed Roman died of leukemia at age 57 in 1988 at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y.\nEd Warner also pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. He was the only one of the players to go to jail for his crimes when he was sentenced to six months at Rikers Island. He received a prison sentence because he had a record as a juvenile delinquent and was incorrigible and uncontrollable in the courtroom. In the 1960s, he was imprisoned again after pleading guilty to attempting to sell heroin. Warner had worked as a high school basketball referee, but in April 1984 he was partly paralyzed when his automobile was struck from behind in Upper Manhattan. Ed Warner died in Harlem at age 73 in 2002.\nFloyd Layne became basketball coach at CCNY in the 1970s and 1980s. After he left CCNY, he became the head basketball coach at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn.\nAlvin Roth was 6'4\", weighed 210 pounds and played guard. He was one of the players arrested in the scandal and agreed to serve in the United States Army for a time in exchange for suspending his jail sentence. After discharge, Roth finished City College business school and became an insurance executive in Westchester County, New York.\nLeroy Watkins was a 6-foot-7-inch reserve center who was not involved in the scandal, because he had very little playing time. Nat Holman put Watkins in to jump-center for the opening tipoff against Kentucky in the NIT, and he surprisingly outjumped 7-foot Bill Spivey. Watkins died in 2008.\nJoe Galiber, a substitute player who was not involved in point-shaving, became a state senator and served in this capacity until his death at age 71 in 1995.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12| Regular Season\n!colspan=12| National Invitation Tournament\n!colspan=12| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "2010 Formula Renault 2.0 UK Championship",
        "text": "The 2010 Formula Renault 2.0 UK Championship was the 22nd British Formula Renault Championship. The season began at Thruxton on 3 April and ended on 10 October at Brands Hatch, after twenty rounds held in England, and for the first time since 2006, Scotland. Making its debut in the series in 2010 was the new-specification car, designed by Barazi-Epsilon, replacing the Tatuus chassis that had been in the series since 2000.\nAt the age of , Anglo-Swedish driver Tom Blomqvist of the Fortec Motorsport team became the youngest drivers' champion in series history after coming out on top of a season-long battle with his rivals. Despite winning just three races – coming in succession at Silverstone National and Knockhill – Blomqvist won the championship due to his superior finishing record, finishing 19 of the season's 20 races within the top seven placings; giving Fortec their third title in the last four seasons. Lewis Williamson of Manor Competition finished the season as runner-up behind Blomqvist, 14 points behind on overall scores, but was eight points closer on the series' championship system in which a driver's two worst scores are not considered towards the championship. Williamson took five victories during the season, but mistakes at Brands Hatch when he spun out of the lead while leading the race and a poor start in the final race, as well as errors at Croft prevented him from becoming Manor's second successive champion after Dean Smith's triumph in 2009.\nAlso in the running for the championship at the final Brands Hatch meeting were Atech GP's Tamás Pál Kiss and Williamson's Manor teammate Will Stevens, but poor results for both drivers in the first race mathematically eliminated them from contention. Pál Kiss had started the season strongly, having finished on the podium in six of the first seven races with three victories but failed to reach the top step of the podium in any of the remaining races, taking just two further podiums en route to third place in the championship. Stevens took fourth in the championship finishing nine points behind Pál Kiss on overall scores and 20 on dropped scores after finishing every race of the season including victories at Thruxton and the Brands Hatch GP meeting. CRS Racing's top driver was Harry Tincknell, who finished fifth in the championship with victories at Rockingham and Snetterton.\nFive other drivers tasted success during the season, with only Riki Christodoulou not finishing within the top ten of the championship, due to him not partaking in the full campaign. Ollie Millroy was another winner for Manor, when he won from pole position at Snetterton, Pál Kiss' Atech GP teammates Nick Yelloly and Marlon Stöckinger each won races at Brands Hatch and Croft respectively, Christodoulou won the season finale at Brands Hatch for Fortec, while CRS Racing's Robert Foster-Jones won at Knockhill before retiring at the end of the season, aged just 20 years old. In other championships, Alex Lynn bested Fabio Gamberini for Graduate Cup honours for first-year drivers, while Manor Competition comfortable won the Entrants' Championship by 96 points.\nCalendar.\nThe series supported the British Touring Car Championship at all rounds except Donington Park on 19 September, as Formula Renault formed part of the World Series by Renault meeting on the same date, at Silverstone.\nNotes:\nFormula Renault UK Winter Series.\nThe 2010 Michelin Formula Renault UK Winter Series was the 13th British Formula Renault Winter Series. The series commenced at Snetterton on 6 November and ended at Pembrey on 14 November, after six races at three rounds held in England and Wales.\nFortec Motorsport again took honours for the Series, as main season Graduate Cup winner Alex Lynn won the title after winning three of the six races to be held. He finished 17 points clear of teammate Joni Wiman, who made his Formula Renault début during the series having competed in ADAC Formel Masters, and claimed a victory at Pembrey. Jack Hawksworth finished third in his first single-seater championship, having taken two podiums and five top-ten finishes in his first six races out of karting for Mark Burdett Motorsport. Atech GP driver Richie Stanaway and Oliver Rowland of CRS Racing claimed the remaining victories as they finished in fifth and seventh places respectively. With five class wins, Fortec's Josh Webster won the BARC Winter Cup for the Formula Renault BARC competitors."

        "text": "Mike Hodges (born November 14, 1945) is a former American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1992 to 1997, compiling a record of 35–30.\nCoaching career.\nHodges served as an assistant coach and a defensive coordinator at UMass for 14 years, under three different head coaches. Following the 1991 season he was named the school's head coach after Jim Reid resigned following budget disagreements with administration.\nAs head coach, Hodges compiled a 35–30 overall record with four winning seasons. His 35 wins were the fifth most in UMass history at the time, and he still ranks 7th on the UMass all-time win list. During his head coaching tenure, Hodges coached eight All-Americans and 39 All-Conference selections (Yankee Conference, Atlantic 10), including Walter Payton Award finalist and current ESPN analyst Rene Ingoglia. Hodges resigned after a 2–9 season in 1997. \nAfter resigning as head coach, Hodges served as the Director of Football Operations for UMass until his retirement in 2011. Although Hodges did not make the postseason as head coach of the Minutemen, many fans of the school appreciated his contributions to the program. Hodges kept the Minutemen competitive at a time when huge budget cuts ravaged the Athletic Department. Also, many of his recruits were prominent members of the 1998 UMass team that won the Division 1AA National Championship."

South Africa won the tournament, narrowly defeating hosts Hong Kong in the final, after Farhaan Behardien hit the required six off the last ball of the match.\nDespite losing in the final, Hong Kong's Irfan Ahmed was awarded the Ben Hollioake Trophy, given to the player of the tournament. He played in all seven of Hong Kong's matches, and finished with 163 runs, which was bettered only by England's Peter Trego. He also claimed three wickets in the tournament, at an economy of 13.63 runs per over, ranking him fifth of all bowlers for economy.

Each member of the fielding side, with the exception of the wicket-keeper shall bowl one over. Wides and no-balls count as two runs to the batting side, plus an extra ball.\nLast man stands.\nIf five wickets fall (not including batsmen retiring not out) before the allocated overs have been completed, the remaining batsman continues, with the last batsman out remaining as a runner. The not out batsman shall always face strike, and shall be declared out if his partner is declared out.\nBatsman retire.\nA batsman must retire not out on reaching 31 runs, but not before. He may complete all runs scored on the ball on which he reaches his 31, and retire immediately after. If one of the last pair of batsmen is out, any remaining not out batsman may resume his innings. In the case where there is more than one, they must return in the order they retired.\nGroup stage.\nNorthern Hemisphere.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSouthern Hemisphere.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCup round-robin stage.\n \n \n \n \n \n "

She batted and threw right-handed.\nSmith was born and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. An all-around athlete in college, both in basketball and softball, she served in the Army during World War II, just after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Smith joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, where she drew illustrations for the WAAC newspaper based at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, and also played as a catcher on a women’s fast-pitch softball team. She was transferred to the Pentagon in 1944 to work in Army Military Intelligence, working in cartography. She was discharged in 1945 and made her debut in the AAGPBL in its 1947 season, playing for the Kenosha Comets before joining the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1948.\nFollowing her baseball career, Smith attended and graduated from Pratt Art Institute in New York City. She spent more than 30 years in the Richmond school system, teaching art and shop classes, before retiring in 1982. The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York since November 5, that honors those who were part of this experience. Smith, along with the rest of the league's girls, is enshrined in the Hall. Smith died in January 2019 in her hometown of Richmond, Virginia, 12 days after her 97th birthday."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey season was the Falcons' 41st season of varsity hockey and 39th in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). The Falcons finished the year as the eleventh place team in the CCHA and in the first round of the CCHA Hockey Tournament, they lost to the sixth seed Nebraska Omaha. The team was coached by Dennis Williams in his first and only season as the program's head coach.\nPreseason.\nFollowing the 2008–09 season, the future of the ice hockey program at Bowling Green State University was put into doubt. Blog and the local media began to report that the university was planning on cutting the ice hockey program to save money. The reports were met by much criticism from Bowling Green alumni and residents of Northwest Ohio. In late March 2009, Bowling Green president Dr. Carol A. Cartwright officially announced that a feasibility study of the 43-year-old ice arena and the hockey program would be conducted. Cartwright stated the outline of a plan to decide the future of the BGSU Ice Arena and to explore options facing the University's Intercollegiate Athletics Department. Cartwright has assigned Dr. Edward G. Whipple, BGSU vice president for student affairs, to lead the arena effort and Greg Christopher, director of intercollegiate athletics, to head the athletics review. Bowling Green's hockey program's first head coach, Jack Vivian, was announced as the head of the arena working group, as he was a long-time, national consultant on ice arena operations.\nOn July 22, 2009, Bowling Green and the Michigan Wolverines announced that they would play a game at the newly opened Lucas County Arena in downtown Toledo, Ohio on November 21.\nOn July 31, 2009, BGSU announced that it was committing $2.5 million to improvements to BGSU Ice Arena and that another $1.5 million was secured from the state of Ohio by state representative Randy Gardner and state senator Mark Wagoner to assist with renovation plans for the Falcons hockey team's home ice facility. Along with the money committed by BGSU and received from the state of Ohio, the program began to receive donations from supporters and alumni, including $250,000 from Jack and Elaine Vivian and former figure skater and Bowling Green native Scott Hamilton donated $500,000 to endow the Scott Hamilton Hockey Scholarship.\nCoaching changes.\nHead coach Scott Paluch would resign on June 30, 2009 and took up a position as regional manager for the United States National Developmental Team. In seven seasons as head coach at Bowling Green, Paluch compiled a record of 84–156–23. Paluch's assistant, Dennis Williams was named the interim coach for the 2009–10 season.\nPlayers leaving.\nBowling Green would see many players leave the team during the offseason, starting with sophomore forward Dan Sexton, who signed a professional contract with the Anaheim Ducks. Freshman defenceman Dean Petiot, who had left Bowling Green during the 2008–09 season, signed with the Huntsville Havoc of the Southern Professional Hockey League Sophomore forward Jacob Cepis left Bowling Green and transferred to the University of Minnesota and began his career at Minnesota against Bowling Green on January 2, 2010. Freshman defenceman Nick Bailen withdrew from Bowling Green and re-signed with his junior team, the Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League."

        "title": "Laws of rugby league",
        "text": "In rugby league football, the Laws of the Game are the rules governing how the sport is played. The Laws are the responsibility of the Rugby League International Federation, and cover the play, officiating, equipment and procedures of the game.\nThe Laws have undergone significant changes since pioneers of the sport broke away from the Rugby football establishment in 1895. The sport has been described as a \"constantly evolving animal, particularly with professional coaches, [with which] the rules have to keep pace\".\nLaws.\nThe current \"Laws of the Game\" and \"Notes on the Laws\" are set out in 17 sections:\nThe current 17 sections, which include notes, are detailed in fewer than 50 pages and around 17,000 words. The Laws therefore have some flexibility to enable decisions to be made without the need to amend them. For example, Section 15, Law 1 (i) considers behaviour \"in any way contrary to the true spirit of the game\" to be misconduct. That law has been used to prevent chicken-wing tackling techniques, for example.\nOrigins.\nRugby football.\nThe rules of football as played at Rugby School in the 19th century were decided regularly and informally by the pupils. For many years the rules were unwritten. In 1845 three pupils at the school, William Delafield Arnold, Walter Waddington Shirley and Frederick Leigh Hutchins were tasked with writing a codified set of rules by the then Head Schoolboy and football captain Isaac Gregory Smith. The three pupils submitted 37 rules which were approved on 28 August 1845. Another pupil, Charles Harcourt Chambers, illustrated the Rules.\nThe Rules played at the school continued to develop over time and as pupils left they took with them the game as they had played it. In 1871, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded with the purpose of standardising the rules for the clubs playing the Rugby style of football in England. The RFU invited three former pupils, all lawyers, to write the standardised rules, and they titled their work as \"laws\". In June of that year the first Laws of the Game were approved.\nUnions were formed to govern the game in other countries but the English RFU continued to control the Laws until 1885. In 1884, there had been a dispute over the rules between the English and Scottish unions after a match between the two countries; this led to the formation of the International Rugby Football Board in 1886 with the intention of settling such disputes. The RFU refused to join and in 1887 the members of the new organisation, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, stated that no matches would be played against England until the RFU joined and accepted its rules. In 1890 the RFU joined and in 1892 a significant revision of the laws took place.\nRugby league.\nFrom 1895, the year of the schism in the game, the laws of rugby league were initially referred to as \"Northern Union\" rules, after the new governing body, and were a slight variation on the rules of rugby football as played at that time. What began as modifications to make the competition more entertaining to spectators continued until a distinct sport had emerged.\nInitially the rules were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union, today's Rugby Football League, the governing body for rugby league in the United Kingdom. As the sport spread to around the world, other rugby leagues were established, notably in Australia, France and New Zealand, a more international approach was adopted. In 1948, the International Rugby League Board (IRLB) was formed. Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop. The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later.\nDuring the Super League war, a dispute over media rights and the control of the game originating in Australia, the laws of rugby league were altered by the rival factions, the IRLB and its only remaining member, the Australian Rugby League, and the Super League International Board and its members.\nSince 1998 when the different sides reunited, the Laws have been the responsibility of the Rugby League International Federation.\nHistory of changes to the Laws.\nThe Northern Rugby Football Union inherited the existing laws of rugby football, as played until that time by its member clubs. The NRFU immediately made changes. In addition to the time before 1948 when an international governing body was established, members of the International Federation and its predecessors have had the authority to make significant changes to the Laws applied within their jurisdiction.\nThe following is an incomplete list of changes made to the laws of rugby league since the 1895 schism. Changes to the laws used for senior competitions within the jurisdictions of RLIF members with test nation status are included here.\n1890s.\nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \n1900s.\nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \nNRFU \n NSWRFL \n1920s.\n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n RFL \n1930s.\n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n1940s.\n NSWRFL \n1950s.\n RFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n1960s.\n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n RFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n1970s.\n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n RFL \n1980s.\n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRFL \n NSWRL \n NSWRL \n NSWRL \n NSWRL \n1990s.\n NSWRL \n NSWRL \nIRLB \n NSWRL \n RFL \nSLIB \n ARL \n RFL \n ARL \n SL (A) \n NRL \n RFL \n2000s.\n NRL \n RFL \n RFL \n NRL \n NRL \n NRL \n RFL \n NRL \n2010s.\n RFL \n NRL \n RFL \n RFL \n RFL \nNRL\n https://www.nswrl.com.au/news/2015/07/22/official--2016-rules-changes/\n RFL "

Washington had defeated UCLA, which had defeated USC, which had defeated Washington. The USC loss was the only one for Washington, and the Huskies had the best record in the AAWU.

        "text": "The 1953 Rose Bowl was the 39th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Thursday, January 1, at the end of the 1952 college football season. The fifth-ranked USC Trojans of the Pacific Coast Conference defeated the #11 Wisconsin Badgers of the Big Ten Conference, 7–0.\nIt was Wisconsin's first bowl game and the first Rose Bowl appearance for the Trojans in five years. It is also the first meeting of the two football programs.\nTeams.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin was the co-champion of the Big Ten Conference with Purdue, whom they did not play, and entered the Rose Bowl with a 6–2–1 record (4–1–1 in conference). The Badgers' non-conference loss was to UCLA, the Big Ten loss was at Ohio State, and they tied Minnesota in their season-ending rivalry game. This was the program's first bowl game appearance.\nUSC Trojans.\nThe USC Trojans entered the game as the Pacific Coast Conference champions, with a 6–0 record in conference play. Their sole loss was against Notre Dame in their season-ending rivalry game.\nAftermath.\nThis was the first win by a Pacific Coast team over a Big Ten team since the Rose Bowl began its exclusive contract to pair the champions of these two conferences in 1946 (beginning with the 1947 Rose Bowl). It was only the second time in Rose Bowl history that the PCC defeated the Big Ten, the first was 32 years earlier in January 1921, when California defeated Ohio State.\nThis game featured the fewest points scored in a Rose Bowl since the 0–0 tie in 1922. As of 2020, this game still stands as the second-fewest points ever scored in a Rose Bowl, and the fewest scored since the Rose Bowl started pairing the Big Ten and West (PCC/AAWU) champions for the game. The next time these two teams met in a Rose Bowl (1963), they combined to break the record for the most points ever scored in the game.\nUSC quarterback Rudy Bukich was named the Player of the Game. Future Heisman Trophy winner, Wisconsin running back/linebacker Alan Ameche, finished the game with 133 rushing yards on 28 carries. Bukich and Ameche have subsequently been inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame."

During an injury crisis at the club, Smith made his one and only NRL appearance in Newcastle's 26–28 loss to Canterbury in round 3. He is remembered for his poor performance, in which he dropped the ball multiple times, missed multiple tackles, and allowed Canterbury to score two tries as Newcastle surrendered a 24–4 lead.\nSmith was accused of misrepresenting his time with Philadelphia in order to earn a contract with Newcastle after the media learned he had not actually played in the NFL. Smith maintains that no such claim was ever made.\nSmith is reputed to have vanished from rugby league circles after the match. However, he continued to play in the Metropolitan Cup after he was released by Newcastle mid-season.\nPost-playing career.\nSmith is now a full-time track and field coach in Sydney at junior and elite level.

Dating back to 1878, it is the oldest amateur event in golf, as the first Amateur Championship was played in 1885. It is also the oldest team event in English golf. Scottish team matches were common after 1849, and included St Andrews University matches against Fife artisan clubs.\nHistory.\nThe first University Golf Match was played on 6 March 1878 at Wimbledon Common, courtesy of London Scottish Golf Club, which hosted the fixture for 19 years until it moved to Royal St George's Golf Club in 1897. The match was contested by four singles matches, and used the holes up method of scoring. Oxford, led by Horace Hutchinson, won by a margin of 24 holes.\nIn 1898 the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society (OCGS) was founded; members qualify by virtue of their participation in the University Golf Match. Since 1920, the OCGS has hosted the President's Putter, an annual match-play competition for its members held at Rye Golf Club, in Rye, East Sussex.\nVenues.\nUntil the 1890s there were very few golf courses in England, and none of appropriate quality in the Oxford and Cambridge areas. The University Match was initially played on Wimbledon Common, which, along with Royal Blackheath, was one of just a handful of courses in the London area at the time. Since then, the University Golf Match has been played at courses all over the United Kingdom, including Royal St George's, Royal Cinque Ports, Royal Liverpool, Muirfield, Ganton, Walton Heath, Hunstanton, Aldeburgh, Royal Porthcawl, and Sunningdale. The choice of venue alternates between the teams, and the match is traditionally played every five years at Rye.\nPresent-day competition.\nMen - Each team comprises ten players plus two reserves. The reserves traditionally play the \"Dinner Match\" on the Thursday of the Varsity Match week: an 18-hole alternate shot foursomes match, followed by an 18-hole singles match. The losing team is responsible for paying the bill for the Varsity Match dinner on the Saturday evening.\nThe University Match itself is contested over the course of two days. Five 36-hole foursomes matches are played on the Friday, and ten 36-hole singles matches are played on the Saturday.\nLadies – 36-hole foursomes followed by 36 holes singles the next day contested between 6 ladies from each team, with one reserve. The Ladies' match is held on the Tuesday and Wednesday of Varsity week as the beginning of the matches.\nStymies and Divots - The Stymies (Cambridge) v. Divots (Oxford) match occurs on the Wednesday before the Blues Varsity Match, featuring five 18-hole foursomes matches in the morning, followed by 10 18-hole singles matches in the afternoon."

The Azerbaijani delegation consisted of two alpine skiers, Gaia Bassani Antivari and Jedrij Notz. The nation's best finish was by Antivari, 57th place in the women's giant slalom.\nBackground.\nThe National Olympic Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic was created in 1992 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1993. Azerbaijan has sent delegations to every Olympics since the 1996 Summer Olympics, first entering the Winter Olympics in Nagano in 1998.

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1910 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire had been playing for thirty nine years. It was their sixteenth season in the County Championship and they won two matches to finish fifteenth in the Championship table.\n1910 season.\nDerbyshire played twenty two matches, all in the County Championship and won two and lost fourteen. Their two victories were courtesy of Leicestershire. John Chapman was in his first year as captain. Ernest Needham scored most runs, and Arthur Morton took most wickets.\nAmong the draws, the season produced one of the most memorable matches against Warwickshire at Blackwell in 1910 and not just a Derbyshire record 9th wicket partnership, but a world record 9th wicket partnership of 283 which still stands. At lunch time on the last day Derbyshire with eight second innings wickets down, were far behind Warwickshire's first innings score and Warwickshire looked certain of a comfortable win. Chapman and Arnold Warren were batting. William Taylor wrote \"In view of their strong position, Warwickshire, I knew, were hoping to catch an early afternoon train, and, in conversation during the interval, I remarked to their fast bowler, Frank Field: You look like catching your train all right, Frank. The reply was, I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Taylor. These chaps are pretty good bats, you know. How right he was. Chapman and Warren made their runs in less than three hours and Warwickshire had to be content with a draw.\" Chapman scored 165 and Arnold Warren 123.\nFred Root who became an international player and played five seasons for Derbyshire made his debut in 1910. Henry Jelf who retired from the navy played occasional games in this and the following season. Bertie Corbett, James Handford and Stanley Holden made their debuts and played a few games but only in the 1910 season. Charles Newcombe, who died in the war and Arthur Marsden who died six years later at St Pancras, played their only first class games in the season."

        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a batsman is said to have scored a century when they reach a score of 100 or more runs in an innings without being dismissed. In first-class cricket, the highest form of the game below international level, a total of 25 players have achieved the feat on a hundred or more occasions. For statistical purposes, any centuries scored in a Test match are included as first-class centuries (as shown in the Table below).\nThe first cricketer to achieve the feat was W. G. Grace, who completed his hundredth century in May 1895. Grace remains the only batsman to have achieved the feat and finished with a batting average below 40.\nThe English County Championship has historically always been the first-class competition in which the most matches are played per season, hence the most conducive competition to prolific run-scoring. Of the 25 men to have scored 100 first-class centuries, all have been either natively English or English-qualified except Donald Bradman of Australia, Zaheer Abbas of Pakistan, Glenn Turner of New Zealand and West Indian Viv Richards. Zaheer Abbas (Gloucestershire), Turner (Worcestershire) and Richards (Somerset) all had substantial county careers as overseas players; Bradman, the first non-English batsman to achieve the feat, therefore remains the only batsman to have done so despite never having played for an English county side. He also achieved the feat in the fewest innings and at the highest average.\nGeoffrey Boycott became the first player to score his 100th century in a Test match, doing so against Australia at his home ground of Headingley in August 1977. Subsequently Zaheer Abbas is the only other player to achieve the feat in a Test match."

        "text": "John Edward Conner (born June 8, 1987) is a former American football fullback. Conner earned a 2009 College Football All-America Team selection and was one of the best fullback prospects in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was drafted in the fifth round by the New York Jets. He is nicknamed \"the Terminator\" because of the name he shares with the main character from the popular movie franchise and because of his aggressive blocking style against defensive players.\nHigh school career.\nConner attended Lakota West High School in West Chester, Ohio, where he was a two-year starter at running back. He rushed for 1,100 yards and 14 touchdowns, averaging 6.3 yards per carry, as a senior. That year, Lakota West gained an 8–3 record and a berth in the state playoffs. Conner was subsequently named first-team All-Greater Miami Conference and honorable-mention All-Southwest Ohio.\nUnrecognized as a prospect by the two major recruiting services, \"Rivals.com\" and \"Scout.com\", Conner was not offered an athletic scholarship, although he received some recruiting attention from Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Illinois, among others. He eventually chose to walk on with the Kentucky Wildcats.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman at Kentucky, Conner appeared in the first three games of the 2005 season on special teams before sustaining a season-ending injury. He received a medical redshirt and retained the year of eligibility.\nIn his redshirt freshman season, Conner played in all 13 games, starting the first three at fullback. In his sophomore year he also played all 13 games, starting four. He scored four touchdowns and also made two tackles in kick coverage.\nBy his junior year, Kentucky frequently opened with a fullback in the lineup, giving him 11 starts in 13 games. In a game versus Georgia, Conner set career highs with seven rushes for 26 yards.\nPrior to his senior season, Conner was named the \"best blocking back\" in the Southeastern Conference in the \"Birmingham News\" 2009 preseason edition. After a solid performance throughout the season, Conner earned All-American honors by \"Pro Football Weekly\", which places an extra premium on talent and draft value in the selection process.\nProfessional career.\n2010 NFL Draft.\nConsidered one of the best fullbacks available in the 2010 NFL Draft, Conner was selected in the fifth round (139th overall) by the New York Jets.\nNew York Jets.\nIn 2012, Conner struggled with an MCL sprain and hamstring injury, and was released by the Jets on October 17.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nConner was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on December 15, 2012, after the team placed fullback Chris Pressley on the injured reserve list. Conner was released by the Bengals on August 31, 2013. In an episode of \"Hard Knocks\", Bengals coaches stated that though Conner was the best Fullback on the roster, they were keeping Orson Charles due to his special teams play, even going as far as showing Charles game film of Conner after the decision.\nNew York Giants.\nAfter working out with the Buffalo Bills, Conner was signed to a two-year contract by the New York Giants on September 25, 2013, replacing Henry Hynoski, who suffered a fractured shoulder in Week 3 of the regular season.\nSecond stint with the New York Jets.\nConner was re-signed by the New York Jets on September 30, 2014 after fullback Tommy Bohanon suffered a broken collarbone.\nBuffalo Bills.\nConner signed with the Buffalo Bills on May 13, 2015, reuniting with his former head coach Rex Ryan. On September 4, 2015, he was released by the Bills."

He served as head football coach at Northeastern University and Colby College and was the head baseball and men's basketball coach at Northeastern.\nEarly life.\nA native of Brookline, Massachusetts, McCoy attended Newton High School and Dean Academy. As a youth he excelled in football, swimming, and baseball. He was awarded a medal from the Massachusetts Humane Society for saving a girl from drowning in Crystal Lake. He attended the College of Holy Cross for one semester but had to leave due to poor health. He enrolled at Pennsylvania State University in 1921. He was a member of the Penn State team that played in the 1923 Rose Bowl. After the game, McCoy missed his midterms due to a blizzard that trapped him in his wife's home town of Syracuse, New York. He could not afford the $5 an exam fee to retake the test so he dropped out of school and worked on a railroad. McCoy resumed his education after he was recruited to play football at Lafayette College by coach Jock Sutherland.\nCoaching.\nAfter graduating from Lafayette College in 1927, McCoy became the coach for all athletics at Hackettstown High School in Hackettstown, New Jersey. In 1929 he joined the faculty of Northeastern University as an English professor and head baseball and men's basketball coach. In 1932, with the assistance of engineering school dean Carl Ell and athletic director Putty Parsons, McCoy established a freshman football team at Northeastern. The following year the school began its varsity football program. After a 1-3-1 first season, McCoy would not have a losing season as Northeastern's football coach.\nIn 1937, McCoy left Northeastern to become the head football coach at Colby College. In 1941, he was hired as backfield coach for the Harvard Crimson football team. In 1947 he became the chief scout for the Boston Yanks of the National Football League. McCoy's final coaching position came as an assistant at the University of Washington.\nLater life.\nAfter his coaching career ended, McCoy moved to La Jolla, California, where he was a successful liquor store owner and a golf writer for the \"San Diego Tribune\". In 1982 he was inducted into Northeastern's Hall of Fame. He died on January 31, 1990, in La Jolla. He was 90 years old."

The story involves circumstances relating to the Curse of the Bambino. The musical had a preview run in Massachusetts that began on May 14, 2010. The musical's world premiere was on June 2, 2010 at the Loeb Drama Center of the American Repertory Theater.\nSynopsis.\nOriginally called \"Red Sox Nation\", \"Johnny Baseball\" was conceived after the Red Sox's stunning collapse in the 2003 playoffs due to the \"Curse\", which is often cited as a reason for the failure of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year period from 1918 until 2004.\nThe Curse is traced to the interactions of three people: the fictional Johnny O'Brien, a hard-luck right-hander on the 1919 Red Sox; his idol, Babe Ruth; and O'Brien's love interest, Daisy Wyatt, an African American blues singer. The show is told through flashbacks between the fourth game of the 2004 American League Championship Series and the fictional life of Johnny O'Brien. The musical ends with David Ortiz ending the Curse in 2004.\nOriginal production numbers.\nSource: \"CurtainUp\", UMaine program\nProduction history.\nThe premiere production was staged at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The cast featured Colin Donnell as the fictional character Johnny O'Brien, Stephanie Umoh as the fictional character Daisy Wyatt, Burke Moses as Babe Ruth, Charl Brown as Tim, and Jeff Brooks as Tom Yawkey.\nThe creative team included direction by Diane Paulus, choreography by Peter Pucci, orchestrations by Wendy Bobbitt Cavett, costumes by Michael McDonald, sets by Scott Pask, and lighting by Donald Holder. This production played from June 2, 2010 to July 11, 2010. \"Johnny Baseball\" was part of the theater's \"America: Boom, Bust and Baseball\" festival.\nIt was next produced in August, 2012 by the University of Maine Summer Music Theatre Festival and Issaquah, Washington-based Village Theatre's Festival of New Musicals.\nAfter heavy rewrites, it was produced for the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Summer 2013."

After playing two years of professional hockey in Europe, Whitehead embarked on his coaching career, returning to the D-II college ranks as an assistant at Middlebury with Head Coach Bill Beaney for two years before joining the powerhouse program at Maine for the 1990–91 season. Whitehead's next stop was at Massachusetts-Lowell where he would remain as an assistant to Bruce Crowder for five years before replacing him in 1996. Whitehead would remain head coach of the River Hawks for a further five seasons before returning to Maine to replace his former boss Shawn Walsh who succumbed to cancer prior to the 2001–02 season.\nWhile only an interim head coach in his first season with the Black Bears, Whitehead led the team all the way to the NCAA title game, losing to Minnesota 4–3 in overtime. Whitehead received the Spencer Penrose Award as the NCAA Division 1 National Coach of the Year for his efforts, as well as having the interim tag removed from his job title. Two years later Whitehead led Maine back to the championship match, this time losing 1–0 to Denver. The Black Bears won the Hockey East Championship that season in a thrilling 2-1 triple overtime victory over UMass. Whitehead's success in Orono would continue through the 2006–07 season including two more trips to the Frozen Four, but after four Frozen Fours in six years, the Black Bears slumped in 2008 and 2009. Maine would miss the NCAA tournament four consecutive years, until returning to the NCAA Northeast Regional in 2012. After an 11-win, injury-plagued season in 2012–13 Whitehead was fired by an athletic department trying to find a way to regain a revenue stream that had been declining for 5 years. Overall, Whitehead led the Black Bears to seven NCAA tournament appearances in his twelve years at Maine, a run that included two NCAA national championship games, four NCAA Frozen Fours, and the 2004 Hockey East Championship.\nShortly after leaving Maine, Whitehead was named as the head coach for Kimball Union Academy promptly leading the prep school to its second title in his first year behind the bench. After winning the NEPSAC Elite Division New England Championship in 2016–17, Whitehead's career record at KUA stands at 114-22-9.\nPersonal life.\nTim lives in Meriden NH with his wife Dena and their two children, Natalie (18) and Zach (16)."

Growing up, he worked the scoreboard for baseball games at Norfolk's Bain Field, but he never played baseball until he served in the army during World War II.\nHis service in the army started in January 1944 and finished in 1946. He made his professional debut in 1948, with the Roanoke Rapids Jays, and he spent his first three seasons with the team. He earned an 8–12 win–loss record with a 4.21 earned run average (ERA) in 36 games in the 1948 season. In 1949, he had a 16–12 record with a 3.97 ERA in 38 games. Brown had arguably the best year of his professional career in 1950, as he went 28–11 with a 2.38 ERA in 45 games, allowing 269 hits in 317 innings of work. He led the league in wins and strikeouts (204) and won the league's Most Valuable Player award.\nHe began the 1951 season with the Senators, making his major league debut on April 21. Brown had a 9.26 earned run average in seven big league appearances, with no decisions. He appeared in his final big league game on May 27, and was sent to the minors, where he went 5–8 with a 6.29 ERA in 22 games (16 starts) for the Chattanooga Lookouts. Brown split 1952 between the Lookouts and Richmond Colts, going 12–10. In 1953 he went 11–8 with a 2.24 ERA in 42 games (13 starts) for the Norfolk Tars. Before the 1954 season, Tars management offered Brown a contract for $250, and after negotiations, settled on a salary of $375. He split that season between the Tars and Shreveport Sports, going a combined 13–6 in 44 games. Brown played his final minor league season in 1955, splitting the year between the Columbus Foxes and San Antonio Missions, finishing with a combined 2–3 mark. Overall, he went 109–76 in 320 minor league games.\nBrown managed the Norfolk Tars for part of the 1955 season. After leaving baseball, Brown was a longshoreman on the Norfolk docks. After 20 years as a longshoreman, he suffered disabling injuries in a fall onto a barge. He died at the age of 90 in 2016."

        "text": "Welsh regional rugby is the top tier of professional Welsh club rugby and is composed of the Scarlets, Ospreys, Cardiff Rugby and the Dragons which compete in the United Rugby Championship.\nThe regions were established for the start of the 2003/04 rugby union season. From this date, Wales was represented by a smaller number of regional teams in both the Celtic League and European Cup competitions, where previously the top club sides were entered into them.\nCurrent regions.\nCardiff Rugby.\nBased in Cardiff, the capital of Wales, Cardiff Rugby (Welsh: \"Rygbi Caerdydd\") play at Cardiff Arms Park and are owned by Cardiff Rugby Ltd, who also own and run Cardiff Rugby Football Club. From 2003 to 2021 the club were known as the Cardiff Blues before changing their name to Cardiff Rugby prior to the start of the 2021-22 season.\nCardiff Rugby are responsible for developing rugby in the city of Cardiff, Vale of Glamorgan, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil and south Powys. There are 75 associate clubs within this wider Cardiff Rugby region including semi professional Pontypridd RFC, Merthyr RFC and the Cardiff RFC Welsh Premiership side.\nCardiff Rugby compete in the United Rugby Championship, which includes teams from Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Italy and South Africa. In addition, Cardiff Blues competed in the Anglo-Welsh Cup and (for the 2017–18 season) the European Rugby Challenge Cup which they won by beating Gloucester in the final 31–30. They previously won the 2008–09 Anglo-Welsh Cup and the 2009–10 European Challenge Cup. For the 2021-22 season, Cardiff will compete in the European Champions Cup.\nScarlets.\nTheir home ground of the Scarlets is the Parc y Scarlets stadium. They play in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup (which replaced the Heineken Cup from the 2014–15 season). The club was originally named the Llanelli Scarlets but was renamed at the start of the 2008–09 rugby season.\nThe Llanelli Scarlets were founded in 2003, as one of the five (now four) regional teams created by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The Scarlets are affiliated with a number of semi-professional and amateur clubs throughout the area, including Welsh Premier Division sides Llanelli RFC, Carmarthen Quins RFC and Llandovery RFC. Through the 2007–08 season, they played most of their games at Stradey Park in Llanelli, but they have also played matches at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. The club's new stadium, Parc y Scarlets (), was constructed in nearby Pemberton, and opened in November 2008.\nOspreys.\nThe Ospreys (), formerly the Neath-Swansea Ospreys, compete in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup. The team formed as a result of Neath RFC and Swansea RFC combining to create a new merged entity, as part of the new regional structure of Welsh rugby, that began in 2003. They are also affiliated with a number of local semi-professional and amateur clubs, including Welsh Premier Division sides Aberavon RFC, Bridgend Ravens, and original founding clubs Neath and Swansea. The regional area represented by the team has widely become known for rugby purposes as 'Ospreylia'.\nTheir main home ground is the Swansea.com Stadium, Swansea, although some smaller profile games have been played at the Brewery Field, Bridgend. Ospreys currently play in a black home strip, while the away strip is white and orange. The Ospreys logo consists of an image of an Osprey mask.\nThe Ospreys are the most successful Welsh team in the history of the Celtic League or Pro12 tournament, having won the competition four times. They also became the first and only Welsh regional team to beat a major touring side, defeating 24–16 in 2006.\nDragons.\nDragons () are owned by the Welsh Rugby Union and play their home games at Rodney Parade, Newport and at other grounds around the region. They play in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup/European Rugby Challenge Cup. The region they represent covers an area of southeast Wales including Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen with a total population approaching 600,000 and they are affiliated with a number of semi-professional and amateur clubs throughout the area, including Pontypool RFC, Caerphilly RFC, Cross Keys RFC, Ebbw Vale RFC and Newport RFC.\nFormed in 2003 as a result of the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales, the team started life with a third-place finish in the 2003–04 Celtic League, and finished fourth the next season; however, the team finished in the bottom three in each of the next four seasons. In 2007, they reached the semi-finals of the European Challenge Cup, losing to French side ASM Clermont Auvergne 46–29. In 2011, they reached the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, losing to Gloucester. They are yet to make the knock-out stage of the European Rugby Champions Cup.\nHistory.\nBefore regional rugby.\nBefore regions were introduced to rugby union in Wales, there were nine clubs that played in the Welsh Premiership, the top-level of domestic club rugby in Wales. Since 2001, all of the teams also competed in the Celtic League competition, a cross-border competition involving Welsh, Scottish and Irish teams. Five Welsh clubs were also selected to take part in the Heineken Cup competition, which feature clubs from France, England and Italy in addition to the Celtic nations.\nConcerns had been raised about the number of clubs playing at the top level, with regard to Wales not producing enough good-quality players to sustain nine clubs. Good quality players who played for clubs that failed to qualify for Heineken Cup rugby missed out on the experience of playing in such a tournament. In addition, the club game in Wales had struggled to cope financially since Rugby Union turned professional in 1995. Clubs struggled for support, with reigning champions Swansea attracting a crowd of just 932 for a home game against Pontypridd in late 2001.\nRegion suggestions.\nA suggestion to move to a regional structure was made by Graham Henry, then coach of the national Wales side, in December 2001 as he had concerns that the current club system was causing harm to the performance of the national team. Prior to joining Wales, Henry had first-hand experience of a regional structure as coach of the Auckland Blues, a regional franchise team in his native New Zealand. Henry's proposal was for the creation of four sides based in West Wales, South East Wales, the South Wales Valleys and Gwent. All players would be under contract to the Welsh Rugby Union, who would decide which players would play for which region.\nHenry resigned from his post as Wales coach in February 2002, before any progress had been made with the plans. His replacement, Steve Hansen, also had coaching experience with a regional franchise in New Zealand, the Canterbury Crusaders, and he also advocated the regional structure.\nSix of the clubs that made up the Welsh Premiership suggested that they compete in a reduced size Premier League. The proposal of a six club league was agreed with in principle by the WRU management but the WRU membership rejected the proposal.\nIn September 2002, the WRU and the clubs that made up the Premiership agreed to discuss and decide on a future structure for the game. Two representatives from the clubs and two from the WRU would discuss all possible options, including making modifications to the existing club structure, provincial rugby, franchises, superclubs and regional mergers.\nSteve Hansen favoured option was for four regional teams, with 120 of Wales' top players and eight coaches under contract to the WRU, and spread through the teams as the WRU saw fit. At the end of October, David Moffatt was appointed Group Chief Executive of the Welsh Rugby Union, and he was tasked with reducing the debt of the Union.\nProposals.\nAt a meeting held between the WRU and the eight Premier League clubs on 5 December 2002, Terry Cobner, the WRU director of rugby, and David Moffett outlined plans for a regional system similar to that used by the Irish Rugby Football Union. The only proposal offered to the clubs was for four regional sides, all of which would be under the control of the Welsh Rugby Union with the existing clubs acting as feeder clubs providing their best players to the regions. The locations of the four regions, and the proposed feeder clubs were as follows:\nThe proposal was rejected by the Premier League clubs, who had expected five 'superclubs' to be formed made up of partnerships between existing clubs. Two plans had been drawn up with the partnerships arranged as follows:\nThe clubs were unable to agree on which plan they wished to submit as their preferred alternative to the WRU's provincial system. Llanelli were keen to stand-alone, citing their previous record in European competition while Neath were reluctant to form a partnership with Swansea, having already agreed in principle to pool resources with Bridgend for European competition.\nBy the end of January 2003, six of the nine clubs in the Welsh Premiership agreed on a plan that would see four regional franchises, with each club holding 50% of a franchise. Unless otherwise agreed, matches would be equally split between venues of both clubs. The proposed franchises were:\nCaerphilly RFC did not oppose the plan, despite not having a role to play in a franchise. However Cardiff RFC and Llanelli RFC were opposed to this structure, stating that it \"was not in the best interests of Welsh rugby\". Despite Llanelli's intention to pursue legal action against the Union if the plans went ahead, an Extraordinary General Meeting of the WRU was scheduled for 23 February.\nAll 239 member clubs of the Union had a vote of equal weighting, with a simple majority required for the changes to be implemented. In a bid to get some of the non-Premier League clubs to support the changes, the Union announced that the Premier League would be expanded to 16 clubs under the new proposal, which would result in a number of teams being promoted from the division below. The result of the vote was heavily in favour of the changes, with just seven votes against.\nOn 19 March, Llanelli RFC issued legal proceedings against the WRU, claiming that the Union were acting unlawfully in breaching an agreement between the clubs and the Union that was signed six years previously and were also in breach of European competition law. Three days later, the WRU announced that a consensus had been reached between them and the clubs to implement a five team regional structure. The structure of the teams had been decided with Cardiff and Llanelli each having a region whilst the remaining 6 clubs each held 50% of a region. However further meetings were scheduled to discuss outstanding issues.\nAgreement.\nThe introduction followed much controversy, as clubs disagreed with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), the governing body of the sport in Wales, over many issues, including the forming of partnerships, funding levels, loss of status and both the number and locations of regional teams.\nOn 1 April 2003, David Moffett announced that the clubs and Union had come to an agreement to implement the five regional teams, which had been approved by the WRU Board of Directors. The details were submitted to the Heineken Cup organisers, ERC, by the 2 April deadline, and the process of setting up companies to own the regions began. The five regions were:\nFurther reform.\nCeltic Warriors was acquired and liquidated by the WRU at the end of the 2003–04 season, leaving four Welsh regional sides and redrawn catchment areas.\nLlanelli Scarlets and Neath-Swansea Ospreys dropped their geographical location in their name to become Scarlets and Ospreys respectively whilst Gwent Dragons added \"Newport\" to their name as Ebbw Vale RFC dropped out and were replaced by the WRU. More recently, the Newport Gwent Dragons dropped both of their regional identifiers after the 2016–17 season, becoming simply Dragons. This change of identity coincided with the WRU acquiring Newport RFC's 50% stake in the regional side.\nIn 2008, Regional Rugby Wales was established as the association of the four regional teams. It was renamed Pro Rugby Wales in 2014.\n2010s.\nSince the regionalisation of professional Rugby Union in Wales, the national team has undoubtedly experienced great success, winning the Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2019, as well as winning the championship for a fourth time in 2013 and a fifth time in 2021. Some have attributed this success to the regional concept.\nThe regions have been reasonably successful in the Pro12 (renamed Pro14 from 2017 to 2018 forward), with Welsh teams winning on 5 separate occasions. The Ospreys are the most successful team in the history of the league with four titles, a record they share with Leinster. However, the Welsh sides have made little impact in the European Cup, with no team getting further than the semi-finals. A desire for success in Europe had been one of the principal reasons for setting up the regions in the first place.\nWhile average attendances at regional matches are generally higher than those at any one club had been before regionalisation, the total numbers attending top-flight Rugby in Wales have remained relatively stable, or even declined since 2003 due to the smaller number of teams and matches. While average attendances at all the Welsh regions have steadily grown since 2003 and are generally higher than the Scottish and Italian teams with whom they share the Pro14, they are far behind those at the Irish teams and are generally lower than in the English Premiership and French Top 14. This may be due to a failure of the regional sides to properly embrace the regional concept, with some being perceived as little more than extensions of former club sides unlikely to gain support among followers of former rivals. Supporters of Pontypridd RFC for example may find it difficult to get behind their regional side Cardiff Blues, who share colours, name and a stadium with traditional rivals Cardiff RFC. This has led to occasional calls either for the establishment of new regions to better represent those sides who feel unrepresented under the current system, or for the scrapping of the regions and a return to a club-based system.\nFinancial stability was one of the motivations for the establishment of the regions, yet the regions have remained financially unstable ever since their establishment as crowds and TV revenue have failed to materialise, with the Celtic Warriors franchise in particular lasting only one year.\nFuture.\nThe future of regional rugby in Wales will likely depend on the sporting and financial success or failure of the existing regional franchises as well as changes in the wider context of European club rugby.\nSince the demise of the Celtic Warriors, the South Wales Valleys, traditionally a heartland of Rugby, has been without a representative team. This has led to a huge part of the country being left disenfranchised from top level rugby. There have been occasional calls to resurrect the franchise or establish a new Valleys professional team as a fifth region. Valleys Rugby was established as an attempt to achieve this aim, with a new side based in Pontypridd. However, any fifth region would require additional funding or reduce the funding available to the remaining regions from the WRU and TV rights, as well as reducing their number of feeder clubs and potentially drawing away their support.\nNorth Wales was nominally part of the Scarlets' region at the introduction of regional rugby. Despite containing a significant part of the Welsh population, rugby has traditionally been less well established in the north. As a means to develop rugby in the area, the WRU established RGC 1404 in 2008 as a north Wales representative development side, based in Colwyn Bay. RGC 1404 currently play in the Welsh Premiership. Promotion and relegation is not possible between the top northern league, WRU Division One North, and the rest of the Welsh Rugby Union pyramid, and Rugby clubs in the north act as 'feeder' clubs to RGC 1404 in much the same way as the professional regions have their own feeder clubs among the semi-professional Welsh sides. Thus, although not a full-time professional side, RGC 1404 operate as a \"de facto\" fifth region: unlike the other teams at their level they are not themselves a feeder club to any of the professional regions. RGC 1404 have their own academy and have contributed players to the national U-20 side.\nDisagreements between the regional teams and the WRU during the 2013–14 season led to questions as to whether the existing regions would continue to play in the Pro12 in 2014–15, with the regions threatening to join the English premiership. The WRU stated it would consider setting up new regional teams to play in the Pro12 and European competitions should this happen. This ultimately didn't happen however following the signing of a new participation agreement.\nIn 2018 and 2019 the Welsh Rugby Union launched plans labelled Project Reset, led by a Professional Rugby Board, to start discussions of reforming salaries and the regional club system."

It comprises the Blues team, the second-team Cambridge University Golf Club Stymies, and the Ladies team. The club was founded in 1869, and the first University Golf Match was played against Oxford in 1878. Members who play in the University Golf Match are awarded a Full Blue, while those who play against Oxford for the Stymies are awarded Second Team Colours.\nHistory.\nGolf at the University of Cambridge can be traced back to 1869, when a group of undergraduates played golf over the heath in neighbouring Royston, initially cutting the holes themselves. This embryo club boasted 17 members, who paid a subscription fee of two shillings and sixpence. However, given its distance from Cambridge (8 miles), the Royston-based club did not survive beyond 1871.\nThe CUGC was officially founded in 1875 by W.T. Linskill (Jesus), and played at Coldham's Common (in the general area of the present airport) until the club's current home club, Royal Worlington and Newmarket Golf Club, was opened in 1893.\nPresent-day Club.\nThe CUGC comprises the Blues, the Stymies, and the Ladies golf teams; each has its own fixture list and Varsity Match against their Oxford counterparts. The golf season runs from the beginning of Michaelmas Term (early October), and ends with the Varsity Matches at the end of Lent Term (late March).\nThe CUGC is governed by a permanent President and Senior Treasurer, as well as the Captain, Hon. Secretary, Treasurer, Stymies Captain, and Ladies Captain that are elected each year.\nRoyal Worlington has been the home of the CUGC for over 100 years; home matches are held at the club, as well as training and coaching."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter is able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any runners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An automatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the outfield fence in fair territory. More rarely, an inside-the-park home run occurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play on the field. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the home run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year. Only home runs hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead. Mark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other player that year. However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL) Oakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway through the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24, respectively) did not qualify to lead either league.\nThe first home run champion in the National League was George Hall. In the league's inaugural 1876 season, Hall hit five home runs for the short-lived National League Philadelphia Athletics. In 1901, the American League was established and Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led it with 14 home runs for the American League Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 22-season career, Babe Ruth led the American League in home runs twelve times. Mike Schmidt and Ralph Kiner have the second and third most home run titles respectively, Schmidt with eight and Kiner with seven, all won in the National League. Kiner's seven consecutive titles from 1946 to 1952 are also the most consecutive home run titles by any player.\nRuth set the Major League Baseball single-season home run record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are tied for the widest margin of victory for a home run champion as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961 for which MLB assigned an asterisk until reversing themselves in 1991 citing Maris had accomplished his record in a longer season. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting a new record of 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, then broke that mark, setting the existing single season record of 73 in 2001. . The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had four players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.\nOn October 4, 2022 Aaron Judge hit his 62nd homerun of the year off Jesús Tinoco of the Texas Rangers passing Roger Maris for the AL home run record 61 years after Maris set it and making him only the sixth person to hit at least 60.\nIn 2023, Shohei Ohtani became the first Japanese-born player ever to win a major league home run title, leading the AL with 44 home runs."

        "text": "Zoltán Horváth (27 September 1979 – 28 December 2009) was a Hungarian professional basketball player. He played for the Hungarian national basketball team from 2005 to 2009.\nHorváth began his career on senior level in 2003 with the team of the PVSK Panthers from Pécs. He soon became the leading rebounder of the team, and in 2005 moved to the Hungarian league's defending champion, Atomerőmű SE. There, Horváth won the domestic championship and reached the national cup's final in his first year, and played in the FIBA EuroCup the following season. In 2007, he was signed by PAOK Thessaloniki, but played just four games for them before returning to Atomerőmű. Horváth then again became part of the defending domestic champion's roster, in that case Falco KC Szombathely. He reached the domestic cup's final in 2009, and developed into one of the league's dominating players during his last months, scoring more than 20 points in the first five matches of the season.\nAs part of his country's national team, Horváth took part in one match of the EuroBasket 2005 qualification, in six matches of the EuroBasket 2007 qualification, and in all six matches of the EuroBasket 2009 qualification's relegation. Although the Hungarian team eventually did not qualify for any of these tournaments, they at least avoided relegation from the Division A.\nOn 28 December 2009, Horváth was killed in a traffic accident on his way to Szombathely. He had crashed head-on into a truck after losing control of his car on the road's icy surface."

The events were broadcast on ESPN.\nSports.\nThe following were the events at Winter X Games 14.\nHighlights.\nWinter X Games XIV took place just two weeks before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Many of the events such as the snowboard cross, ski cross, and half pipe events acted as a prelude and set the tone for the Vancouver Olympics.\nKaya Turski of Canada landed the highest score in slopestyle history at the X Games winning gold. In the same event, Sarah Burke tried to land a 1260 during her third and final run. Had she landed the 1260, this would have been the first time a woman had landed it during competition. Heath Frisby and Levi Lavallee, favourites in the snowmobile freestyle event, fail to qualify for the final, opening the door for Justin Hoyer, who went on to win the gold.\nSarah Burke failed in her attempt at a four-peat in the skier superpipe when she finished sixth, Jen Hudak won gold and 17-year-old phenom Megan Gunning won silver. Burke had predicted a year earlier that Gunning would be her biggest threat in an attempt to four-peat in the superpipe.\nIn the men's snowboard superpipe final, Shaun White won gold despite injuring himself 45 minutes prior to the final, in practice when he tried a 1080 inverted double cork. He did land two double corks back to back in the final and also added a double McTwist 1260 to seal off his gold medal run.\nNate Holland won his fifth consecutive gold medal in men's snowboard cross. This was the first five-peat in the history of the Winter X Games. Lindsey Jacobellis also became the first person to win a double three-peat, when she won the women's snowboard cross for the third year in a row. Her first three-peat was 2003–2005.\nOn the final day of competition, Ophélie David successfully completed the first four-peat in women's Winter X Games history, again winning the gold in skiercross. In the men's skiercross, the Canadians won a sweep of the medals, led by Chris Del Bosco. This was a first sweep of a Winter X Games medal round by a country other than the United States. With the men's sweep, along with Ashleigh McIvor and Kelsey Serwa's silver a bronze respectively, the Canadians won 5 out of 6 possible medals in ski cross.\nSchedule.\nAll times listed are Mountain Standard Time (MST).\nResults.\nMen's Snowmobile.\nKnock Out Results.\nThis was a five-round contest in which the contestant with the shortest distance in each round was eliminated. The number listed represents the distance (in inches) of the best jump in given round."

Texas Tech has played its home games at United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas since its opening in 1999.\nTexas Tech (then known as Texas Technological College) fielded its first intercollegiate men's basketball team during the 1925–26 season. The school's athletics teams were known as the \"Matadors\" from 1925 to 1936, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. In 1932, Texas Tech was admitted to the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, also known as the Border Conference. In the team's first season of conference play, Texas Tech went undefeated, winning the first of three consecutive Border Conference championships. At the beginning of the 1937–38 season, Texas Tech's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially with \"Red Raiders\", the nickname the team has today. Texas Tech received their first postseason bid in 1942 to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) tournament. Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won five conference championships and one co-championship.\nIn 1957, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference (SWC), in which it experienced similar success as it had in the Border Conference. In the regular season, the Red Raiders won four conference championships and three conference co-championships. At the end of the 1976 regular season, the Southwest Conference began an annual conference tournament known as the SWC Classic. Texas Tech won five SWC Classic titles in their six appearances in the conference tournament championship game. The university remained in the SWC until the conference ceased operations in 1996, when the Red Raiders ended the 1995–96 season ranked #8 in both the AP (Associated Press) Poll and Coaches' Poll. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the university became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. Since joining the Big 12 Conference, the Red Raiders did not receive a bid to postseason play until 2002, when Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight was hired. During Knight's six-year tenure, Texas Tech received five postseason bids, participating in four NCAA tournaments and one National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The Red Raiders won the third place playoff in the 2003 NIT tournament, the farthest a Red Raiders basketball team has advanced in postseason play before Chris Beard lead the team to 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game.\nSeasons.\n "

In 2000, the Austrians defeated Slovenia 6–2 to advance out of Pool C and into Division I for the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Austria finally qualified for the top level for 2004, by defeating Norway 6–4 in their final contest. Austria however was relegated back to Division I for 2005. The team has been unable to maintain a steady presence as part of the Top Division, their most recent appearance being in 2010. They have not won a game at the top level in four appearances, but did tie Ukraine in 2004."

        "text": "The 2011 Tour de France was the 98th edition of the race. It started on 2 July at the Passage du Gois and ended on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 24 July. The cyclists competed in 21 stages over 23 days, covering a distance of . The route entered Italy for part of two stages. The emphasis of the route was on the Alps, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the mountain range first being visited in the Tour. Cadel Evans of the won the overall general classification. Andy Schleck of was second, with his brother and teammate Fränk third.\nThe general classification leader's yellow jersey was worn first by Philippe Gilbert of , who won the opening stage. In the following stage, 's victory in the team time trial put their rider Thor Hushovd into the overall lead. He held the yellow jersey until the end of the ninth stage when it was taken by Thomas Voeckler (), who went on to hold it throughout the stages in the Pyrenees and up until the end of the final Alpine stage. Andy Schleck, who had won the previous stage (the 18th), held it for the following individual time trial; Evans took enough time in this stage to take the yellow jersey. He then held the lead into the finish in Paris.\nThe race saw Yohann Gène become the first black rider in the history of the Tour. Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour, and the second non-European to have officially done so. At 34, he was also the oldest post-World War II winner being almost a year older than Joop Zoetemelk was when he won the 1980 edition. 's Mark Cavendish was the first British winner of the points classification, Samuel Sánchez () won the mountains classification and Pierre Rolland of won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by and the overall super-combativity award was given to Jérémy Roy ().\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams participated in the 2011 edition of the Tour de France. The race was the 17th of the 27 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its eighteen UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 19 January 2011, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, all of which were French-based. One team, the Spanish-based , which included the third-placed rider in the 2010 Tour, Denis Menchov, and the 2008 Tour winner, Carlos Sastre, was overlooked. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place in front of audience of 7,000 inside the Roman amphitheatre at the Puy du Fou theme park in Les Epesses, Vendée, on 30 June, two days before the opening stage.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 198 riders. Of these, 49 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from 30 countries; France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and United States all had 12 or more riders in the race. Riders from ten countries won stages during the race; British riders won the largest number of stages, with five. The average age of riders in the race was 29.38 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Anthony Delaplace () to the 39-year-old Jens Voigt (). Of the total average ages, was the youngest team and the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nIn the lead-up to the Tour, Alberto Contador (), winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours, was widely considered as the top pre-race favourite for the general classification. His closest rivals were thought to be Andy Schleck () and Cadel Evans (). The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Bradley Wiggins (), Ivan Basso (), Robert Gesink (), Samuel Sánchez (), Chris Horner (), Fränk Schleck () and Jurgen Van den Broeck ().\nIn September 2010, Contador announced that he had tested positive for the banned clenbuterol from a sample taken during his now-disqualified 2010 Tour victory. He was suspended from racing during an investigation until February 2011. When cleared to race he competed in and won the general classifications of the Vuelta a Murcia, Volta a Catalunya and Giro d'Italia before the Tour. With overall victory in the Tour he was aiming to complete the Giro-Tour double, last achieved by Marco Pantani in the 1998 Tour. Schleck had placed second to Contador in the previous two Tours and won the young rider classification in the previous three. In the lead up to the Tour his best results were third in the one-day race Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the mountains classification of the Tour de Suisse. Evans, podium finisher in the 2007 and 2008 Tours, had a successful season before the Tour, winning the general classifications of both the Tour de Romandie and Tirreno–Adriatico, as well as second place in the Critérium du Dauphiné.\nThe sprinters named as the \"riders to watch\" by \"Bicycling\" magazine and possible contenders for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Mark Cavendish (), Philippe Gilbert () and riders Tyler Farrar and Thor Hushovd. Former winners of the points classification and notable sprinters included in the startlist were the defending champion, Alessandro Petacchi (), and the winner in 2007, Tom Boonen (). The points classification winner of the 2002, 2004 and 2006 Tours, 39-year-old Robbie McEwen, was not selected by his team for the race, . Óscar Freire of was another former winner (2008) left out of his team's Tour squad.\nCavendish was runner-up in the 2010 Tour's points classification and had won 15 stages in the three previous Tours; he had won a stage at the Tour of Oman, the one-day race Scheldeprijs and two stages at the Giro during the 2011 season prior to the Tour. Gilbert had amassed a total of eleven wins (not including the national championships) for the season before the Tour, including three spring classics: Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne. Farrar's form in the lead-up to the Tour included a stage win in both Tirreno–Adriatico and the Ster ZLM Toer. Hushovd, the world road race champion, only had one win in the season before the Tour, a stage of the Tour de Suisse. Petacchi's best results prior the Tour were a trio of stages in the Giro, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of Turkey. The major victory of Boonen's season up to the Tour was the Gent–Wevelgem one-day race.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 26 January 2010, the race director, Christian Prudhomme, announced that the department of Vendée would host the 2011 edition's opening stage (known as the \"Grand Départ\"). It was the fifth time Vendée had hosted the \"Grand Départ\", which consisted of two stages. The entire route was announced by the ASO on 19 October 2010 at the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The route was thought to suit climbing specialists, with Prudhomme saying \"We wanted a balanced route. We tried to keep the suspense for the Alps but also to have a big battle as early as the Pyrenees,\". To celebrate the centenary of the introduction of the Alps into the Tour it featured two of its most famous climbs, the Col du Galibier and Alpe d'Huez, with the Galibier climbed twice.\nThe first of the two stages held in Vendée started in Passage du Gois and finished in Mont des Alouettes, whilst stage two was held in Les Essarts. The Tour left Vendée in Olonne-sur-Mer and headed north to Redon for the finish of the third stage. The following two stages took place in the region of Brittany. Stage six left the region to the finish in Lisieux. Stages seven and eight took the race through the middle of the country from Le Mans to the Super Besse resort in the elevated region Massif Central, which hosted stage nine. The following two stages headed south through the lower slopes, and stage twelve took the race into the Pyrenees. The mountain range hosted the next two stages. The fifteenth stage took place between Limoux and Montpellier. Stage sixteen took the route into the Alps. The next two stages took the race into Italy, with Pinerolo hosting between them. Stage nineteen was the last in the Alps, before the twentieth, which was held in the foothills around Grenoble. A long transfer took the Tour to its conclusion in Paris with the Champs-Élysées stage.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 2010 Tour. For only the second time since the 1967 Tour, the race started with a mass-start stage instead of a prologue (an individual time trial under ), the last occasion being in 2008. The longest mass-start stage was the seventh at , and stage 21 was the shortest at . The race featured only of time trialling, with stage two's team time trial and stage twenty's individual time trial. Of the remaining stages, ten were officially classified as flat, three as medium mountain and six as high mountain. There were four summit finishes: stage 12, to Luz Ardiden; stage 14, to Plateau de Beille; stage 18, to Col du Galibier; and stage 19, to Alpe d'Huez. It was the first time a stage had finished on the -high Galibier. It was the highest summit finish in Tour history, beating the finish of the -high Col du Granon during the 1986 Tour. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Col Agnel mountain pass on stage 18. It was among nine \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. There were fifteen new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, at the Le Lioran mountain resort, and after 15, in the department of Drôme.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" and Massif Central.\nThe opening stage's uphill finish of Mont des Alouettes was won by Philippe Gilbert, who took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. He also led the points and mountains classifications. were the fastest in the team time trial on the second stage, four seconds ahead of second-placed . This put Garmin's Thor Hushovd, who was third in stage one, into the yellow jersey. Tyler Farrar won the third stage from a bunch finish. José Joaquín Rojas of , third on the stage, took points classification's green jersey. The following day, a five-rider breakaway group had led the stage after , before the peloton caught on them at the foot of the Mûr-de-Bretagne climb. After a series of attacks, a group of nine riders moved clear, and Cadel Evans won the subsequent sprint finish. Evans took the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification. Mark Cavendish won stage five from a bunch sprint, with second-placed Gilbert taking the green jersey. The sixth stage was won by 's Edvald Boasson Hagen, who won the hilly bunch sprint in Lisieux. Johnny Hoogerland () took the polka dot jersey.\nCavendish won the stage seven's bunch sprint finish. Rojas regained the green jersey. A crash around from the end of the stage forced general classification contender Bradley Wiggins out of the race with a clavicle fracture. Another overall contender involved in the crash was Chris Horner; he finished the stage, but did not start stage eight due to concussion, a nasal fracture and a hematoma to his calf. The eighth stage was the first at altitude, and saw the breakaway's only survivor, Rui Costa (), win atop Super Besse, with a twelve-second margin. Gilbert led the points classification and Tejay van Garderen () the mountains classification. In the ninth stage, there was controversy when Nicki Sørensen of was struck by a motorbike carrying a photographer, and Hoogerland and Juan Antonio Flecha () were injured after an incident with a television car. Prior to the crash, both riders had formed a five-rider breakaway; the remaining three held on to finish in front of the chasing peloton. Luis León Sánchez () won the stage, with second-placed Thomas Voeckler () gaining the overall race lead. Jurgen Van den Broeck, a general classification contender, left the race due to a clavicle fracture caused by a crash. Hoogerland took back the polka. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour. Stages ten and eleven ended with a bunch sprints, with the victors André Greipel and Cavendish, respectively. The latter took the lead of the points classification.\nPyrenees and transition.\nStage twelve was the first to enter the high mountains, and included two climbs that were rated \"hors catégorie\", the La Hourquette d'Ancizan and the climb to the finish at Luz Ardiden. An early breakaway of six riders were caught and passed in the final by Jelle Vanendert () and Samuel Sánchez). They held off the chasing group that included the main general classification contenders and a late attack by Fränk Schleck, with Samuel Sánchez crossing the finish line first. Of the general classification favourites, Contador lost the most time in the stage, 33 seconds down on third-placed Fränk Schleck (the highest placed overall contender). The mountains classification points Samuel Sánchez received at the summit finish put him in the polka dot jersey. In the thirteenth stage, a three-rider breakaway went clear over the \"hors catégorie\"-rated Col d'Aubisque, and after the long descent to Lourdes, they finished with a margin of five minutes; Hushovd took the stage win. Jérémy Roy (), who was one of the three, took the polka. The fourteenth stage was last in the Pyrenees and it included six categorised climbs. As the race reached the \"hors catégorie\" climb to Plateau de Beille and the finish, the main group of overall favourites took control, and with to go, Vanendert attacked and won with a margin of 21 seconds. His win put Vanendert in the polka.\nThe transitional stage fifteen that moved the race east to the Alps was won by Cavendish from a bunch sprint. The next day was the second rest day. Hushovd won his second stage of the Tour with the sixteenth; he formed part of the three-rider breakaway that escaped with to go. On the descent of the final climb – the Col de Manse – Evans attacked and at the finish had gained time on his rivals, displacing Fränk Schleck and moving up one place to second overall.\nAlps and finale.\nAnother descent to the finish followed in stage sixteen, and again the winner came from a breakaway. Boasson Hagen was the victor, improving on his second place the previous day. Overall race leader Voeckler lost 27 seconds to his rivals after he went wide on two of the final descent's corners. The Tour's queen stage, the eighteenth, included three \"hors catégorie\" climbs, including the Col du Galibier summit finish. With to go, Andy Schleck launched a solo attack on the second climb, the Col d'Izoard. He went on to bridge across and pass a large breakaway, before claiming the stage win; he moved up to second overall, gaining over two minutes on his rivals. Voeckler's lead in the yellow jersey was reduced to fifteen seconds. The autobus (the large group behind the leading peloton) of 88 riders finished outside the time limit, 35 min 50 s after Schleck; all riders were allowed to stay in the race due to the large number. The points classification leader, Cavendish, who was in the group, was docked 20 points.\nThe race for the general classification began from the start of the nineteenth stage, the Tour's final mountain stage, with Voeckler, the Schleck brothers and Evans all in a second breakaway. Andy Schleck was then part of a group that crossed the second of the stage's three large climbs, the Galibier, in pursuit of the leading group. The head of the race came together on the long descent to foot of the climb and the finish at Alpe d'Huez, with the exception of Ryder Hesjedal () and Pierre Rolland (), who had a 47-second lead. The latter won the stage, counter-attacking a solo move by Contador. Voeckler lost the lead of the general classification, dropping to fourth overall, behind the Schleck brothers and Evans, who all came in with an elite group a minute after the winner. The top three positions of the general classification were Andy Schleck, Fränk Schleck (53 seconds down) and Evans (57 seconds down). Samuel Sánchez, second in the stage, took the lead of the mountains classification. The penultimate stage, the individual time trial in Grenoble, was decisive in the outcome of the general classification, with Evans placing second and beating Andy Schleck by two and a half minutes to lead the Tour. Tony Martin of won the stage, seven seconds ahead of Evans.\nIn the final stage, Cavendish secured a record third successive victory on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, his fifth stage win of the 2011 Tour. Evans finished the race to become the first Australian rider to win the Tour de France, and at 34, the oldest post-World War II winner. The Schleck brothers placed second and third, Andy 1 min 34 s down and Fränk 2 min 30 s down. Cavendish won the points classification with a total of 334, 62 ahead of Rojas in second, becoming the first British rider to claim the green jersey. The mountains classification was won by Samuel Sánchez, who had a win and two second places on the four mountain-top finishes. Andy Schleck finished second in that category, with Vanendert third. Rolland, tenth in the general classification, won the young rider classification, largely by virtue of positions he attained in supporting his team leader, Voeckler, during the time he held the yellow jersey. finished as the winners of the team classification, eleven minutes ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 169 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nDoping.\nDuring the Tour's first rest day, it was announced that Alexandr Kolobnev's () urine sample taken after the fifth stage had tested positive for the diuretic medication hydrochlorothiazide. Although it was listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as prohibited, cycling's governing body, \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI), only released a statement advising his team \"take the necessary steps to enable the Tour de France to continue in serenity...\". He withdrew from the race immediately. On 1 March 2012, CAS decided that Kolobnev would only receive a warning for this, and no suspension, because his use of the drug was justified by 'medical reasons unrelated to performance'.\nOn 6 February 2012, CAS removed Alberto Contador's results due to his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour. The UCI subsequently revised the final general classification, with riders ranked between 6 and 21 upgraded, and the 21st position left unattributed. On 18 October 2012, the UCI announced that a disciplinary procedure against Carlos Barredo () was taken following anomalies in his biological passport. He retired from cycling in December 2012. In July 2014, his results were disqualified from races in which he participated between 26 October 2007 and 24 September 2011, with his 35th position on the 2011 Tour's general classification left vacant.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2011 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. In the 2010 Tour, stages classified flat had three intermediate sprint points worth 6, 4, and 2 points to the first three riders across the line. For 2011, flat stages had just one intermediate sprint which was worth 20 points to the rider in first position, and the first 15 score points. The intention was to have riders needing to sprint twice during the day to score well. Points awarded at the finish of flat stages also increased, from 35 points for the winner to 45. Medium mountain stages awarded 30 points to the winner, high mountain stages and the individual time trial gave 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage two. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any \"hors catégorie\", first-, or second-category climb awarded double points if it was the last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to be a general classification contender than in years past. This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1986. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage, excluding the team time trial; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Jérémy Roy won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €3,412,546 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders got €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. Team prizes were available, with €10,000 for the winner of team time trial and €50,000 for the winners of the team classification. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier in stage eighteen, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage twelve.

        "text": "The Men's Individual Road Race of the 2010 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on 3 October in Melbourne and concluded in Geelong, Australia. Thor Hushovd claimed the World Championship in a sprint finish, to become the first Norwegian to win the World Championship road race.\nRoute.\nThe race started at Federation Square at Melbourne. For the first time, the World Championship route started and finished in different locations, with the riders traveling to Geelong before entering the finishing circuit. The route followed the West Gate Freeway and Princes Freeway, passing the Werribee River. Exiting at Bulban Road, the riders passed the You Yangs Regional Park, continued via Bacchus Marsh Road, then entered the Geelong circuit at Bell Parade. There were eleven laps around a 15.9 kilometre course through the Geelong suburbs, including South Geelong, Belmont, Highton, Queens Park, Newtown and Geelong West. The profile included two steep climbs, the first between 5 and 7 kilometres, the second between 9 and 11. The finish had a moderate uphill gradient.\nCircuit practice, training and racing took place in Geelong from Thursday 23 September to Sunday 3 October.\nRace Report.\nThe early breakaway consisted of 5 riders and was given a lead of up to 23 minutes by the peloton. In the break were Oleksandr Kvachuk, Mohammed Said Elammoury, Jackson Rodríguez, Diego Tamayo and Matt Brammeier. In between the break and the peloton rode Esad Hasanovic, who was chasing the lead group for several kilometres. He rode around 5 to 6 minutes behind them for some time. The breakaway almost lapped the peloton on the closing circuits, but the American and Belgian teams would increase the pace of the peloton and the gap began to fall. Elammoury was dropped by the other four with about 10 laps to go.\nKvachuk dropped Brammeier, Tamayo, and Rodriguez but by the end of the seventh lap the gap had fallen to about 5 minutes. Somewhat like the previous year's race, a large escape group went away, this time with 5 laps to go. The group contained 31 riders, including the previous year's champion Cadel Evans, his teammates Stuart O'Grady and Simon Gerrans, Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway, Belgian Philippe Gilbert, Dane Matti Breschel and 5 Italians including Vincenzo Nibali and Filippo Pozzato. The group survived until lap nine although the peloton, led on by Spain, never let them get much of a gap. On the ninth lap Nibali attacked which decimated the breakaway and the peloton behind. Evans, Gilbert, and Pozzato were chasing behind at the end of the 9th lap, with the peloton 49 seconds behind Nibali. However, the peloton kept the pressure high and had pulled back all the attackers, including the early breakaway at the beginning of the last lap.\nOn the final ascent of the Montpelier climb, Gilbert made an attack and Evans immediately tried to jump into his slipstream. However, Gilbert got away from Evans, who was absorbed by a chase group containing Paul Martens of Germany, Alexander Kolobnev of Russia, Koos Moerenhout of The Netherlands, and Fränk Schleck of Luxembourg. The group was not well organized and was brought back by the remnants of the peloton and Gilbert was also caught with 2 kilometers to go.\nRussian Vladimir Gusev and Slovenian Janez Brajkovič attacked just before the 1 kilometer to go banner and were joined by Dutchman Niki Terpstra. Terpstra attacked with about 800 meters to go as the Danes tried to set up a sprint for Breschel. However, as soon as Terpstra was caught Belgian Greg Van Avermaet launched the sprint. Breschel passed Van Avermaet on the left-hand side but Thor Hushovd of Norway passed Breschel and held on to the finish line for the victory. Breschel would settle for 2nd while Allan Davis of Australia passed Van Avermaet for the bronze medal.\nNational qualification.\nNations in the top ten places of the UCI World Ranking on 15 August were permitted up to nine riders, although they were not permitted more than six unless they had at least seven riders in the rankings on that date. This happened to Kazakhstan, and as a result, one additional spot was awarded to Luxembourg, Slovenia and France (10th to 12 respectively in the rankings), although this concession had not been in the original documentation describing the allocation of places.\n27 other qualifying nations were permitted no more than six riders. After allowing for the top ten in the world rankings, the continental rankings are to be used to identify sixteen further European nations, two countries from the UCI Africa Tour, five from the Americas, three Asian countries, and one representative of the Oceania tour.\nRiders on teams that are members of a UCI ProTeam, but whose nation did not qualify, were eligible for additional places.\nFinal classification.\nRiders who did not finish.\n79 riders failed to finish the race."

The Atlanta Open was known as the \"Atlanta Tennis Championships\" for its first two years before signing BB&amp;T as a title sponsor in 2012. In 2015, the tournament was acquired by GF Sports from its then-owners, the USTA.\nHistory.\nIn 2009, the Association of Tennis Professionals purchased the license for the tournament in Indianapolis because of low ticket sales and a struggle to attract top players. In December 2009 it was announced that the ATP had sold the license to a group in Atlanta, Georgia, where it would be held at the Atlanta Athletic Club. Prior to 2010 Atlanta had previously held a tennis tournament known as the Verizon Tennis Challenge from 1992 to 2001. That tournament, also held at the Atlanta Athletic Club, included Andy Roddick, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and John McEnroe among its past champions.\nIn 2011 the tournament moved to the Racquet Club of the South in suburban Atlanta. In 2012, the tournament gained BB&amp;T as title sponsor and changed its name to the BB&amp;T Atlanta Open. The 2012 and later editions have been held in Atlantic Station in midtown Atlanta. Temporary courts are constructed around the retail and residential area's central park. The main court has a capacity of 4,000 people. In 2015, the tournament was acquired from the USTA by GF Sports.\nFor its first six years, the Atlanta Open singles was dominated by Americans. Mardy Fish, Andy Roddick, and John Isner were the only men to win the event before Australian Nick Kyrgios defeated Isner in the 2016 final. Isner, a former Georgia Bulldog and local favorite, owns the tournament records for most finals (9) and most titles (6).\nEddie Gonzalez served as Atlanta Open Tournament Director from 2014-2022."

The series began on 14 May in Doha, Qatar and ended on 27 August in Brussels, Belgium.\nSuperseding the European-centred IAAF Golden League, the Diamond League was the IAAF's first intercontinental series of one-day track and field meetings. Expanding upon the idea of the former Golden League jackpot, there were 32 separate \"Diamond Races\", involving 16 men's and 16 women's track and field events – each of the events featured seven times only over the course of the fourteen meetings of the 2010 Diamond League, and the best athlete in each event won a \"Diamond Trophy\". League winners were decided via a points system, with four points going to the winner, two to the runner-up, and one to the third place finisher, with points doubled at the final two meetings in Brussels and Zurich. The total available prize money for the series was US$6.63 million.\nFor infrastructure reasons the men's and women's hammer throw events were not included in the IAAF Diamond League. For this reason the IAAF created a Hammer Throw challenge.\nFor the first time, some of the world's foremost track and field athletes were centrally contracted to an athletics meeting series. For the 2010 series the contracted athletes – called Diamond League Ambassadors – included figures such as Usain Bolt, Kenenisa Bekele, Yelena Isinbayeva and Blanka Vlašić.\nPrior to the series, former World Champion Steve Cram stated that he believed that, through greater television exposure, and mutual responsibility between the IAAF and promoters, the 2010 Diamond League would raise the profile of the sport of athletics.\nAmbassadors.\nA total of fourteen athletes were given Diamond League Ambassador status, with the intention of bringing attention to some of the sport's foremost competitors.

The first five teams in the league were the San Jose Spitfire, San Francisco Bay Sox, Long Beach Aces, Phoenix Peppers and Los Angeles Legends.\n1997 Season.\nIn the 1997 season, the league consisted of five teams: the San Jose Spitfire, San Francisco Bay Sox, Long Beach Aces, Phoenix Peppers and Los Angeles Legends. In the league's championship the San Jose Spitfires defeated the Los Angeles Legends. Janelle T. Frese of the Los Angeles Legends won the Ladies League Baseball \"Most Outstanding Pitcher\" award for the 1997 season.\nIn 1997 the Long Beach Aces played at Blair Field in Long Beach, California, the home of the Long Beach State University baseball program.

Barbara played at Long Beach State and was a Dirtbag assistant coach, later becoming the head recruiter and hitting coach at Sacramento State.\nThe Aces were also coached by Joe Magno, who assumed the role of Aces bench coach. Magno was a scout with the Cincinnati Reds and later became a minor league bench coach for the Western Baseball League champion Long Beach Breakers in 2001.

        "title": "Michael Swift (rugby union)",
        "text": "Michael Swift (born 18 October 1977) is an English former rugby union player. Swift played rugby professionally for 17 years and spent most of his career with Irish provincial team Connacht. He retired from playing in 2015. Though he originally played both as a flanker and a lock, Swift played almost exclusively in the second row later in his career.\nAt the time of his retirement Swift was the most-capped Connacht player of all time and held the record for appearances in the Celtic League/Pro12. These records were later broken by his long-time Connacht teammate John Muldoon.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nRichmond.\nSwift started playing rugby in 1989, while a pupil at the London Oratory School. He represented Middlesex and England U16s during his time at school. His first professional club was Richmond, which he joined at 19 while attending Loughborough University. He primarily played as a flanker. Swift did not feature for the team in the 1997–98 Premiership, but made two appearances in the 1997–98 European Challenge Cup. In the 1998–99 Premiership, Swift made six appearances for the team, four of these coming as starts.\nThe club had been bought by financial markets trader and Monaco tax exile Ashley Levett, who turned the club into one of the first professional rugby union teams in England. Levitt bought in big names to push the club up the leagues, such as Ben Clarke from Bath Rugby, the first £1 million signing. Despite the crowds and revenues from competition, Levett was continually financing the team, and he eventually put the club in administration in March 1999. The professional side of Richmond was eventually merged into London Irish, but during the period of uncertainty following the onset of administration, a number of players left the club.\nLeeds Tykes.\nFollowing the administration of Richmond, Swift joined another English team, this time Leeds Tykes. Swift featured for Leeds in the 1999–2000 Second Division as the Tykes finished second to Rotherham by a margin of four points, missing out on promotion. Swift also played for the team in that season's Tetley's Bitter Cup, scoring two tries in two games.\nConnacht.\nEarly seasons (2000–2003).\nSwift was recruited by his former coach at Richmond, John Kingston, to join the Connacht-based club Galwegians in June 2000. He made his first appearance for the Connacht provincial team against Ulster in the same year, while still playing for Galwegians in the All-Ireland League. Swift also played for Connacht in the 2000–01 European Challenge Cup, making his European debut for the province on 7 October 2000 as a replacement against Béziers at home, before starting in both the return match on 13 January 2001 and the game against Neath the following week.\nThe following season saw the foundation of a new domestic league for Connacht, with teams from Scotland and Wales uniting with the Irish provinces to create the Celtic League. The competition featured 16 teams, split into two pools of eight, with teams from the top half of each pool advancing to the knockout rounds. In the inaugural Celtic League, Swift made four appearances, all of them coming as starts, as Connacht finished second to Irish rivals Munster in Pool B, before losing to Glasgow in the quarter-finals. In the 2001–02 Challenge Cup, Swift played three games, featuring as a replacement against Sale Sharks, before starting against Rugby Roma and Narbonne.\nIn the 2002–03 Celtic League, Swift made six appearances before Connacht were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Munster, all but one of these appearances coming as starts. In the 2002–03 Challenge Cup, Swift played in four of the team's six games, starting in three of them, as Connacht reached the quarter-finals, playing both legs in the ties against Narbonne and Pontypridd.\nUnder Michael Bradley (2003–2010).\nThe 2003–04 season saw Connacht appoint a new coach, with Michael Bradley taking charge of the side. That year's Celtic League saw a change in the competition's format. Following the formation of regional rugby teams in Wales, the competition was organised as a round-robin league, with each team playing the other once at home and once away. Under this new 22-game structure, Swift featured 17 times for Connacht, starting on all but two of these occasions, as the province finished ninth. In Europe, however, Connacht experienced their greatest level of success in professional competition, reaching the last four of the 2003–04 Challenge Cup. The team beat Béziers and Pau on aggregate, before beating Narbonne in both legs in the quarter-finals. Swift started in all six of these games, and scored a try in the first leg of the tie against Pau. Swift also started both legs of the semi-final against Harlequins, as Connacht came within touching distance of the final, only for a Will Greenwood try, 12 minutes from time in the second leg to cost them their place in the decider, which Harlequins went on to win.\nThe 2004–05 season saw the team slip further in the league, but maintain their strong European form. Swift played 14 of 20 games in the 2004–05 Celtic League as it was reduced to an 11 team competition. He also scored one try in the league as Connacht finished one place from the bottom of the table. In the 2004–05 Challenge Cup, Connacht again reached the semi-finals, overcoming Narbonne, Montpellier and Grenoble in the process. Swift again featured in all of the games. In the semi-finals, however, Connacht were again knocked out by the eventual champions, this time Sale Sharks.\nThe next season saw Swift continue to be a regular player in European competition, but feature less prominently in the league. He made 15 appearances in the 2005–06 Celtic League, but over half of these came as a replacement. Connacht finished the season level on points with last-placed Glasgow Warriors. Meanwhile, the 2005–06 Challenge Cup saw change's to the competition structure, with the addition of pool stages followed by single-leg knockout games. Connacht finished second in their group to Worcester Warriors, with Swift featuring in four of the team's six games. This was enough to see the team through to the quarter-finals, where they faced Newcastle Falcons. Swift was used as a replacement against Newcastle, but he was sin-binned during the match as Connacht crashed out.\nIn the 2006–07 Celtic League Swift featured in 14 of the team's 20 games, starting in four of them as Connacht finished above only Border Reivers, a team that was disbanded at the end of the season. Swift also played in four 2006–07 European Challenge Cup matches. He started in each of these games, playing Montpellier twice, before facing Bath and Harlequins, but couldn't prevent Connacht being eliminated at the pool stages. The game against Montpellier was Swift's hundredth appearance for Connacht, making the fifth player to reach the milestone for the province. With the number of competing teams reduced to ten for the 2007–08 Celtic League Swift featured in 12 games for the province, starting all but two of these, as Connacht finished bottom of the table. Swift also started in all six of Connacht's 2007–08 Challenge Cup games, playing at home and away against Brive, El Salvador and Newcastle Falcons, scoring a try against El Salvador. Connacht finished third in the group and were eliminated.\nSwift made eight starts, along with six appearances as a replacement in the 2008–09 Celtic League, as Connacht continued to struggle domestically. The team finished in last place, 13 points adrift of Newport Gwent Dragons in ninth. Connacht's European form improved, however. Grouped with London Irish, Dax and Rovigo in the 2008–09 Challenge Cup, the team finished second in their pool. Swift played in each of these pool games, before featuring in the quarter-final against Northampton Saints. Connacht were ultimately beaten 42–13 by the Saints.\nThe 2009–10 season was Bradley's last in charge of the side, and he announced his attention to leave the province early in the season. Swift made 12 appearances in the 2009–10 Celtic League, starting in nine of these games and scoring a try. Connacht again finished in last place. In the 2009–10 Challenge Cup, Swift played in all of Connacht's group games, starting in four and coming on as a replacement in the other two. He also scored two tries against Olympus Madrid. Connacht won all of their group games to enter the knock-out as top seeds. Swift started in the province's quarter-final win over Bourgoin, scoring a crucial try in a three-point victory. In the semi-final Connacht faced a Toulon side featuring Jonny Wilkinson, and were beaten by a score of 12–19. In December 2009, Swift became the most capped Connacht player of all time, overtaking Eric Elwood with 169 appearances.\nEric Elwood as coach (2010–2013).\nThe 2010–11 season saw Swift's former teammate Eric Elwood take over as coach, replacing the outgoing Bradley. The 2010–11 Celtic League saw two teams from Italy introduced to the competition, bringing the number of teams back up to twelve. Swift started 19 games and scored a try as Elwood set about improving the team's league form. Connacht finished the season above both Italian teams and Glasgow Warriors in ninth place. As Elwood helped the team climb up the domestic league, they did not fare as well in the 2010–11 Challenge Cup as the previous season. Swift featured in all six games, starting five of them, as Connacht were knocked out in the pool stages, finishing second in their group to the eventual winners of the tournament, Harlequins.\nThe 2011–12 season saw changes for Connacht both domestically and in Europe. Connacht competed at the highest level of European club rugby, qualifying for the Heineken Cup for the first time. This was due to Leinster winning the 2011 Heineken Cup Final. Competition rules introduced in the 2010–11 season, granted the winners of both the Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup an automatic berth in the following year's Heineken Cup. As Leinster had qualified through performance in the 2010–11 Celtic League, this place was passed on to another team from the same country, with Connacht the beneficiaries. Domestically, the Celtic League was renamed, becoming the Pro12, due to the previous season's introduction of Italian teams.\nEarly in the season, Swift reached another milestone in becoming the first player to make 200 appearances for Connacht, when he played against Edinburgh on 16 September 2011. He made a total of 18 appearances in the 2011–12 Pro12, starting each of the games as Connacht finished eighth. On 2 March 2012, Swift became the most capped player in the history of the Pro12/Celtic League, playing in his 140th game in the competition. Swift made his first appearance at the very top level of European club rugby on 11 November 2011, when he started against Harlequins in the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, a game which Connacht lost 25–17. He also started against Toulouse both home and away, but did not feature in either of the games against Bath, with Connacht losing on each occasion. Swift started against on 20 January 2012, however, with Connacht managing an upset, beating Harlequins 9–8 in the Sportsground, preventing the Premiership club from topping the group, and knocking them down into the Challenge Cup.\nAhead of the 2012–13 season, Swift was given the honorary role of Club Captain by the province in recognition of his service, with teammate Gavin Duffy continuing as captain on the field. Swift made 19 appearances in the 2012–13 Pro12, with just two of these coming as a replacement. Connacht finished the season in the same position as the year before, coming in eighth. At European level, Connacht played in the Heineken Cup again in the 2012–13 season, because of Leinster's second Heineken Cup win in a row the year before. The team won three of their pool matches, with the victories coming in the home and away ties with Italian side Zebre, along with a victory at home over 2009–10 finalists and 2011–12 Challenge Cup winners Biarritz. Swift started four of the team's six games, but missed both games against Biarritz. Elwood had announced his intention to leave his post in October 2012, and departed at the end of the season.\nFinal seasons (2013–2015).\nSwift signed a contract with Connacht for the 2013–14 season, taking his service at the province up to May 2014. Ahead of his fourteenth season with the province, Swift was named one of the team's joint captains, and started out the season sharing the captaincy with both Gavin Duffy and John Muldoon. After a poor run of form culminating in a 43–10 defeat against Edinburgh, Craig Clarke was made Connacht's team captain with Swift and the others continuing to \"lead off the field.\" Swift made 18 appearances in the 2013–14 Pro12, with half of these coming as starts. He also scored tries against Edinburgh and Newport Gwent Dragons, as Connacht ultimately finished tenth. With Leinster having won the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup, Connacht competed in the Heineken Cup again in the 2013–14 season. Swift started for and captained Connacht in the first two games against Saracens and Zebre, and came on as a replacement in a famous away victory over Toulouse. Swift did not feature in the return match against Toulouse, but came on as a replacement in the second match against Zebre, before starting the final group game against Saracens.\nIn April 2014, Swift signed another new contract with Connacht. The one-year deal ran until summer 2015, taking Swift's service with Connacht into its fifteenth season. Swift made his first appearance of the season on 26 September 2014 against Glasgow Warriors in the league, and featured in three 2014–15 Rugby Challenge Cup games, but Swift more often featured for the Connacht Eagles during the course of the year. In February 2015, while recovering from a leg fracture, Swift announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He made his 269th and final Connacht appearance against Ospreys on 16 May 2015, when he came on as a replacement for Eoin McKeon after 65 minutes."

        "text": "Edward Scott Sr. (October 17, 1917 – January 11, 2010) was an American baseball scout. Before he became the first African-American scout in the history of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball, Scott was a talent-spotter for the Negro leagues, and he signed Henry Aaron, the Baseball Hall of Famer and future home run king, to Aaron's first professional contract for the Indianapolis Clowns.\nEarly life.\nScott was born in Dade City, Florida, but moved to Mobile, Alabama, as a young man, where he played baseball for a local, semi-professional African-American team, the Mobile Black Shippers. He worked in a paper company and barnstormed the area with his baseball team. When his playing days ended, he started scouting. The baseball color line had been broken in minor league baseball in , and in MLB the following year, by Jackie Robinson. But the 16 Major League teams were slow to integrate and the Negro Leagues were still operating when Scott's scouting career began.\nHank Aaron signing.\nAccording to Ed Scott Jr., his father discovered the teenaged Aaron playing in a Mobile softball game. \"If that boy can hit a softball that far, how far can he hit a baseball?\" his son quoted Ed Sr. as saying. He was able to sign Aaron for the Indianapolis Clowns, and by , the 18-year-old player was offered a contract by the Boston Braves. Aaron would go on to play 23 big-league seasons, and shatter (in ) Babe Ruth's all-time record with 755 home runs over his career. (Aaron currently stands second, all time, to Barry Bonds.)\nRed Sox signings.\nScott spent four decades with the Red Sox as a scout, beginning in the early 1960s. Among the players he signed for Boston were George Scott (no relation), Oil Can Boyd and Amos Otis, who was drafted out of the Boston system as a minor-league prospect by the New York Mets. Ed Scott was still listed as a scouting consultant by the Red Sox in . His son Alex also was a Boston area scout based in Mobile during the 1990s.\nPersonal life and death.\nAlso an accomplished golfer, Scott was inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. He died in Mobile at age 92 on January 11, 2010."

        "title": "2013 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2013 Ashes series (known as the Investec 2013 Ashes Series for sponsorship reasons) was a series of Test cricket matches contested between England and Australia for the Ashes. It formed part of the 2013 Australian tour of England, which also included the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, five One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals.\nThe 2013 series was the first of two back-to-back Ashes series. With the intent of breaking the cycle of Ashes series being held directly before Cricket World Cups, the Ashes were brought forward in the schedule by one year, starting with the 2013–14 series in Australia.\nEngland won the series 3–0, with wins at Trent Bridge, Lord's and the Riverside Ground; the matches at Old Trafford and The Oval finished as draws. This was the first time since 1977 that Australia had not won a Test match in an Ashes series.\nVenues.\nThe five venues used in the series were Trent Bridge, Lord's, Old Trafford, the Riverside Ground and The Oval. There were questions as to whether Lord's would host an Ashes match – it would have been the first time since 1882 that Lord's had not hosted an Ashes Test – but the venues were eventually confirmed to include Lord's on 22 September 2011. On 1 June 2012, it was announced that the first Test was scheduled to take place at Trent Bridge.\nIt was the first Ashes series held in England since 1977 not to include a match at Edgbaston.\nSquads.\nThe Australia squad was announced on 24 April 2013. The squad included players for the entire Australian tour of England and Scotland, including the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the T20I series against England, and the ODI series against both England and Scotland. Among those selected were 35-year-old opening batsman Chris Rogers, five years after his only other Test cap, and uncapped all-rounder James Faulkner. Despite having played in nine of the last 10 Ashes Tests, seamer Mitchell Johnson was omitted from the squad, as was the highly rated, Pakistan-born leg spinner, Fawad Ahmed, who had not yet received his Australian passport.\nAll-rounder Steve Smith was added to the squad on 23 June after captain Michael Clarke suffered injury concerns, while left-arm orthodox spinner Ashton Agar was called up as back up for Nathan Lyon after taking six wickets for Australia A in three matches against Scotland, Ireland and Gloucestershire. Having been suspended until the start of the first Test for punching Joe Root on a night out during the Champions Trophy, opening batsman David Warner was sent on the Australia A tour of southern Africa to regain match experience; during the tour, which lasted from 18 to 27 July, Warner remained part of the Australian Ashes squad.\nThe England squad for the first Test was announced on 6 July 2013, the most notable absentee being batsman Nick Compton, who had opened the batting with captain Alastair Cook in each of the nine Tests since the retirement of former captain Andrew Strauss; Compton was replaced in the opening partnership by 22-year-old Joe Root. Middle-order batsman Kevin Pietersen and spinner Graeme Swann were included after overcoming injury troubles from earlier in the year, while Tim Bresnan, Steven Finn and Graham Onions were all selected as competition for the third seam bowling spot alongside James Anderson and Stuart Broad.\nAfter naming an unchanged squad for the first two Tests, England were forced into a change for the third Test after Pietersen suffered a calf injury on the third day at Lord's. After much speculation regarding his replacement, Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor was called up on the back of an unbeaten century against the Australians in a tour match against Sussex, for whom he was making a guest appearance. The England selectors also made the decision to allow Finn and Onions to return to their clubs, to be replaced by seamer Chris Tremlett and another spin option in Monty Panesar. Following the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street, Tim Bresnan was ruled out for the summer, so Simon Kerrigan and Chris Woakes were given surprise call-ups and would both go on to make their debuts in the fifth Test at The Oval.\n† Late addition to squad\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test was noted as a dramatic match with the advantage swinging between the two sides, culminating in a close result. England's opening innings of 215 all out was considered disappointing, however Australia seemed to be heading to a significant deficit after being reduced to 117/9 in the following innings. The record-breaking 10th-wicket stand revived the tourists to an unexpected 65-run lead by the end of the innings. England reclaimed the upper hand in the third innings, with Ian Bell's century contributing to a total of 375, setting Australia a target of 311 to win the Test. England looked to be in a strong position, as there had been only 10 recorded successful fourth-innings run chases of over 300 in Test history. However, Australia had a strong showing with the bat and were only 15 runs short of victory by the time the final partnership was broken in the afternoon session of the fifth day.\nSecond Test.\nIn comparison to the close first Test, the second match of the series was a much easier victory for England. Though losing their first three wickets for just 28 runs England managed 361 by the time their final wicket fell in the morning session on day two. Australia only managed a response of 128, their lowest total at Lord's since 1968, with the second innings ending before the end of the day's play. With a lead of over 200 runs, England captain Alastair Cook had the option of making the Australians follow-on, but elected not to. In the third innings, Australia managed to reduce England to 30/3, but from then on, England were dominant, with Joe Root scoring 180 in 338 balls and 466 minutes at the crease. Immediately following Root's dismissal early on the fourth day, Cook declared at 349/7. England managed to dismiss Australia before the end of the day's play, securing a 2–0 lead in the series.\nThird Test.\nEngland went into the third Test needing only a draw to retain the Ashes. In the opening innings the English bowlers were ineffective against the Australian batsmen, with captain Michael Clarke scoring 187 runs. Australia ended up batting for most of the first two days before declaring on 527/7. England's second innings batting response was slow, scoring 368 all out at an average run rate of just 2.63 runs per over. However England critically managed to avoid the follow-on and consumed much of the time remaining in the game; Australia began the third innings shortly before lunch on the fourth day. Australia quickly scored 172 runs at a run rate of 4.77 runs per over, and elected to declare overnight, hoping to bowl England out on the final day to win the game. However rain and poor light meant that only 20 overs were played. With the match declared a draw England retained the Ashes.\nFourth Test.\nHaving already at least drawn the series, England's first innings was slow with an average run rate of only 2.58 per over. England managed to hit 149/2 before succumbing to a run total of 238 early on the second day of the test. Australia's response was marginally better, with Chris Rogers hitting a century to contribute to his team's 270-run innings despite bad light. In the third innings, Australia were unable to prevent Ian Bell from securing his third century of the series by the close of the third day. England made 330 all-out, leaving a target of 299. In the fourth innings, England dismissed Australia for 224 by the end of the fourth day to secure an unassailable 3–0 lead in the series.\nFifth Test.\nAustralia started strongly with both Shane Watson and Steven Smith hitting centuries in their first innings. Australia captain Michael Clarke opted to declare for 492/9 on the second day of the test. As in the previous test, England's first innings was slow with an average run rate of 2.6 per over. With rain forcing play to be abandoned on the fourth day, England managed to push to 377 all out just after lunch on the fifth day. Australia added 111/6 in less than two hours before declaring, setting England a target of 227 from 44 overs; the run chase ended in a draw when play was called off due to bad light at 7:36pm, with England needing 21 runs from the final four overs to win an Ashes series 4–0 for the first time. The umpires' decision to end the game early was controversial, with commentator Jonathan Agnew declaring it an \"absolute disgrace\".\nDecision Review System.\nThe implementation of DRS in this series resulted in several controversies, mostly relating to the use of the Hot Spot technology. The most high-profile occurred in the first innings of the third Test: Usman Khawaja was given out caught-behind by on-field umpire Tony Hill, and reviewed the decision; Hot Spot showed no sign of an edge, and many observers noted that visual evidence also appeared to show that Khawaja did not edge the ball, but the decision was not overturned. Cricket Australia requested a formal explanation of the decision from the ICC following the match, and the decision was heavily criticised in Australian media. Kevin Pietersen was dismissed in similar circumstances in the second innings of the same match.\nAfter the third Test, allegations were made by Australian broadcaster Channel Nine that batsmen were trying to avoid Hot Spot detections by applying silicone tape to their bats. While such a practice would have been technically legal under the laws of cricket, Kevin Pietersen, who was specifically named in the claims, angrily denied the allegations, and the ICC did not investigate the claims. In October 2013, Pietersen won libel damages from Specsavers after they ran an advert that implied that he had tampered with his bat.\nBroadcasters.\nThe Australian live television rights to the series were shared by the Nine Network and Fox Sports, and the British rights by Sky Sports with daily highlights broadcast on Channel 5. Live radio commentary in the UK was provided by BBC Test Match Special, which was syndicated on ABC Radio Grandstand in Australia."

        "text": "Lloyd Thaxton Goes Surfing with The Challengers is the second album by the surf rock band The Challengers. This album was issued in 1963, at the peak of the \"surf wave\", in South California. This record was a \"hard to find\" LP, until the Sundazed Records cie (on the Yesterdazed Series) released it back, in 1994, with 2 previously unissued bonus tracks.\nLloyd Thaxton was host-producer of \"The Lloyd Thaxton Show\", one of the highest rated musical shows in Hollywood. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, and brought up in Toledo, Ohio, Lloyd moved his family to Hollywood in 1957.\nThe \"Lloyd Thaxton Show\" is a favorite not only for teenagers, but with their parents as well, because the show is more than a dance-party; it is filled with a variety of crazy and entertaining gimmicks.\nBy the time \"Surfing With The Challengers\" was issued in the spring of 1963, the band become one of the most visible and influential musical groups in Southern California. Their debut album, \"Surfbeat\" was selling well and Wallichs Music City had an entire window display devoted to the band. They were a permanent fixture on local TV dance shows and appeared at the Y-Day Concert at the Hollywood Bowl.\nThe choice of the tracks used for \"Surfing With The Challengers\" repeated the approach followed on their first album: unique surf instrumental versions of late 1950s rock instrumental (songs by Duane Eddy, The Fireballs and The Ventures) coupled with The Challengers' originals. This served to emphasize how much the new genre of surf music had been inspired by the rich heritage of rock instrumentals from the \"golden age\" just three or four years before.\nThe choice of material, and the wonderful crisp and restrained production of both this album and the earlier \"Surfbeat\", were inspirational to most teen bands at the time."

Furthermore, the national team has qualified to the FIBA Asia Cup eight times, with their best result coming in 1997, where they finished fifth. The UAE has also competed at the Arab Nations Cup multiple times, where they had their top performance in 1997, winning bronze.\nHistory.\nThe United Arab Emirates played in their first international match at the 1982 Asian Games. The group stage fixture win against North Yemen, was one of only two victories for the team against four losses during the event; which saw the team miss out on making it to the medal round. After the tournament, the team would not appear at an international competition until the 1990 Asian Games, where the team would only achieve modest results.\nThree years later, the United Arab Emirates made their debut at the top continental competition, the 1993 FIBA Asia Cup. Placed into Group B during the preliminary phase, the UAE won two out of their three matches for a record of (2–1) to advance into the quarter-finals. However, the UAE would lose a narrowly contested match against Iran 73–77, to relegate the team to the classification rounds to finish out the tournament. After nearly reaching the semi-finals at the first FIBA Asia Cup tournament the UAE took part in, the team was back at the next edition of the event in 1995. Stationed in Group B once again, the UAE, however, would only win one of their preliminary phase matches; which came against the Philippines 70–56, to be sent to the classification stages for the second straight tournament. There, the team would pickup four more victories to close out the competition in ninth place.\nBehind subpar performances at their first two FIBA Asia Cup competitions, the United Arab Emirates entered the tournament in 1997, determined to gain better results. After completely dominating India, and Bangladesh in their first two preliminary phase matches, the team fell in a close defeat to South Korea 73–72. Although with the two wins, the team automatically advanced into the quarter-final round. Entering the phase, the UAE would only prevail in one of their three matches, a 77–59 win against Jordan. The loss for the team would send them into the classification fifth place game, where they would earn one more victory to end the competition. After the tournament, the UAE would make the competition five more times over the next 14 years through the 2011 edition, accumulating only disappointing outcomes.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2025 FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Bahrain and Syria.\nPast rosters.\n2011 FIBA Asia Cup: finished 10th among 16 teams"

        "text": "Daniel L. Allen (December 7, 1955 – May 16, 2004) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Boston University from 1990 to 1995 and at the College of the Holy Cross from 1996 to 2003. Allen began his coaching career at the University of Dayton as a graduate assistant, where he earned a master's degree in 1979. He then served as an assistant coach at Holy Cross from 1982 to 1989 before moving on to his first head coaching job at Boston University. After a six-year stint for the Terriers, Allen finished his coaching career back at Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders for eight seasons before being fired following a 1–11 campaign.\nBoston University's 1993 Cinderella season.\nAllen's most successful season as a coach came in 1993 with Boston University. Between 1990 and 1992, the Terriers football team had combined to win 12 total games against 21 losses. Heading into the 1993 season they had been picked to finish near the bottom of the Yankee Conference standings. What happened instead turned out to be one of the single biggest turnarounds in NCAA Division I-AA football history.\nThe Terriers began their season with a 45–0 win over Maine; this sparked the momentum that would carry through the rest of the regular season as Boston finished with an unblemished 11–0 record (8–0 Yankee). It is the school's only undefeated season and it had set a new high mark for wins as well. The Terriers earned their first Division I-AA playoffs berth in many years. In the first-round game, the Terriers defeated the Kurt Warner-led Northern Iowa Panthers, 27–21, in double overtime. The season would end one week later in the quarterfinals against Idaho when they lost 21–14. Both the 1993 Boston team and Allen himself garnered national recognition, awards and accolades for their Cinderella season.\nIn 1994, the Terriers once again performed well and finished with a 9–3 record, making the 1993 and 1994 seasons' combined overall record 21–4, which is the best two-year span in Boston University history.\nFamily and death.\nAllen was married to his wife, Laura, and the couple had three children together: Mark, Taylor and Danielle. He died on May 16, 2004, at his home in Westboro, Massachusetts, after succumbing to complications of ALS. \nBoth of Dan's sons have continued his strong legacy of coaching football. Mark is the current head football coach at Algonquin Regional High School in Northborough, MA, and has been there for over 9 years in total, previously as the Defensive Coordinator. Taylor has also been involved in coaching, and was the head football coach at Algonquin from 2017 to 2019 after serving as an assistant coach for three years prior."

        "text": "The 1967 Rose Bowl was the 53rd edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 2nd, 1967. The game was played between the Purdue Boilermakers of the Big Ten Conference and the USC Trojans of the AAWU. A total of 101,438 people attended the game. Purdue won 14−13.\nPurdue defensive back John Charles was named the Player of the Game. Because New Year's Day fell on Sunday in 1967, the game was delayed until the 2nd.\nTeams.\nPurdue Boilermakers.\nThis was Purdue's first Rose Bowl appearance, led by All-American quarterback Bob Griese. The team participated in the Rose Bowl with an record, finishing second in the Big Ten Conference. Purdue's only losses were to #1 Notre Dame and #2 Michigan State. Conference champion Michigan State was undefeated at in the Big Ten, but the conference's \"no-repeat\" rule barred the team from playing in the Rose Bowl. Purdue's only other appearance in the Rose Bowl was 34 years later, in January 2001.\nUSC Trojans.\nThe USC Trojans, representing the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), came into the game with a record, ranked in the second ten of the AP Poll and #18 in the UPI coaches poll. They were controversially awarded with the Rose Bowl bid over UCLA, despite the Bruins' #5 ranking, record, and victory over the Trojans. Because of a flaw in the schedule, USC played one more conference game than UCLA and had a 4–1 Pac-8 record to UCLA's . Prior to the UCLA-USC game, it was widely assumed that the winner would go to the Rose Bowl.\nUSC was voted in to the Rose Bowl by the AAWU athletic directors before prior to the game with Notre Dame on November 26, a 51–0 shutout loss in Los Angeles. Many thought awarding USC the Rose Bowl was to make up for 1964, when USC and Oregon State tied for the AAWU title. In that year, it was assumed that if USC upset #1 Notre Dame in its final game, they would get the nod over Oregon State. USC beat Notre Dame 20–17, but Oregon State was awarded the Rose Bowl berth over USC based on a tiebreaker of most recent Rose bowl appearance despite Oregon State's better overall record ( vs. ). The head coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Tommy Prothro, who left after the season for UCLA. Another factor may have been an ankle injury sustained by Bruin junior quarterback Gary Beban, the Heisman Trophy winner in 1967. USC started the season with six wins, then dropped three of their last four games going into the matchup with Purdue. This was the first of four consecutive Rose Bowl appearances for the Trojans; the Pac-8 did not have a \"no-repeat\" rule.\nGame summary.\nAs 1967 was an odd-numbered year, the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) representative (USC) was designated the home team and wore cardinal red jerseys while Purdue, the visiting team, wore white jerseys with gold pants and helmets.\nThe game was played largely defensively. Neither team scored in the first quarter. Both teams only reached the end zone once in the second quarter. The halftime score was 7–7. Purdue took a 14–7 lead in the third quarter after a touchdown run by fullback Perry Williams. With less than two minutes to play, USC scored a touchdown on a Troy Winslow pass to Rod Sherman for 19 yards. Coach John McKay decided to try for a two-point conversion to secure the win against Purdue, but Purdue's George Catavolos intercepted the pass in the end zone to preserve the 14–13 victory.\nPurdue's astronaut alumni (Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee), attended the 1967 Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl game. Less than four weeks later, on January 27th, Grissom and Chaffee died in the Apollo 1 fire in Florida."

        "text": "The 1959 Rose Bowl was the 45th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Thursday, January 1. The heavily-favored and second-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference defeated the #16 California Golden Bears of the Pacific Coast Conference, 38–12. Iowa's star halfback Bob Jeter was named the Player of the Game. Iowa improved to 8–1–1 and California fell to 7–4 for the season.\nIowa, 7–1–1, was behind undefeated LSU in the two major polls. LSU was ranked number one in both major polls since week 6 of the season. LSU's Sugar Bowl win over higher ranked #12 Clemson was convincing and was awarded the national championship by the Associated Press and the Coaches' Poll (UPI), as well as by 37 other selectors. Iowa finished first in the football writers poll.\nFuture Berkeley, California city mayor Tom Bates was a member of the California Golden Bears team.\nIt was the sixth straight Rose Bowl win for the Big Ten, and the twelfth of the last thirteen. The PCC disbanded in the spring and five of its members formed the new AAWU (Big Five), while the other four competed as independents for several years. It is the last time Cal has appeared in the Rose Bowl.\nTeams.\nIowa Hawkeyes.\nSecond-ranked Iowa were the Big Ten champions, entered the game with a record of 7–1–1 (5–1 Big Ten), and were favored by eighteen points.\nCalifornia Golden Bears.\nSixteenth-ranked California, led by quarterback Joe Kapp, entered the game as Pacific Coast Conference champions with a record of 7–3 (6–1 PCC).\nGame summary.\nRandy Duncan helped Iowa take a 14–0 lead with a touchdown run in the first quarter and a touchdown pass to Jeff Langston in the second quarter. The Hawkeye backfield carried Iowa the rest of the way, as Willie Fleming ran for two touchdowns and Bob Jeter, the Rose Bowl Most Valuable Player, and Don Horn each ran for one touchdown. Iowa attempted a Rose Bowl record three two-point conversions and failed on all three, while Bob Prescott made one of two extra points. End Jack Hart scored all of California's twelve points, running for a touchdown in the third quarter and catching a touchdown in the fourth quarter, both of which were followed by failed two-point conversion attempts. Iowa broke four Rose Bowl records: longest run (Jeter 81), team rushing yards (429), team total yards (516) and individual rushing yards (Jeter 194); and tied another Rose Bowl record set by Georgia in 1943: first downs (24). The attendance was 98,297.\nFour Rose Bowl game records were set: Jeter's 81-yard run, his 194 yards of rushing offense, the 429 yards gained on the ground and the 516 yards of total offense."

Arnold led his 1984 Montana State Bobcats team to a 12–2 record, a Big Sky Conference title, and the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. For his effort, he was named the AFCA Division I-AA Coach of the Year that season. The 1984 championship run followed a season in 1983 in which the Bobcats finished 1–10 and last in the conference, but defeated their in-state rival, the University of Montana Grizzlies in their sole win. The 11-game turnaround is one of the largest in college football history.\nArnold worked as an assistant coach under Dennis Erickson at Washington State University and Miami University and then in the National Football League (NFL), coordinating the special teams for the Seattle Seahawks from 1995 through 1997. With the Seahawks, he coached with Rick Tuten when he led the NFL in yards per punt in 1995. Kicker Todd Peterson made over 82 percent of his field goals in 1995 and 1996."

        "text": "Bowling on NBC is a presentation of professional ten-pin bowling matches from the PBA Tour formerly produced by NBC Sports, the sports division of the NBC television network in the United States.\nHistorical overview.\n\"Championship Bowling\".\nPrior to the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA)'s inception, bowling was broadcast on television sporadically beginning in the early 1950s. NBC began with an early 1950s special telecast entitled \"Championship Bowling\".\n\"Jackpot Bowling\".\nJackpot Bowling (also known as \"Phillies Jackpot Bowling\" and \"Jackpot Bowling Starring Milton Berle\") was a professional bowling program that ran on NBC for two seasons from January 9, 1959, to March 13, 1961. It was the first bowling show on national television since \"Bowling Headliners\". The program aired on Fridays at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time, following the \"Cavalcade of Sports Friday Night Fight\".\nFirst hosted by Leo Durocher, who left after only two episodes, the program was subsequently hosted by Mel Allen. However, Allen was not popular with viewers as he showed a lack of bowling knowledge. He was replaced by Bud Palmer on April 10, 1959, before Allen returned in October 1959, remaining with the show until April 1960; Palmer subsequently returned to the program as host, staying through June.\n\"Jackpot Bowling\" was put on a brief hiatus by NBC after the June 24 episode. When it returned on September 19, 1960, the program was retooled; the series not only moved to Monday nights at 10:30, but Bayuk Cigars replaced Phillies Cigars as sponsor, the Hollywood Legion Lanes replaced the T-Bowl in Wayne, New Jersey, as the program's venue, and Milton Berle took over as host.\n\"Sportsworld\".\nThe NBC sports anthology series \"Sportsworld\" covered several professional bowling events throughout its run that were not broadcast as part of the \"Pro Bowlers Tour\" on ABC.\nIn 1980, NBC aired the \"Legends of Bowling\" mini-series on three consecutive Saturdays. The game consisted of 7 frames, with a combination of strikes and spare shots, with point values assigned to each frame. The winning team got a chance to make the \"big money split\" at the end. The play-by-play announcer was Sam Nover while the color analyst was Steve Neff. The off-stage announcer was the legendary NBC voice, Don Pardo.\nFrom 1984 to 1991, it had its own series called \"The PBA Fall Tour\". Jay Randolph and Earl Anthony served as commentators. Unlike ABC's coverage, NBC was the first to introduce uninterrupted coverage of the championship match.\nFrom 1988 to 1990, bowling had its own version of the Skins Game called The Bowling Shootout. Four bowlers (three pros and one amateur in the 1989 and 1990) competed. Each frame had a designated value and to win, the bowler on the floor must be the only one to strike, spare or have most pin count to claim the prize. A two-player tie meant all tied, but all players bowled regardless (where there was a game within a game). If it was still tied after the 10th frame, the players would go on to a one ball roll-off. The bowler with the highest monetary prize won the Shootout. In addition, the bowler who threw the most strikes (the game within a game) won a boat. Marshall Holman (who moved on to the roll-off in three consecutive tournaments: with Mark Roth in the 1988 Muskegon, Michigan, and the 1989 Reno, Nevada, Shootout, and the 1990 tournament in Atlantic City, New Jersey) won all three boats. Brian Voss (who moved on to the roll-off in the 1990 tournament, alongside Holman) was the only bowler to win a frame with a spare.\nBowlero Elite Series.\nMarch 2019, NBC announced that it would air three installments of the Bowlero Elite Series. This these are three single-elimination tournaments sponsored by Bowlero Corporation that feature the top professional and amateur bowlers competing for a total prize pool in excess of $1 million. The first two events, emanating from Chicago, Illinois, and North Brunswick, New Jersey, were scheduled to air on NBCSN on April 9 and September 11, 2019, respectively. The final installment, emanating from Jupiter, Florida, would air on December 28 on NBC.\nNBC's commentators include Leila Rahimi (host and reporter), Jerome Bettis (guest analyst), Todd Harris (play-by-play), and Chris Barnes (analyst)."

It is also known that matches were held against some of the British who lived in Moscow.\nThe Finnish Cricket Association (Suomen Krikettiliitto ry) was created in 1999 to develop and organize the game of cricket in Finland. The turnover of the size of the top division was 45 (initially 40) overs until 2007, when it became 50 overs. In 2008, the Association created a second league, which is played with 40 overs. The winners of these series are promoted to the SM50 series, which is played by the best players in both leagues. In addition, Dev T20 and Open T20 series are played, which consist of 20 overs games and indoor cricket."

The team was the second undefeated national champion in NCAA basketball history and was the first ACC team to win a title. The team notably won its last two games in triple overtime. The Tar Heels leading scorer was player of the year, small forward Lennie Rosenbluth.\nIn the semifinal against Jumping Johnny Green and Michigan State, to tie the game in regulation, Pete Brennan, usually the power forward, after gathering the rebound, ran the floor like a guard and put in a jump shot with a soft touch. Three overtimes later, UNC won 74 to 70.\nThis placed undefeated North Carolina for the championship against Wilt Chamberlain and Kansas. Again the game went to triple overtime. Center Joe Quigg made the winning free throws.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| ACC tournament\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\nSeason summary.\nHired away from St. John’s in 1952 to make North Carolina basketball competitive with rival NC State, legendary coach Frank McGuire mined his native New York for talent and put together a team that won the national championship by slowing down dominating Kansas center Wilt Chamberlain. A veteran lineup led by star forward Lennie Rosenbluth, who averaged 28 points, finished the season a perfect 32-0."

Each archer shot one quarter of a FITA round, with the 36 arrows split evenly between the distances of 90 metres, 70 metres, 50 metres, and 30 metres.\nThe United States and Korea, having vied for dominance throughout the competition, won a gold and silver medal, respectively.

        "text": "Matt Zimmerman is the current director of operations and a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Arkansas and a former Arkansas Razorbacks basketball team manager. A member of Delta Upsilon fraternity, Zimmerman graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1990. He went on to serve in the United States Army until 1995 reaching the rank of Captain. He then went on to serve as an athletic director and coach at the high school level before joining Mike Anderson's staff at UAB and Missouri. He is well known for his work ethic and commitment to coaching. Zimmerman headed up the walk-on tryouts while at both UAB and Missouri.\nPlayer career.\nZimmerman was a standout basketball player for Wonderview High School from 1981–1985, where his team had a combined 133-19 record in four years capped off by a 36-4 record and a state runner-up finish his junior season.\nAfter high school, Zimmerman worked as a student manager for the Arkansas Razorbacks for three seasons (1987–88, 1988–89 and 1989–90) under head coach Nolan Richardson and assistant coach Mike Anderson. During those three seasons Arkansas had an overall record of 76–21, a conference record of 42–6, two conference titles, and three National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament appearances including a final four in 1990.\nMilitary career.\nAfter college, Zimmerman served in the United States Army from 1990 to 1995. He graduated from the Army Airborne School in 1991 and served as Platoon Leader, shop officer, company executive officer and Battalion S-1 on his way to achieving the rank of captain.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school coaching career.\nUpon completing his time in the military, Zimmerman entered the basketball coaching ranks in his home state of Arkansas. From 1995 to 1998, Zimmerman served as the Athletic Director and Head Basketball Coach for the now defunct Plainview-Rover High School. While there he led the team to three conference titles and was selected as the conference coach of the year in 1996.\nIn 1998 Zimmerman took the head coaching job at Dardanelle High School in Dardanelle, Arkansas. In his four years there the team accumulated a 74-46 record and captured the Class 4A State Title in the 2001-2002 season. This success led Zimmerman to be named the KARV Dream Team Coach of the Year and River Valley Radio Coach of the Year in 2000.\nCollege coaching career.\nWhen Nolan Richardson was let go at the University of Arkansas, the Razorbacks hired Stan Heath rather than long term assistant coach Mike Anderson, who had been an assistant for 17 seasons under Richardson. Instead the University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB), located in Anderson's home town of Birmingham, Alabama, gave Anderson a chance to be a head coach. Zimmerman joined Anderson's staff at UAB until Anderson accepted the position of head basketball coach at the University of Missouri in 2006. Zimmerman followed Anderson to Missouri and served on his staff as an assistant until Anderson accepted the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas in 2011. On April 6, 2011 it was announced Zimmerman would join Anderson's staff at Arkansas. Zimmerman spent five years as an assistant and then another three years as the Director of Basketball Operations. He is currently a color analyst for the Razorback Sports Network and co-host, with Quinn Grovey, of The Razorback Daily podcast."

        "title": "Gibraltar Barbarians Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Gibraltar Barbarians Rugby Football Club (GRFC) is a Rugby union club from Gibraltar and the surrounding Campo in Spain, who play in the Andalucian League as Gibraltar Barbarians RFC. They play their home games in the town of Guadiaro near Sotogrande in the Cadiz province of Spain. They currently play in the 1 Division National of the Federacion Andaluza de Rugby (FAR). In 2010, Campo Gibraltar is now a Gibraltar-based team and its name has been changed to Gibraltar Barbarians RFC.\nHistory.\nGibraltar Rugby Football Club was established immediately after the Second World War. After the repatriation of displaced Gibraltarians locals who had learnt to play rugby either at English schools or whilst being in the forces started to play the resident teams from the Army, Navy and RAF in a pitch in neighbouring Spain (given the lack of grass pitches in Gibraltar). Initially the military sides were dominant but by the 1960s the Latin flair which became a trade mark of Gibraltar's style of rugby became evident and GRFC became the dominant force in the area. A local league consisting of GRFC, Army, Navy and RAF was set up in the mid-1960s which added a more structured and competitive framework within which to play.\nThe closure of the land frontier between Gibraltar and Spain in 1968 saw local rugby diminish in popularity but tag Rugby ensured that it did not entirely disappear. In 1985 the land frontier re-opened and with it the local league once again became an important part of Gibraltar's weekly sporting calendar with games being played in Spain on grass pitches mostly located within 15 minutes of Gibraltar. GRFC prospered within the local league and since 1985 with the exception of three years when the Duke of Wellington Regiment were posted to Gibraltar the GRFC won the league year after year. Games against Spanish sides during the 1980s were played on a friendly basis primarily against sides from Seville and Madrid. Spanish rugby grew in popularity and by 1990 the GRFC began to struggle against premier league sides but enjoyed very competitive games against First Division regional teams in Andalusia.\nThe reduction in military personnel in 1991/1992 and the positive approach by the Andalusian Rugby Federation that uniquely kept politics out of sport meant that it became clear that the GFRC future was playing within the Andalusian League and the 1992/93 season saw GRFC fully integrated into the Second Division of Andalusia. Players from forces sides joined the GRFC and by 1994 the GFRC were at their strongest historically. In that same year the GRFC were promoted to the First Division almost winning it in the first year. Throughout this period the GRFC toured regularly entering tournaments in Spain and Portugal with considerable success both at 15s and 7s. The highlight was winning the Benidorm 7s tournament Club section in 1996. Ireland won the national section.\nBy 2000, the retirement of a crop of players at the same time led to GRFC dropping to the Second Division where they stayed until 2004/05 when they were once again promoted. In their first year in the First Division they finished third but the failure to produce a youth side meant that they were relegated to the Second Division.\nPromotion into the First Division.\nDuring the 2006-2007 season the club played in Group A of the Andalucian Regional League 2, they finished top of the league winning 7 out of 8 games in the process and then went on to beat local rivals Marbella 3-0 in a playoff final on 15 April for promotion back to Regional League 1. \nThe GRFC organised a youth section of the club to ensure they gained their rightful place in the First Division.\nRugby in the Primera Division Regional.\nSince their promotion into the First Division, Gibraltar have been one of the most consistent teams in their league, maintaining a position in the top half of the table. They finished third behind Malaga and San Jeronimo in the 2009/2010 season.\nYouth Rugby.\nTo maintain their position within the First Division in Andalucia, the GBRFC organised an Under 19s team to be entered into the league. The team was known as the GRFC Colts. The Andalucian Rugby Federation changed the age groups for the 2010/2011 season meaning that the Under 19s would become Under 20s. The GBRFC entered both an Under 18s and 20s team into the Andalucian leagues. The Under 18s would be known as the Gibraltar CG Ice Barbarians and the Under 20s would be known as the Gibraltar CepsaGib Barbarians.\n2013/2014 season.\nThe Barbarians kicked off the 2013/2014 season with a 53-18 home win over long-standing rivals, San Jeronimo of Seville.

        "text": "The 1954 Challenge Cup was the 53rd staging of rugby league's oldest knockout competition, the Challenge Cup. It featured clubs from the 1953–54 Northern Rugby Football League season and is particularly notable for its final, which had to be replayed at Odsal after a drawn match at Wembley, with the replay attracting possibly the largest ever crowd in world rugby league history.\nFinal.\nHalifax and Warrington, the teams who had finished first and second respectively on the Championship ladder (separated by only one competition point), reached the Challenge Cup final Saturday 24 April 1954. The game was played at Wembley, and 81,841 spectators saw what turned out to be a comparatively lacklustre match. \nAfter a couple of penalties, Halifax held a 4-0 lead at half time. In the second half Warrington drew level, also kicking two penalties. There was no further scoring and the match finished in a draw, at 4 - 4. This match remains the only occasion on which Wembley hasn't seen a single try scored on Cup final day. The replay was initially scheduled for 5pm on Wednesday 5 May 1954 at Odsal Stadium, Bradford.\nFinal replay.\nAround 70,000 spectators were expected at Odsal for the replay, which was rescheduled for a 7pm kick-off in order to allow for rush hour traffic in Bradford. The twenty trains and fifty buses (specially arranged for the match, as well as the 100 gatesmen and 150 policemen on duty at the ground) were believed to be adequate to deal with the expected crowd. \nHowever, the competitive closeness with which the two teams were matched, together with the enticing prospect of the Challenge Cup decider coming north for the first time in a decade, seems to have generated far greater public interest than was supposed.\nPeople had started queuing outside the stadium a good hour before the shuttle buses started running from 4:25pm. The gates opened at 5.00pm, and by that time some people had already been queuing for an hour and a half. With over an hour remaining before kick off, there were already an estimated 60,000 in the ground. The traffic on the roads in the surrounding area was at a standstill as more and more spectators converged on the stadium. Some squatted around the pitch, while others climbed onto rooftops for a better view. Fences around the ground had collapsed, as more people struggled to cram into the bowl of Odsal before the match started. \nThe official attendance figure for the crowd was announced as 102,575 however it is widely believed that a more realistic figure for the number of spectators present is closer to 120,000.\nThe match itself was another tense, low-scoring struggle, but an improvement on the first game. Jim Challinor opened the scoring with a try for Warrington after nine minutes. Half an hour later, Tyssul Griffiths kicked a penalty for the Halifax side, who had also had two tries disallowed. This meant a half time score of 3 - 2 in favour of Warrington.\nThe third quarter of the match saw additional goals kicked by both Griffiths and Harry Bath, bringing the score to 5 - 4, still just one point in favour of Warrington. Then Gerry Helme scored a try, which Bath couldn't convert, putting Warrington four points clear of Halifax, but still within a converted try. Controversy reared just before full-time, when Halifax had a third try disallowed by referee Ron Gelder. Warrington had claimed their 4th Challenge Cup, with Helme winning the Lance Todd Trophy for his match-winning performance, the first player to do so twice."

On three occasions the county progressed to the third round of the competition: in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Minor counties teams were excluded from the competition from the 2006 season; Cornwall's last match was against the Netherlands in the first round of the 2004 competition.\nIn their seventeen List A matches, 69 players have represented Cornwall. Gary Thomas has appeared the most times for the county, playing in twelve matches, closely followed by Jonathan Kent, who made eleven appearances. Kent recorded the highest score in List A cricket for Cornwall, scoring 80 runs against Somerset Cricket Board in 2002. Steven Pope, who played 109 first-class matches in his native South Africa is Cornwall's leading run-scorer, having scored 294 runs in his eight appearances for the county. Justin Stephens's thirteen wickets for the county is the most by any player, but Charlie Shreck has the best bowling figures, having taken five wickets against Worcestershire in 2002. Gavin Edwards, who appeared for Cornwall on seven occasions, has claimed the most dismissals as wicket-keeper, taking five catches and making two stumpings. Only three non-English players have appeared for Cornwall; Jersey's Ryan Driver, Pakistan's Naeem Akhtar and South Africa's Steven Pope.\nThe players in this list have all played at least one List A match. Cornwall cricketers who have not represented the county in List A cricket are not included in the list.

        "title": "Super Rugby franchise areas",
        "text": "The Super Rugby competition in rugby union, including teams from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands and, in the past, from Argentina, Japan and South Africa, is based on a \"franchise\" system of teams. The original member countries – Australia, New Zealand and South Africa (until 2020) – all have several regional franchises, while the expansion countries – Argentina, Fiji, Japan and the Pacific Islands – have/had one franchise each. The article covers specific detail as to the areas covered by each Super Rugby team. Bold denotes stadiums that are current primary stadiums for the franchises.\nCurrent franchise areas.\nAustralia.\n \n \n \nWaratahs\nBrumbies\nReds\nForce\nRebels\nThe Australian Super Rugby franchises have evolved from traditional state and territory representative sides. For most of the history of rugby in Australia, the domestic game has been structured around regional club competitions. The strongest of these are based in the state and territory capitals of Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. During the amateur era prior to 1996, these competitions fed into the representative teams of New South Wales, Queensland and Australian Capital Territory, respectively, and those teams became Australia's three original Super Rugby franchises.\nVictoria, Western Australia and South Australia had similar representative teams and club structures but the game was generally not as strong in those states due to Australian rules football being the dominant code. Western Australia obtained the country's fourth franchise with the Western Force joining in 2006 and Victoria's Melbourne Rebels joined in 2011 as the fifth franchise. At the end of 2017, however, the Western Force lost its licence and was removed from the competition because the ARU decided to reduce the number of Australian teams in Super Rugby from five to four.\nSince 1968, several Australian provincial competitions were created that did not continue, including the Wallaby Trophy in the 1960s and 1970s and, more recently, the Ricoh National Championship, APC and ARC. The last continent-wide competition was the NRC, which was launched as a national competition (like the Currie Cup and the ITM Cup) from 2014 to 2020.\nAs well as Australian teams signing players from regional club competitions many players are signed straight from schoolboy rugby with strong competitions such as Queensland's GPS and New South Wales' AAGPS providing a large number of professional players.\nWhile Australian Super Rugby teams do have general feeder areas, players from such areas can play for any side that offers them a contract. Examples include James O'Connor playing for the Western Force having played school rugby in Queensland and Matt Toomua playing for the ACT Brumbies having also played school rugby in Queensland.\nThere are three regions that do not have a Super Rugby franchise.\nAll regions have provincial club competitions with a representative teams in the Australian Rugby Shield, from 2000 to 2008, and in NRC Division 2, from 2018 to 2020.\nSuper Rugby AU.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling the shortened 2020 Super Rugby season, the Western Force returned to Super Rugby to participate in Super Rugby AU. Since departing Super Rugby the team had been participating in Global Rapid Rugby. The team was again confirmed in the 2021 Super Rugby AU season.\nFiji.\n \nDrua\nFiji has a single franchise. It was included in Super Rugby for the 2022 Super Rugby season and represents all of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU); the team consists of players from various teams that participate in the Skipper Cup, represents the Fiji national side or Fiji Sevens national side. Many of the players who represent the side have returned from stints internationally in Europe or elsewhere. In the past, Fiji has also a team in Australia's National Rugby Championship (NRC) and Global Rapid Rugby. For the 2022 season, the Drua were confirmed as being based in Lennox Head, New South Wales, Australia due to travel restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNew Zealand.\n \n \n \nBlues\nChiefs\nHurricanes\nCrusaders\nHighlanders\nIn New Zealand, each of the country's five Super Rugby teams are linked with several unions in the country's two domestic competitions, the professional National Provincial Championship and amateur Heartland Championship. For all practical purposes, all Super Rugby players will be drawn from the National Provincial Championship sides. The specific unions linked to each franchise are:\nSuper Rugby Aotearoa.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling the shortened 2020 Super Rugby season, the New Zealand Rugby Union organized Super Rugby Aotearoa with its 5 Super Rugby Franchises.\nPacific Islands.\nThe Pacific Islands have a single franchise, that is owned and operated by New Zealand Rugby. It was included in Super Rugby for the 2022 Super Rugby season and represents all the Pacific Islands, and specifically the Fiji Rugby Union, Rugby Samoa and Tonga Rugby Union along with Cook Islands Rugby Union and Niue Rugby Football Union. The team consists of players from various teams that participate in competitions in these countries such as the Datec Cup Provincial Championship, Samoa National Provincial Championship and Skipper Cup, represents one of these nations national side or sevens side. Many of the players who represent the side have returned from stints internationally in Europe or elsewhere, or play their rugby in Australia or New Zealand in competitions such as the National Provincial Championship, Heartland Championship, Queensland Premier Rugby or Shute Shield. The Pacific Islands have had previous representative teams in Global Rapid Rugby and also competed internationally as the Pacific Islanders rugby union team and had a number of teams who competed in the World Rugby Pacific Challenge. The team will be based in South Auckland, New Zealand.\nFormer franchise areas.\nArgentina (2016–2020).\n \nJaguares\nArgentina had a single franchise, which participated in the South African Conference. It was included in Super Rugby for the 2016 Super Rugby season and represents all of Argentine Rugby Union; the team consists of players from various teams that participate in the Nacional de Clubes, which involves clubs from URBA and from the Torneo del Interior. Argentina has also a team in South African's Currie Cup and Súper Liga Americana de Rugby. The Jaguares weren't named in a Super Rugby tournament for the 2021 season and won't compete in 2021.\nJapan (2016–2020).\n \nSunwolves\nJapan had a single franchise called the , which participates in the Australian Conference. It was included in Super Rugby for the 2016 Super Rugby season and represented all of Japan and its major rugby club competition, the Top League from 2016 to 2020.\nIn March 2019, it was announced that 2020 would be the final season for the Sunwolves after failing to negotiate a contract due to financial considerations.\nSouth Africa (1996–2020).\nSouth Africa operated its Super Rugby system in basically the same manner as in New Zealand, with each franchise linked with one or more unions in the country's domestic competition, the Currie Cup and the Vodacom Cup (its development competition). During the 1996 and 1997 Super 12 seasons, South Africa entered their 4 top finishers in the previous season's Currie Cup. The franchises were created for the 1998 season.\nThe country had five franchises. The four teams from the Super 12 era—the Bulls, Cats (now the Lions), Sharks and Stormers—were joined in 2006 by the Cheetahs. Their identities are largely based around the 5 traditional powers of the Currie Cup competition; the Blue Bulls, Golden Lions, Sharks, Western Province and Free State Cheetahs respectively. In 2013, 2016 and 2017, South Africa had another team, Southern Kings, expression of Currie Cup's team, . For 2020, the Griquas and Pumas joined for the Super Rugby Unlocked competition. In September 2020, South African Rugby announced their plan to leave Super Rugby at the end of 2020.\nThe franchises that represented South Africa in Super Rugby were:\nSouth African side reduction.\nFollowing SANZAAR's decision to reduce the number of teams for 2018 from six to four, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Cheetahs and Southern Kings would be the teams cut from the 2018 competition. Instead, the Cheetahs and Southern Kings joined the previously-northern hemisphere Pro14 competition from ahead of the 2017–18 Pro14 season.\nSuper Rugby Unlocked.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling the 2020 Super Rugby season, the Cheetahs returned to Super Rugby to play in the Super Rugby Unlocked competition. They will be joined in the competition by Griquas and Pumas who will be playing in their first Super Rugby affiliated competition.\nSouthern and Eastern Cape Region Franchise.\nThe proposed sixth team were supposed to be entrenched in the 2007 and 2008 Super 14 seasons and were to draw from the Southern and Eastern Cape Region (SEC) and based in Port Elizabeth. They became a major bone of contention in South African rugby, when it was proposed originally, that the entry of the Spears would mean a promotion/relegation system would be put in place in 2006 to determine which team would not participate in the following season's Super 14. The entrenchment of the Spears proved highly controversial; after allegations of financial mismanagement and poor results against other South African sides, the South African Rugby Union (SARU) decided on 19 April 2006 to scrap its original plan to admit the Spears in 2007.\nThe High Court of South Africa gave the Spears a potential reprieve in August 2006 when it ruled that the Spears had a valid contract with SARU and its commercial arm, SA Rugby, to enter both the Currie Cup and Super 14. Both the SARU and SA Rugby planned to appeal this decision. In November 2006, all parties involved reached a settlement; the Spears dropped their suit and abandoned any attempts to enter the Super 14.\nSince the Spears never joined Super Rugby, the SARU and SA Rugby had to determine how to reincorporate players from the Spears region to the other franchises. In January 2009, the SARU announced that a new SEC franchise, also to be based in Port Elizabeth, would be launched in June 2009 to coincide with the arrival of the British &amp; Irish Lions for a midweek tour match in the city. The franchise, a joint venture between the Eastern Province and Border unions, was created with the goal of an eventual place in Super Rugby, although the entry date was uncertain, pending agreement with the other SANZAR partners. SARU also confirmed that the franchise would not assume the Southern Spears name; the team was later announced as the Southern Kings.\nThe Southern Kings were confirmed to be drawing from the Spears' former area with the announcement of their inaugural squad in 2009. Most of the players in the Kings' debut match against the British &amp; Irish Lions were affiliated with the team's co-owners, the Border and Eastern Province unions (the latter being the operators of the ), but South Western Districts (operators of the Eagles) were also involved. The inaugural Kings side also included players from the provinces of Western Province and Boland within the Stormers' area.\nOn 27 January 2012, it was confirmed that the Southern Kings would join Super Rugby in 2013. It was confirmed that they would replace the Lions as South Africa's fifth club. After playing just a single season, the Lions returned in 2014 and 2015, before a further Super Rugby expansion saw the Kings being included on a permanent basis between 2016 and 2017."

The tournament has been held every year since 1979, except for 1992–93.\nIt is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. The winner, declared conference champion, receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament, as long as it is eligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play. The eligibility issue applied in both 2021 and 2022, with each final featuring a team representing a transitional member of Division I (North Alabama in 2021 and Bellarmine in 2022). Under NCAA rules, a school transitioning from NCAA Division II is not eligible for NCAA-sponsored D-I postseason play (either the NCAA tournament or the NIT) during its four-year transitional period. North Alabama began its transition in July 2018 and was thus ineligible for the NCAA tournament or NIT through the 2021–22 season; Bellarmine began its transition in July 2020 and is thus ineligible for said events through 2023–24. Should a transitional school win the tournament, ASUN rules call for the regular-season champion to receive the automatic bid. North Alabama lost its final, making the issue moot for 2021, but Bellarmine won in 2022, giving Jacksonville State that season's automatic bid.\nThe Atlantic Sun tournament is the earliest of the NCAA Division I men's tournaments and its champion is the first to lock in an NCAA bid.\nPerformance by school.\n\"Teams in bold are ASUN members as of the upcoming 2023–24 NCAA basketball season.\""

        "text": "Ronald Thomas Campbell (April 5, 1940 – February 2, 2023) was an American right-handed infielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs.\nAfter spending some time at Tennessee Wesleyan College, Campbell was signed by the Cubs as a free agent in 1960. He toiled in the minor leagues for a few seasons before getting his first opportunity with the Cubs on September 1, 1964. After going 0-for-8 in his first two contests, Campbell singled off Cincinnati Reds pitcher John Tsitouris in his first at-bat on September 3, 1964, not only recording his first major league hit, but also his first RBI as teammate Len Gabrielson scored from third to give the Cubs a 1–0 lead. The Cubs went on to win 3–0, giving Campbell credit for the game-winning RBI.\nIn lieu of Joey Amalfitano, Campbell went on to start at second base for all but two of the Cubs' remaining games that season, sharing the field with future Hall of Famers Billy Williams and Ernie Banks. He hit his first and only major league home run on September 6 of that season against the St. Louis Cardinals' Ray Sadecki. Another highlight of his first month in the majors was collecting his first three-hit game on September 23 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Campbell finished his brief 1964 campaign with the Cubs with a batting average of .272, six doubles, a triple, a home run, and 10 RBI in just 92 at-bats.\nHowever, 1965 saw Campbell back in the minors for almost the entire season. His only appearances with the Cubs were as a pinch-hitter in each game of a September 12 doubleheader against the San Francisco Giants.\nCampbell was with the Cubs for two stints during the 1966 season; first from late June to mid-July, and again from late August through the end of the season. He played both third base and shortstop during this time with the club, spelling Ron Santo and Don Kessinger. However, he did not fare nearly as well as in 1964, batting only .217 with one double, no triples or home runs, and four RBI. On his final day as a major leaguer, Campbell recorded his second and last three-hit game, collecting three singles against the New York Mets on September 28 in the first game of a doubleheader (he went 0-for-4 in the second game, however). He never appeared in the major leagues again.\nFor his career, Campbell hit .247 with a home run and 14 RBI.\nCampbell died February 2, 2023."

He played two games in the outfield for the 1871 Fort Wayne Kekiongas and seven games as pitcher for the 1872 Brooklyn Eckfords.\nMcDermott previously played for the Eckfords in the second of that club's professional seasons, 1870. While the team won 2, tied 1, and lost 12 pro matches, he was the regular pitcher. Overall, he appeared in 20 games on record, one behind the team leaders, and he was an ordinary batter in the company of his teammates."

        "text": "Arcade Hoops Basketball (also called Arcade Hoops) is a basketball video game developed and published by Skyworks Interactive. It was released as a download-only title on April 17, 2009 for the iOS and on December 28, 2009 for the Nintendo DSi via the DSiWare service. This was the first game developed and published by Skyworks Interactive.\nGameplay.\nThe game is similar to the basketball minigames found in arcades and midways. In the game, players use the iPhone or Nintendo DSi device to attempt to score as many baskets as possible within 45 seconds. This involves players having to hold the basketball by touching it on the touchscreen and then shoot the ball by flicking toward the top of the touchscreen. The game involves three different modes of gameplay – shooting from short distance, from medium distance, or from the three-point line. The game has a feature in which the highest scores in each mode are saved. The game also gives players the option to either shoot at a stationary basket or at a basket that moves back and forth toward the player.\nDevelopment.\n\"Arcade Hoops Basketball\" was developed by Garry Kitchen, who developed \"Donkey Kong\" for the Atari 2600 and \"Activision Gamemaker\". According to an interview with Pocket Gamer Kitchen said that \"Arcade Hoops Basketball\" was intended to be more of \"a web casual game rather than a console title\". Kitchen worked on the game by himself and in his spare time as the other members of Skyworks were busy working on other games. The game took six weeks to write and complete."

        "title": "1968 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1968 Rose Bowl was the 54th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 1. The USC Trojans of the Pacific-8 Conference defeated the Indiana Hoosiers of the Big Ten Conference, 14–3. USC tailback O. J. Simpson was named the Player of the Game.\nTeams.\nThrough , this remains the only Rose Bowl appearance for Indiana. USC was a two touchdown favorite; this was the first Rose Bowl in fifteen years in which the West Coast team was favored. In the intervening fourteen games, the Big Ten had won ten and lost four (1960, 1961, 1963, 1966).\nBeing an even-numbered year for the bowl game, Indiana wore their crimson jerseys as the home team and USC wore their white shirts as the designated visitors.\nUSC.\nThe top-ranked and Pac-8 champion Trojans came into the game with a 9–1 record, losing only at Oregon State in the November mud in a close 3–0 game. They fell to fourth in the AP poll, then reclaimed the top spot a week later after a close 21–20 win over rival and then-#1 UCLA in their heavily-anticipated conference finale, securing another trip to the Big Ten/Pac-8 classic. Runner-up Oregon State had a conference loss (at Washington) and a tie (at UCLA), and the deflated UCLA Bruins lost again the following week 32–14 at home to non-conference Syracuse.\nThe Trojans were led by their powerful junior tailback O. J. Simpson, a junior college transfer from San Francisco. Unlike the Big Ten and the old Pacific Coast Conference, the Pac-8 did not have a \"no-repeat\" rule; this was the second of four consecutive Rose Bowl appearances for the Trojans.\nIndiana.\nThe fourth-ranked and co-Big Ten champion Hoosiers also came into the game with a 9–1 record, losing to Minnesota, a week before defeating Purdue. A three-way league title championship was created when all three finished with 6–1 league records, each defeating and losing to one of the other. Purdue was ineligible because of the \"no-repeat\" rule by the Big Ten and the \"Rose Bowl or no bowl\" rule enforced by both of the participating conferences (Big Ten and AAWU). Purdue had played in Pasadena the previous year, beating USC by a point, 14–13.\nThe conference's athletic directors voted to award the Rose Bowl bid to Indiana over Minnesota, albeit not unanimously. Indiana was considered the logical choice because they were the only Big Ten school yet to appear in the game. Minnesota coach Murray Warmath argued in vain that the Gophers deserved the bid because their prior two Rose Bowl teams, after the 1960 and 1961 seasons, received at-large bids because there was no agreement between the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl at the time; thus, technically, the Gophers never had received a Rose Bowl bid pursuant to that arrangement. Ironically, if Purdue had beaten Indiana in the season finale, the Boilermakers would have had sole possession of the conference championship, but Minnesota presumably would have received the Rose Bowl bid as the second place team in lieu of the ineligible Boilers. Instead, Indiana scored a 19–14 upset over Purdue, giving Minnesota a share of the conference championship but costing them a trip to Pasadena. Quarterback Harry Gonso led the Hoosiers into their first ever bowl game."

The 1967–68 team tied for the Big Ten Title with Ohio State with a 10–4 conference record, and a 16–9 overall record.

        "title": "2005 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team",
        "text": "The 2005 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team was Mike Anderson's third year as head coach. The Huskers played their home games at Hawks Field.\n2004.\nNebraska posted a 36–23 record, with 14 of the losses being by two runs or less as they barely missed their first NCAA regional\nappearance since 1998. However, the Huskers were the only Big 12 team not shut out during the whole season, and they established a school record and ranked eighth nationally with a .975 fielding percentage shattering the previous best of .971. A few honors include Big 12 player of the years and first-team All-American third baseman Alex Gordon and All-Big 12 selections Zach Kroenke, Curtis Ledbetter and Joe Simokaitis.\nSeason review.\nSummary\nWhile the 2005 Nebraska baseball season will be remembered for many things, it was the never-say-die attitude that captured the hearts of Husker fans around the state.\nHeading into the final weekend of the season, the Huskers were two games behind Baylor in the conference race. Nebraska won its first two games against Kansas State, while Baylor and Missouri split their first two contests, putting the Huskers in position to earn a share of the league crown. Behind Kroenke's complete-game gem on Senior Day, Nebraska posted a 3–1 victory, while Missouri capped NU's title hopes by beating Baylor in Waco later that day, giving the two teams a share of the Big 12 crown. The two teams would meet one week later with the Big 12 Tournament title on the line. The game was scoreless until the sixth when Andy Gerch's sacrifice fly plated Gordon for the game's only run. Duensing and Jensen combined on a three-hit shutout to give NU a 1–0 win over the Bears and the Huskers’ fourth Big 12 Tourney crown since 1999 and winning the regular-season and tournament titles in the same season for the second time in school history (2001).\nNever was the Huskers’ true spirit more evident than on college baseball's grandest stage – the College World Series in Omaha. Trailing 5–3 in the ninth inning, the Huskers were down to their last at-bat, looking to extend the most successful season in school history. As they had done 20 times during the season, Nebraska began to rally, opening the inning with two hits before Alex Gordon's RBI single pulled NU within 5-4. Two batters later, freshman Andy Gerch provided one of the most memorable moments in school history, sending an 0–2 pitch into the left-field bleachers, giving the Huskers a 7–5 lead. Alas, the lead was short-lived, as Arizona State scored twice in the bottom of the ninth – including a game-tying homer by Jeff Larish – before ending one of the most memorable games in recent CWS history two innings later for an 8–7 ASU win.\nFor Head Coach Mike Anderson, the heart shown by the Huskers was a characteristic that he saw develop throughout the year. \"This was a resilient group all year long,\" Anderson said. \"We fought and fought, and it didn’t surprise me at all that we scored those runs in the ninth.\" While its resiliency allowed the Huskers to never be out of a contest, Anderson credited the team's selflessness as the catalyst for going from eighth to first in the Big 12 and returning to the College World Series for the first time since 2002.\nFor Nebraska's eight seniors, 2005 capped a remarkable five-year run in which NU won 237 games, claimed three Big 12 titles and made three College World Series appearances.\n\"We’re at the World Series this year because we had a group of young men that gave of themselves for their team,\" Anderson said. \"It's the most unique group of young men that I’ve ever been around. They bought into the team concept. They understood the team concept and got to where they are at because of the team concept. I can’t say how proud I am of them.\"\nA total of six Huskers were selected in the Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft, including four players in the top 10 rounds. Alex Gordon became Nebraska's fifth first-round pick, as he was chosen by Kansas City with the No. 2 overall pick. Brian Duensing and Zach Kroenke joined Gordon as players taken in the first five rounds, as they were picked in the third and fifth rounds, respectively. The trio's selections marked the first time that three Huskers were taken in the first five rounds of the draft.\nPitching\nNebraska relied on the combination of a dominant pitching staff, strong defense and clutch hitting to put together a 57–15 record and sweep the Big 12 regular season and tournament titles en route to a berth in the College World Series. The 57 wins not only led the nation, but easily topped the previous school mark of 51 set in 2000. The Huskers finished the year ranked as high as fifth in the national polls after opening the year at No. 50 in Baseball America's preseason issue. Also, their No. 2 ranking in Baseball America heading into the College World Series is its highest in any national poll since the 2001 season (a year the Huskers were ranked first for two weeks by Baseball America).\nOn the mound, Nebraska put together one of the most dominant staffs in Big 12 history. The Huskers ranked second nationally with a Big 12-low 2.69 ERA, the best by a Husker staff since 1969, holding 54 of its 72 opponents to four runs or less tying for the second lowest single-season ERA in school history. It also finished .03 off the Big 12 mark of 2.66 set by Texas in 2004. NU set single-season records for wins (57), saves (23) and strikeouts (538), while holding opponents to a .227 average. The heart of the staff was a four-man rotation of right-handers Joba Chamberlain and Johnny Dorn and southpaws Brian Duensing and Zach Kroenke. They won 15 straight decisions until Johnny Dorn's loss to Florida on June 19 at the College World Series. The quartet combined for a 37–6 record, as all earned All-Big 12 honors in 2005.\nA transfer from Division II Nebraska-Kearney, Chamberlain took the Big 12 by storm, going 10–2 with a 2.81 ERA en route to third-team All-America honors. The Big 12 Newcomer of the Year and a first-team all league pick, Chamberlain was second in the Big 12 with 130 strikeouts and ranked in the top 10 in seven categories. The sophomore right-hander recorded five double-digit strikeout performances, including 15 against New Mexico in just his second start as a Husker. Chamberlain saved his best performance of the year until the Super Regional against Miami, which he fanned 13 and allowed one run over eight innings to out-duel Cesar Carillo in a 3–1 win.\nDorn became one of the Big 12's top freshmen, going 12–2 to capture third-team All-America honors. The Big 12 Freshman of the Year and a first-team all conference selection, Dorn went 12–2 with a 2.16 ERA, tying for the league lead in wins and ranking among the top five in the Big 12 in wins, ERA and opponent batting average. Dorn was superb in conference play, going 5–0 with a 2.08 ERA, as he earned the clinching win in five of NU's eight series victories.\nDuensing returned from missing nearly two full seasons with an elbow injury to post an 8–0 record and earn All-Big 12 honors. Duensing split time between the rotation and the bullpen, but saved his best effort for the Big 12 title game, when he tossed 7.2 innings of shutout ball, as NU blanked Baylor, 1-0, to win the conference tournament title.\nKroenke rounded out the quartet, going 7–2 with a 2.82 ERA to pick up second-team all-conference accolades. The Omaha native saved his best efforts for NU's biggest moments, tossing a complete game against Kansas State to help clinch the Big 12 title. Two weeks later, Kroenke struck out a career-high 13 in a complete-game masterpiece against Creighton in the regional title game.\nWhile NU's rotation was the envy of much of college baseball, the Huskers also relied on a talented bullpen led by closer Brett Jensen. The junior ranked third in the country with 16 saves to earn All-Big 12 honors, while set-up man Dustin Timm also earned All-Big 12 honors.\nOffense\nOffensively, the Huskers were led by the leadership and all-around abilities of third baseman Alex Gordon. A two-time All-American, Gordon etched his name in Husker history by becoming the first NU baseball player to be named national player of the year. The junior from Lincoln hit .372 with 19 homers, 66 RBIs and 23 stolen bases, as he topped the Big 12 in six categories and became the first player in seven years to repeat as conference player of the year.\nGordon was one of four hitters to receive All-Big 12 honors in 2005. Senior first baseman Curtis Ledbetter garnered first-team All-Big 12 honors, hitting .319 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs. He ranked fourth in the Big 12 in homers and was named MVP of the Big 12 Tournament, leading NU back to its fourth conference tournament title since 1999.\nWhile Gordon and Ledbetter provided most of the offensive firepower, seniors Joe Simokaitis and Daniel Bruce provided leadership with their relentless aggressiveness on the field to instrumental roles in 2005.\nSimokaitis finished his career as the Big 12's alltime leader in assists and routinely made spectacular plays look routine. A 10th-round pick in the MLB Draft, Simokaitis put together the best offensive year of his career, hitting .310 with three homers, 37 RBIs and 18 stolen bases.\nBruce shined in both the classroom and on the diamond in 2005. A second-team CoSIDA Academic All-American, he was named Nebraska's Male Student-Athlete of the Year and earned an NCAA postgraduate scholarship. Bruce also hit .322 with five homers and 32 RBIs to earn All-Big 12 honors.\nFans also turned out in record numbers to watch the Huskers in 2005, as NU averaged a school-record 4,984 fans per home game to rank sixth nationally. Hawks Field drew seven of its 10 largest crowds in 2005, highlighted by a school-record crowd of 8,771 for the Super Regional clinching win over Miami. NU enjoyed immense success at home, going 33–4 at its home park, including a perfect 5–0 during the NCAA tournament breaking the previous single-season home mark for wins of 29 set five times (1980, 1988, 2002, 2003 and 2008).\nWhile Nebraska was dominant at home, the Huskers put themselves in position to reach the postseason with success on the road. NU went 15–6 in road games during the regular season, a total that ranked third nationally. In Big 12 play, the Huskers stayed in contention for the league title, going 8–4 away from Hawks Field and winning every conference road series for the first time since 1938.\nNine of Nebraska's 15 losses this season were by one run, as the Huskers finished 11–9 in one-run games. After having just one multi-homer game in 2004, Nebraska had eight this season, including four by first baseman/catcher Curtis Ledbetter and two by All-American third baseman Alex Gordon.\nStats.\nHitting\nPitching\nAwards.\nMike Anderson\nJeremy Becker\nDaniel Bruce\nJoba Chamberlain\nJohnny Dorn\nBrian Duensing\nAndy Gerch\nAlex Gordon\nBrett Jensen\nZach Kroenke\nCurtis Ledbetter\nPhil Shirek\nJoe Simokaitis\nDustin Timm\nTony Watson\nRyan Wehrle\nHuskers in the MLB Draft.\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008"

        "text": "Joseph Patrick Rogers Sr. (September 30, 1924 – April 1, 2011) was an American football player and coach. He served as the interim head football coach at Villanova University for the final six games of the 1959 season, compiling a record of 1–5, including the team's only win of the season.\nHigh School Career.\nJoe Rogers was named all-scholastic athlete for both football and basketball at Roman Catholic High School in Philadelphia. He played under Jordan Olivar, who served as a mentor for much of Joe's professional career.\nCollege career.\nAfter serving in the US Coast Guard from 1943 to 1945, Rogers entered Villanova University as a freshman in 1946 where he played halfback for the Wildcats.\nRogers led the Wildcats in both scoring and rushing in 1946 with seven touchdowns for 42 points and 90 carries for 620 yards. As a freshman, he averaged 6.9 yards per carry which ranked 12th nationally.\nIn a game against Detroit on September 30, 1949, Rogers’ senior year, he caught an 83-yard touchdown pass from Stephen Romanik. This play still ranks as the second longest pass play in Villanova football history.\nDuring Rogers’ four-year playing career, Villanova tallied a 28–10 record and played in two bowl games, including the 1947 Great Lakes Bowl, in which he served as Captain (24-14 win over Kentucky) and the 1948 Harbor Bowl (27-7 loss to Nevada).\nRogers was inducted into the Villanova Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1979.\nCoaching career.\nWaldron Academy.\nRogers served as athletic director and head football coach at Waldron Academy from 1950 to 1952.\nVillanova University.\nFreshman Coach (1952-1955).\nRogers was the freshman coach from 1952 to 1955. In addition to coaching, Rogers was largely responsible for all scouting duties associated with the team. He had tremendous success with Villanova's freshman eleven.\nVarsity Backfield Coach (1955-1959).\nIn August 1955, Rogers was promoted to varsity backfield coach after the job was vacated by Bob Snyder, who had accepted an assistant coaching position with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nInterim Head Coach and Professional Scouting (1959-1960).\nIn October 1959, Villanova head coach, Frank Reagan, stepped down and appointed Joe, his first assistant, to serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. That year, Rogers coached Villanova to its only victory of the season.\nJoe was offered the permanent head coaching position in 1960, but turned down the offer. He also turned down several coaching offers, including one in Canada, to remain at Villanova as Coordinator of Alumni Programs. He also worked as a scout for the Green Bay Packers during this time.\nVarsity Backfield Coach (1961-1966).\nFrank Reagan convinced Joe to come back to Villanova as Varsity Backfield Coach in 1961. He resigned in 1966 at the age of 41.\nProfessional.\nIn 1966, Rogers resigned from his Villanova position to accept a backfield coaching position for the Atlantic City Senators in the ACFL. He coached many household names here, including: Tom Urbanik, former Penn State fullback; Glynn Griffing, former reserve quarterback of the New York Giants, and Mark Lichtenfeld, formerly of Temple University.\nRogers then went on to work as defensive coach for the Philadelphia Bulldogs of the Continental Football League under the direction of Wayne Hardin.\nAfter a stint as defensive coach for the Pottstown Firebirds, Rogers was promoted to defensive coordinator in March 1969. Firebirds head coach, Dave DiFilippo, credited Rogers with the team's successful 1968 season and called Rogers \"the best defensive coach in the ACFL.\" In 1969, the Firebirds won the ACFL Championship 31–0 against the Hartford Knights.\nRogers permanently retired from full-time coaching in 1970, citing frequent travel as the main reason. Rogers noted his desire to spend more time at home with his wife and nine children.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from full-time coaching in 1970, Rogers went on to have a successful career as a sales manager for Independence Blue Cross. He was also a frequently sought after public speaker, presiding over many Philadelphia-area athletic ceremonies and conferences.Joe was inducted into the Villanova Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1979. Joe Rogers died on April 1, 2011, at his home in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, leaving behind 9 children, 30 grandchildren, and many great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife Nora (née Cassidy) in 2009."

        "text": "Noel Morgan (born 1940 in Brisbane, Queensland) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer. He first played for the Easts (Brisbane) in Queensland as a junior and then as a senior player in the Brisbane Rugby League, debuting at the age of 19 in 1959 at the end of the season, representing Brisbane on a number of occasions against a touring International side and in the Bulimba Cup against the Toowoomba and Ipswich representative sides. At age 22 at the end of the 1962 BRL season, he was signed by West End Athletic in the Townsville Rugby League Competition for several seasons and later with a Cairns Rugby League club, representing both Townsville and Cairns in the famous Foley Shield, which led to making the North Queensland representative side on a number of occasion playing the Brisbane rep team and playing against touring International sides. He played against England, France and New Zealand touring test sides. His position of choice was usually always at the back at fullback.\nEasts Tigers.\nMorgan was a fullback with Brisbane club, Easts Tigers from 1959 to 1962. He was named in the former Brisbane Rugby League rugby league club and now Queensland Cup club's official \"75 Year Dream Team\" on 24 June 2008.\nThe club's only success in the 1960s was due to a match winning try from Noel Morgan, \"The only real success the A grade team enjoyed in the early sixties was the winning of the Peter Scott Memorial Trophy in 1960 played between the two leading teams at the end of the second competition round.\"\nThe following report is from the BRL program of 27 and 28 July 1960 in the Famous Flashbacks section. It details the game played between the two leading teams at the end of the second round of the competition. The competition in those days was three round and eight teams and they were still playing unlimited tackle and the three yards rule in defence.\n\"A dramatic finish can turn an ordinary football match into something to remember but when a match is brilliant throughout with the drama of a last minute try for victory, it becomes a match of a lifetime. And the 1960 Peter Scott Memorial final between Easts and Valleys at Lang Park was such an encounter. It was a match which was wide open until the final hooter sounded and Easts had won 13 – 10. Easts snatched the 1960 Peter Scott Memorial final with only seconds of play remaining when Easts Bulimba Cup fullback, Noel Morgan, flashed over for a try. This gave Easts an 11 – 10 lead but Easts halfback, Stan Neave, made sure of the victory when he converted the try for a final score of 13 – 10. The match was the best of the year and the brand of football played through by both teams made a draw seem like a fair result according to reports.\"\nTownsville.\nHe played with West End Athletic rugby league football club for 2 seasons from 1963.\nExert from the club's website: \"Late in the 50s, early 60s we won the Club Championship several times, as well as premierships in the lower grades. Outstanding players of that era were; Pat Payers, Pat Eales, George Church, Bevan Hoyle, Col McElligott, Mal Lindsay, Dave Parkin, John and Graham Weir, Les Wilson, Bill Cumner, Bob Mitting, Lyle Humphries, Mick Hill, George Madsen and Noel Morgan.\"\nFoley Shield.\nNoel Morgan represented both Townsville and Cairns within a 5-year period from 1963 to 1968, while winning the shield on a number of occasions."

Clancy refereed the 2007 Churchill Cup final and the 2009 and 2011 European Challenge Cup finals. Between 2013 and 2017 Clancy also served as a touch judge/assistant referee at five consecutive European Rugby Champions Cup finals.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Clancy is the son of Seoirse and Helen Clancy. He was raised in Bruff and he is the great grandnephew of George Clancy, a former Mayor of Limerick killed during the Irish War of Independence. Clancy was educated at St Munchin's College, where his fellow pupils included Marcus Horan and Jerry Flannery. He played rugby union for both St Munchin's and Bruff R.F.C. He also played both gaelic football and hurling for Bruff GAA. Clancy also represented Limerick at hurling. Clancy only gave up playing hurling when he was offered an IRFU refereeing contract which prohibited him playing sports that might result in an injury. He remains a hurling fan and he was attending a match between Bruff GAA and Ballybrown GAA when he received a phone call from Paddy O'Brien inviting him to referee the opening match of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Clancy has a master's degree in international relations and worked as a tax official with the Revenue Commissioners before becoming a full-time referee.

Seoirse Clancy was involved with Bruff R.F.C. and had refereed at a local level. He encouraged his son to take up refereeing after injuries, including a broken leg, prevented him from playing rugby union at a top level.

He also refereed the 2010–11 European Challenge Cup final between Harlequins and \nStade Français.\nBetween 2013 and 2017 Clancy also served as a touch judge/assistant referee at five consecutive European Rugby Champions Cup finals.\nEarly internationals.\nClancy refereed at the 2004 FIRA Women's European Championship and at the 2005 and 2006 Under 21 Rugby World Championships. He made his senior international debut on 30 September 2006 when he took charge of a 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifier between Uruguay and the United States.

Clancy refereed three pool stage matches at the 2015 tournament.\nControversies and incidents.\nDuring his refereeing career Clancy has been involved in several controversies and incidents. On his Six Nations Championship debut on 14 February 2009, Clancy awarded a try to France's Fulgence Ouedraogo against Scotland. Replays showed the final pass from Maxime Médard was forward. However, Clancy had been knocked to the ground in the move building up to the score. He consulted with his assistant before confirming the try.\nOn 5 December 2009, after refereeing an All-Ireland League match between Shannon and Cork Constitution, Clancy was verbally abused by Shannon supporters and club officials. Among the alleged abusers was Gerry McLoughlin. After the match had finished Martin Clancy, the Shannon president, entered the referees dressing room and continued to verbally abuse the referee. He was eventually removed by the two touch judges. Shannon were subsequently fined €25,000.\nOn 13 February 2010 during a match between Wales and Scotland, Clancy sin-binned Scotland's Phil Godman for an alleged off-the-ball trip on Lee Byrne. Byrne was later accused of deliberately diving to help Wales win.\nOn 10 April 2010, during a 2009–10 Heineken Cup quarter-final, between Biarritz and Ospreys, Clancy refused to award Ospreys a penalty towards the end of the match after an alleged knock-on by Biarritz's scrum-half, Dimitri Yachvili. The decision denied Ospreys a potential victory.\nOn 6 September 2014 Clancy refereed a match between Australia and South Africa. Clancy yellow carded South Africa's Bryan Habana for a high tackle on Adam Ashley-Cooper in the 65th minute. According to Paul Cully of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"\nthe decision was incorrect and was \"the defining moment\" of the match, costing South Africa a potential victory.\nOn 16 September 2017 Clancy was serving as a touch judge during a 2017–18 Pro14 match between Cardiff Blues and Glasgow Warriors. A disgruntled Cardiff Blues fan threw his pint of beer at Clancy because he allegedly was unhappy with a decision made by the officials. The act was caught on camera and the fan was quickly escorted from the ground."

        "text": "College of Charleston Baseball Stadium at Patriots Point is a baseball venue located in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. It is home to the College of Charleston Cougars baseball team, a member of the Division I Colonial Athletic Association. \nThe venue is located across Charleston Harbor from the campus of the college. The field was constructed for the start of the 2001 season, adjacent to the College of Charleston soccer and softball fields. Since the ballpark opened in 2001, the Cougars have compiled a winning percentage of over .700.\nNotable History.\nAfter the ballpark's original opening in 2001, the facility underwent a $3 million renovation in 2007 that expanded the press box to include two radio/television booths, partially covered the seating areas, and increased the seating capacity to 2,000. The site also includes locker rooms, a club house, an athletic training facility, practice field and a 4,200 square foot indoor practice facility.\nThe ballpark saw its attendance record broken in 2012, when Charleston hosted then No. 10 South Carolina Gamecocks at Patriots Point.\nIn May 2015, the Colonial Athletic Association, of which Charleston is a member, hosted the first of two conference baseball championships at Patriots Point, the second coming in May 2016. The Patriots Point stadium is the third largest baseball facility in the CAA, behind Northeastern and UNCW.\nIn late May 2015, the College of Charleston announced their plans to design a new athletics facility at Patriots Point. While the main addition would be a three-story athletic building adjacent to the ballpark, the plans also include the expansion of seating down the third base line at the baseball stadium. The new athletics building, which would be down the left field line of the baseball stadium, would include a weight room and sports medicine facility, locker rooms, coaches’ offices, academic spaces and a viewing deck overlooking the baseball and soccer fields."

        "text": "The All-American Basketball Alliance (AABA) was announced on January 19, 2010 by Don \"Moose\" Lewis as an all-white basketball league, with players reportedly required to be \"natural-born United States citizens\", and whose parents must both be \"of the Caucasian race\". The initial roster of the league was intended to include teams from twelve cities in the southern U.S. Lewis, who was interviewed by Scott Michaux of the \"Augusta Chronicle\", said that one of the objectives of the AABA was restoring \"court sanity\" to the game of basketball.\nPlans.\nLewis claimed that local contacts in each of the twelve targeted cities, including Augusta, Georgia; Albany, Georgia; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, would pay $10,000 to become \"licensees\" of the league.\nLewis also hinted at a possible reality television show, \"Snow Ball vs. Bro Ball\", involving the league.\nThere is no evidence that Lewis ever followed through on any of these plans.\nInitial reception.\nOne of the cities intended to be a part of the AABA was Augusta, Georgia. Augusta's mayor, Deke Copenhaver, stated that he did not support the idea: \"As a sports enthusiast, I have always supported bringing more sporting activities to Augusta. However, in this instance I could not support in good conscience bringing in a team that did not fit with the spirit of inclusiveness that I, along with many others, have worked so hard to foster in our city.\" Clint Bryant, athletic director at Augusta State University, described the idea for the league as \"absurd\", and noted that it \"gives you an idea of the sickness of our society.\" Dip Metress, head men's basketball director at ASU, also opposed the idea, saying \"nobody is going to put money behind this. Basketball is an international game.\" Chattanooga, Tennessee was another city targeted by Lewis' plan; a spokesman for Chattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield described Lewis' plan as \"absolutely ridiculous\", but also added that he was unaware of anything the City could do to actually stop it.\nCritics commented on the irony of a whites-only basketball league being announced on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; former NBA star Charles Barkley called the idea of the AABA \"blatantly racist.\"\nDon Lewis, the founder of the AABA and formerly a Georgia-based boxing and wrestling promoter, responded by saying that he did not \"hate anyone of color\" but that he felt that white people should be given their own league to play \"fundamental basketball, which they like\" instead of the \"street ball\" he said is played by nonwhites. He claimed that \"white basketball players are essentially 'shut out' of conventional professional basketball due to the proliferation of non-organized play on the court\" and cited Gilbert Arenas' suspension for bringing guns into the Washington Wizards' locker room as an example of the way basketball was being run, commenting \"That's the culture today, and in a free country we should have the right to move ourselves in a better direction.\" Lewis claimed to have received threats from people opposed to the AABA's whites-only policy. Besides Augusta, several other cities warned Lewis and the AABA to \"stay out of town\". Because of the negative attention toward the league, Don Lewis' nephew Ralph said that the physical address of its Atlanta, Georgia office would not be made public.\nReverend R. L. White, president of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the AABA as \"ridiculous\" and said \"it attempts to set back what we've been trying to do for 100 years.\" White said he was worried that the all-white basketball league might set off racial tensions, and added, \"If we can do anything to stop it, we will.\"\n\"The Daily Show\" did a feature on the AABA on March 29, 2010 interviewing Don Lewis, using the show's satirical approach in covering the topic."

There was critical analysis that this Vuelta, which commemorates the 75th anniversary of the first edition of the race, was an especially difficult one and that stage 16 was the queen stage.\nThe stage 1 team time trial was held at night.\nVuelta runner-up Ezequiel Mosquera and teammate David García Dapena were announced on September 30 to have given positive tests for hydroxyethyl starch during the race, a substance which is known as a masking agent for erythropoietin (EPO). All results from Mosquera after 12 September (stage 15) were annulled, which caused him to lose his second place. García later was announced to have tested positive for EPO during the race as well.\nTeams.\nSixteen teams were automatically selected due to previous agreements and there were six wildcard places. Three of these were given to UCI Professional Continental teams, and three to UCI ProTour teams.\nTeam RadioShack was not invited despite having a ProTour license.\nStages.\n\"For details see 2010 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2010 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21\"\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2010 Vuelta a España, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding the finishing times of the stages per cyclist after deduction of time bonuses for high placings in stage finishes and at intermediate sprints, the leader received a red jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Vuelta a España, and the winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the Vuelta.\nAdditionally, there was also a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The winner got 25 points, second place 20, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point per place less down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. In addition, some points were won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a blue-spotted white jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, either first, second, third or \"special\" category, the last of which is equivalent to the Hors catégorie rating used in races such as the Tour de France.\nFinally, there was the combination classification. This is calculated by adding the rankings in the general, points and mountains classifications; the cyclist with the lowest combined ranking is the leader in the combination classification, and receives a white jersey.\nThere was also a classification for teams. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per stage were added, and the team with the lowest time is the leader.\n1 Initially, the team time trial gave points toward the points classification. These points were later removed.\n2 All results from Mosquera after 12 September (stage 15) were originally annulled. However this was overturned by a Spanish Court."

He began his professional basketball career with the Harlem Globetrotters, then played in the NBA from 1958 to 1962 as a member of the Philadelphia Warriors and Chicago Packers. He averaged 9.8 points over his NBA career, posting a high of 14.3 points per game with the Packers in the 1961–62 season.\nTo Johnson's surprise, he was cut by Chicago before the 1962–63 season began, allegedly because he \"didn't know the plays\". He then joined the Philadelphia Tapers of the American Basketball League. Johnson hoped to return to the NBA after a season with the Tapers, but such an opportunity never materialized. He played eight more years in the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL) / Eastern Basketball Association (EBA). Johnson was named as the EPBL Most Valuable Player with the Allentown Jets in 1964. He served as player-coach of the Camden Bullets during the 1970–71 season and led the team to a 12–16 record.\nBecause he had been cut by the Chicago Packers before his fifth NBA season, he did not qualify for a pension from the NBA, though after some effort, he managed to receive some money from them later in his life.\nJohnson is the subject of a 2010 biography called \"Basketball Slave\". The book was written by his son, Mark, who believed his father had been exploited throughout his athletic career on account of his ethnicity.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball managers",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner's office. Since that time, MLB has operated as a single league. Composed of 30 teams, MLB is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.\nEach team in the league has a manager who is responsible for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.\nAs of the end of the 2023 MLB regular season, the longest-tenured active manager with the same team in Major League Baseball is Kevin Cash, who has led the Tampa Bay Rays of the American League since 2015. The longest-tenured active manager with the same team in the National League is Craig Counsell, who led the Milwaukee Brewers since 2015 until he signed with the Chicago Cubs following the 2023 postseason. The New York Mets, San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Guardians and the Los Angeles Angels will begin the 2024 season with new managers.\nConnie Mack holds the Major League Baseball record for most games won as a manager, with 3,731, and most managed with 7,755. The all-time leaders in championships won in the World Series era (1903–present) are Joe McCarthy and Casey Stengel, who each won seven championships with the New York Yankees.\nNational League.\nEastern Division.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves National League franchise originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1871. The team has employed 45 managers, who have led the team in three different cities: Boston (1871–1952), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1953–1965), and Atlanta (1966–present). The first manager was Harry Wright. The longest-tenured manager is Bobby Cox, who retired at the end of the 2010 season. Cox served as skipper of the Braves for 21 consecutive seasons (1990–2010), and holds the major league record for managerial ejections, with 151. Cox' win–loss record was 2,058–1,638 with the Braves (he previously managed the Toronto Blue Jays). He won four Manager of the Year Awards (1985, 1991, 2004–2005) and led the Braves to 14 consecutive division titles (3 in the National League West and 11 in the East; 1991–2005 excluding the 1994 strike-shortened season), winning one World Series in 1995. Fredi González succeeded Cox as manager. Gonzalez was fired on May 17, 2016. On May 17, 2016, the Atlanta Braves named Brian Snitker as their interim manager and the 47th manager in club history. He was named permanent manager on October 11, 2016.\nMiami Marlins.\nThe Marlins franchise entered the National League in 1993 as an expansion team and was known as the Florida Marlins until 2011. The franchise's first manager was Rene Lachemann, who accumulated 285 losses during his four-season tenure. Jim Leyland and Jack McKeon each guided the team to World Series victories, in 1997 and 2003, respectively; however, the team has never won a division title. Marlins managers have never lost a playoff series, and Miami is the only franchise in Major League Baseball to accomplish the feat. McKeon is the franchise leader in wins (281). Joe Girardi won the Manager of the Year Award in his only season managing the Marlins (2006). He is the only manager to win the award while fielding a team with a losing record, and he's the only manager to win with a team that finished in fourth place in its division. Jack McKeon was named the team's interim manager in 2011, having been named to the position following the mid-season resignation of Edwin Rodríguez. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, the Marlins hired Ozzie Guillén to be their manager for the 2012 season; however, he was fired following his first season. The Marlins then named Mike Redmond as their manager. Redmond was subsequently fired on May 17, 2015 and replaced by Dan Jennings on an interim basis. After the 2015 season, Don Mattingly signed a four-year contract to become the club's 15th manager. On September 25, 2022, Mattingly stated that he and the Marlins mutually agreed that he would finish the season as manager, and not return to the role in 2023. On October 25, 2022, Skip Schumaker was hired as team's manager.\nNew York Mets.\nThe successor to two previous National League franchises in New York City (the Giants and the Dodgers), the New York Mets have existed since 1962 and have played in Queens since 1964, when they vacated the Polo Grounds in Manhattan and moved to Shea Stadium. Casey Stengel was the first of twenty managers. Gil Hodges led the team to their first championship in the 1969 World Series. Davey Johnson is the franchise leader in regular-season wins, with 595 during his seven-season tenure, and he led the Mets to their most recent title in the memorable 1986 World Series. Bobby Valentine managed the team during their next deep playoff run to the 2000 World Series. Terry Collins holds the record for most games managed at 1134, and his Mets record was 551–583. Combined with his managerial tenures with the Houston Astros and Anaheim Angels, his record was 995–1017. The Mets made the playoffs in Collins' fifth season as manager, and played in the 2015 World Series.

Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, and is the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired in October 2014, and he was replaced by Paul Molitor. Molitor himself was fired following the 2018 season. On October 25, 2018, Rocco Baldelli was hired as the 31st and current manager of the club.\nWestern Division.\nHouston Astros.\nThe city of Houston, Texas was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League in 1962 after the dissolution of the Continental League. The team, which began play as the Colt .45s, changed its name to the Houston Astros in 1965. The team's first manager was Harry Craft, while the first manager under the Astros moniker was Grady Hatton. Bill Virdon is the all-time leader for the most regular-season games managed (1,066) and wins (544), while Phil Garner had won the second most playoff games (7). Larry Dierker, the only manager whose number is retired by the franchise, and he has the second highest winning percentage (.556) in franchise history. Brad Mills replaced Cecil Cooper—who was fired with 13 games remaining in the 2009 season—and Dave Clark, who was Cooper's interim replacement. On August 18, 2012, Mills was fired, and Tony DeFrancesco was named the interim manager. On September 27, 2012, Bo Porter became the 21st manager in Astros history. Porter was fired in September 2014, and replaced with interim manager Tom Lawless. AJ Hinch was hired as the 23rd manager in October 2014. Hinch is the franchise leader in playoff wins and regular season winning percentage. He led the club to its first World Series championship. He was fired on January 13, 2020 after the Astros sign-stealing allegations in the 2017 World Series came to light. Dusty Baker was hired as the club's 24th manager on January 29, 2020. Baker announced his retirement after 2023 postseason. Bench Coach Joe Espada was promoted to manager on November 13, 2023.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nPlaying under various names such as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels, and the Los Angeles Angels, the club has been a member of the American League since 1961. The team's first manager, Bill Rigney, led the squad for parts of eight seasons until his release in mid-1969. Mike Scioscia, who was manager for 19 seasons from 2000 through 2018, holds most of the Angels' managerial franchise records. He is the only Angels skipper to be named Manager of the Year, a distinction that he earned twice (2002, 2009). His regular-season wins (1066) and losses (878), postseason wins (21) and losses (24), and winning percentage (.548) are the highest of any manager in team history. Dick Williams is the only Angels manager who has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Five managers have served multiple terms with the team: Gene Mauch, John McNamara, Buck Rodgers, Marcel Lachemann, and Joe Maddon. On October 21, 2018, Brad Ausmus was hired as the club's 21st manager after longtime manager Mike Scioscia stepped down. Ausmus was fired after one season. On October 16, 2019, the Angels announced that Joe Maddon would be returning to the team as manager. Maddon was fired on June 7, 2022, and was replaced by interim manager Phil Nevin. The Angels did not pick up the 2024 option for Nevin. On November 8, 2023, the Angels hired Braves third base coach and former Rangers manager Ron Washington to be the club's skipper.\nOakland Athletics.\nWhile the Oakland Athletics have played under the same name since their establishment in 1901, the team has played in three different locations. The franchise was initially based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was managed by Connie Mack, a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and often called one of the best managers in history. Mack led the team from 1901 to 1950; his 50 seasons managed are a Major League Baseball record which has been called \"unbreakable\". He managed 7,466 games, accruing a record of 3,582 wins and 3,814 losses; all three totals are also Major League Baseball records. Over the course of his career, Mack led the Athletics to nine American League pennants and five World Series championships. His 24 wins and 19 losses in the postseason are both franchise records. Three Athletics managers were inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in recognition of their services to the team while it played in Pennsylvania: Mack, Jimmy Dykes, and Eddie Joost. The team moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, at the beginning of Lou Boudreau's tenure as manager, and then moved on to Oakland, California in 1968. Boudreau is also a member of the Hall of Fame, in addition to Mack; other inductees to manage the Athletics include Joe Gordon and Luke Appling, both inducted as players, and Dick Williams, whose .603 winning percentage leads all Athletics skippers. Bob Melvin managed from mid 2011 through 2021 as the team's 30th manager. He won Manager of the Year twice while in Oakland. After 2021 season, Melvin left the Athletics, to manage the Padres for 2022 season. On December 21, 2021 the Athletics named Mark Kotsay as their 31st manager in Athletics history.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe Seattle Mariners franchise was established in 1977, the successor to the earlier Pilots team that moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In their inaugural season, the Mariners hired Darrell Johnson as their first manager; he led the team for parts of four seasons, through the middle of 1980. After that point, no Mariners skipper started his new tenure at the beginning of the season until Jim Snyder in 1989. Statistically, Lou Piniella is the most successful manager in Mariners history; he is the franchise leader in games managed (1,551), regular-season wins and losses (840–711), and winning percentage (.542). He is also the first Mariners skipper to appear in the postseason, accruing a 15–19 record in 34 playoff games, and is the only person to win the Manager of the Year Award with the club, as he captured the award in 1995 and 2001. Don Wakamatsu, the first Asian-American manager in Major League Baseball history, was the team's skipper from 2009 until he was fired on August 9, 2010. Lloyd McClendon became the Mariners manager in late 2013, and managed the Mariners to a winning record in 2014. McClendon was fired October 9, 2015. On October 23, 2015, Scott Servais was hired as the club's 20th and current manager.\nTexas Rangers.\nWhen the Minnesota Twins moved to Minneapolis for the 1961 season, a new Washington Senators team was established in the United States capital as an expansion franchise, with Mickey Vernon as manager. The new Senators played in Washington, D. C. for 11 seasons, finishing with a winning percentage over .500 only once—under Ted Williams in 1969. After the 1971 season, the team moved to Arlington, Texas and became the Texas Rangers, named after the Texas Ranger Division of the state's law enforcement agency. Bobby Valentine, who led the team for parts of eight seasons (1985–1992), is the franchise leader in managerial wins and losses in the regular season (581–605). Johnny Oates was the first Rangers manager to lead the team to the postseason; however, his playoff record is 1–9. Oates and Buck Showalter have won the Manager of the Year Award with the team. Among managers who have led the Rangers for a full season or more, Billy Hunter amassed the highest winning percentage (.575). Ron Washington led the Rangers since 2007, but he resigned in September 2014, to focus on his family. Tim Bogar then took over as interim manager. In October 2014, the Rangers named Jeff Banister as their new manager. He was fired late in the 2018 season and replaced by Don Wakamatsu for the remaining 10 games. On November 3, 2018, Chris Woodward was hired as the club's 27th manager. Woodward was fired on August 15, 2022. Tony Beasley managed the rest of 2022. On October 21, 2022, the Rangers hired Bruce Bochy as team's manager."

Each member can vote and the winner is determined by the player with the most votes. Coaches may not put votes in for players on their own team. If it is done anyway, the vote is thrown out. The award can only be given to a Senior, This has been in effect since 2003 as Mistie Bass won the award 3 years in a row.\nSee also.\nWisconsin Mr. Basketball Award"

        "title": "John Schneider (American football executive)",
        "text": "John Schneider (born May 25, 1971) is a professional American football executive who is the president of football operations and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). Schneider was previously an executive for the Washington Redskins and Green Bay Packers in the 2000s. He was a primary architect in building the Seahawks roster that went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII.\nEarly years.\nSchneider grew up in Wisconsin and attended high school in De Pere at Abbot Pennings High School, where he played football and graduated in 1989. He studied history and secondary education at University of St. Thomas and was on the football team his freshman year until injuries caused him to retire. During his junior year, he wrote a letter to Ron Wolf asking if he could work as a scout. His internship that summer was the beginning of his relationship with the Green Bay Packers.\nProfessional executive career.\nAs an assistant.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nHe started working in the Scouting Department for the Green Bay Packers in 1993.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nHe was the director of pro personnel for the Chiefs from 1997 to 2000.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nHe worked for the Seahawks in 2000 under Ted Thompson as director of player personnel.\nWashington Redskins.\nIn 2001, Schneider became the vice president of player personnel.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nSchneider went back to the Green Bay Packers as the top personnel aide to the Packers' GM. He then elevated to director of football operations.\nAs general manager.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn January 11, 2010, the Seahawks announced the hiring of Pete Carroll as head coach and vice president of football operations. One week later, on January 18, 2010, the Seahawks announced the hiring of Schneider as their general manager. Schneider added the distinction of executive vice president in 2013. In his role, he manages all aspects of the Seahawks roster and draft process while working collaboratively with Carroll in all facets of the football operations department.\nEarly years, rise of the Legion of Boom and Super Bowl appearances (2010 to 2014).\nSince arriving in Seattle, Schneider and Carroll orchestrated a complete overhaul of Seattle's roster. In 2010, Schneider completed 284 roster transactions, including trading for Marshawn Lynch. On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won Super Bowl XLVIII, their first and only championship in their existence. Of those on the championship roster, only Max Unger, Red Bryant, Jon Ryan, and Brandon Mebane were Seahawks prior to Schneider's arrival in Seattle. Schneider and Seattle followed their Super Bowl win with another NFC Championship, but lost to New England in Super Bowl XLIX.\nNotable draft picks of Schneider involved in winning the Super Bowl XLVIII included Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Byron Maxwell, K.J. Wright, Bobby Wagner, and Earl Thomas. He also picked up undrafted receiver duo Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse. Notable free agents were Michael Bennett, Cliff Avril, and Brandon Browner. These defensive players soon became known as the Legion of Boom due to their hard-hitting style of defense.\nFinal years of the Legion of Boom (2015 to 2018).\nIn 2015, the Seahawks clinched a wild-card berth, but fell in the NFC Divisional Round to the Panthers. Schneider signed a 5-year contract extension with the Seahawks in July 2016 that kept him in Seattle through the 2021 season. The Seahawks won their fourth NFC West title under Schneider in 2016, but were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs for the second straight year. In 2021, Schneider signed a 6-year contract extension with the Seahawks that will keep him in Seattle through the 2027 draft.\nYears of transition (2018 to 2023).\nDespite the regression of the defense, the Seahawks remained a top team in the NFL due to the stellar play of quarterback Russell Wilson and the emergence of the receiver duo of 2015 3rd-round pick Tyler Lockett and 2019 2nd-round pick DK Metcalf. Schneider also traded for Duane Brown, Quandre Diggs, and Jamal Adams during that time. \nAfter missing the playoffs in 2021 Schneider traded franchise quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos for two first-round picks (used on Charles Cross and Devon Witherspoon) and two second-round picks (used on Boye Mafe and Derick Hall), and for Broncos players Drew Lock, Shelby Harris, and Noah Fant.\nWith head coach Mike Macdonald (from 2024).\nIn 2024 Schneider needed to hire a new head coach after Pete Carroll moved to an advisory role for the Seattle Seahawks. During the process he and the search committee interviewed Ejiro Evero, Patrick Graham, Ben Johnson, Mike Kafka, Bobby Slowik, Frank Smith, the eventual new Commanders head coach Dan Quinn, and Raheem Morris, who became the Falcons head coach. In the end, he hired Mike Macdonald as the new head coach for the Seahawks, signing him to a six-year contract. This made Macdonald the youngest active head coach in the NFL to date.\nAwards and honors.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII Champion (as EVP/GM of the Seattle Seahawks)\nPersonal life.\nSchneider and his wife, Traci, have two sons, Ben and Jack. Schneider and wife Traci founded Ben's Fund in 2012 in honor of their son, Ben, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. The intent of Ben’s Fund is to provide financial support to children and young adults with autism in Washington State along with guidance and support as they continue their journey."

        "title": "2010 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2010 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2010 World Cup, the 19th edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at Soccer City in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 11 July 2010, and was contested by the Netherlands and Spain. The event comprised hosts South Africa and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, the Netherlands finished first in Group E, with three wins, after which they defeated Slovakia in the round of 16, Brazil in the quarter-final and Uruguay in the semi-final. Spain finished top of Group H with two wins and one loss, before defeating Portugal in the round of 16, Paraguay in the quarter-final and Germany in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 84,490 supporters, with more than 909 million watching on television, and was refereed by Howard Webb from England.\nSergio Ramos had a chance to score for Spain early in the first half when his shot was saved by Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, while Arjen Robben had a chance for the Netherlands when he hit a low shot from the edge of the penalty area shortly before half-time, which was saved by Iker Casillas. There were numerous bookings throughout the first half, which BBC Sport's Paul Fletcher wrote had \"disturbed the rhythm of the match\". Robben missed an opportunity in the 62nd minute when he was one-on-one with Casillas, with the goalkeeper able to intercept his attempted shot with the toe of his boot to prevent the goal. David Villa then had a chance for Spain from the Netherlands goal, but Stekelenburg saved his shot. Ramos missed a header in front of goal on 77 minutes, sending the ball over the crossbar. With the match goalless after 90 minutes, it went to extra time. John Heitinga received a second booking during extra time, which resulted in him being sent off, and four minutes before the end, Andrés Iniesta gave Spain the lead, and the title, with a volleyed shot into the corner of the goal to secure a 1–0 win.\nSpain's win was their first World Cup title, as well as the first World Cup win by a European team outside Europe. Iniesta was named the man of the match, while Casillas was awarded the Golden Glove as FIFA's outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain went on to win UEFA Euro 2012 for their third successive trophy, but failed to defend the World Cup at the 2014 tournament in Brazil, becoming the second successive World Cup holders to be eliminated in the group phase after defeats against the Netherlands and Chile.\nBackground.\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was the 19th edition of the FIFA World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held between 11 June and 11 July 2010 in South Africa. South Africa qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, while 205 teams competed for the remaining 31 spots through qualifying rounds organised by the six FIFA confederations and held between August 2007 and November 2009. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase. The defending champions from the 2006 World Cup were Italy.\nThe match ball for the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, revealed on 20 April 2010, was the Jo'bulani, a gold version of the Adidas Jabulani ball used for every other match in the tournament. The name of the ball is a reference to \"Jo'burg\", a common nickname for Johannesburg, the match venue. The gold colouring of the ball mirrors the colour of the FIFA World Cup Trophy and also echoes another of Johannesburg's nicknames: \"the City of Gold\". The Jo'bulani became the second ball to be specifically produced for the FIFA World Cup final, after the Teamgeist Berlin was used for the 2006 final.\nThe 2010 final was the first time since 1978 that neither of the finalists had previously won the World Cup. The Netherlands had been runners-up twice before, losing 2–1 to West Germany in 1974, and 3–1 (after extra time) to Argentina in 1978. Reaching the 2010 final was Spain's best performance in the World Cup, their having previously finished fourth in 1950 when the tournament had a round-robin final stage, and having reached the quarter-final stage in 1934, 1986, 1994 and 2002, when single-elimination knock-out stages featured. Spain were the reigning European champions, having won UEFA Euro 2008, a tournament in which the Netherlands reached the quarter-final before being eliminated by Russia. This was the first meeting between the two teams in the main tournament stages of either a World Cup or a European Championship. In all-time head-to-head results, the teams had met nine times previously since 1920, with the Netherlands winning four games to Spain's three and one draw, all in either friendlies or European Championship qualifying games. At the start of the tournament, Spain were ranked second in the FIFA World Rankings, behind Brazil, while the Netherlands were ranked fourth.\nRoute to the final.\nThe Netherlands.\nThe Netherlands entered the World Cup having won all eight matches in their qualifying campaign. They were then drawn in Group E for the World Cup, in which they were joined by Cameroon, Denmark and Japan. Their first match was against Denmark at Soccer City, on 14 June 2010. The Netherlands took the lead shortly after half-time when Denmark's Simon Poulsen cleared a cross from Robin van Persie, but it struck the back of Daniel Agger and deflected in for an own goal. Dirk Kuyt added a second five minutes before the end to complete a 2–0 win, scoring on the rebound after Thomas Sørensen, the Danish goalkeeper, had saved Eljero Elia's shot on to the goalpost. The Netherlands faced Japan in their second game, on 19 June at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. As in the first game, they scored the opening goal shortly after half-time when Wesley Sneijder received the ball on the edge of the penalty area, following an attempted clearance by Japan, and struck the ball into the goal. The win, alongside Denmark's victory over Cameroon, meant that the Netherlands had qualified for the next round before playing their final group game. That game was against Cameroon, on 24 June at Cape Town Stadium. Van Persie gave them the lead on 36 minutes, before Samuel Eto'o equalised with a penalty after Rafael van der Vaart was penalised for a handball in the penalty area. Klaas Jan Huntelaar scored a late goal, however, to seal a 2–1 win and first place in the group.\nThe Netherlands' round-of-16 game was against Slovakia, who had beaten Italy in their final group game, at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 28 June. Arjen Robben started his first game of the tournament after recovering from an injury, and he gave the Netherlands the lead in the 18th minute when he received a long pass upfield by Sneijder and scored with a low shot past goalkeeper Ján Mucha. Sneijder then added a second in the 84th minute before Slovakia scored a penalty in the final minute of injury time, giving a final score of 2–1 to the Netherlands. In the quarter-final, the Netherlands faced five-times world champions Brazil, on 2 July at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Brazil took the lead in the 10th minute, when Robinho latched on to a deep pass from Felipe Melo and scored. Goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg had to make several saves to prevent Brazil extending their lead. The Netherlands equalised eight minutes after half-time, the goal being initially recorded as an own goal by Melo but later credited to Sneijder. The Netherlands then took the lead from a Robben corner kick in the 68th minute, Sneijder heading the ball in after a flick-on from Kuyt. Melo was sent off for a stamp on Robben, and the Netherlands went on to complete a 2–1 win. Their semi-final was against Uruguay at Cape Town Stadium on 6 July. Giovanni van Bronckhorst gave the Netherlands the lead on 18 minutes with a shot which deflected in off the goalpost, before Diego Forlán equalised from long-range for Uruguay shortly before half-time. The Netherlands retook the lead on 70 minutes when Sneijder scored with a shot which deflected off Maxi Pereira, a Uruguayan defender. Uruguay's players protested that van Persie had been interfering with play in an offside position, but the goal stood. Robben extended their lead with a header shortly afterwards, before Pereira scored during injury time to give a final score of 3–2 to the Netherlands.\nSpain.\nLike the Netherlands, Spain also won all of the matches in their qualifying campaign. They were then drawn in Group H, alongside Chile, Honduras and Switzerland. Spain began their finals campaign on 16 June 2010 in the Moses Mabhida Stadium against Switzerland. In what \"The Daily Telegraph\" reporter Jeremy Wilson described as \"among the bigger shocks in the competition's entire history\", Switzerland won the game 1–0 with Gelson Fernandes scoring the winner in the second half after teammate Eren Derdiyok had collided with Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas when through on goal. Their second game was at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium, against Honduras. David Villa opened the scoring on 17 minutes when he beat two defenders and hit a shot into the top corner of the goal. He doubled the lead shortly after half-time with a shot from the edge of the penalty area following a one-two with Xavi. Villa missed the chance for a hat-trick when his 60th-minute penalty went wide of the goalpost, and the game finished 2–0 to Spain. Spain entered their final game against Chile, at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on 25 June, needing a win to guarantee their progression to the knockout stage. Villa gave Spain the lead on 24 minutes, with what \"The Guardian\" Rob Smyth described as \"the goal of the World Cup so far\". Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo came out of the penalty area and made a tackle on Fernando Torres, but the loose ball then reached Villa on the left of the pitch and he curled a shot into the net from a distance of around . They doubled their lead on 37 minutes when Andrés Iniesta scored following a pass from Villa. Chile's Marco Estrada was sent off for a second yellow card when the referee judged that he had fouled Torres in the build-up to the goal. Rodrigo Millar pulled a goal back for Chile after half-time, but Spain held on for a 2–1 and a place in the next round as group winners.\nSpain's round-of-16 game was against Portugal at the Cape Town Stadium, on 29 June. Both teams had chances to score in the first half, but it was Spain who took the lead on 63 minutes when Xavi found Villa with a back-heeled pass who scored into the top of the goal after his initial shot was saved by Portuguese goalkeeper Eduardo Carvalho. Portugal's Ricardo Costa was sent off with two minutes remaining, for elbowing Joan Capdevila, and Spain went on to complete a 1–0 victory. In the quarter-final, Spain faced Paraguay at Ellis Park Stadium on 3 July. Paraguay put the ball into the goal shortly half-time but it was disallowed as Óscar Cardozo was ruled offside. Paraguay were awarded a penalty on 57 minutes, taken by Cardozo after Gerard Piqué had fouled him, but it was saved by Casillas. Two minutes later, Spain were awarded a penalty of their own when Antolín Alcaraz fouled Villa. Xabi Alonso put the ball past the goalkeeper into the net, but the referee ordered it to be retaken due to Spanish players being inside the penalty area when the penalty was taken. Alonso's second attempt, the third penalty of the match, was saved by goalkeeper Justo Villar, and the score remained 0–0. The deadlock was finally broken by Villa, who scored a goal on 82 minutes, which bounced off both posts before going in, to give Spain a 1–0 win. Their semi-final match took place on 7 July against Germany at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. For the third successive game, Spain won 1–0, the winner a headed goal by Carles Puyol. Kevin McCarra of \"The Guardian\" commented afterwards that these results did not imply that Spain were \"grinding out\" results, however. He said that their play was \"enjoyable as well as masterful\".\nMatch.\nPre-match.\nHoward Webb of England was named as the referee for the final, along with fellow Englishmen Darren Cann and Michael Mullarkey who were the assistant referees. Webb was the first Englishman to referee a World Cup final since Jack Taylor officiated the 1974 final. A former police officer from Rotherham, Webb was one of the English Select Group of referees, and had officiated Premier League matches since 2003. He was appointed to the FIFA list of international match referees in 2005, and before the World Cup, he had taken charge of the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final and the 2009 FA Cup Final. Webb had refereed three prior games at the 2010 World Cup. Yuichi Nishimura and Toru Sagara, both from Japan, were the fourth and fifth officials respectively.\nA closing ceremony for the World Cup was held on the pitch before the game, featuring dancers in the colours of the 32 tournament participants. There were also dancers dressed as elephants and hippopotamuses gathered around a watering hole, denoting South Africa's wildlife, and others in clothing typical of the country's urban youth. Video highlights from the tournament were projected on to the pitch, while local music group Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed their song \"Rain Rain Beautiful Rain\" and Shakira sang the World Cup anthem \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\". Nelson Mandela, who had missed the opening ceremony due to the death of his great-granddaughter in a road accident, made an appearance on the pitch in his wheelchair before the game, alongside wife Graça Machel. He was greeted with a noisy standing ovation and a peal of vuvuzelas from the spectators at the game. Other attendees at the match included members of both the Dutch and Spanish royal families. South African dignitaries and celebrities attended, including Charlize Theron and South African president Jacob Zuma. Spaniards Plácido Domingo, Rafael Nadal and Pau Gasol were in attendance to cheer on their team. American actor Morgan Freeman, who had played Mandela in the 2009 film \"Invictus\", was also present at the game.\nFirst half.\nThe Netherlands kicked off at approximately 8:30 pm local time (6:30 pm UTC) in temperatures of , with humidity of 34%. Spain won a free kick on 5 minutes, when van Bronckhorst fouled Alonso. Xavi's kick reached Sergio Ramos in the penalty area, who headed the ball towards the bottom-left corner of the goal, but Stekelenburg was able to dive down to make the save. Pique then gained possession of the loose ball, and attempted to pass to Villa in the centre, but Stekelenberg intercepted. Two minutes later, Kuyt obtained the ball following an error by Alonso, and took a shot at the Spanish goal from out but it was weak and Casillas was able to claim the ball. Spain had a chance on 11 minutes when Ramos beat Kuyt after receiving the ball from Iniesta, but John Heitinga deflected his shot over the crossbar. Alonso took the resulting corner, which was volleyed by Villa into the side netting. On 15 minutes, Van Persie received the first booking of the match for a foul on Capdevila, with Puyol also being shown the yellow card two minutes later for a high tackle on Robben. Sneijder hit a shot at goal from the resulting free kick which was caught by Casillas.\nOn 22 minutes, Mark van Bommel was booked for a foul during a sliding tackle on Iniesta, with Ramos joining him in the book two minutes later for bringing down Kuyt. Nigel de Jong then became the fifth player of the match to be booked with a high tackle on Alonso which resulted in his studs connecting with the Spaniard's chest. Busquets complained to the referee that this should have resulted in a sending off, Paul Fletcher of BBC Sport described the multiple bookings as having \"disturbed the rhythm of the match\", but noted that \"several crude challenges left him with little option\". Casillas collided with and injured Puyol on 33 minutes, putting the ball out of play so that he could receive treatment. The Netherlands attempted to return the ball to Casillas from the resulting throw-in, but the bounce off the pitch surprised Casillas and he had to push the ball behind to prevent a Netherlands goal. The Netherlands returned the ball to him from the corner. Netherlands had two opportunities to score from a corner on 37 minutes, but van Bommel and then Mathijsen both failed to connect properly with their attempted shots. Pedro then ran upfield with the ball but his shot went wide of the goal. Shortly before half-time, Robben received the ball on the edge of the Spanish penalty area and his low shot towards the corner of the goal was saved by Casillas as the half ended 0–0.\nSecond half.\nThere were no substitutions at half-time, and Spain kicked off the second half. They had the first opportunity of the half on 48 minutes, when the ball reached Capdevila around from goal, but he scuffed his attempted side-footed shot. Spain had a penalty appeal turned down on 50 minutes when van Bommel and Alonso were contesting the ball, after which the Netherlands moved down the field and crossed the ball into the Spanish penalty area, but no Netherlands players were able to reach the ball. A mix-up between Casillas and Puyol on 52 minutes led to a Netherlands throw-in, from which they built an attack, but it ended when van Persie's shot was claimed by Casillas. Spain then won a free kick around from goal, following a foul by van Bronckhorst for which he was booked. It was taken by Xavi, but went wide of the goal. On 56 minutes, Heitinga was booked for a foul on Villa and two minutes later the Netherlands won a free kick when Iniesta fouled Robben. The ball reached Heitinga in the penalty area, but he missed his shot although he was deemed to be offside. Spain made the first substitution of the match on 60 minutes, with Jesús Navas coming on in place of Pedro.\nIn the 62nd minute, Robben had what ESPN's Elko Born later described as \"the most obvious opportunity to score during regular time\". Receiving the ball from a Sneijder pass upfield, Robben was one-on-one with Casillas. He delayed his shot before attempting to flick the ball over the goalkeeper into the corner of the goal, but his shot lacked height and Casillas was able to put the ball out for a corner which the Dutch failed to score from. On 67 minutes, Capdevila was booked for a foul on van Persie, and three minutes later Spain had an opportunity when Villa received the ball from goal following a pass by Navas. His shot was parried behind by Stekelenburg, in what \"The Guardian\" Scott Murray described as an \"amazing save, terrible miss\". The Netherlands made a change on 71 minutes, as Elia replaced Kuyt, before Spain won a free kick around from goal which Villa kicked wide. Spain had another chance a minute later as Alonso found Navas, who sent in a cross, but Villa missed with his attempted volley. On 77 minutes, Spain won a corner when Villa's shot was saved following a one-two with Xavi. The ball reached Ramos from the corner, who was unmarked from goal, but his header went over the crossbar. Robben then had a chance on 83 minutes, when he beat Puyol and attempted to take the ball around Casillas, but the goalkeeper dived low to take the ball from him before he could do so. Robben was booked for dissent, saying that Puyol had fouled him, and the game went to extra time, finishing 0–0 at the end of 90 minutes.\nExtra time.\nSpain appealed for a penalty two minutes into the extra period, when Xavi went down following a clash with Heitinga, but it was not given. Three minutes later, Cesc Fàbregas, who had come on as a substitute for Alonso shortly before the end of regular time, received a pass from Iniesta and was one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He directed a shot low shot towards the corner of the goal, but Stekelenburg was able to claim the ball. This was followed by an opportunity for the Netherlands when Fàbregas impeded Casillas following a Netherlands corner. The ball reached Mathijsen, who was not marked but his attempt to head the ball into the goal from went over the crossbar. Spain then had two chances, first through Puyol, whose attempted header towards goal lacked power and direction, then through Iniesta who ran forward after receiving a pass from Fàbregas, but lost the ball to van Bronckhorst without being able to shoot or pass the ball to Navas, who was in space. The Netherlands then made their second change, bringing on van der Vaart for de Jong. On 101 minutes, Navas ran with the ball down the right-hand flank, following passes by Fàbregas and Villa, before hitting his shot into the side netting. Many spectators at the ground thought it had been a goal. Three minutes later, Fàbregas fired a shot which went just wide of the goalpost.\nThe Netherlands made a substitution in the 105th minute, bringing on Edson Braafheid for van Bronckhorst. After the extra-time interval, Spain substituted Fernando Torres for Villa. Braafheid made his first touch when defending a Xavi cross, the ball bouncing off the top of his head and into Stekelenburg's arms after he had turned away from it. Xavi then found Iniesta on the left of the field, but his attempted run into the penalty area was stopped when he was brought down by Heitinga. The referee gave Heitinga a second booking, which resulted in him being sent off, the fifth player to be dismissed in a World Cup final. Another booking followed for van der Wiel on 111 minutes when he fouled Iniesta, and Stekelenburg punched the ball clear from the resulting free kick before Navas hit a shot which went high into the stand behind the goal. On 115 minutes, the Netherlands won a free kick when Pique fouled Elia, which was taken by Sneijder. It deflected off the Spanish wall and Casillas fingertipped it behind, but the referee gave a goal kick instead of a corner. Spain then broke upfield through Torres, who passed into the centre where the ball bounced off a Netherlands defender. Fàbregas retrieved it and passed to Iniesta who was in space on the right-hand side of the penalty area. He took one touch with his right foot before striking the ball with his right foot on the half-volley past Stekelenburg into the left corner of the goal to give Spain the lead four minutes before the end. The Netherlands' players complained to the assistant referee about both the corner decision and what they believed was a foul on Elia that was not given. Mathijsen received a booking for throwing the ball into the pitch in anger while Iniesta was also booked for removing his shirt while celebrating his goal. Xavi was booked on 120 minutes for kicking the ball away and Torres went down in injury time with a hamstring issue but Spain held on to win the game 1–0 and win their first World Cup.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nPost-match.\nThe win was Spain's first World Cup title, and it lifted them to first place in the FIFA World Rankings with the Netherlands moving into second. Spain also became the first European nation to win a World Cup outside of Europe. At the conclusion of the match, the Spanish team changed into their red-shirted home kit for the presentation. These shirts already had a star over the emblem, signifying their World Cup victory. The Spain players formed a guard of honour for the Netherlands team as they went up to the stands to receive their runners-up medals. Afterwards, the red-shirted Spaniards went up to receive their medals, led by Xavi. Spain captain Casillas (who per tradition went last) was presented with the trophy by Zuma and FIFA president Sepp Blatter. As Casillas raised the trophy, a short version of the tournament's official anthem \"Sign of a Victory\" was played. Iniesta was named the man of the match, while Casillas won the Golden Glove from FIFA for the tournament's best goalkeeper and the Spanish team won the Fair Play Trophy.\nWith fourteen during the match – nine to the Netherlands and five to Spain – the match set the record for the most bookings in a World Cup final, more than doubling the previous record of six from the 1986 final between West Germany and Argentina. The Netherlands players were critical of referee Webb, questioning why Heitinga was sent off for a second bookable offence, while Iniesta was not. Former Netherlands player Johan Cruyff was critical of his compatriots, however, saying that they had played \"in a very dirty fashion\", describing their contribution to the final as \"ugly\", \"vulgar\" and \"anti-football\". He added that the Netherlands should have had two players (Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong) sent off early in the match, and was critical of Webb for being too lenient on them. The Associated Press was of the opinion that the Netherlands had \"turned far too often to dirty tactics\". Webb himself said, in a subsequent interview, that \"Having seen [the De Jong challenge] again from my armchair, I would red-card him. The trouble in the actual game was that I had a poor view of that particular incident\".\nThe Netherlands team were welcomed back to Amsterdam by an estimated 700,000 supporters lining the banks of the canals, and team captain van Bronckhorst and coach Bert van Marwijk were named Knights in the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Beatrix. Further, there were also reports that noted the play-acting and fouls by some of the Spanish players. German footballer Franz Beckenbauer, who had won the World Cup as both a player and a manager, criticised the two teams and Webb, saying that the match was \"lacking flow, [with] constant protests from the players and a referee who didn't have too much of an overview\". Spain's ball-possession strategy in the World Cup final received mixed reactions. While some maintained that it was effective, but \"boring\", others claimed it was \"beautiful\".\nFIFA estimated that 910 million viewers worldwide watched at least part of the final. In Spain, the final attracted 15.6 million total Spanish viewers across three networks, which represents 86% share of the audience, becoming the highest rated TV broadcast in Spanish history. Spain's previous record was set by the Euro 2008 quarter-final penalty shoot-out between Spain and Italy, which drew 14.1 million viewers. In the Netherlands, 12.2 million people watched the final on television, which was an estimated 74% of the total population of the country.\nSpain's next major tournament was UEFA Euro 2012, which they also won, beating Italy 4–0 in the final to complete three consecutive major tournament wins. At the subsequent 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Spain and Netherlands were both drawn in Group B, from which Spain failed to advance, finishing third in the group behind the Netherlands and Chile, as well as being beaten by the Netherlands 5–1 in the rematch from four years prior and Chile 2–0. The Netherlands went on to reach the semi-final, where they lost in a penalty shoot-out to Argentina while Chile in the Round of 16."

        "text": "Chris Terry (born April 7, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with the Chicago Wolves in the American Hockey League (AHL). He was drafted 132nd overall by the Carolina Hurricanes during the 2007 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nTerry was drafted by the Plymouth Whalers in the second round, 29th overall in the 2005 OHL Draft from the Markham Islanders. In his rookie season as a 16-year-old with the Whalers, Terry recorded 28 points in 64 games, followed by five points in 11 games in the playoffs during the 2005–06 season.\nTerry's production increased to 66 points in 68 games with Plymouth in 2006–07 season, finishing with the third highest point total on the team. Terry followed that up with 18 points in 20 post-season games, helping the Whalers win the J. Ross Robertson Cup, and a berth to the 2007 Memorial Cup. Plymouth would lose to the eventual champion Vancouver Giants in the semi-finals. After the season, Terry was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft.\nDuring the 2007–08 season, the Whalers named Terry as their captain during road games. Terry would enjoy a breakout season, finishing sixth in the OHL with 44 goals and 101 points. He then led the Whalers in playoff scoring, earning seven points in four games.\nTerry was named the Whalers full-time captain in the 2008–09 season, and he continued putting up impressive offensive numbers, finishing second in league scoring with 94 points in 53 games. In 11 playoff games, Terry finished with 16 points, tied for the team lead. After the season, Terry was awarded the Mickey Renaud Captain's Trophy and the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy by the league.\nIn 253 career games with the Whalers, Terry finished with 289 points, third highest in team history.\nProfessional.\nAfter his junior team was eliminated in the playoffs in 2008, the Carolina Hurricanes assigned Terry on an amateur try-out contract to their AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats at the end of the 2007–08 season. He made his professional debut and in one game went pointless for the Rats. Following another year with the Whalers, Terry was signed by the Hurricanes to a three-year entry level contract on May 29, 2009.\nAfter attending the Hurricanes training camp, Terry returned to Albany for his first full professional season in the 2009–10. Terry remained in the AHL, until the 2012–13 season, when he was recalled and made his NHL debut on March 9 against the New Jersey Devils at PNC Arena. He recorded his first NHL goal and point in his debut.\nAfter the 2015–16 season, having completed his first full season in the NHL, Terry left the Hurricanes as a free agent after seven seasons with the club. On July 2, 2016, Terry was signed to a one-year, two-way deal with the Montreal Canadiens.\nTerry had a memorable 2017–18 season, despite spending it in the AHL. Near the beginning of the season, Terry was named an alternate captain along with Matt Taormina. He was named to the AHL All-Star Classic and earned AHL player of the month in March. At the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, Terry was named to the AHL First All-Star team. He was also recognized as the Laval Rockets AHL Man of the Year for his charity and community involvement. Terry was later awarded the AHL Leading Scorer title after finishing the season with a career-high 71 points.\nOn July 1, 2018, Terry signed as a free agent to a two-year, two-way contract with the Detroit Red Wings.\nAt the conclusion of his contract with the Red Wings, having played exclusively with AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, Terry left the club as a free agent. With the 2020–21 North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and approaching his 12th professional season, Terry opted to sign his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year contract for the remainder of the season with Russian outfit Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on December 8, 2020. Terry made 19 regular season appearances with Torpedo, registering 8 goals and 8 assists for 16 points.\nFollowing a first-round exit in the post-season, Terry returned to North America as a free agent and was signed to a one-year AHL contract with the Bridgeport Islanders, affiliate to the New York Islanders on August 3, 2021.\nLeading Bridgeport in scoring in his two year tenure with the club, Terry left as a free agent and was signed to a one-year contract with independent AHL club, the Chicago Wolves, for the 2023–24 season on July 10, 2023. \nInternational play.\nTerry represents Canada internationally in inline hockey.\nCharity involvement.\nIn 2018, Terry launched the \"Chris ALS All-star\" program. As part of this program, Terry awarded two people living with ALS tickets to a Laval Rockets home game and a personal meet-and-greet."

        "title": "Junior rugby league in England",
        "text": "Rugby league is played at a school level in many schools in the rugby league heartlands of the traditional counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumberland; recently it has been introduced into some schools outside the traditional areas in particular in London, Essex and Hertfordshire. Thirty-three percent of schools across the UK offer rugby league as a school sport.\nCharlie Bray is the youth league representative on the Community Board.\nYoung People's Advisory Panel.\nThe RFL launched the Young Peoples Advisory Panel in 2010, a group consisting of young people aged 16–25 from across England. The national panel meet three times a year at the RFL's Red Hall headquarters to discuss and debate the following:\nChanges in the structure of youth rugby;\nCommunications between young rugby league enthusiasts and the RFL;\nRFL policies which impact on young people.\nTwo nominated members will also sit on the Youth &amp; Junior Forum, a key device used to advance youth rugby league.\nForms of the game.\nBoth males and females can play youth and junior rugby league, in fact from under-7 up to the under-11 teams are of mixed gender. The age groups at clubs run from under-7 all the way up to under-18 and at present there are around 500 clubs. There are currently more than 30 community clubs who have developed female sections, with over 600 girls aged between 11 and 16 registered to play for sides at the under-12, under-14 and under-16 age groups.\nThe Rugby Football League uses two modified forms of rugby league created by ARL Development in Australia. Mini league (known as mini footy in Australia) is played by all children up to Year 4 of Primary School. It is designed to provide children with a safe environment, a firm knowledge of the laws of rugby league and a chance to practice the skills such as tackling, passing and common defensive and attacking tactics. Players up to and including Year 6 of Primary School play mod league. Mod league is a bridge between mini league and full contact rugby league. On completion of mod league, players make a move to full international rugby league laws.\nTag rugby, touch rugby and rugby league nines are also widely used to introduce young children to the sport of rugby league.\nEnglish Schools Rugby League.\nEnglish Schools Rugby League was formed in 1967 following talks between the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It was formed to enable the organising and playing of International games, to act as one body for the disbursement of Grant Aid received from the RFL and to act as an organising body to spread the game and to be a forum for committed and expert opinion.\nChampion Schools.\nThe Champion Schools tournament is a national competition for secondary schools. The RFL in partnership with English Schools Rugby League re-launched the Champion Schools Tournament in 2002 and since then it has continued to grow each year.\nIn the 2005/6 academic year over 1,200 teams and 20,000 players competed in the Champion Schools tournament, making it the largest rugby league competition in the world. Eighty percent of participants are new to rugby league. The growth of the Champion Schools tournament led to the creation of the Carnegie Champion Colleges competition for Years 12 and 13. The regionally based competition was introduced in 2008 and started in January.\nRegional leagues and competitions.\nBritish Amateur Rugby League Association runs the Gilette National Youth League as well as the Yorkshire combination, West Riding Youth League, Hull &amp; District Youth League, North West Counties U15 - U13, North West Counties U8 - U12 and North West Counties Youth. There are county cups at age group level, known as the Yorkshire Youth Cup, Lancashire Youth Cup and the Cumbria Youth Cup.\nThe non-heartlands junior leagues include the Chilterns Junior Rugby League, London Junior League, North East Junior League, Midlands Junior League and Bristol Junior Rugby League.\nAcademies.\nProfessional and semi-professional teams run academy sides to develop young talent. The Academy under- 18 league was introduced in 1991.\nThe under-20s Super League competition is a full league with twenty rounds and top six play-offs. The under-18s, under-16s and under-15s are non-competitive and feature eight rounds in under-18s and six in under-16s and under-15s. Championship and Championship 1 sides have their own reserve grade.\nThe under-18s is open to either Super League clubs or Championship sides that meet very stringent criteria. The under-16s and under-15s are open to all Super League, Championship and Championship 1 sides."

Founded in 1855, the club's first XI plays in the Sussex Cricket League which is the accredited ECB Premier League for Sussex and is the highest level for recreational club cricket in England and Wales.\nHistory.\nFounded in March 1855 at the Steyne Hotel (now the Chatsworth Hotel) in Worthing, under the patronage of Lord Henry Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, and Lord Alexander Paget. The club first played on Broadwater Green, then the Pavilion Road sports ground until its closure in 1937. The Manor ground then became the club's main cricket ground.\nIn the 19th century, Colonel Thomas F Wisden of Offington was president of the club. Arthur F Somerset of Castle Goring became captain, his son Arthur PFC Somerset (also of Castle Goring) both played for Sussex and toured the West Indies with the Marylebone Cricket Club.\nThe club was a founder member of the Sussex League, having been a member since its inception in 1971. In the 20th century, the club was able to attract such high-profile Test match players such as Pakistan captain Imran Khan and England fast bowler Paul Jarvis. Current Hampshire CCC and England leg break bowler Mason Crane was a member of Worthing CC from the age of 10 and played in junior and senior sides, taking 54 wickets for the first XI until county duties with Hampshire took hold of his playing career.\nThe club's only major honour to date was winning the Sussex League Cup in 1992 under the captaincy of Tim Dunn, who was the Club Chairman.\nThe club today.\nFrom 2008 to 2010, the club's first XI was captained by former Sussex, Hampshire and Kent batsman Dominic Clapp. The club appointed Michael Gould as its first XI captain for 2011. Michael is the son of former England, Middlesex, Sussex and Auckland wicket-keeper, Ian Gould, who is now on the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. The current club captain from 2021 is Harry Dunn and the current chairman is Dominic Clapp. The club has a strong junior section and has England and Wales Cricket Board Clubmark status. The club runs four senior teams in league cricket on a Saturday as well as a Sunday XI.\nIn 2011 the club won Division 2 of the Sussex Cricket League, and were promoted to the Premier league of the Sussex Cricket league; however, they were then relegated in 2013.\nIn 2022 the club won Division 3 West, of the Sussex Cricket League, they are now back in Division 2 aspiring for Premier Division Cricket."

        "title": "2009–10 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2009–2010 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by John Thompson III and played their home games at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. The Hoyas were members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 23–11, 10–8 in Big East play. They advanced to the championship game of the 2010 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to West Virginia. They received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning a 3 seed in the Midwest Region, where they were upset by 14 seed Ohio in the first round.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nThe Hoyas′ previous season had been a disappointing one in which the relatively young and experienced Georgetown team had fallen from a Top Ten ranking in early January 2009 to a 16–15 finish in March that ended with the loss of 12 out of 16 games and first-round exits from both the 2009 Big East tournament and the 2009 National Invitation Tournament. The Hoyas had lost starting forward DaJuan Summers after the end of the season when he chose to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2009 National Basketball Association draft, as well as starting guard Jessie Sapp, who graduated, and reserve guard/forward Omar Wattad, who transferred. But with freshman forwards Jerrelle Benimon and Hollis Thompson joining the team and sophomore starting center Greg Monroe, junior reserve center Henry Sims, junior starting guards Austin Freeman and Chris Wright, junior reserve forward Julian Vaughn, and sophomore reserve forward Jason Clark all returning, the Hoyas expected to bounce back in 2009–10. The preseason Associated Press Poll ranked them No. 20.\nNon-conference schedule.\nThe season began with six straight wins over unranked opponents. Greg Monroe had a double-double (18 points and 11 rebounds) in the season opener at Tulane and 11 points and nine rebounds in the low-scoring home opener against Temple, which saw Georgetown blow a 12-point lead in the second half before eking out a victory that broke Temple's streak of 68 straight wins when holding opponents to under 50 points. Against Savannah State, a team coached by former Georgetown player Horace Broadnax, Monroe had 13 points. Austin Freeman scored 16 points at Tulane and 12 points at Savannah State, while Chris Wright scored 11 points each at Tulane and at Savannah State and 15 against Temple. Jason Clark came off the bench to score 13 points at Tulane and a game-high and career-high 14 at Savannah State, a game in which he connected on four three-pointers.\nClark started a week later in the first game of a three-game homestand, a rout of Lafayette – the first game between the schools since December 1979 – and had another game and career high, scoring 19 points, while Hollis Thompson had 16 points, Chris Wright finished with 14, Greg Monroe had 13 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, Austin Freeman added 12 points, and Julian Vaughn finished with 11 points in the first game since John Thompson III became head coach in 2004 in which six Hoyas scored in double figures. Against Mount St. Mary's at the end of November, Greg Monroe had a double-double with a season-high 19 points and 11 rebounds, Chris Wright and Julian Vaughn had career highs in scoring – Wright with 18 points and Vaughn with 14 – and Jason Clark started again and added 12. In an easy win over American five days later, the Hoyas limited the Eagles to 27-percent shooting from the field and Chris Wright and Henry Sims each scored 12 points – the first time Sims scored in double figures in his college career – and Julian Vaughn contributed 11 points, while Greg Monroe had nine points, a career-high 13 rebounds, and four blocked shots.\nAs the winning streak continued, the Hoyas rose in the national rankings, to No. 19 in the AP Poll by the time of the Temple game, to No. 18 when they met Lafayette, to No. 16 in time for the game against Mount St. Mary's, and to No. 15 after beating American. They then traveled to Madison Square Garden to make Georgetown's first appearance in the Jimmy V Classic and face their first ranked opponent of the season, No. 22 Butler. Greg Monroe played an outstanding defensive game that contributed to Butler junior forward Matt Howard shooting only 1-for-9 from the field and scoring only nine points. Monroe also shot 9-for-20 (45 percent) from the field and had his third double-double of the season, with career highs in both points (24) and rebounds (15), while Austin Freeman went 4-for-5 in three-point attempts and scored 18 points. The Hoyas led 39–31 at halftime and stretched their lead to 52–35 after Freeman scored on two three-point shots and Hollis Thompson hit a third three-pointer with 13:35 to play. The Bulldogs scored the next seven points to close to 52–42 as the Hoyas failed to score during a 4:13 stretch, finally broken by a monster Monroe dunk that made it 54–42. Butler then scored five more unanswered points to close to 54–47 with 8:37 remaining, and the Bulldogs were behind only 68–62 in the final minute before Georgetown prevailed in an 82–65 win. Georgetown outrebounded Butler 43–30 and outscored the Bulldogs 30–16 inside, and the loss was Butler's third in a row against ranked teams and eighth in its last nine games against the Top 25 – but the Bulldogs were destined to advance to the National Championship Game in the 2010 NCAA tournament four months later.\nGeorgetown next went to Anaheim, California, to make its only appearance in the John R. Wooden Classic and face its second ranked opponent in a row, No. 17 Washington, led by sophomore forward Isaiah Thomas, in the first meeting of the schools. The game was tight through the first half, with the Hoyas clinging to a 30–29 lead at halftime. However, Georgetown scored the first 12 points of the second half before Thomas made a layup with 15:56 remaining in the game for Washington's first points since halftime, and the Hoyas then went on a 9–0 run to stretch their lead to 51–31 with less than 14 minutes remaining. Georgetown still led 60–40 with 6½ minutes to play, but the Huskies took advantage of a 23-point performance by senior forward Quincy Pondexter and 21 points – 15 of them in the second half – by Thomas to stage a late comeback try that included a 15–3 run. Washington closed to 69–63 with 27 seconds remaining, but Chris Wright and Hollis Thompson hit key free throws that ensured the Hoyas a 74–66 victory that stretched their season-opening winning streak to eight. Julian Vaughn – the only Georgetown starter averaging fewer than 12 points per game – scored a career-high 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting from the field, Greg Monroe added 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds, and the Hoyas forced the Huskies to commit 25 turnovers.\nRanked No. 11, Georgetown returned to Washington, D.C., to play its last two non-conference games of the season, meeting Old Dominion and Harvard. Three years earlier, Old Dominion had upset the Hoyas to become the first team to beat Georgetown in a game at McDonough Gymnasium since 1982, and in a return to McDonough on December 19 – the season's only game there, played on a day when Georgetown University was closed due to a snowstorm – the Monarchs took advantage of a slow start by the Hoyas to again upset Georgetown, dealing the Hoyas their first setback of the season and remaining the only team to defeat Georgetown at McDonough over the course of nearly 28 years. Greg Monroe had a game-high 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds, while Austin Freeman and Julian Vaughn each contributed 13 points, with Freeman pulling down six rebounds and Vaughn grabbing seven. Falling to No. 14 in the AP Poll after the loss, Georgetown had an easier time in a victory over Harvard at the Verizon Center four days later in which Chris Wright scored a career-high 34 points, Austin Freeman scored 21, and Greg Monroe had a double-double with 16 points and a career-high 16 rebounds.\nMeanwhile, reserve forward Nikita Mescheriakov, averaging only five minutes per game, announced on December 22 that he would leave Georgetown at the end of the semester in search of greater playing time; he transferred to Wake Forest in January. Mescheriakov became the ninth player in five years to leave Georgetown before the end of his college eligibility: Jeff Green and DaJuan Summers both had left school after their junior year to enter the National Basketball Association draft, and Omar Wattad, Vernon Macklin, Jeremiah Rivers, Octavius Spann, Marc Egerson, and Josh Thornton all had transferred. Mescheriakov's departure left the Hoyas with only 11 players on their roster, two of them walk-ons.\nConference schedule.\nClimbing to No. 13 in the AP Poll with a record of 9–1, the Hoyas opened their Big East Conference schedule on New Year's Eve 2009 by hosting St. John's, followed by visits in the new year of 2010 to DePaul and Marquette. The Hoyas pulled ahead of St. John's in the first half before the Red Storm took a narrow lead halfway through the second half, but the Hoyas ultimately prevailed with a balanced scoring attack that saw Chris Wright score 21 points and Austin Freeman and Greg Monroe contribute 15 each. Another win followed against DePaul, the Hoyas′ ninth victory in a row against the Blue Demons and DePaul's 21st straight loss in a Big East Conference game, with Georgetown shooting 57 percent from the field and four Hoyas – Chris Wright with 18 points, Austin Freeman with 17, Jason Clark with 13, and Greg Monroe with 10 – scoring in double figures. Marquette, however, upset the by-then-No. 12 Hoyas on January 6, dealing them their first conference defeat of the season in a close game in which Austin Freeman scored 20 points, Julian Vaughn had 12, and Greg Monroe scored nine points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a losing cause.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center for a two-game homestand. In the first game, they hosted their first ranked conference opponent of the season, No. 13 Connecticut. The game was close at first, with the Huskies clinging to a 20–19 lead with 8:38 to play in the first half. Then the Georgetown offense went into a deep slump: While Connecticut scored 16 unanswered points, the Hoyas did not score again until Greg Monroe hit a pair of free throws with 4:30 left in the half, by which time Connecticut had built a 34–21 lead. Connecticut then went on a 6–0 run to take a 40–21 lead before Chris Wright connected on a two-point jumper with 45 seconds left until halftime – ending a 9½-minute stretch in which the Hoyas missed 11 consecutive shots from the field and saw their shooting effort for the game drop to 6-for-25 (24 percent) – to allow Georgetown to close to 40–23. The Hoyas went into the locker room at the break down 41–25, but Austin Freeman – who scored 28 of his career-high and game-high 33 points in the second half and also pulled down seven rebounds – led a Hoya comeback. With Connecticut leading 45–34 with 16:44 left to play, Freeman scored on a three-point jumper that sparked a 10–0 Georgetown run in which he scored eight points, allowing the Hoyas to close to 45–41 with 14:57 remaining. The Huskies managed to pull ahead to a lead of as many as seven points, but the Hoyas again closed the gap, and a Freeman three-pointer put Georgetown ahead 66–65 with 3:09 remaining. The game stayed tight, but Connecticut did not score a field goal during the final 3½ minutes, and a Julian Vaughn two-pointer put Georgetown ahead for good at 70–69 with 44 seconds left. In the end the Hoyas pulled off a 72–69 come-from-behind victory to avoid an upset. Greg Monroe had a double-double (15 points and 10 rebounds), and Chris Wright scored 14 points. Ranked No. 11 by the time they met Seton Hall five days later, the Hoyas put heavy defensive pressure on the Pirates's highest-scoring player, Jeremy Hazell, and won easily, with Chris Wright scoring 21 points, Jason Clark rebounding from a scoreless outing against Connecticut to score a career-high 20 points, Austin Freeman adding 16 points, and Julian Vaughn contributing 13, while Greg Monroe had an eight-point, nine-rebound game. The win gave Georgetown a perfect 8–0 record at the Verizon Center for the season.\nGeorgetown next went on the road as the underdog to face No. 4 Villanova, which had won six straight games. The Hoyas led 15–14 in the first half when the Wildcats went on a 14–0 run to take a 28–15 lead, and at halftime Villanova led 46–31. In the second half, Austin Freeman scored 10 points in the first 3:38 of play as the Hoyas began to eat into Villanova's lead. An offensive lull in the middle of the second half in which the two teams combined to miss 20 straight shots over a 6-minute-12-second stretch ended with a Greg Monroe field goal that tied the game at 67–67 with 4:36 left in the game. After Villanova pulled ahead 69–67 with 4:15 remaining, Monroe again tied the game, at 69–69, with 4:01 left. Shooting only 39.3 percent from the field for the game, the Hoyas made only one more field goal the rest of the way, and a field goal by Villanova senior guard Scottie Reynolds – who led the Wildcats with a game-high 27 points – put the Wildcats ahead for good at 71–69. Georgetown's final score, another Monroe field goal, closed the gap to 80–77 with 9.6 seconds left, but two Villanova free throws with 6.9 seconds remaining – part of an 8-for-8 Villanova performance from the free throw line in the final 36 seconds – clinched an 82–77 win for the Wildcats, breaking a five-game losing streak against Georgetown. In a losing cause, Greg Monroe had a double-double (29 points and 16 rebounds), while Austin Freeman had 22 points and Jason Clark scored 16.\nFalling to No. 12 in the AP Poll, Georgetown next faced another ranked opponent, No. 9 Pittsburgh, in another road game. The Panthers were tough at home – they had compiled a 125–10 record on their home court at the Petersen Events Center since the venue opened in 2002, and Georgetown had beaten them there only once, in January 2005 – and they entered the game having won 31 straight games at home and with an eight-game winning streak overall. Georgetown made its first five three-pointers of the game and led by 19–11 and 25–17, but much of the game was close, with the score tied at 31–31 at halftime and Pittsburgh clinging to a 56–54 lead in the second half with 7:48 left to play. But Georgetown, playing tough defense that largely contained Pittsburgh's top-scoring players during the game, then went on a decisive 9–0 run during which Chris Wright put the Hoyas ahead for good at 59–56 with a three-pointer. By the time the run was over, the Hoyas led 63–56. Pittsburgh cut the Georgetown lead to 63–58 with 3:48 remaining, but the Hoyas hung on to upset the Panthers 74–66. The Panthers suffered only their third loss in 13 games against ranked opponents at the Petersen Events Center, and Georgetown became the only team other than Louisville to defeat Pittsburgh twice there. Chris Wright had 27 points, Greg Monroe had 13 points and nine rebounds, Austin Freeman also scored 13, and Julian Vaughn contributed 11.\nAn easy win over Rutgers followed in which Greg Monroe shot 10-for-12 (83.3 percent) from the floor had another double-double (21 points and 10 rebounds), while Chris Wright went 4-for-5 from three-point range and scored 16 points and Austin Freeman scored 14. The victory extended the Hoyas′ winning streak against the Scarlet Knights to eight. Climbing to No.7 in the AP Poll, Georgetown went on the road again to face another ranked opponent, No. 4 Syracuse the winners of seven straight games. It was the first time since March 1990 that the two teams met while both were ranked in the Top Ten. The Hoyas began the game with a 14–0 run over the first three minutes, hitting their first four three-pointers, but the Orange battled back to only a two-point deficit with 8:19 left in the first half time, and Syracuse had a 34–29 lead at halftime. Syracuse began the second half with a decisive 18–8 run that saw the Orange build a lead of 43–33 with 16:10 left to play and culminate. in a 52–37 Syracuse lead with 12:37 remaining. Austin Freeman led the Hoyas with 23 points, and Jason Clark scored 15, but Syracuse won 73–56, giving head coach Jim Boeheim his 819th career victory, making him sixth all-time in victories among NCAA Division I college basketball coaches. In improving to 20–1, the Orange also clinched Boeheim's 32nd season with at least 20 victories in his 34 years as head coach at Syracuse. The loss extended Georgetown's losing streak to Syracuse in games played at the Carrier Dome to six.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center to begin a three-game homestand by meeting No. 8 Duke in a nonconference game five days later with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in the audience. Shooting 77 percent from the floor in the first half, the Hoyas used an 18–3 run in which they held the Blue Devils without a field goal for nearly four minutes to jump out to what turned out to be a decisive 34–20 lead. With Georgetown leading 46–33 at the beginning of the second half, Duke made two three-pointers to cut the lead to seven, but the Hoyas responded with a 6–0 run to stretch the lead back to 13. Duke closed again to 52–45, but Georgetown again extended the lead and went on to win 89–77. Chris Wright shot 8-for-9 from the floor and scored 21 points; Greg Monroe also scored 21, and Austin Freeman added 20 points. The Hoyas shot 71.7 percent from the floor for the game, the third-best team shooting performance in Georgetown history and the best since Georgetown shot 71.9 percent against St. John's in 1980; it was also the second-highest shooting percentage ever against Duke, exceeded only by a 73.3 percent shooting performance against the Blue Devils by UCLA in 1965. The victory was John Thompson III's 200th career win as a college head coach.\nUnfortunately for Georgetown, a shocking upset followed the win over Duke, as the No. 7 Hoyas resumed conference play by losing to South Florida, a team which three days earlier also had upset No. 17 Pittsburgh. The Hoyas blew a first-half 13-point lead, their offense going cold in the second half, resulting in arguably the biggest win in the history of Bulls basketball. Greg Monroe and Austin Freeman each scored 21 points and Monroe grabbed eight rebounds in the loss. The Hoyas then faced No. 2 Villanova – a team that had beaten them in January, had not yet lost a conference game during the season, and was riding an 11-game winning streak – on February 6. Although about two feet (61 cm) of snow had fallen in Washington, D.C., that day, 10,387 fans – including Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and former National Football League commissioner and Georgetown basketball player Paul Tagliabue – showed up at the Verizon Center for the game, some of the students in attendance having walked three miles (4.8 km) from the Georgetown campus. During the first half, the Hoyas forced 16 Villanova turnovers and limited the Wildcats to 12 field goals. A 15–2 Georgetown run gave the Hoyas a 34–20 lead, and a 16–4 Georgetown run followed to stretch the lead to 50–27, which Villanova cut to 50–31 at halftime. In the second half, Villanova scored 59 points and committed only two turnovers, and early in the half twice closed to a 13-point deficit, but the Hoyas then stretched their lead to 76–55 with 9:13 left to play. The Wildcats followed that with a 13–3 run of their own to close to 79–68 and later got as close as 81–71, but the Hoyas added to their lead again and ultimately upset Villanova 103–90. Georgetown went 39-for-50 (78 percent) from the foul line during the game, and making half of those free throws in the second half helped the Hoyas protect their lead against Villanova's second-half offensive surge. Austin Freeman scored a game-high 25 points and Jason Clark had 24, while Greg Monroe shot 11-for-14 (78.6 percent) from the field, scoring 19 points, pulling down eight rebounds, and making six assists. Julian Vaughn contributed 13 points and Hollis Thompson came off the bench to add 12.\nStill ranked No. 7 and sporting records of 17–5 overall and 7–5 in the Big East, the Hoyas next went on a two-game road trip that yielded mixed results – a win at Providence followed by an upset loss at Rutgers that was the Scarlet Knights′ first victory over a Top Ten team in seven years. At Providence, Chris Wright scored 21 points, Julian Vaughn had a career-high 19 points, Austin Freeman added 17, and Greg Monroe had a double-double (12 points and 12 assists) and seven rebounds, while at Rutgers Monroe had 19 points, eight rebounds, and six assists and Austin Freeman scored 17 points. Dropping to No. 10 in the AP Poll, they then returned to the Verizon Center to face No. 5 Syracuse. Syracuse started out with a dominating performance, making five of six shots from the field to start the game and take a 13–2 lead in the first 3 minutes 51 seconds. Georgetown closed to 15–6, but five straight points by Syracuse senior guard Andy Rautins – who had a season-high 26 points in the game – put the Orange ahead 20–6. The Hoyas followed with a 12–2 run to close to 22–18, but Syracuse responded with a 9–2 run of its own to take a 31–20 lead. Syracuse's final nine points of the first half stretched the Orange's lead to 16 points, and the teams went to the locker room at the half with Syracuse ahead 44–31. In the second half, Syracuse stretched its lead to 60–37 with 12:37 remaining to play, but made only three more field goals during the last 12 minutes of the game. Meanwhile, the Hoyas began a comeback upset bid that started with a 10–0 run. After Rautins finally answered with a three-pointer, the Hoyas scored twice more to close to 63–51 with 7½ minutes left in the game. Rautins sank two free throws to make it 65–51, but Georgetown then scored nine straight points to close to 65–60, and after Austin Freeman scored five straight points Georgetown only trailed 67–65 with 3:12 left in the game. By the time 1:10 was left to play, Syracuse was clinging to a 71–70 lead, but the Orange held on to win 75–71, the first time Georgetown had lost two games in a row during the season. Austin Freeman led the Hoyas with 21 points and six rebounds, while Chris Wright and Greg Monroe each scored 20 and Monroe also pulled down nine rebounds.\nFalling to No. 11 in the AP Poll, the Hoyas broke their two-game losing streak by coming from behind with a second-half offensive surge to beat Louisville in a game in which Austin Freeman scored 29 points – 24 of them in the second half – and Greg Monroe had a double-double (16 points and 14 rebounds. Four days later, however, Notre Dame upset them at the Verizon Center – Notre Dame's second straight win over a Top 25 team – dropping the Hoyas to 19–7 overall and 9–7 in the Big East. Against the Fighting Irish, Greg Monroe scored 15 points and Jason Clark and Hollis Thompson each scored 12, but Georgetown's leading scorer Austin Freeman, averaging 17.7 points per game, was suffering from what at the time was thought to be gastroenteritis and Notre Dame held him to only five points.\nHaving lost three of their last four games, the Hoyas had dropped to No. 19 in the AP Poll by the time they met No. 10 West Virginia on March 1 with Austin Freeman missing the game to go to a hospital, where he was found not to be suffering from gastroenteritis, but rather from diabetes. The Hoyas missed his offense and, although Greg Monroe had 22 points and nine rebounds and Chris Wright scored 21 points, the Mountaineers never trailed after the game's first four minutes and led by as many as 27 points in the first half, by 43–26 at halftime, and by 53–26 with 16:51 left to play in the game. Georgetown managed to close to 62–53 with 5:55 left, but for the final 3:37 of the game West Virginia never led by less than double digits. Although West Virginia shot only 43 percent from the field, the Mountaineers scored 24 points off 20 Georgetown turnovers and outscored the Hoyas 27–14 in free throws.\nLosers of four of their last five, the Hoyas finished their regular season with an easy win over Cincinnati at the Verizon Center in which Austin Freeman – monitored closely by the team physician – returned to action to score 24 points, Greg Monroe had a double-double (19 points and 15 rebounds), and Chris Wright scored 16. Georgetown finished the regular season with a record of 20–9 overall, a conference record of 10–8 that tied them with Notre Dame for seventh place in the Big East, and a ranking of No. 19 in the AP Poll.\nBig East tournament.\nLosing four of the final six games of the regular season caused Georgetown – ranked No. 7 in mid-February – to fall to No. 22 in the AP Poll by the time the 2010 Big East tournament began in the second week of March. Tiebreaking criteria gave Notre Dame the seventh seed in the tournament and relegated Georgetown to the eighth seed, but that was high enough for the Hoyas to receive a bye in the tournament's first round. In the second round they met the No. 9 seed, South Florida, which had beaten Georgetown in their only regular-season meeting. The Hoyas defense clamped down on the Bulls, holding them to 29.1 percent shooting from the field, a season low for South Florida. Meanwhile, Jason Clark and Greg Monroe each scored 16 points and Chris Wright added 15 as Georgetown cruised to a 69–49 victory, the Hoyas′ first win in a postseason tournament since 2008.\nIn the quarterfinals, Georgetown faced No. 3 Syracuse, which had lost its final game of the regular season to Louisville but had received a bye in both the first and second rounds. The game was the 13th Big East tournament game between the teams, the most between any two Big East teams in the tournament's 31-year history, and each team had won six of the previous meetings. This time, Syracuse, with a 28–3 record, was the tournament's No. 1 seed, had not lost two games in a row all season, and had defeated Georgetown twice in regular-season play. Georgetown pulled out to an early 14–11 lead, but the Orange tied the game and pulled ahead, where they would remain for the next 21 minutes of play, including a 40–37 advantage at halftime. A Syracuse offensive spurt in the second half gave the Orange a nine-point advantage with 13:43 left in the game, but then the Hoyas began an offensive surge in which they outscored Syracuse 19–2, including a 13–0 run at one point. During the surge, Georgetown freshman reserve guard Vee Sanford scored to give the Hoyas a 60–59 lead with 10:37 left to play – their first lead since 14–11 – and by the time the 19–2 run ended, Georgetown led 70–61 with 7:24 remaining in the game. Syracuse responded with an offensive push of its own, cutting Georgetown's lead to 74–72, but the Hoyas then outscored the Orange 11–4 to take an 85–76 lead with 1:39 remaining. Georgetown went on to upset Syracuse 91–84, the first time the Orange had lost two games in a row all season and only the sixth team in Big East tournament history that a top seed had lost its tournament opener. Although Syracuse's bench outscored Georgetown's 37–10, the Hoyas made up for it by shooting 57.9 percent from the field. Chris Wright led the team with a game-high 27 points and Austin Freeman scored 18, while Jason Clark contributed 17 points and Greg Monroe had a double-double (15 points and 10 rebounds) and a team-high seven assists.\nGeorgetown advanced to the semi-finals to meet fifth-seeded Marquette, another team that had beaten the Hoyas in their only regular-season meeting. The Hoyas scored on their first six field goal attempts and quickly pulled ahead to a 15–4 lead, but the Golden Eagles′ offense came alive and went on a 15–5 run that tied the game at 29–29. Georgetown led 37–34 at halftime and 56–51 with 10:48 left in the game, but after that the Hoyas went on a decisive 14–1 run that stretched their lead to 70–53. The Hoyas cruised to an 80–57 victory, dealing the Golden Eagles their first double-digit loss of the season. Greg Monroe had one of the best all-around performances of his college career with another double-double (23 points and 13 rebounds) and seven assists, while Chris Wright and Jason Clark each scored 15 points and Austin Freeman added 12 points and eight rebounds.\nGeorgetown appeared in the Big East tournament championship game for the first time since 2008, where it faced the tournament's third seed, No. 7 West Virginia. West Virginia had won six in a row and eight of nine entering the game and was making only its second appearance in the tournament championship game. The first half was close, and West Virginia led 32–28 at halftime. The Mountaineers held their lead through most of the second half, stretching it to as many as nine points before the Hoyas began to close the gap, and Austin Freeman tied the score at 56–56 with a three-pointer with 54 seconds left to play. Chris Wright fouled West Virginia junior guard Joe Mazzulla, who hit two free throws with 27 seconds remaining to give the Mountaineers a 58–56 lead, but Wright then scored on a jumper to tie the game again at 58–58 with 17 seconds left to play. After a timeout, West Virginia senior forward Da'Sean Butler, who had 20 points during the game, scored in the lane with 4.2 seconds left to give the Mountaineers a 60–58 lead. Chris Wright drove the length of the court and missed a final shot at the buzzer, and West Virginia won its first Big East tournament championship. Chris Wright scored 20 points, Austin Freeman had 14, and Greg Monroe contributed 11.\nNCAA tournament.\nGeorgetown's deep Big East tournament run gave the Hoyas a 23–10 record and made the case for the team's inclusion in the 2010 NCAA tournament. Georgetown was seeded third in the Midwest Regional in the Hoyas′ first appearance in the tournament since 2008. Observers considered the Hoyas a legitimate Final Four threat, and Georgetown was the heavy favorite in its first-round game against 14th-seeded Ohio, a team that had posted a losing regular-season record in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) but had earned a tournament berth by winning the MAC tournament championship. The day before the game, John Thompson III said that the Hoyas were playing their best basketball of the season, but behind a 32-point effort by junior guard Armon Bassett, 23 points by freshman guard D. J. Cooper, and a strong team three-point shooting performance, the Bobcats jumped out to an early lead that Georgetown was never able to close. Ohio led 48–36 at halftime and by as many as 19 points in the second half, and a second-half Georgetown offensive surge got the Hoyas no closer than seven points despite Chris Wright's team-leading 28 points, Greg Monroe's double-double (19 points and 13 rebounds), and Hollis Thompson's 16-point performance. Ohio cruised to a shocking 97–83 upset victory, the first time the Bobcats had won an NCAA tournament game since 1983, and Georgetown's season came to a sudden and unexpected end.\nWrap-up.\nFor the season, Austin Freeman led the Hoyas in scoring, shooting 52.5 percent from the field overall and 44.4 percent from three-point range and averaging 16.5 points per game, while Greg Monroe, who started all 34 games, also shot 52.5 percent and averaged 16.1 points per game. Chris Wright averaged 15.1 points per game and shot 47.0 percent, while Jason Clark averaged 10.5 points on 47.5 percent shooting. Freeman missed one game, came off the bench in another, and started 32 games, while the rest of them started in all 34 games during the season. Julian Vaughn also started in all 34 games, and Hollis Thompson appeared in all 34, starting in two of them.\nMonroe opted to leave the team after the season, foregoing his junior and senior years of college to enter the 2010 National Basketball Association draft; the Detroit Pistons selected him. He left Georgetown having started all 65 games of his collegiate career, shooting 54.3 percent from the field and averaging 14.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. After a first year in which he had scored only in the Lafayette game and taken only one shot and played only four minutes during the remainder of the season, reserve guard Stephan Stepka also left, transferring to James Madison. although he did not play there. They were the ninth and tenth Hoyas in five seasons to leave Georgetown prior to the expiration of their college eligibility.\nThe 2009–10 Hoyas played short-handed, with an understrength roster, shallow bench, and no seniors, and, like the 2008–09 team, their fortunes declined as the regular season wore on. Unlike the Hoyas of 2008–09, however, they bounced back to make a deep run in the Big East tournament and returned to the NCAA tournament. But as they had two years earlier, the Hoyas lost to a double-digit seed in the tournament's first weekend. For the rest of John Thompson III's tenure as head coach, the Hoyas would never advance beyond the first weekend of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2009–10 Hoyas finished with a record of 23–11 and were ranked No. 12 in the season's final AP Poll, which was taken before their loss to Ohio in the NCAA tournament. They were unranked in the postseason Coaches Poll.\nRoster.\nSource\n2009–10 schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

It is a conversion of the SNES title \"\", which was done by the same team at Loriciels and released in 1994 on all regions.\nNamed after and set in the French Val-d'Isère ski resort, \"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" features freeride, training and competition modes and players can choose between skiing and snowboarding gameplay styles. It also features in-game advertising promoting the FILA sportswear store. While it inherits some of the game design and mechanics from its original SNES counterpart, the conversion features a different map and completely new trail layouts.\n\"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" received mixed reviews, and as of April 1, 1995 the game has sold nearly 10,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime. Retrospective reviews have been equally as mixed.\nGameplay.\n\"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" is a winter sports game that uses a behind-the-view perspective, similar to \"Tommy Moe's Winter Extreme: Skiing &amp; Snowboarding\". When racing down the skiing trails, the player can accelerate, turn, stop, jump, decelerate and make sharp turns either when accelerating or decelerating. The players can choose either snowboard or ski playstyles at the main menu and change the default control scheme at the options menu. Unlike its original SNES version, however, in-game weather conditions changes do not exist. Two players can also participate in any of the modes by taking their respective turn. Progress, records and other changes made by the player are saved automatically via the cartridge's internal EEPROM. More options can be accessed by entering a cheat code at the main menu.\nModes.\n\"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" has three different modes of play: Freeride, Training and Compete. Each one having their own subset of rules. Freeride is an arcade-style, non-competitive event mode in which the player has to descend from the mountain and reach the finish line of the track. At the start of any course, the player is given a limited amount of time to reach a designated checkpoint and increase the time limit to continue racing, while avoiding obstacles in order to not lose time. After reaching down the bottom of the mountain, the player automatically uses a ski lift in order to climb to the next mountain trail. More paths are unlocked depending on the route the player has chosen when descending from the mountain's skiing trail. If the players misses a checkpoint, the time limit stays the same, leading to an early end to the race as a result. Later paths get increasingly difficult as the player progresses in this mode, with more obstacles to avoid and lower time limits, in addition, these later courses add power ups such as turbo, shield and time increasers.\nTraining mode is recommended for beginners to practice and refine their ski and snowboard skills for the competition modes of downhill, slalom and giant. Before the start of any event, the player is given the choice of selecting any of the four courses on the map screen, each one increasing in difficulty. If the player misses any gate, there is a penalty of two seconds for each one lost at the end of the practice.\nCompete mode, as the name suggests, is a competitive mode consisting of four championships, each of which is divided into three events. In the first event, the player has to be in the top 7 to qualify, then in the top 5 on the second event and then in the top 3 on the third and final event to win an award, depending on the time the player reached the finish line. If the player qualifies on the four championships, then he is moved on onto the finals. If the player fails to qualify in any of the events, a life is lost and once the three lives are lost in qualifying, the game is over. Unlike the previous two modes, progress is not saved after completing any event.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" was developed by the same personnel who developed \"Tommy Moe's Winter Extreme: Skiing &amp; Snowboarding\" on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System at Virtual Studio. In an interview with Vincent Baillet, one of the programmers of the game, remarked his experience when it came to develop for the system, pointing out both the advantages and disadvantages that it had compared to the SNES. Vincent worked on the project before Loriciels went bankrupt, which resulted in his departure from the company but before doing so, he worked on displaying the slopes, sprites and sound effects. After leaving the company, Olivier Richez did the remaining programming work for the game. He also stated that the game received changes prior to release. The game was also present during WCES 1995.\nReception.\n\"Val d'Isère Skiing and Snowboarding\" garnered mixed reception upon release.\nSarah Nade of \"GamePro\" rated the game's graphics and \"fun factor\" at 4.5/5.0.\n\"Next Generation\" gave two stars out of five; although they noted the inclusion of three play modes, 1-2 player option, and three different courses to play, the magazine felt that the game did not bring enough variation in play to give it a long-term value.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game a B+."

        "title": "List of IIHF World Junior Championship players for Canada",
        "text": "Canada has participated in all 39 World Under-20 Championships, an annual ice hockey tournament organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The first World Under-20 Championship was held in 1974, although the IIHF considers the first three years to be unofficial invitational tournaments. In 1977, the Ice Hockey World Championships became an \"open competition\" which allowed all players, professional and amateur, to participate. With National Hockey League (NHL) players participating in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status was given to the World Under-20 Championship. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. During the first years of the tournament, Canada did not have a national team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Memorial Cup winner. In 1978, an all-star team was sent. The first national junior team participated in the 1982 tournament, and became the first Canadian team to win a gold medal. Canada has won more gold medals than any other nation and has had two five-year gold medal winning streaks, during 1993–1997 and 2005–2009. The Canadian team is usually composed mostly of players from the Canadian Hockey League, a major junior umbrella organization that consists of the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and Western Hockey League.\nOne of the most infamous incidents in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive brawl involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading to most of the players from both teams joining the brawl. The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared null and void. An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7–1 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 at the time of the brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The brawl helped raise the profile of the tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one of the most important hockey events.\nSince 1977, Canada has participated in every tournament, sending 673 players: 64 goaltenders and 609 skaters (forwards and defencemen). During this period, Canadian teams have won 29 medals: 16 gold, eight silver and five bronze. Canadian cities have hosted the tournament a combined 11 times, more than any other nation. Because of the age restrictions, the majority of players have participated in only one tournament. However, 142 players (131 skaters, 11 goaltenders) have played in two tournaments. Seven players—Jason Botterill, Jay Bouwmeester, Ryan Ellis, Trevor Kidd, Martin Lapointe, Eric Lindros and Jason Spezza—have played in three tournaments. As of 2015, 513 players (464 skaters and 49 goaltenders), or 76.3% of players, have won at least one medal. Of that number, 298 (29 goaltenders and 269 skaters), or 44.3% of all players, have won at least one gold medal. Forty-four players (41 skaters and 3 goaltenders), or 6.5%, have won two or more gold medals. Jason Botterill is the only Canadian player to win three gold medals (1994–1996), while three other players have also won three medals: Jason Spezza and Jay Bouwmeester (both 2000–2002) won two bronze and one silver, while Ryan Ellis (2009–2011) won a gold and two silvers. Eric Lindros, who scored 12 goals and 19 assists for a total of 31 points over three tournaments (1990–1992), is Canada's all-time assists and points leader in the tournament. Jordan Eberle, who played in the 2009 and 2010 tournaments, is Canada's all-time leading goal scorer, with 14 goals.\nNotes.\nNote 1—Canada's seventh game in the 1987 World Championships against the Soviet Union was not completed and declared null and void because of a bench-clearing brawl between the two teams. Canada had been winning 4–2, but the statistics of that game are not included here."

There are several hundred ITF Women's Circuit tournaments each year, spread across all six inhabited continents, with prize money ranging from US$15,000 to US$100,000. Players who succeed on the ITF Women's Circuit earn sufficient points to be eligible for qualifying draw or main draw entry to WTA tournaments.\nUntil 2011 the ITF Women's Circuit was the level immediately below the main WTA Tour, but in 2012 the WTA introduced an intermediate level, the WTA 125 tournaments.\nThere is also an ITF Men's Circuit, but it only incorporates the lower-level Futures tournaments. Mid-level men's tournaments, equivalent to the WTA 125 tournaments and the bigger money events on the ITF Women's Circuit, come under the aegis of the ATP as part of the ATP Challenger Tour.\nIn 2019, reforms was made to the circuit, renaming it the ITF World Tennis Tour as a new umbrella name for former Pro Circuit and Junior Circuit tournaments and will serve as the player pathway between the junior game and the elite levels of professional tennis.\nThe launch of the tour is the culmination of a series of ITF reforms designed to support talented junior players in their progression to the senior game, and target the prize money effectively at professional tournaments to enable more players to make a living as professionals.\nList of events.\nThe ITF Women's Circuit has included:"

They were accepted into the qualifying tournament on the agreement that they would aim to develop rugby league within Lebanon. The Lebanese Rugby League Committee was formed in 2003. It was initially based in Sydney, Australia.\nThe Lebanese Rugby League Committee was awarded full federation status in Lebanon on 30 December 2009.\nIn 2010 the LRL changed its logo, adopting a competition submission by Bashir Srour of Beirut. The design incorporates a representation of a rugby league ball, the cedar of the Lebanese flag and the numerals \"XIII\" symbolising rugby league. The use of the colour red represents \"strength and power\" while the green represents the cedar. The sharp edges of the font used for \"LRLF\" represent the intensity and roughness of the sport."

        "title": "Newcastle (Staffs) Volleyball Club",
        "text": "Newcastle (Staffs) Volleyball Club is an English volleyball club based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England which is affiliated with Volleyball England, with teams competing at the national level for women, men, girls and boys in all three formats of the sport - Volleyball, Sitting Volleyball and Beach Volleyball. Formed in 1980, the club is best known for its tradition of junior development and has produced a number of England's leading talents in the sport. The construction of Beach Volleyball courts at Keele University in 2016 provided the club with the opportunity to continue its development through this form of the game.\nThe club was formed following the amalgamation of two school teams in Newcastle-under-Lyme: Marshlands High School (now Wolstanton)] and Edward Orme High School (now Newcastle Community)]. The two schools had developed a strong cohort of predominantly-male volleyball players; as they grew older, the players needed to play at a higher level. The club was formed and its teams rose quickly through local and regional leagues to national-league status. When it reached the lower reaches of the National League promotion came quickly, until the top flight was reached during the mid-1980s. The women's team was formed during the late 1990s from two teams (Cheadle High School and Stone Alleynes High School), both of which had success at local level; however, until they combined they could not move to a higher level. The combined team entered the West Midlands Regional League; during the mid-2000s, it progressed to play in the National League. From 2008–2010 the women's team underwent more changes, with a new generation of young players graduating from the club's junior ranks. During the 2010–2011 season, the women's team won the national under-18 championship, the NVL 2 North title and the National Shield.\nDespite winning a number of national junior titles, the club has been less successful at the senior level. In 2002 the club embarked on a programme of growth centred on Madeley High School, which has spread across all four school-sports partnerships in North Staffordshire, a Talented Athlete Programme (TAP) at the City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and links to three higher-education institutions (Keele University, Staffordshire University and Manchester Metropolitan University-Cheshire). September 2010 saw the opening of the Volleyball England National Academy, based in Loughborough; of the academy's first intake, six boys and two girls play for the club and are eligible for a formal daily training programme linked to the national squad as part of the England performance pathway. The 2010–2011 season saw three of the club's junior teams reaching the national finals, with the under-18 boys and girls both winning titles and the under-16 boys losing the final. Since then, no titles have been won, but teams have reached the final stages of competitions in every season - and in 2016 the men's 1st team lost 3-2 in a fantastic National Shield Final against Solent, after having missed out on promotion to the Super 8s (the elite league) the previous season in a play-off against London Lynx.\nTwice winner of the Volleyball England Club of the Year Award since 2000, chair Colin Roberts and other members have received a number of awards for their work with the club. Roberts received the National Leadership Award by the Institute of Sport, Parks and Leisure (ISPAL) in summer 2009, and was runner-up for the Service to Sport award at the City of Stoke-on-Trent Sports Awards in early 2010 after receiving the Volleyball England \"Volunteer of the Year\" award in 2008 (12 months after fellow club member Rod Stockwell received the same honour). In 2016 the club completed the long process of becoming a charity, based on its focus on supporting the development of young people in the local community by raising aspirations.\nIn 2012, inspired by the London Olympic Games and a burst of additional interest in the sport, the club launched its social section which is thriving, and still growing four years later. This section of the club focuses on fun and participation in an active lifestyle through volleyball.\n2014 saw the creation of a Sitting Volleyball section of the club, through the emergence of local players with an interest and enthusiasm for the Paralympic version of the sport, and the need of a number of leading players around England to have a team to play for. In their two seasons the team has finished 2nd in the leading national competition (Volleyball England Sitting Volleyball Grand Prix) twice, and lost in the National Cup final on one occasion.\nIn 2016 the England National Team returned to the court for the first time since it surrendered status to Great Britain for the 2012 Olympic Games - and competed in the CEV European Championships qualification round in Norway in May. Captaining the team was Newcastle Staffs. alumni Adam Bradbury (now playing professionally in Sweden for Vingakers), and along with fellow Staffs 'old boy' Sam Shenton (now playing for Team Northumbria) the team made great strides losing 3-1 versus Norway and Israel, but beating Hungary 3-2.\nHonours.\nNewcastle has won a number of English national volleyball titles, predominantly in the junior age groups; a number of players have been recognised at the international level. In 2010 the national under-18 champion boys' team travelled to Castellana Grotte in southern Italy for the inaugural EuroVolley Cup 2010 (a European junior boys club competition supported by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) and the Italian federation. The team won two of its nine matches, finishing in eighth place.\nInternational-level players.\nPlayer's highest honour only (i.e. if GB, England not recorded)"

        "text": "Vivian Richards is a former international cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. He has scored centuries (100 runs or more) in both Test and One Day International (ODI) matches. In 2000, he was knighted for his services to cricket, and during the same year named as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. He is generally considered one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and in 2002 he was honoured by \"Wisden\", who named him as the greatest ODI batsman of all time, and the third greatest Test batsman. After four years, he received the Most Exalted Order of National Hero award in his native Antigua.\nRichards made his Test debut against India in November 1974, and scored his maiden Test century during the second Test of the same tour, scoring an unbeaten 192 in the first-innings of the match. In 1976, he scored seven Test centuries in a calendar year, passing Garfield Sobers' record of six, which had been set in 1958. He scored his maiden double century in the first Test of that year's tour of England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham making 232. After scoring a century in the third Test, he once again scored a double century in the fifth Test, accumulating his highest score, 291, at The Oval, London. These centuries, and a total of 1,710 Test runs in the year, helped him to be named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. In 1986, facing England at the Antigua Recreation Ground, Richards scored the fastest century in Test cricket, reaching his twentieth Test hundred in 56 balls. Richards has the third-highest number of centuries for the West Indies, behind Brian Lara's 34 and Sobers' 26.\nIn One Day International cricket, Richards made his debut during the 1975 Cricket World Cup in England. He scored his first century the following year in the same country, during the first ODI match of the tour, remaining 119 not out. He holds the two highest scores by a West Indian batsman in ODI cricket, 181 against Sri Lanka in 1987 and 189 not out against England in 1984. His score of 189 not out was also the highest score by any ODI batsman for just under 13 years, until it was surpassed by Saeed Anwar's 194. This innings was also named by \"Wisden\" as the best ODI innings of all-time in a 2002 list. In total, seven of Richards' eleven centuries were in the top 100, and his 1979 unbeaten 138 against England at Lord's ranked second."

It was serialized in Shueisha's manga magazine \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from December 2008 to September 2014, with its chapters collected in 30 volumes. It tells the story of a high school basketball team trying to make it to the national tournament.\nAn anime television series adaptation by Production I.G aired for three seasons from April 2012 to June 2015. A sequel manga, \"Kuroko's Basketball: Extra Game\", was serialized in \"Jump Next!\" from December 2014 to March 2016. An anime film adaptation of the \"Kuroko's Basketball: Extra Game\" manga premiered in March 2017. A stage play adaptation opened in April 2016 followed by more stage adaptations.\nThe manga has been licensed for English-language release by Viz Media in North America. By November 2020, \"Kuroko's Basketball\" had over 31 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.\nPlot.\nThe Teiko Middle School basketball team dominated basketball teams within Japan, winning the middle school Nationals for three consecutive years. The star players of the team became known as the \"Generation of Miracles\". After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was another player in the \"Generation of Miracles\": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the \"Generation of Miracles\", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of his youth in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, and Seijuro Akashi.\nSeirin High team faced Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami's skills with added strength and speed, Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. They then met Shintaro Midorima's school Shutoku in the preliminaries of Interhigh. The game was much more difficult; not only was Midorima considerably stronger than Kagami, but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. Seirin managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, whose basketball team included the Ace of the \"Generation of Miracles\" - Daiki Aomine. After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team. They spent the entire summer training for the Winter Cup, even coincidentally meeting Shutoku while training.\nIn the preliminaries, they met team Shutoku again. This match ended into a tie, so Seirin needed to defeat team Kirisaki Daichi in order to advance. Kirisaki Daichi's captain was Makoto Hanamiya, a member of the Uncrowned Kings well-known for his underhanded methods to win a match. However, they won and gained a ticket to the Winter Cup.\nMedia.\nManga.\nWritten and illustrated by Tadatoshi Fujimaki, \"Kuroko's Basketball\" was serialized in the \"shōnen\" manga anthology \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from December 8, 2008 to September 1, 2014.

In May 2013, the manga has over one million copies of volume 1 in print. By 2013, the manga had over 23 million copies in circulation, a number that grew to 27 million by April 2014. By November 2020, the series has over 31 million copies in circulation. Individual volumes frequently appeared on Oricon's weekly lists of the best-selling manga in Japan, and many of them were some of the best-selling manga in the year 2012. \"Kuroko's Basketball\" was the third best-selling manga series of 2013, with 8,761,081 copies sold in a year. In 2014, the 24th volume of the manga had received an initial print run of one million copies; and the 30th volume in 2015 had an initial print run of 700,000 copies printed. The \"Kuroko's Basketball\" light novel series also sold well in Japan in 2014. The first light novel \"Replace\" was the ninth best-selling light novel series, while it was the sixth best-selling light novel volume with 215,859 copies sold. DVD sales of the anime series have also been featured on Oricon's weekly Japanese anime DVD rankings various times.\n\"Kuroko's Basketball\" is often compared to \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\"s earlier basketball-themed manga \"Slam Dunk\". However, Azusa Takahashi of \"Real Sound\" pointed out whereas \"Slam Dunk\" was very realistic, the newer series is more focused on entertainment and is strongly based in fiction with each character having a \"special move.\" The anime series was awarded the 2013 Tokyo Anime Award in the Television Category.\nControversies.\nAfter the anime began airing in 2012, the series became popular with \"dōjinshi\" circles, particularly for \"yaoi dōjinshi\", though there is no yaoi in the series itself. Several events at which dōjinshi of the series were to be sold, as well as several other locations linked to the series and the author Tadatoshi Fujimaki, including a television station airing the anime, a convenience store chain selling items of the series, and Fujimaki's alma mater Sophia University, received threatening letters containing a powder or liquid substance. It is still unknown if it is one individual behind all the threatening letters, nor is the reason for the threats known. Multiple doujinshi events, including Comiket, banned content related to the series, barring creators from selling \"Kuroko's Basketball\"-themed doujinshi at their events. The suspect, who was later revealed to be a 36-year-old man named Hirofumi Watanabe, was eventually caught and was arrested on December 15, 2013. Due to the loss of \"Kuroko's Basketball\" dōjinshi because of the threats, there was a special event that specifically focused on dōjinshi related to the series affectionately named \"Kuroket\", organized by the Comic Market Preparatory Committee, held during the Comiket Special 6 – Otaku Summit 2015 on March 29, 2015. The event hosted approx. 2400 \"dōjinshi\" circles."

        "title": "Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club is a cricket club in Victorian Premier Cricket, the elite club competition of Melbourne, Australia. The club played sub-district cricket from 1974-75 to 1992-93 and played its first season of premier cricket in 1993-94. Its home ground is the Adrian Butler Oval in Frankston.\nSince promotion from the sub districts to Victorian Premier Cricket in 1993–94, the club has yet been able to win a 1st XI premiership; their best effort was runner-up to St Kilda Cricket Club in 2000–01.\nHistory.\nThe Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club was founded in 1880 under the name of the Frankston Cricket Club. The club played in the Victorian sub-district cricket association, which is a step down from Victorian Premier Cricket (VCA), from 1974-75 to 1992-93. Then in 1993 the club was accepted into the VCA and changed its name to the Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club, starting a new era for the club. Frankston Peninsula played its first season of premier cricket in 1993-94 at its home ground, the Adrian Butler Oval in Frankston.\n1996-97 the Frankston Peninsula Seconds won the Premiership.\nDuring the 2001-02 season, the club finished a disappointing 16th in the competition. The 2002-03 season saw great improvement however, with the club finished in 5th on the ladder and an impressive 4th on the ladder in a positive one day campaign. In the 2-day finals Frankston Peninsula made it to the Grand final, playing St Kilda. With St Kilda 289 &amp; 4/175 defeating Frankston Peninsula 201 at the Albert Ground. The next year saw the club perform just as well during the regular season, finishing 6th in the 2-day and one-day competitions. But in the 2-day finals they were again defeated by St Kilda in the Qualifying Final. The 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons finished in disappointment, with the club unable to make the finals on both occasions. The 2005-06 season however saw the Club revamp its scoreboard \"The Tim Gloury Scoreboard\" to further enhance the facility. In a positive 2006-07 season the club finished 6th in the competition and 15th in a disappointing one day campaign. But were once again defeated by St Kilda in the 2-day finals and Footscray-Edgewater in the One-Day finals. The following year once again saw Frankston Peninsula finish 16th in the competition. The 2008-09 saw the club finish in 6th on the 2-day ladder and 15th on the one-day ladder. Carlton knocked out Frankston Peninsula in the finals due to wet weather giving Carlton the Draw they needed. In 2009-10, Frankston Peninsula finished 6th on the 2-day ladder and 15th on the one-day ladder, the same positions as the year before. They were once again defeated by St Kilda in the first round of finals.\nGround.\nThe Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club boasts two top quality playing surfaces the Adrian Butler Oval (used by the 1st and 2nd XI) and the Jubilee Park East Oval (used by the 3rd and 4th XI). Situated in between both grounds is the two story Kevin Collopy Pavilion, which allows spectators to view either game from a great view point. The Butler Oval was reconstructed in 1991 just prior to the Frankston Cricket Club's first attempt to gain admission to the VCA or Victorian Premier League. Since then it has won the Award for the best 1st &amp; 2nd XI ground on 8 occasions. The East Oval was reconstructed in 1999 and after the 3rds and 4ths spent the 1999~2000 Season playing home games at the R.M.Hooper Oval in Hastings. The ground was adjudged the Best of the 3rds and 4ths Grounds for the next 3 seasons, including two more seasons after that.\nThe Collopy Pavilion, which overlooks both grounds, was completed in mid-2002 and was officially opened on 27 October. It commands a brilliant view of Port Phillip Bay, at night the lights of the City and on playing days the ideal view of games being played on both grounds.\nPremier Grounds Award:\nClub song.\n\"If you are a Frankston boy, then sing along with me,\"\n\"We are the Heat on the road to victory,\"\n\"All for one and one for all we will answer to the call,\"\n\"We are the greatest team of all.\"\n\"Good old Frankston boys forever,\"\n\"We will always stick together,\"\n\"We will always do our best to see it through,\"\n\"For the good old red, gold and blue.\"\nHonours.\nHonors for the Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club in Victorian Premier Cricket, since the clubs induction into the Victorian Cricket Association in 1993.\nClub.\nPremierships and Runners-up for all the clubs elevens since the clubs induction into the VCA in 1993.\nAustralian Representatives.\nFrankston Peninsula players who have also played for the Australian Test, One Day International or Twenty20 International cricket teams.\nVictorian Representatives.\nPlayers who have represented the Victorian Bushrangers and have also played for the Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club.

        "title": "Cricket",
        "text": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.\nThe fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as \"T20\"), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.\nTraditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.\nThe earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the \"Laws of Cricket\", are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.\nWomen's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.\nThe most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nCricket is one of many games in the \"club ball\" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a \"wicket gate\" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend. The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three \"groups\" of \"club ball\" games: the \"hockey group\", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the \"golf group\", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the \"cricket group\", in which \"the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it\".\nIt is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:\nBeing a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.\nGiven Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played by boys in Surrey. The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"\"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\" and the verb form \"\"crosser\" as \"to play at cricket\".\nOne possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word \"\"cryce\" (or \"\"cricc\") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary\", he derived cricket from \"\"cryce\", Saxon, a stick\". In Old French, the word \"\"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) \"\"krick\"(\"-e\"), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"\"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, \"met de (krik ket)sen\" (i.e., \"with the stick chase\"). Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.\nGrowth of amateur and professional cricket in England.\nAlthough the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects. The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.\nIn 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance. This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.\nCricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century. It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth. The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.\nAccording to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after the Restoration\" in 1660. Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era. Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population. Along with horse racing, as well as prizefighting and other types of blood sport, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players. By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676. A 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.\nThe patrons, and other players from the social class known as the \"gentry\", began to classify themselves as \"amateurs\" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities. The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of \"noblesse oblige\" to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their \"social inferiors\" if they were to win their bets. In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were \"officers and gentlemen\" whose destiny was to provide leadership. In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term \"shamateur\" was coined to describe the practice.\nEnglish cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport. Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting. Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape.\nThe Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the \"Laws of Cricket\". New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).\nThe 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839. In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.\nThe most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, \"de facto\" professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.\nThe last two decades before the First World War have been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.\nCricket becomes an international sport.\nIn 1844, the first-ever international match took place between what were essentially club teams, from the United States and Canada, in Toronto; Canada won. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North America and South Africa.\nIn 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen which toured England in 1868.\nIn 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognized as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia. The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.\nCricket in the 20th century.\nThe inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batter of all time. To curb his dominance, England employed Bodyline tactics during the 1932-33 Ashes series, which involved bowling at the body of the batter and setting a field, that resulted in batters having to choose between being hit or risking getting out. This series moved cricket from simply being a game to a matter of national importance with diplomatic cables being passed between the two countries over the incident.\nDuring this time, the number of Test nations continued to grow with the West Indies, New Zealand and India being admitted as full Test members within a four-year period from 1928 to 1932.\nAn enforced break during the Second World War stopped Test Cricket for a time, although the Partition of India caused Pakistan to gain Test status in 1952. As teams began to travel more, the game quickly grew from 500 tests in 84 years to 1000 within 23.\nCricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an immediate impact.\nSri Lanka would join the ranks in 1982, although South Africa would be banned by the ICC due to Apartheid from 1970 until 1992. 1992 also brought about the introduction of Zimbabwe.\nCricket in the 21st century.\nThe 21st century was welcomed in by the introduction of Bangladesh, who made their debut in 2000. The game itself also grew with a new format made up of 20 over innings being created. T20 Cricket took hold and quickly grew to became a highly popular format, putting One Day Cricket at risk. The new shorter format also caused Franchise cricket to be created, with tournaments like the Indian Premier League and the Australian Big Bash League being formed.\nOutside factors also took their toll on cricket with the 2008 Mumbai attacks leading India and Pakistan to suspend bilateral series indefinitely, while a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team during their tour of Pakistan, led to Pakistan being unable to play at home until 2019.\nIn 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th Test nations.\nLaws and gameplay.\nIn cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called \"The Laws of Cricket\" (hereinafter called \"the Laws\") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital \"L\"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.\nPlaying area.\nCricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image of cricket pitch and creases) between two teams of eleven players each. The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.\nIn the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed apart. The pitch is a flat surface wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.\nAs illustrated, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.\nMatch structure and closure.\nBefore a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings. Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match. In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batters. When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting their ability to run; in this case, the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs, though this does not apply in international cricket. The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.\nThe main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn. If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have \"lost by \"n\" runs\" (where \"n\" is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by \"n\" wickets\", where \"n\" is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) have won the match \"by four wickets\".\nIn a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have \"won by an innings and \"n\" runs\", and does not need to bat again: \"n\" is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.\nIf the match has only a single innings per side, then usually a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. In some cases, ties are broken by having each team bat for a one-over innings known as a Super Over; subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.\nIn all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue. There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.\nInnings.\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in\". In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress.\nAn innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:\nOvers.\nThe Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\". The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\". The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.\nClothing and equipment.\nThe wicket-keeper (a specialised fielder behind the batter) and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.\nSubject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.\nBat and ball.\nThe essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from their end of the pitch towards the batter who, armed with a bat, is \"on strike\" at the other end (see next sub-section: \"Basic gameplay\").\nThe bat is made of wood, usually \"Salix alba\" (white willow) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than wide and the total length of the bat not more than . There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).\nThe ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of . The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva was legal, even when the polishing was deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air. The use of saliva has since been made illegal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seams constitute illegal ball tampering.\nPlayer roles.\nBasic gameplay: bowler to batter.\nDuring normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.\nIn the photo, the two batters (3 &amp; 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6). Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 &amp; 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler's (4) end of the pitch. The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batter (8) at the other end who is called the \"striker\". The other batter (3) at the bowling end is called the \"non-striker\". The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called \"first slip\" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batters and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).\nWhile the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called \"square leg\", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.\nSome players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either of these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termed all-rounders. Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or spinners. Batters are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.\nFielding.\nOf the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.\nIf a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of the aforementioned fielder, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return. The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.\nBowling and dismissal.\nMost bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batters bowl occasionally. These specialists bowl multiple overs during an innings, in groups called \"spells\" that are generally 4 to 8 overs long in order not to physically exhaust the bowler, cause muscle strain and stress the skeleton. The rules prevent a single bowler bowling consecutive overs, resulting in at least two bowlers alternating each over. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.\nA bowler reaches their delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts their run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\". Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up, while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over , and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing their shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder. At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler, who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter. A spinner will often \"buy their wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batter into making a poor shot. The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries, as the batter is often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as the batter expects it to, and the batter could be \"trapped\" into getting themself out. Accidental full toss deliveries can also get wickets as the failure of the ball to bounce can surprise a batsman, or induce a poor stroke in an effort to punish the poor deliver with a boundary hit. In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium-paced seamers, who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter's concentration.\nThere are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed: five relatively common and four extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped. Rare methods are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field and timed out. The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give their decision. If the batter is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says \"Out!\"; otherwise, the umpire will shake their head and say \"Not out\". There is, effectively, a tenth method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.\nBatting, runs and extras.\nBatters take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team. Substitute batters are generally not allowed, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.\nIn order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.\nA skilled batter can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat, it is called an \"edge\". The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, the batter does not have to attempt a run when hitting the ball with their bat. Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs by simply making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists, or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that the player has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batter's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".\nThe batter on strike (i.e. the \"striker\") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with their bat so that the batter and their partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground \"en route\" to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batters do not need to run. Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball.\nIf an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batters have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules; wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they bowl so that the ball is out of the batter's reach; bye, an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way; leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter's body, though not their bat. If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, the bowler's team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.\nSpecialist roles.\nThe captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating their players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that the captain's players conduct themselves \"within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws\".\nThe wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the \"keeper\") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about their equipment and demeanour. The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping, and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.\nDepending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batters, and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.\nUmpires and scorers.\nThe game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, and the other in a position called \"square leg\" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which that umpire is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities, including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batter is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How's that?\" or \"Howzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.\nOff the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out (has been dismissed); the umpire raises both arms above their head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.\nA match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks, and runs were originally called notches. According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use. It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.\nScores are displayed differently depending on location, although it is standard to show how many wickets have been lost and how many runs a team has made in the following formats.\nWithin Australia, the format is Wickets/Runs. While in the rest of the world, the format is Runs/Wickets.\nA score of 125 with 4 wickets lost, would be displayed as 4/125 or 125/4 respectively.\nSpirit of the Game.\nBesides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the \"Spirit of Cricket\", a concept encompassing sportsmanship, fair play and mutual respect. This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined. Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000 a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game. The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line:\n\"Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only\naccording to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket\".\nThe Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the \"positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork.\" Its second line states that \"the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents.\"\nThe umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.\nPrevious versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batter is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship – or its absence.\nWomen's cricket.\nWomen's cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745. International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test match was played between Australia and England in December 1934. The following year, New Zealand joined them, and in 2007 Netherland became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa. In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005). In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England. In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and T20I lists.\nGovernance.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989. The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nEach member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.\nThe table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:\nForms of cricket.\nCricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket.\nThe highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital \"T\") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.\nLimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each. There are two main types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three to four hours, usually in an evening session. The first Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007. In addition, a few full-member cricket boards have decided to start leagues that are played in the T10 format, in which games are intended to last approximately 90 minutes. Most recently, in 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) introduced a new league featuring a hundred-ball tournament, known as The Hundred. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".\nSingle wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batter in at a time, and that batter must face every delivery bowled while their innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.\nCompetitions.\nCricket is played at both the international and domestic level. There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats. There are now a number of T20 leagues, which have spawned a \"T20 freelancer\" phenomenon.\nInternational competitions.\nMost international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes.\nThe ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020 and lasted only for one edition. The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.\nCompetitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier.\nThe game's only appearance in an Olympic Games was the 1900 Olympics. However, it is scheduled to make a return, with the T20 format of the game, in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nNational competitions.\nFirst-class.\nFirst-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019.\nAustralia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. New South Wales has the highest number of titles.\nThe other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League (Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).\nClub and school cricket.\nThe world's earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a \"cricketing\" of \"the Weald and the Upland\" versus \"the Chalk Hill\" at Chevening \"about thirty years since\" (i.e., ). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.\nAt the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular. Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events. The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket. On the North American side, in 2023, Monroe Township High School, in Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, launched the first U.S. high school cricket club.\nCulture.\nInfluence on everyday life.\nCricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as \"that's not cricket\" (that's unfair), \"had a good innings\" (lived a long life) and \"sticky wicket\". \"On a sticky wicket\" (\"aka\" \"sticky dog\" or \"glue pot\") is a metaphor used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.\nIn the arts and popular culture.\nCricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron. \"Beyond a Boundary\" (1963), written by Trinidadian C. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written.\nIn the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's \"Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury\" (1907) and Russell Drysdale's \"The Cricketers\" (1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\" French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batter in motion. Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan's cricket images are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's \"World of Invention\" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nIn music, many calypsos make reference to the Sport of Cricket.\nInfluence on other sports.\nCricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports. In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game. It is typically played on modified cricket fields.\nIn England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months. Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884; Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams. Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.\nIn the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the \"Clipper\". The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as \"the Father of Baseball\" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.\nSee also.\nRelated sports"

A prolific long-range scorer, he was nicknamed \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Shotgun\". Scoop Jackson of the magazine \"SLAM\" later dubbed him the best playground basketball player ever. \"No one has ever claimed to have seen, heard about or witnessed Billy having a bad game. Not one story, not one game,\" wrote Jackson.\nHarris graduated from Dunbar High School in Chicago in 1969; he averaged a team-high 33 points per game as a senior. After being recruited by many colleges, including the University of Kansas, he played at Northern Illinois University from 1969 to 1973. During his junior season at NIU, he led the team to a 21–4 record, which was good enough for NIU to be ranked in the national top 20 for the first time in school history. Harris tallied 17.8 points per game that season, and 24.1 points per game the next season.\nAfter college, Billy Harris was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the seventh round of the 1973 NBA draft. However, he did not make the team, and instead played in the American Basketball Association with the San Diego Conquistadors and in the Philippines. Later in his life, Billy Harris coached basketball for young people in his Chicago neighborhood and became a car salesman. He was inducted into the Northern Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2002.\nOn January 3, 2010, Harris died of a stroke at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago. He is survived by his six children, eight bonus children, three brothers, one sister, and many grandchildren."
