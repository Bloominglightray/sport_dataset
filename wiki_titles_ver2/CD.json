        "text": "Benjamin Frank Davis (born October 30, 1945) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback and return specialist for 10 years in the National Football League (NFL). He is the brother of political activist Angela Davis.\nEarly years.\nDavis was born in 1945 in Birmingham, Alabama. His father, a graduate of St. Augustine's College, a traditional black college in Raleigh, North Carolina, was briefly a high school history teacher, but found it more lucrative to own and operate a service station in the black section of Birmingham. His mother, with an MA from New York University, was an elementary school teacher. The family owned a large home in a middle class mixed neighborhood called \"Dynamite Hill\" after so-called \"night rider\" terrorists began bomb attacks on civil rights leaders clustered there.\nTo avoid the racial strife for which Dynamite Hill was named, children in the Davis family spent time with friends and relatives elsewhere. Davis graduated from Fair Lawn High School in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, at the age of 15, then marked time by attending Bridgton Academy, a prep school in Maine until he was old enough to enroll in Defiance College in rural Defiance, Ohio.\n\"I went to Defiance because I was looking for the same type of environment as the prep school,\" Davis told Fred Greetham in 2001. \"I was in the band in high school, but I decided to go out for the football team in college. By the time we were seniors, we were undefeated.\"\nProfessional career.\nDavis was drafted in the 17th (and last) round by the Cleveland Browns in the 1967 NFL Draft. With Paul Warfield, Gary Collins and Clifton McNeil already established as receivers, Davis was switched to a defensive role. In his rookie year, he led the league in punt returns, averaging 12.7 yards per return, and one 52-yard return for a touchdown. He also led the Browns in returning kickoffs, with 27 returns totalling 708 yards, including one of 63 yards. Only Leroy Kelly (15.6), Greg Pruitt (12.9) and Eric Metcalf (12.9) ever had better years returning punts for the Browns.\nIn 1968, Davis started at cornerback, and led the team with 8 interceptions. The season's 32 interceptions that year set a Browns record. His individual performance is the 3rd-best in Browns history, and he still holds the record for seven consecutive games with an interception.\nA torn anterior cruciate ligament benched Davis during the 1969 season, and half of the 1970 season.\nHe was traded to the Detroit Lions in 1974 for a 5th-round draft pick.\nPost-NFL.\nDavis went into copier sales after his football career ended, then went into cable television and bought a radio station in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since 1995, he has owned and operated Britt Business Systems, a Xerox dealer, in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood, Ohio. Davis has lived in Cleveland since 1967, even commuting to Detroit when he played for the Lions.\nPersonal life.\nDavis and his wife Sylvia have two grown children, Cecilie and Ben III, who both live in California. Davis's sister, Angela Davis, is a prominent political activist. A younger brother, Reggie Davis, also attended Defiance College."

The feat was first accomplished in 1890 by Buck West, and most recently by Stephen Vogt in 2022.\nPaul Gillespie and John Miller are the only players in MLB history to hit home runs in their first and last major-league at bats. Bobby Kielty and David Ross both hit their final home runs in a World Series game—Kielty hit his for the Boston Red Sox in the series-clinching Game 4 of the 2007 World Series, while Ross's occurred in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series and was an important contribution to ending the 108 year title drought of the Chicago Cubs. Mickey Cochrane and Ted Williams are the only players on this list who are inductees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nPlayers.\nMany players in the below list hit a home run the final time they batted in the last game of their professional career—that is, at the professional level, the player never batted again or played in another game—one notable example being Ted Williams. However, circumstances may vary—for example, Mickey Cochrane homered in his final at bat (hence his inclusion in the below list) but was hit by a pitch in his final plate appearance. Because pitchers bat less often than position players, especially since the introduction of the designated hitter, some pitchers in the below list played in many major-league games after their final at bat; for example, Tim Stoddard, who homered in his final at bat in June 1986, pitched in the major leagues through July 1989. In other cases, a player in the below list had a very brief major-league career, but continued playing professionally at the minor-league level—one example is Chris Jelic, who played in only four major-league games, all late in the 1990 season, then continued playing professionally through 1993.\nNote: Baseball Almanac, the primary source for this section, lists and numbers players who have accomplished the feat during regular-season games, and provides separate commentary on players who have done so in postseason games.\nRegular season.\nSource:\nPostseason.\nSource:"

Fiji were awarded 'second tier' status by the International Rugby Board.\nBy 1976, the union contained 750 clubs.\nFor a number of years, Fiji rugby suffered from a degree of racial segregation - the Native Rugby Union was formed in 1915, but did not merge with the national union until 1945.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nRugby football was introduced into Fiji in the 1884 if not earlier, by Britons and New Zealanders, and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba, on Viti Levu. By the early 1890s, the sport had started to draw attention from media outlets, such as newspaper and other print, and the game started to establish itself as a sport in the country.\nIn its early years, it faced off strong competition from association football, but by 1904, rugby had won out as the stronger code in Fiji, and remains so today.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, a lot of the regular players were expatriates, however, by 1904, a domestic club competition had been organised; in the early years, there were racially segregated leagues with whites and native Fijians playing separately.\nThe first formally organised club, Pacific, was formed in 1913 by New Zealander PJ Sheehan, a tradesman. The idea to form a rugby club came about from Sheehan and his co-workers, most who were New Zealand or Australian expatriates, and had no organised sporting club or competition. The club was founded with around 40 members.\nThese matches became popular with the locals, as well as the European population in Fiji. Sheehan was approached by a European to consider the formation of a governing body. Thus, the Fiji Rugby Football Union was soon formed. The Cadets club and the United Services club were also established in this period. Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott, the governor of the colony at the time, donated the Escott Shield, with the purpose for competitive club competition. The first championship was won by the Pacific club. During this period, Sheehan arranged for the All Blacks to stop in Fiji on their way home from a tour of California in the United States. A match was organised between the All Blacks and a Fijian representative side. The All Blacks won 67 to 3, with Sheehan, the captain-coach getting the only points for the Fijian representative side.\nThe Fijian team was made up of Europeans, as were most of the clubs at this point, though by now the locals had taken an enthusiastic interest in the game. Several Fijian locals approached Sheehan and asked him to teach the sport to the locals. Sheehan subsequently organised a match between two sides, all made up of local players. The game was played on a rainy afternoon, that, along with different interpretations of the rules, made the game difficult. By the following year, locals had formulated their own competition, and the clubs Taipou, Tarirere, Hill and Ofisa (police) had been established. Local businessman J Davies presented the Davies Cup for competition in 1915, which was first won by Tarirere. A governing body for the competition was established through the main Rugby union.\nOn 18 August 1924, the national team played their first ever test, playing Western Samoa. The match was played in Samoa at 7 in the morning, so the Fijians could later continue onto Tonga that same day, as well, so the Samoans could work after the game. Fiji won the match 6 to nil, and continued on to a nine match tour of Tonga. The team actually wore black jerseys, as opposed to their now-traditional white ones. Spectators at their first game praised the visiting Fijians for their speed and agility.\nIn 1926, two overseas sides visited Fiji, being the Auckland University College and the national team of Tonga. This became the first time that the national side of Fiji would wear their now traditional white jerseys and black shorts. Two years later, a domestic schools competition was started.\nThe toured Fiji in 1938.\nIt was in 1939 that Fiji Schools Union was established to govern school rugby. Also that year, Fiji embarked on a tour of New Zealand. The team became famous for becoming the first side to leave New Zealand without losing a match - winning seven and drawing one of their eight fixtures. The Fijians impressed the New Zealand crowds with their unpredictable and free-flowing style of rugby. After their final match against the New Zealand Maori, a newspaper wrote that \"Fiji is destined to play a big part in world rugby\".\n1950s and 60s.\nFiji toured New Zealand again in 1951, and were successful with most of their fixtures, winning eight of their games, losing five and drawing twice.\nAs early as the 1950s, the Fijians toured Australia twice. The 1952 tour was notable for its record crowds in Australia: in the 1952 game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a crowd of 42,000 turned up to watch. Fiji held the Wallabies to a one-a-piece drawn two-test series.\nThe Farebrother-Sullivan Trophy, started in 1961 was for competition between Fijian sub-unions.\nFiji returned two years later, achieving the same test series result, and breaking further crowd records. In 1963 the Fiji Rugby Football Union became the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU).\n's first tour to Europe came in 1964. and they played and and a variety of local teams. Their first match in Europe was against France in Paris, where they lost 21 to 3. They went on to play another five matches against various French teams. They then played a test against Wales XV at Cardiff Arms Park, where they lost only 28 to 22. Fiji then continued on to play another three Welsh sides.\n1970s, 80s and 90s.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens tournament for rugby sevens was introduced in 1976 and the Fiji sevens team won the title in its second year of competition, in 1977. Fiji went on to win in 1978 and again in 1980 as well as the 1984 tournament. Fiji won the tournament another five times during the 1990s making themselves one of the most dominant sevens sides in the world. However, some commentators have blamed Fijians' love of rugby sevens as being to the detriment of the XV-a-side game.\nDespite its isolation and small population, Fiji has regularly punched above its weight, and threatened to challenge the \"Big Eight\" - one of the most recent examples of this was in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. From 1982 through to 1984, Fiji completed a 15 match winning streak. The national side were invited by the International Rugby Football Board to participate in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 that was to be hosted by Australia and New Zealand. In their first World Cup match, Fiji defeated Argentina 28 to 9 in Hamilton. They were subsequently defeated by the All Blacks, 74 to 13, and Italy, 18 to 15, but they still finished second in their group, which allowed them to go through to the quarter-finals where they lost to France, 16 to 31.\nHowever, they have often been challenged by their South Pacific neighbours, Tonga and Samoa, who are the other two parts of the Pacific Championship. In the 1987 Rugby World Cup, which was invitation only, Tonga and Fiji were invited, with Fiji making it to the quarter-finals where they lost to France, which ended their World Cup campaign. In the 1991 Rugby World Cup, they lost all three of their games, and they did not even qualify for the 1995 tournament. However, the Fiji sevens team won the Rugby World Cup Sevens three years later. Fiji found itself increasingly excluded from the Tri-Nation group - Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - which denied them entry to the Super 12, and hindered development of the game internationally.\nProfessionalisation was a mixed blessing for the Fijian game. On the one hand, it meant that the Fiji team could call on professional talent, and on the other, it meant a \"brawn drain\", as players such as Serevi, Rosari, Bale and Vidiri were drawn out of Fiji, and into the leagues of Japan and New Zealand, which diminished the domestic competition.\nFiji qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales and were grouped in pool C. After strong pool victories over Namibia and Canada, they lost their last game against France. Their pool wins saw them finish second in their pool behind France, and move through to the finals. They lost to England at Twickenham, 45 to 24. Political unrest in Fiji during 2000 forced the FRU to accept the cost of hosting international meets in Samoa, instead of Fiji.\nPresent day.\nFiji qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia and were grouped in pool B. They lost their opening match to France 61 to 18, won a subsequent close game over the United States 19 to 18, defeated Japan but lost their last pool game to Scotland by two points. They finished third in their pool, which did not take them to the finals.\nIn the 2007 Rugby World Cup Fiji were grouped in pool B with Australia, Wales, Japan and Canada. In their final group game they beat Wales 38-34 and went through to the next round, sending Wales home.\nThey were beaten by eventual champions South Africa in the knockout stage.\nThere are over 600 clubs in Fiji.\nNotable players.\nSome notable Fijian players include -\nTwo Fijian players were chosen for the President's Overseas XV squad, selected to play England at the anniversary of the English Rugby Football Union:\nCompetition.\nSkipper Cup\nThis is the top tier domestic competition in Fiji. Involves 8 semi-professional clubs from around Fiji including (Suva, Nadroga, Naitasiri, and Namosi. Another competition that runs parallel to this competition is prestigious Farebrother-Sullivan Trophy, one of Fiji's oldest competition and garners national interest. The Players are picked from this competition for representative honors to the Fiji Warriors and then to higher honors with the Fijian Drua, Fiji's only professional club playing in the Super Rugby as well as being selected for Flying Fijians.\nColonial Cup - defunct.\nThe Colonial Cup was introduced by the Fiji Rugby Union to identify and prepare local players for the international stage. The national side and 'A' team were selected from Colonial Cup players, as well as including overseas players. In 2007 a new team entered the competition leading to six teams in the competition.\nPacific Rugby Cup.\nThe IRB Pacific Rugby Cup started in 2006 and involves representative teams from the three Pacific rugby unions, Fiji along with Samoa and Tonga. Fiji has two sides in the tournament, the Fiji Warriors and the Fiji Barbarians. The aim of the tournament is to improve the quality of rugby in the Pacific Islands.\nRepresentative teams.\nNational.\nFiji have competed at seven World Cups since the tournament was first held in 1987. They made the quarter-finals in 1987,1999, and in 2023. Fiji also compete in the Pacific Tri-Nations alongside Samoa and Tonga. Fiji also participate in the IRB Pacific 5 Nations, again with Samoa and Tonga, as well as Japan and the Junior All Blacks. Fiji perform the cibi as part of their pre-match traditional. The Fiji kit is made up of white jerseys with black shorts. Fiji also participate in the Pacific Tri-Nations series between Tonga, Fiji and Samoa which has been played since 1982. The Pacific Nations Cup is a competition which involves Fiji, Samoa, Tonga as ell as the Junior All Blacks and the Japan and Australia A.\nNational (sevens).\nFiji are one of the most successful sevens nations. They won the Hong Kong Sevens tournament in 1977, and have since won it another eight times. They are also the only side to have won the Rugby World Cup Sevens on two occasions; in 1997 (defeating South Africa in the final) and in 2005 (defeating New Zealand in the final). The World Sevens Series was introduced in 2000, and New Zealand won the first six series in a row. However, at the 2006 event, Fiji put an end to their winning streak, becoming the 2006 World Sevens Series champions. They also won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016, the first Olympic medal in the country's history, when they defeated Great Britain in the final."

        "title": "2006 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2006 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2005–06 season, and the culmination of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs. The first Stanley Cup Finals since 2004 after a lockout in 2004 and 2005, it was contested between the Eastern Conference champion Carolina Hurricanes and the Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers. It was Carolina's second appearance in the Finals, the other being in 2002, a loss to the Detroit Red Wings. It was Edmonton's seventh appearance in the Finals and their first since winning their fifth Stanley Cup in 1990. It was also the first (and to date only) Finals matchup between teams that entered the league in 1979. Carolina defeated Edmonton in seven games to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup and become the tenth post-1967 expansion team and third former WHA team to win the Cup. Carolina's 2006 win was also the team's second league championship (the club, then known as the New England Whalers won the WHA Championship in 1973).\nPaths to the Finals.\nCarolina defeated the Montreal Canadiens 4–2, in the first round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, the New Jersey Devils 4–1 in the second round and the Buffalo Sabres 4–3 in the Eastern Conference final.\nEdmonton defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4–2 in the first round, the San Jose Sharks 4–2 in the second round and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 4–1 in the Western Conference final. The Oilers became the first team since the NBA's 1999 New York Knicks and the first team in the history of the NHL to make it to the finals as a #8 seed.\nGame summaries.\nThis series marked the first time that two former World Hockey Association teams played against each other for the Stanley Cup since they merged with the NHL in 1979. As a result of the new scheduling formula that was implemented before the 2005–06 NHL season, the Hurricanes and the Oilers did not meet during the regular season.\nThese were also the first ever finals contested by two teams that had both missed the playoffs the previous season (skipping 2005 due to the lockout). It was also to be the first finals contested by teams that would both go on to miss the following year's playoffs. Prior to these Finals, only the 1938–39 Chicago Blackhawks had ever missed the playoffs one year, then played in the Stanley Cup Finals (win or lose) the following season, and then missed the playoffs again the season after that. Both the Hurricanes and Oilers have now accomplished this dubious feat.\nHurricanes head coach Peter Laviolette joined Ron Wilson as the only people to have head coached in an Olympics and Stanley Cup finals in the same year, having coached the American ice hockey team during the Torino Olympics. Both would coach in either one in 2010; Wilson coached the American ice hockey team to silver medal at the Vancouver Olympics, while Laviolette would coach in the Stanley Cup Finals with the Philadelphia Flyers.\nGame one.\nIn game one, Carolina tied the biggest comeback in Stanley Cup finals history, overcoming a three-goal deficit to win 5–4. Edmonton scored first, 8:18 into the first period, with a goal from Fernando Pisani. In the second period, Chris Pronger scored the first penalty shot goal in finals history after defenceman Niclas Wallin illegally covered the puck inside his own goal crease, and Ethan Moreau's goal at 16:23 gave the Oilers a 3–0 lead. But at the 17:17 mark, Rod Brind'Amour scored the Hurricanes' first goal of the game. Carolina then tied the game in the third period with two scores by Ray Whitney. The Hurricanes jumped ahead 4–3 on a shorthanded breakaway goal by Justin Williams, but Edmonton's Ales Hemsky scored on a power play to tie the game with 6:29 remaining. Late in the final period, Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson suffered a series-ending knee injury in a collision and was replaced with Ty Conklin. With 32 seconds remaining in regulation, Conklin misplayed the puck behind his own net, where it deflected off Jason Smith's stick to the front of the empty net, allowing Brind'Amour to score the winning goal. Hurricanes goaltender Cam Ward had to make the last of his 34 saves with 3.8 seconds remaining, robbing Shawn Horcoff for the second time in the third period with a glove save to preserve the victory.\nGame two.\nWith Roloson's injury, Jussi Markkanen started for the Oilers in game two. Although Markkanen had played 37 games in the regular season, sharing the job with Ty Conklin and Mike Morrison, he and Conklin switched back and forth during the playoff as the backup (with the other sitting in the press box as a healthy scratch); he also had not played in a game since March 1, 2006. The Hurricanes shut out the Oilers, 5–0, with five different Carolina players scoring goals. It was the first time three goaltenders had been used in the Stanley Cup Finals since May 1970, when the St. Louis Blues employed Jacques Plante, Glenn Hall and Ernie Wakely on their way to being swept by the Boston Bruins.\nGame three.\nMarkkanen once again started in net with Roloson still out. Shawn Horcoff scored just over two minutes into the first period. During the second period, a short-handed goal was waved off by the referee, because he had lost sight of the puck and had blown the whistle, despite the fact that the puck had not yet been covered. The Hurricanes responded midway through the third period with their captain, Rod Brind'Amour, taking a rebound off a blocked shot past Markkanen. However, with 2:15 left in the game, Edmonton's Ryan Smyth scored the winning goal after crashing into Ward inside the crease as they both tried to get control of a rebound off of a shot by Ales Hemsky.\nGame four.\nEdmonton got off to a good start when Sergei Samsonov opened the scoring at 8:40 of the first period. However, the lead was short-lived as Cory Stillman replied just 29 seconds later to tie the game at 1–1. Stillman also made a sound defensive play on Chris Pronger late in the second period, tipping the puck away in the Edmonton zone to the front of the net, where Eric Staal fed a pass to Mark Recchi, who scored the eventual game-winning goal with 4:08 to go in the period. Once again Edmonton's power play was ineffective, failing to capitalize on five chances, including a two-man advantage in the first period. When the game ended, the Oilers were 1-for-25 on the power play to this point in the series.\nGame five.\nCarolina had a 3–1 lead in the series and a chance to win the Stanley Cup on their home ice. However, Edmonton scored first on Fernando Pisani's redirect of a Pronger slapshot 16 seconds into the game. The Hurricanes then went ahead 2–1 on two power play goals by Eric Staal and Ray Whitney before the Oilers scored on the power play with a one-timer by Ales Hemsky to tie the game. Michael Peca then gave Edmonton a 3–2 lead with 17.4 seconds left in the first period. In the second period, Staal poked a goal between Jussi Markkanen and the post to tie the game. Early in the third period, Hurricanes centre Doug Weight got sandwiched by Chris Pronger and Raffi Torres, separating his shoulder and ending his night early. Weight would not return to play for the rest of the series, but would eventually raise the Cup. Carolina defenceman Aaron Ward also was injured in the third period, and with Carolina running out of healthy skaters, the Hurricanes were desperate to close out the game. With 7:47 remaining in the third period, Whitney missed what might have been the Hurricanes' best chance to win the series with a shot that just hit the post. The game went to overtime, where Steve Staios drew a penalty early in the period to put the Hurricanes on the power play. Fernando Pisani picked off a cross-ice pass from Cory Stillman and streaked in short-handed to beat Cam Ward top right corner (glove side) with a left-handed shot to score the first short-handed overtime goal in finals history, giving the Oilers the upset win.\nGame six.\nDespite the emotional boost of Carolina winger Erik Cole returning to the ice for the first time since breaking his neck in March, Edmonton dominated for the entire 60 minutes. They shut out Carolina 4–0, tying the series after down 1–3 in front of a raucous crowd at Rexall Place. They scored three power-play goals and limited the Hurricanes to only 16 shots on goal. Edmonton held Carolina to seven shots through 40 minutes of play. Fernando Pisani scored his post-season-high fifth game-winning goal (and 13th in total, also tops amongst scorers in the 2006 playoffs). This game also marked Jussi Markkanen's first career playoff shutout. This turned out to be the final playoff game at Rexall Place, as the Oilers did not make it into playoffs again until 2017 but by then they relocated to Rogers Place.\nGame seven.\nThe Hurricanes returned to the RBC Center defeating the Oilers in game seven, 3–1, to win the Stanley Cup. Aaron Ward and Frantisek Kaberle gave Carolina a 2–0 lead before Fernando Pisani scored for Edmonton 1:03 into the third period to cut the lead in half.\nWith just over a minute to go in regulation, the Oilers pulled the goalie in hopes of forcing overtime. A loose puck wound up on the stick of Bret Hedican, who passed to Eric Staal, who himself passed it down-ice to Justin Williams. Williams skated down the length of the ice and tapped the puck into the empty net, sealing the Stanley Cup for the Hurricanes. Cam Ward became the first NHL rookie goaltender to win the Stanley Cup Finals series since Patrick Roy led the Montreal Canadiens in , and he was also the first rookie since the Philadelphia Flyers' Ron Hextall in to be awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs.\nCory Stillman earned a Stanley Cup title for the second-straight season, having won in 2004 with the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the first player to win back-to-back titles with different teams since Claude Lemieux (1995 New Jersey Devils, 1996 Colorado Avalanche).\nThe Hurricanes' victory ended Glen Wesley's 18-year drought without winning the Cup. He had played close to 1,500 regular season and playoff games before winning the Cup, the longest such drought in the NHL. Wesley was the last player remaining from the franchise's days as the Hartford Whalers. Other notable veterans to win their first Cup were Rod Brind'Amour, Doug Weight, Ray Whitney and Bret Hedican. Hedican was on the losing end of another final decided in a game seven, in , while with the Vancouver Canucks. Mark Recchi won the second Cup of his career, having won it 15 years prior as a member of the 1991 Pittsburgh Penguins. He would later retire a Stanley Cup winner with the 2011 Boston Bruins, where he teamed up with Frantisek Kaberle's brother Tomas.\nThe Hurricanes became the third former World Hockey Association franchise to win the Stanley Cup, following the Oilers and Quebec Nordiques, who won as the Colorado Avalanche in 1996 and 2001.\nThe 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs marked the second time in a row that an Alberta-based team had made it to the finals only to lose in seven games to the Southeast Division champions, as the Calgary Flames were defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers were not able to complete their Cinderella run, having entered the playoffs seeded eighth, denying General Manager Kevin Lowe and Head Coach Craig MacTavish from joining Lester Patrick and Frank Boucher as the only duos to win the Stanley Cup together as players and then as a coach-managerial team, as the two were with the Oilers as players in , and and the New York Rangers in 1994.\nThis was the first major-league professional championship for the state of North Carolina by a men's team (the Carolina Courage of the defunct Women's United Soccer Association won the 2002 Founders Cup). It is also, the only world championship by an active North Carolina based team in any of the four major league sports. The Hurricanes made it to the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Detroit Red Wings in five games; and the Carolina Panthers made it to Super Bowl XXXVIII, but lost to the New England Patriots, and Super Bowl 50, losing to the Denver Broncos.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2006 Stanley Cup was presented to Hurricanes captain Rod Brind'Amour by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Hurricanes 3–1 win over the Oilers in game seven.\nThe following Hurricanes players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2005–06 Carolina Hurricanes\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, this was the first Stanley Cup Finals to be broadcast on NBC and OLN (later Versus, currently NBC Sports Network). Games one and two were on OLN, while the remainder of the series was on NBC. NBC's broadcast of game seven drew a 3.3 rating, a 21% drop from ABC's 4.2 for game seven in 2004. However, some NBC affiliates didn't air game seven live. Overall, NBC had an average rating of 2.3 for its five telecasts of the final, down 12% from ABC's 2004 average.\nIn Canada, the CBC's broadcast of game seven drew 4.739 million viewers. However, it included pre-game and post-game coverage. The game itself drew 5.553 million."

        "text": "Virtual League Baseball is a 1995 baseball video game developed and published by Kemco for the Virtual Boy. A sequel, \"Virtual League Baseball 2\", was planned, but later canceled due to the Virtual Boy console's poor sales.\nGameplay.\nThere are three modes of play in \"Virtual League Baseball\": Player 1 vs. computer, all-star game, and pennant race. In player 1 vs. computer, one single match is played between the player and the computer. In the all-star game, the player plays against the computer using a team of all-stars from America, Asia, or Europe. In the pennant race, the player plays a series of games against the computer, using passwords to resume play after turning off the console, instead of saving.\nIt is a single-player game. Players can receive and enter passwords to skip levels of the game. The game's teams are international.\nDevelopment.\n\"Virtual League Baseball\" was developed by Kemco and released in October 1995 for the Virtual Boy.\nA playable version of the game was displayed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1995. At the time, the coding was so broken that it was impossible for the player to hit the ball. Promotion for the game was further hurt by its infamous \"chili dog farts\" print advertisement which was centered on a photo of two obese men exposing their butt cracks.\nLike all other Virtual Boy games, \"Virtual League Baseball\" uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses stereoscopy, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect.\nA sequel, \"Virtual League Baseball 2\", was in development, but was never released, despite receiving an ESRB rating.\nReception.\n\"Nintendo Power\" praised the game's graphics and \"realistic baseball experience\", but wrote that it was hard to defend near the fence. One of the magazine's six reviewers recommended the game. \"GamePro\" panned it in a brief review, stating, \"VLB's impressive 3D graphics seem promising at first. But after a while the shallow gameplay and awful sounds sent it foul. The archaic controls only add to the agony.\" Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame found the game reminiscent of \"Major League Baseball\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System, noting \"plinky sound effects, only one stadium, all fielders moving in unison with the control pad (including the infield and outfield!), a batting and pitching interface that relies on one button, and base runners who move at the speed of light. Are these features you want in a 1995 release? Certainly not, especially on a system that's supposed to deliver a 'virtual' experience.\""

        "title": "Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame",
        "text": "The Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame was established in 1976 to honour those who have made a significant contribution to the sport of harness and Thoroughbred horse racing in Canada. It is located at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario.\nThe Hall of Fame annually inducts Thoroughbred and Standardbred horses, sulky drivers, jockeys, trainers and the horse racing industry's builders.\nBackground.\nAlthough the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (CHRHF) was founded in 1976, it was not until 1997 that it had a physical location. At that time, the Ontario Jockey Club granted a permanent site located at the West Entrance to Woodbine Racetrack. The Hall now includes information on each of the inductees plus related memorabilia, including trophies, silks, old racing programs and bronzed horseshoes. Each year, special displays are created to honour some of racing's greats, such as jockey Ron Turcotte or pacer Cam Fella.\nIn 2014, the Hall commemorated the 50th anniversary of Northern Dancer's wins in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Queen's Plate with a series of initiatives such as an online timeline of his career, the induction of his trainer Horatio Luro, a special tribute at the annual ceremony and a calendar. Northern Dancer and his owner, E. P. Taylor, were part of the original class of inductees in 1976. Since then, Northern Dancer's sire Nearctic, dam Natalma, sire's dam Lady Angela, several sons and daughters (including Nijinsky, The Minstrel, Northernette and Vice Regent), plus numerous descendants have also been inducted.\nThere are two nominating committees – one for the Thoroughbred industry, and the other for Standardbreds. Each committee nominates up to eight candidates, which are later voted on by the corresponding election committee. Any Canadian person or horse can be nominated for their achievements, whether in Canada or internationally. Foreign-bred horses who had a significant influence on Canadian racing or breeding may also be nominated. For example, Secretariat was nominated in 2013 in recognition of his appearance in the 1973 Canadian International, an appearance that brought worldwide attention to the race."

        "text": "Ski jumping has been included in the program of every Winter Olympic Games. From 1924 through to 1956, the competition involved jumping from one hill whose length varied from each edition of the games to the next.\nMost historians have placed this length at 70 meters and have classified this as the \"large hill\". (Recent information from the FIS offices in Switzerland have had the K-points from 1924 to 1956 determined as shown below). In 1960, the ski jump hill was standardized to 80 meters. In 1964, a second ski jump, the \"normal hill\" at 70 meters (K90) was added along with the 80 meters (K120) large hill. The length of the large hill run in 1968 increased from 80 meters to 90 meters (K120). The team large hill event was added in 1988. By 1992, the ski jumping competitions were referred by their K-point distances rather than their run length prior to launching from the ski jump (90 meters for the normal hill and 120 meters for the large hill, respectively) and have been that way ever since. For the 2006 Winter Olympics, the normal hill was designated as HS106 (K95) while the large hill was designated as HS140 (K125).\nOn April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially accepted women's ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. On February 11, 2014, Carina Vogt of Germany won the first gold medal for women's ski jumping at the Winter Olympic Games.\nMedal table.\nSources (after the 2022 Winter Olympics):&lt;br&gt;\n\"Accurate as of 2022 Winter Olympics.\"\n\"Note: a tie for silver and no bronze medal in the 1980 normal hill competition.\""

        "title": "International cricket in 2006–07",
        "text": "International cricket in the 2006–07 cricket season is defined by major statisticians, such as CricketArchive and Wisden, as those matches played on tours that started between September 2006 and April 2007. Two major ICC tournaments are scheduled for this season, with the Champions Trophy played in October in India, and the World Cup taking place in West Indies in March. In addition, England will defend the Ashes when they go to Australia in November, and all the ten Test nations will be in action during November and December – though Zimbabwe, who are playing Bangladesh during this time, withdrew from Test matches throughout 2006 and will thus only be playing One-day International matches.\nSeptember.\nDLF Cup.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India has announced that India, Australia and West Indies will take part in a triangular series held at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur. The West Indies Cricket Board were in a payment conflict with the West Indies Players' Association about this series, as the WIPA claims it was not informed before the WICB agreed to the matches, but a deal was eventually agreed in early August. The tournament was known as the DLF Cup, the second ODI tournament to be known by this name, following April's India v Pakistan series in the UAE.\nZimbabwe in South Africa.\nZimbabwe made a one-week tour of South Africa as warm-up to the Champions Trophy. They lost all four matches on tour, three ODIs to South Africa and a Twenty20 match with domestic side Eagles.\nOctober.\nChampions Trophy.\nThe 2006 ICC Champions Trophy was held in India from 7 October to 5 November 2006. It was the fifth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy (previously known as the ICC Knock-out). The tournament venue was not confirmed until mid-2005 when the Indian government agreed that tournament revenues would be free from tax (the 2002 tournament had been due to be held in India, but was switched to Sri Lanka when an exemption from tax in India was not granted). Australia won the tournament, their first Champions Trophy victory. They were the only team to only get one loss in the tournament, as all other teams lost at least two matches. West Indies, their final opponents, beat Australia in the group stage, but were bowled out for 138 in the final and lost by eight wickets on the Duckworth–Lewis method. West Indies opening batsman Chris Gayle was named Player of the Tournament.\nNew Zealand Women in Australia.\nNew Zealand Women are scheduled to tour Australia in October. The series begins on 18 October, and consists of one Twenty20 international and five One-day Internationals. Australia have made one change to their squad since beating India in February, with Leah Poulton replacing the injured Alex Blackwell. Australia won the series 5–0, though the first three matches came down to the last over.\nNovember.\nAfro–Asia Cup.\nThe second Afro–Asia Cup was set to involve the African Cricket Association XI take on the Asian Cricket Council XI playing each other in a series of One Day Internationals, but was postponed until June 2007.\nICC Intercontinental Cup.\nThe 2006 Intercontinental Cup continues into this season, with a November match between Kenya and Bermuda. The details are given under the 2006 season.\nWest Indies in Pakistan.\nWest Indies played three Tests and five One-day Internationals in Pakistan. The tour clashed with a date for a Twenty20 match organised by Allen Stanford, but that game was eventually cancelled and the tour went ahead. In the Test series, Mohammad Yousuf passed Viv Richards' record of most runs in a calendar year, finishing the year with 1,788 Test runs, 665 of which came in this three-match series. Pakistan took a two-nil lead in the ODI series before losing captain Inzamam-ul-Haq to injury, and Marlon Samuels helped West Indies outscore Pakistan with his unbeaten century in the fourth match.\nBermuda in Kenya.\nBermuda visited Kenya for three One Day Internationals at the Mombasa Sports Club between 11 and 14 November. The match follows their meeting at the Intercontinental Cup, which was drawn after the final two days of the game were called off due to pitch conditions. Kenya ended up winning all three matches; Bermuda's highest score of the series was 201 in 50 overs, while Kenya's lowest was 186 in 37.5 overs chasing a target in the second match. Martin Williamson, managing editor of Cricinfo, commented that Kenya \"outbatted and outbowled Bermuda, and...looked the more professional side in the field\". Dwayne Leverock, Bermuda, and Thomas Odoyo, Kenya, took the most wickets in the series with seven, while Steve Tikolo made 111 in the final ODI to lead the runs tally with 214. Apart from Tikolo, only Tanmay Mishra, Kenya, and Dean Minors, Bermuda, made more than 100 runs in the three matches.\nIndia in South Africa.\nIndia played their first tour game in South Africa on 16 November. The tour will last until 6 January, when the third and final Test at Newlands is scheduled to finish.\nIn the ODI series, India only once managed to bat through the 50 overs once in four completed games, six of the seven highest scores were made by South Africans, and the five highest batting averages in the series were registered by South Africans. Of the six bowlers to take more than five wickets, five of them were South African. Thus, South Africa won the ODI series 4–0. India also played their first Twenty20 International, winning with one ball and six wickets remaining.\nEngland in Australia.\nEngland arrived in Australia on 10 November, and played their first Test on 23 November. The Boxing Day Test will be the fourth of the series, which concluded on 6 January. The tour also includes a Twenty20 International at the SCG, and the VB Series. The tour also includes several exhibition matches between England and local Australian squads.\nAustralia won the series 5–0, the first whitewash in 86 years, since 1920–21. Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Shane Warne all retired from Test cricket after the final game at the SCG.\nAssociates South Africa Tri-Series.\nBermuda, Canada and Netherlands played a six-match triangular series in South Africa during November and December. Bermuda continued their losing streak, losing their three first matches before bowling Netherlands out for 91 in the sixth and final ODI to win the game. Netherlands, however, had already won three games and the triangular series. Canada finished as runners-up, beating Bermuda in both matches but losing by one wicket in the final game against the Netherlands, where Billy Stelling and Mark Jonkman put on 27 off 20 balls for the last wicket as the Dutch chased 205 in 42 overs.\nZimbabwe in Bangladesh.\nZimbabwe had said they would not play any Tests 2006, so this tour of Bangladesh only included One-day Internationals. They did not win any of their six matches against Bangladesh, losing the Twenty20 International as well as five successive ODIs.\nDecember.\nSri Lanka in New Zealand.\nSri Lanka visit New Zealand for the third consecutive summer, this time playing a series of two Tests, five One-day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals.\nSri Lankans in New Zealand in 2006–07. 2-Test series drawn 1–1. Twenty20 International series 1–1. ODI series 2–2\nScotland in Bangladesh.\nThe Associate member Scotland toured Bangladesh for two One-day Internationals in December, and lost both matches.

        "title": "Rugby union in Tonga",
        "text": "Rugby union is the national sport of Tonga. Tonga are considered to be a tier 2 rugby nation by the International Rugby Board.\nTonga has four main rugby playing islands, Vava'u (which produced players like Epi Taione), Ha'apai (which produced players like Jonah Lomu), ʻEua (which produced the Vunipola family, eight brothers who all played for the national team), and Tongatapu the major island in the Tonga island group.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union is governed by the Tonga Rugby Union who are also members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance.\nTonga were awarded 'second tier' status by the International Rugby Board which entitles them to funding from the IRB. The TRFU was founded in 1923, and joined the IRB, in 1987.\nHistory.\nRugby union was brought to the region in the early 20th century by sailors and missionaries. The main impetus for the establishment of rugby in Tonga came from the Irish missionaries in the 1920s, who introduced it to Tupou College and Tonga College. Since then, the main influence has been from New Zealand, as well as the neighbouring Pacific Islands of Samoa and Fiji, which not unlike Tonga perform far beyond their small population bases. Like Fiji and Samoa, they have a strong tendency towards rugby sevens, which suits their population and geography, and have performed well at the Hong Kong tournament.\nThe New Zealand connection, as for Samoa, has been a mixed blessing, since on the one hand it means that Tongans can play in a major field, but on the other hand, winning a cap for the All Blacks is a major ambition for many Tongans.\nNotable Tongan players include:\nPopularity.\nRugby union is the national sport of Tonga and as in the rest of Polynesia is a way of life. Though Tongans are passionate rugby followers and players, their small population base means that much like its Pacific Island neighbours, Samoa and Fiji, Tonga has a limited yet talented player pool, and sometimes struggles with the resources and numbers of larger nations. Young talent often emigrates to or is poached by countries which offer greater prospects of individual success such as New Zealand, Australia and Europe. Nevertheless, all three countries perform far beyond their population base size.\nThe International Rugby Board (IRB) estimates that Tonga has a total of 800 registered senior players and twice as many juniors.\nRugby is popular in the nation's schools and students from schools such as Tonga College and Tupou College, are regularly offered scholarships from New Zealand, Australia and Japan.\nMany players of Tongan descent e.g. Jonah Lomu, Israel Folau, Viliami \"William\" ʻOfahengaue, Malakai Fekitoa, Ben Afeaki, Charles Piutau, Frank Halai, Sekope Kepu, George Smith, Wycliff Palu, Sitaleki Timani, Salesi Ma'afu, Anthony and Saia Fainga'a, Mark Gerrard, Cooper Vuna, Doug Howlett, Toutai Kefu and Tatafu Polota-Nau have played for either the All Blacks or the Wallabies. British and Irish Lion and Welsh international player Taulupe \"Toby\" Faletau is Tongan born and the son of Tongan international Kuli Faletau. Taulupe's cousins and England international players Billy and Mako Vunipola (who is also a British and Irish Lion), are sons of former Tonga rugby captain Fe'ao Vunipola. Finau Maka, Telusa Veainu, Lopeti Timani, Charles Riechelmann and Pita Alatini are also of Tongan descent.\nThe money coming back from Tongan players playing rugby abroad is Tonga's second biggest export after squash.\nWomen's rugby.\nThe Tonga women's national rugby union team has played only two matches at the Women's Pacific Tri-Nations. Meanwhile, the Tonga women's national rugby sevens team has played at the 2010 and 2011 Asia-Pacific Championship, the Oceania Women's Sevens Championship since 2012, and the 2015 2015 Pacific Games.\nIn March 2018, the Ministry of Education announced to ban women's rugby in high schools, to \"preserve the dignity of Tongan women and hold on to Tongan cultural values\", but days later the Prime Minister reversed the decision.\nCompetitions.\nDatec Cup Provincial Championship.\nThis is the highest level of domestic competition within Tongan rugby union and is a stepping stone for local players into international rugby.\nPacific Rugby Cup.\nThe IRB Pacific Rugby Cup started in 2006 and involves representative teams from the three Pacific rugby unions, Tonga along with Samoa and Fiji. Tonga's Tautahi Gold team won the tournament in 2008. The aim of the competition is to improve the quality of rugby in the Pacific Islands.\nNational.\nThe national team (Ikale Tahi) has performed quite well on the international stage.\nTonga beat Fiji 9-6 in their first test in 1924 played in the capital Nukualofa.\n1973 is arguably the high water mark of Tongan rugby, when they beat Australia 16-11.\nTonga has competed in six Rugby World Cups since 1987. Both the 2007 and 2011 Rugby World Cups were Tonga's most successful to date, both winning two out of four matches and both in a running chance for the quarter-finals. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Tonga won its first two matches, against the USA 25–15, and Samoa 19–15; and came very close to upsetting the eventual winners of the 2007 tournament, the South African Springboks, losing 30–25. A loss to England, 36–20 in their last pool game ended their hopes of making the knockout stages. Nevertheless, by picking up third place in their pool games behind South Africa and England, Tonga earned automatic qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.\nIn Pool A of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Tonga beat both Japan 31-18, and the 5th ranked eventual finalist France 19-14 in the latter pool stages. However, a previous heavy defeat to the All Blacks at the tournament's opener (41-10) and a subsequent tight loss to Canada (25-20) meant that Tonga lost out to France (who also lost to NZ) for the quarter-finals due to 2 bonus points and a points difference of 46. Tonga's best results prior to 2007 came in 1995, when they beat Ivory Coast 29–11, and 1999 when they beat Italy 28–25 (although with only 14 men they lost heavily to England, 101–10). Tonga emerged victoryless in the 1987 and 2003 Rugby World Cups, and did not qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup.\nTonga used to compete in the Pacific Tri-Nations against Samoa and Fiji, which has now been replaced by the IRB Pacific Nations Cup, which now also involves Japan, Canada, and the United States. At club level, there are the Datec Cup Provincial Championship and the Pacific Rugby Cup. Rugby union is governed by the Tonga Rugby Football Union, which was also a member of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, and contributed to the Pacific Islanders rugby union team, before both were disbanded in 2009.\nTonga performs the Kailao (Sipi Tau) before its matches.\nPacific Tri-Nations.\nThe Pacific Tri-Nations was a series between Tonga, Fiji and Samoa. It had been played from 1982 to 2006.\nIRB Pacific Nations Cup.\nThe IRB Pacific Nations Cup (formerly the Pacific 5 Nations, Pacific Tri-Nations) is a competition held between six Pacific rim sides; Japan, Fiji, Canada, Tonga, Samoa, and the United States."

        "title": "ONCE (cycling team)",
        "text": "ONCE cycling team, () also known as Liberty Seguros, Liberty Seguros–Würth and in succession in its final year, Astana–Würth and Astana was a Spanish cycling team. It competed in the UCI ProTour circuit.\nOn 25 May 2006, Liberty Mutual (\"seguros\" means \"insurance\" in Spanish) pulled out of primary sponsorship due to a doping scandal involving the directeur sportif, Manolo Saiz. On 2 June 2006, the team acquired a primary sponsor named Astana, after the capital of Kazakhstan. Würth was co-sponsor until 3 July 2006, withdrawing at the end of the 2006 Tour de France, in which didn't compete . At the end of the season, Astana also withdrew due to the non-participation in the Tour. On 16 December 2006, the UCI withdrew the ProTour licence of Saiz's company, Active Bay .\nSome riders and staff formed the Kazakhstan-based Astana Team.\nHistory.\nONCE.\nThe team traces its lineage to the Spanish team, ONCE, sponsored by a lottery for the blind. Manolo Saiz, one of few managers who was not a former rider, introduced more professional management, closer supervision in coaching, equipment and training. In the 2003 Vuelta he was banned from the race after insulting a motorcycle-mounted TV cameraman, his comments broadcast live.\nONCE team was known for its association with Laurent Jalabert and Alex Zülle in the 1990s, dominating spring races such as Paris–Nice, La Flèche Wallonne and the Tour de Romandie. The team won the Vuelta a España in 1995, 1996 and 1997. It dominated the 1995 Vuelta with Jalabert winning overall, the points competition and the mountains. It was also best team, with Johan Bruyneel third. ONCE team in the Tour de France had stage wins from Jalabert and domination in the team time trial.\nZülle won the Vuelta in 1996 and 1997 but left the team in 1998. The team signed the 1998 winner and individual time trial specialist, Abraham Olano, who challenged in the 1999 Vuelta but never won a second Grand Tour. Joseba Beloki became leader and challenged Armstrong in the 2002 and 2003 Tours.\nIsidro Nozal led the 2003 Vuelta until Roberto Heras took the lead on the penultimate day. ONCE's sponsorship was so successful that brand penetration was 100% in Spain, meaning every Spaniard surveyed knew ONCE. At the end of 2003 ONCE stopped sponsorship. Saiz obtained a new sponsor, Liberty Mutual. Most of the riders stayed, including Isidro Nozal and Igor González de Galdeano. Saiz signed Heras; he did not perform well at the 2004 Tour de France but won the 2004 Vuelta after a battle with Santiago Pérez.\nLiberty Seguros.\nIn the 2005 the team started with wins in the Tour Down Under through Alberto Contador and Luis León Sánchez. In the 2005 Tour the team won the stage to Mende courtesy of Marcos Antonio Serrano, reminiscent of Laurent Jalabert's win in 1995.\nAlexander Vinokourov joined in 2006 for three seasons to challenge for top finish in the Tour de France. Fellow Kazakhstan riders Andrei Kashechkin, formerly of Crédit Agricole, and Sergei Yakovlev also joined.\nOn 25 November, Roberto Heras was fired after a urine sample from the 2005 Vuelta a España, which he had won, tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO. Heras was stripped of what would have been a record-breaking fourth win and banned for two years.\nSponsorship Changes and 2006 Season.\nOn 23 May 2006, Saiz was arrested in relation to the Operación Puerto blood doping scandal. Liberty Mutual retracted sponsorship on 25 May 2006, promising only to finance current obligations. On 2 June 2006, the team acquired a new primary sponsor – named Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan – for three years, with an option to extend to six. It was headed by a consortium of five Kazakh companies. Long before Saiz was ensnared in Operación Puerto, the team had been notorious for doping dating back to its days as ONCE, and was considered one of the dirtiest teams in the European \"peloton.\"\nOn June 30, 2006, Astana-Würth was excluded from the 2006 Tour de France after five riders were implicated in a doping scandal, leaving Vinokourov with three remaining teammates, below the minimum six for the Tour. Würth stopped its commitment on 3 of July.\nOn 26 July 2006, the five riders excluded from the Tour were cleared by Spanish officials, and the team returned to competition at the Tour of Germany in August, Assan Bazayev winning the first stage. One rider, Joseba Beloki, would never ride a professional race again.\nAt the end of 2006, Saiz listed Astana as his team's backer. Astana also claimed to have withdrawn support due to non-participation in the Tour. On 16 December 2006, the UCI withdrew the ProTour license of Saiz's Active Bay company."

The match was focused mostly on France's Zinedine Zidane and Italy's Marco Materazzi: this was the last match of Zidane's career; they each scored their team's only goal of the game; and they were also involved in an incident in extra time that led to Zidane being sent off for head-butting Materazzi in the chest. The incident was the subject of much analysis following the match. Italy's Andrea Pirlo was named the man of the match, and Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament.\nThe final served as a key match in the France–Italy football rivalry, coming after Italy were defeated by France in the UEFA Euro 2000 final. Italy's victory was their first world title in 24 years, and their fourth overall, putting them one ahead of Germany and only one behind Brazil. The victory also led to Italy topping the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993.\nVenue.\nThe Olympiastadion in Berlin was used as the venue for the final, as well as five other matches over the tournament. It was also used for three matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. The current Olympiastadion was built for the 1936 Summer Olympics in the western part of the city. Since 1985, the stadium has hosted the finals of both the DFB-Pokal and its female equivalent. The Olympiastadion hosts the Internationales Stadionfest, which was an IAAF Golden League event from 1998 to 2009. The stadium hosted the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Aside from its use as an Olympic stadium, the Olympiastadion has a strong footballing tradition, having been the home of Hertha BSC since 1963.\nBackground.\nItaly's first official match as a national team was against France on 15 May 1910, and the two countries developed a football rivalry. They have faced each other in several world-stage tournaments, including previous World Cups in 1938 (3–1 Italy), 1978 (2–1 Italy), 1986 (2–0 France), and 1998 (4–3 in penalty-shootout to France). Most recently, they had contested the UEFA Euro 2000 final, which ended in a 2–1 victory for France after a golden goal in extra time by David Trezeguet.\nThe match was the sixth FIFA World Cup final for Italy, and the second for France. Italy had won three of their previous finals (1934, 1938, 1982), losing two (1970, 1994), while France had won their only previous final (1998). It was the first final since 1978 in which neither Germany nor Brazil competed (and only the second since 1938); it was also the first all-European final since Italy won the World Cup in 1982, and the second final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out (1994 was the first, with Italy losing to Brazil on that occasion).\nIn April 2006, France's Zinedine Zidane, who also played for Spanish league side Real Madrid, announced his retirement from football, saying his playing career would end after the World Cup. In May 2006, a match-fixing scandal in Italy's Serie A league was uncovered, mainly surrounding Juventus, a team to which five of the national squad players belonged.\nRoad to the final.\nItaly.\nItaly's campaign in the tournament was accompanied by open pessimism, in large part due to the controversy caused by the Serie A scandal. Italy were drawn in Group E alongside Ghana, the United States, and Czech Republic, opening against Ghana on 12 June 2006. Italy took the lead through midfielder Andrea Pirlo in the 40th minute, eventually winning the match by a score of 2–0. In their next match against the United States on 17 June, Italy took the lead in the 22nd minute with an Alberto Gilardino goal, but five minutes later, Cristian Zaccardo scored an own goal off an attempted clearance following a free-kick, and the match eventually remained a 1–1 draw; this was one of only two goals Italy conceded throughout the tournament. In that match, Daniele De Rossi received a straight red card after he elbowed Brian McBride in the face; he left the pitch bloodied, but returned after treatment, later receiving three stitches. De Rossi later apologised to McBride, who subsequently praised him as \"classy\" for approaching him after the match. Because of the incident, De Rossi was banned for four matches, and was fined CHF 10,000. Their third and final group stage match was against Czech Republic on 22 June. Marco Materazzi, who had begun the tournament as a reserve player, came on as a replacement for Alessandro Nesta who suffered an injury in the match. Materazzi went on to score a goal in the match, and was named Man of the Match of an eventual 2–0 win, finishing top of the group with seven points.\nIn the round of 16, on 26 June, Italy took on Australia in a match in which Materazzi was controversially sent off in the 53rd minute after an attempted two-footed tackle on Australian midfielder Marco Bresciano. In stoppage time, a controversial penalty kick was awarded to Italy when referee Luis Medina Cantalejo ruled that Lucas Neill fouled Fabio Grosso. Francesco Totti converted the kick into the upper corner of the goal past Mark Schwarzer for a 1–0 win. In the quarter-final, on 30 June, Italy took on Ukraine, and Gianluca Zambrotta opened the scoring early in the 6th minute with a left-footed shot from outside the penalty area after a quick exchange with Totti created enough space. Luca Toni added two more goals for Italy in the second half, but as Ukraine pressed forward, they were unable to score. Ukraine had hit the crossbar, had several shots saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, and were denied a goal from a goal-line clearance from Zambrotta, ultimately ending in a 3–0 win for Italy. In the semi-final on 4 July, Italy beat hosts Germany 2–0 with the two goals coming in the last two minutes of extra time. After a back-and-forth half-hour of extra time, during which Gilardino and Zambrotta struck the post and the crossbar respectively, Grosso scored in the 119th minute after a disguised Pirlo pass found him open in the penalty area for a bending left-footed shot into the far corner past German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's dive. Substitute striker Alessandro Del Piero then sealed the victory by scoring with the last kick of the game at the end of a swift counterattack by Fabio Cannavaro, Totti and Gilardino.\nFrance.\nFrance were drawn in Group G alongside Switzerland, South Korea, and Togo, opening against Switzerland on 13 June 2006. The match ended in a scoreless draw. In their next match against South Korea on 18 June, France took the lead in the 9th minute after Thierry Henry picked up Sylvain Wiltord's deflected shot. Later, a header by Patrick Vieira crossed the goal-line after being blocked by Korean goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae, but referee Benito Archundia did not give the goal as he had deemed Vieira to have committed a foul. With about 10 minutes left, Park Ji-sung scored for Korea to claim an eventual 1–1 draw. Their third and final group stage match was against Togo on 23 June, and France needed a victory to progress from the group stage. After a goalless first half, Vieira and Henry scored two second half goals within six minutes of each other to win 2–0, and finish second in the group with five points.\nIn the round of 16, on 27 June, France took on Spain in a match in which Spain took the lead in the first half with a penalty kick converted by David Villa after Lilian Thuram fouled Pablo. Four minutes before half time, Franck Ribéry equalised the score, and with seven minutes before the end of regulation time, Vieira scored from a header for France to take the lead. As Spain pushed forward to find an equaliser, Zinedine Zidane scored in a solo effort in stoppage time, for a final score of 3–1 for France. In the quarter-final, on 1 July, France took on Brazil; France won with a lone goal in the 57th minute by Henry after he volleyed a Zidane free kick to end Brazil's reign as world champions. In the semi-final, on 5 July, France won again with a lone goal, this time from a first half Zidane penalty kick after Henry was tripped inside the box by Ricardo Carvalho.\nPre-match.\nThe official match ball for the final was the + Teamgeist Berlin, a gold-coloured variation of the Adidas Teamgeist, which was unveiled on 18 April 2006. The Adidas Teamgeist was used as the official match ball throughout the tournament, provided by German sports equipment company Adidas.\nOn 6 July 2006, the Argentine Horacio Elizondo was chosen as referee for the final, ahead of the German Markus Merk and the Slovakian Ľuboš Micheľ. Elizondo became a referee in 1994, and refereed his first international match in 1996. His compatriots, Dario García and Rodolfo Otero, were chosen as assistant referees, and the Spanish Luis Medina Cantalejo as fourth official. Elizondo had given England striker Wayne Rooney a red card against Portugal previously in the tournament.\nItaly's team doctor Enrico Castellacci confirmed on 6 July that Alessandro Nesta was ruled out of the final due to a groin injury he sustained against the Czech Republic on 22 June; France reported no injuries.\nBefore the match started, a closing ceremony was organised by FIFA, lasting about 10 minutes, was performed by Il Divo singing their song \"The Time of Our Lives\", the official song of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, as well as Shakira and Wyclef Jean singing a rendition of their song \"Hips Don't Lie\".\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes, making it the only World Cup final from 1990 to 2014 in which both finalists scored. Referee Elizondo awarded a penalty kick when he deemed Florent Malouda to have been fouled by Marco Materazzi. Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring when he converted this kick in the 7th minute with a Panenka that glanced off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal. Materazzi redeemed himself for Italy when he levelled the score in the 19th minute, a header from an Andrea Pirlo corner. In the 35th minute, Luca Toni struck the crossbar with a header from another Pirlo corner. At half time, the score was level at 1–1.\nThe beginning of the second half was largely controlled by France, also seeking a penalty early on when Malouda went to ground in the box after a tackle by Gianluca Zambrotta. Patrick Vieira was replaced by Alou Diarra in the 58th minute due to an apparent hamstring injury. In the 62nd minute, Toni headed a goal that was disallowed for offside from a Pirlo free kick. After the 90 minutes of regulation time, the score was still level at 1–1, forcing the match into extra time.\nIn the 104th minute, Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a potentially game-saving save when he tipped a Zidane header over the crossbar that had been crossed in from Willy Sagnol. Five minutes later, Zidane and Materazzi were jogging up the pitch alongside each other. They briefly exchanged words and Materazzi pulled at Zidane's jersey; this provoked Zidane to headbutt Materazzi's chest, knocking him to the ground. As the game play had switched direction, Buffon protested to the assistant referee who did not see what had happened. When the play returned and referee Elizondo saw Materazzi on the ground, he halted play to consult his assistants. According to match officials' reports, the referee and his assistants did not see what had transpired, however, Elizondo consulted fourth official Luis Medina Cantalejo via headset, who confirmed the incident. Elizondo then issued Zidane a red card in the 110th minute. It marked the 14th overall expulsion of Zidane's career, and meant he joined Cameroon's Rigobert Song as the only players ever to be sent off during two separate World Cup tournaments. He also became the fourth player red-carded in a World Cup final, in addition to being the first sent off in extra time.\nAfter extra time, the score was still level at 1–1, forcing the match into a penalty shoot-out. France's David Trezeguet, who had scored the golden goal against Italy in the UEFA Euro 2000 Final, was the only player not to score his penalty after his kick hit the crossbar, shot down after its impact, and stayed just ahead of the goal-line. Fabio Grosso—who scored Italy's first goal in the 2-0 semi-final win against Germany—scored the winning penalty; Italy won by a score of 5–3. After Grosso scored, Italian commentator for RAI Marco Civoli said the phrase Il cielo è azzurro sopra Berlino (in English: \"the sky is blue above Berlin\") \nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nViewership.\nAccording to FIFA, 715.1 million individuals globally watched the final match of this tournament. IPG's independent media agency Initiative Worldwide estimated a 260 million people viewership. The independent firm Initiative Futures Sport + Entertainment estimates it at 322 million viewers.\nPost-match.\nGerman president Horst Köhler, UEFA president Lennart Johansson, and the local organizing committee president Franz Beckenbauer were among those present on the pitch stage during the awards ceremony. President Köhler handed the trophy to Italian captain Fabio Cannavaro without FIFA president Sepp Blatter's presence. As Cannavaro raised the trophy, a short version of Patrizio Buanne's \"Stand Up (Champions Theme)\" was played. The victory also led to Italy topping the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993. Pirlo was awarded the Man of the Match. The day after the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament. The Italy team celebrated their victory with a parade in Rome the day after the final on 10 July, attended by 500,000 people, the team traveled to the Circus Maximus. The team also met with President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano and Prime Minister of Italy Romano Prodi, where all members of the World Cup-winning squad were awarded the Italian Order of Merit of \"Cavaliere Ufficiale\".\nProvocation of Zidane analysis.\nAfter video evidence suggested that Materazzi had verbally provoked Zidane into the headbutt, three British media newspapers claimed to have hired lip readers to determine what Materazzi had said, with \"The Times\", \"The Sun\" and \"Daily Star\" claiming that Materazzi called Zidane \"the son of a terrorist whore\". Materazzi disputed this claim, eventually winning public apologies from \"The Sun\" and \"Daily Star\" in 2008, as well as libel damages from all three British newspapers.\nZidane only partly explained that repeated harsh insults about his mother had caused him to react. Materazzi admitted trash talking Zidane, but argued that Zidane's behaviour had been very arrogant and that the remarks were trivial. Materazzi also insisted that he did not insult Zidane's mother (who was ill at the time), claiming, \"I didn't talk about his mother, either. I lost my mother when I was fifteen, and even now I still get emotional talking about it\".\nZidane later said that he did not regret his actions because \"it would be like admitting that he was right to say all that\". Materazzi offered his version of events two months later claiming that after he had grabbed Zidane's jersey, Zidane remarked, \"If you want my shirt, I will give it to you afterwards\", and he replied to Zidane that he would prefer his sister, but claimed during the interview that he was unaware Zidane even had a sister. Over a year after the incident, Materazzi confirmed that his precise words to Zidane were: \"I prefer the whore that is your sister\".\nReactions.\nAfter the final, then-President of France Jacques Chirac hailed Zidane as a \"man of heart and conviction\". Chirac later added that he found the offence to be unacceptable, but he understood that Zidane had been provoked. The French public showed support for Zidane's actions; polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showed 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them. However, French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" called the headbutt \"odious\" and \"unacceptable\". \"Time\" magazine regarded the incident as a symbol for Europe's \"grappling with multi-culturalism\". Despite the ongoing furore, Zidane's sponsors announced that they would stick with him.\nThe incident was extensively lampooned on the Internet and in popular culture. \"Family Guy\" parodied it in the episode \"Saving Private Brian\", in which Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake. \"The Simpsons\" parodied it in the episode \"Marge Gamer\", in which Homer Simpson shouts \"Zidane!\", when headbutting the linesman. In addition to becoming a staple of parody via numerous online videos and GIFs, a novelty song titled \"Coup de Boule\" (\"Headbutt\") reached the top of the French charts. A sculpture of the incident was unveiled in 2012.\nIn light of Zidane's statements, FIFA opened disciplinary proceedings to investigate the incident. FIFA also affirmed the legality of Elizondo's decision to send Zidane off, rejecting claims that Cantalejo had illegally relied on video transmission to make a decision about handling Zidane's misconduct. FIFA issued a CHF 5,000 fine and a two-match ban against Materazzi, while Zidane received a three-match ban and a CHF 7,500 fine. Since Zidane had already retired, he voluntarily served three days of community service on FIFA's behalf as a substitute for the match ban.\nIn October 2009, in an interview conducted on French radio station RTL, Zidane stated: \"Let's not forget that provocation is a terrible thing. I have never been one to provoke; I have never done it. It's terrible, and it is best not to react\". However, he later said in 2015, \"If you look at the 14 red cards I had in my career, 12 of them were a result of provocation. This isn't justification, this isn't an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.\" In 2010, Zidane had said that he would \"rather die than apologise\" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final, but also admitted that he \"could never have lived with himself\" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match."

        "title": "2006 Tour de France, Prologue to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2006 Tour de France was the 93rd edition of Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour began in Strasbourg with a prologue individual time trial on 1 July and Stage 11 occurred on 13 July with a mountainous stage to Val d'Aran in Spain. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, on 23 July.\nPrologue.\n1 July 2006 — Strasbourg, (ITT)\nThe prologue is a short (7.1 km/4.4 mile), completely flat, time trial, as is customary. It took place in the French city of Strasbourg.\nThor Hushovd, the 2004 and 2005 Norwegian National Time Trial Cycling Champion, captured a third stage win and second yellow jersey in his career.\n\"Note:\" George Hincapie got to wear the green jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 1.\n2 July 2006 — Strasbourg to Strasbourg, \nStage 1 was a largely flat sprinter stage with a category 4 climb up the small Côte de Heiligenstein about halfway through the stage at the mark, and three intermediate sprints throughout the length of the course. The sprints were in Saverne (at 53.0 km/32.9 mile), Plobsheim (137.0 km/85.1 mile), and Kehl (175.5 km/109.0 mile). The stage was a long loop, starting and finishing in Strasbourg.\nAn early breakaway consisting of Stéphane Augé (Cofidis), Walter Bénéteau (Bouygues Télécom), Unai Etxebarria (Euskaltel–Euskadi), Nicolas Portal (Caisse d'Epargne), Matthieu Sprick (Bouygues Télécom), Benoît Vaugrenard (Française des Jeux), and Fabian Wegmann (Team Gerolsteiner) formed by the mark and gained a lead of 4:35 over the main peloton before being caught in the last . That allowed Wegmann to take the polka dot jersey for winning the race up the lone climb.\nA fast George Hincapie won two bonus seconds and with them the yellow jersey at the last sprint, despite a quick damage control operation by Sébastien Hinault who took the four second bonus to protect his captain, Thor Hushovd.\nAt the very end of the stage, Thor Hushovd (who was wearing the yellow jersey) made contact with a cardboard sign from green-jersey sponsor PMU held by a spectator. Hushovd cut his right arm badly, but was able to stay in the race.\nStage 2.\n3 July 2006 — Obernai to Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg), \nStage 2 started in the small French town of Obernai and ended in Luxembourg and is the second longest of the Tour. This stage is 228.5 km/141.9 miles long with rolling terrain. It has five categorized climbs (two Category 3 and three Category 4):\nThere were three intermediate sprints in Marimont-lès-Bénestroff (at 107.0 km/66.5 miles), Holling (169.5 km/105.3 miles), and Yutz (198.5 km/123.3 miles).\nThe stage was primarily dominated by a two-man breakaway almost at the start by David de la Fuente and Aitor Hernández. They were caught in the late climbs, and De La Fuente took over the polka dot jersey.\nA crash in the last slowed the peloton considerably, although they were all credited with the same time as the leaders. Thor Hushovd reclaimed the yellow jersey due to sprint bonuses.\nStage 3.\n4 July 2006 — Esch-sur-Alzette to Valkenburg (Netherlands), \nLike stage 2, stage 3 (216.5 km/134.5 miles long) has a rolling profile with six categorized climbs and three intermediate sprints. Starting in Luxembourg the stage passes through Belgium before finishing in Valkenburg in the Netherlands, which is also the traditional site of the finish in the Amstel Gold Race cycling classic.\nThe following are the categorized climbs:\nThere were also three intermediate sprints in Mersch (at 35 km/21.7 miles), Spa (144 km/89.5 miles), and Aubel (176.5 km/109.7 miles).\nIn this stage, the breakaway featured the following five riders:\nJérôme Pineau concentrated mainly on finishing first in the climbs, which won him the polka dot jersey. Towards the end, most riders were expecting Jens Voigt to try to get away on his own, but he never did. Instead, Christophe Laurent twice got away, but was caught by the chasing four. Then, José Luis Arrieta got away from the others, but during the last climb of the day, the Cauberg, the peloton passed by him. The most important event of this stage was the loss of Alejandro Valverde, the leader in the ProTour, who broke his collarbone. Erik Dekker and Fred Rodriguez also crashed, and both suffered serious injuries.\nThe Cauberg, with its top just before the red banner from the finish line, was the ideal point for Matthias Kessler to get away from the peloton and take the victory. Sprinters Thor Hushovd and Robbie McEwen did not get over the Cauberg in the first part of the peloton. Therefore, Tom Boonen took the leads in both the general classification and the points classification, even though he finished fourth.\n\"Note:\" Daniele Bennati will be in the green jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 4.\n5 July 2006 — Huy (Belgium) to Saint-Quentin, \nStage 4 was another sprinter's stage. The long stage had only two categorized climbs, both in the first . It started in Huy, Belgium and ended in Saint-Quentin in the northern part of France.\nThe two categorized climbs were Cote de Peu d'Eau (Category 3 at 13.0 km/8.1 miles) and Cote de Falaen (Category 4, 57.5 km/35.7 miles).\nThere were also three intermediate sprints in Beaumont (at 103.0 km/64.0 miles), Sains-du-Nord (135.5 km/84.2 miles) and Bernot (188.0 km/116.8 miles).\nIn this stage, the breakaway took place about into the stage and featured the following five riders:\nThe peloton slowly caught them in the late going, with the lead group breaking up at about to the finish, and finally being caught within of the finish line.\nRobbie McEwen won his second stage in a quick sprint. Just before the finish line, Julian Dean crashed in the middle of the peloton but did not take anyone else down. Thor Hushovd, who finished fourth, was disqualified for irregularities during sprinting and set back to last position of the group he finished in, which was position 148. This cost him 26 points for the green jersey which could prove vital in the end.\nIn the top 10 of the general classification, two new names appear, Robbie McEwen because of the 20-second bonus he received for finishing first, and Egoi Martínez, who won all three intermediate sprints and so moved up 18 seconds and into fifth position.\nStage 5.\n6 July 2006 — Beauvais to Caen, \nStage 5 is a long (225.0 km/139.8 mile) sprinters stage with four categorized climbs (all Category 4) and the usual three intermediate sprints. The stage started in Beauvais and ended in Caen in northern France (in the Normandy region).\nThe following were the categorized climbs:\nThe three intermediate sprints were located in Les Andelys (at 66.5 km/41.3 miles), Saint-Georges-du-Vièvre (at 140.5 km/87.3 miles) and Pont-L'Evêque (at 175.0 km/108.7 miles).\nEarly in this stage, eight riders tried to get away from the peloton:\nbut the peloton did not let them get away very far until Dumoulin and Schröder broke away from the group. The other six were caught and Dumoulin and Schröder were allowed to take a lead of up to 12'50\" over the peloton. Meanwhile, the sprinters in the peloton did not want to sprint for the 2 points left at the three intermediate sprints, so every time Johan Van Summeren attacked just a few kilometers before every sprint to take the points. Jérôme Pineau also was very active today, as he did the same thing as Van Summeren but then on the climbs, taking points to maintain his lead in the standings for the polka dot jersey.\nIn the end, Dumoulin and Schröder were caught about 2 kilometres from the finish line as , and had driven hard to close the gap. In the sprint, surprisingly Óscar Freire popped up out of nowhere to take the stage win. Tom Boonen finished second, took 12 bonus seconds and thereby insured that he was going to be wearing the yellow jersey at least one more day.\nStage 6.\n7 July 2006 — Lisieux to Vitré, \nThis somewhat shorter stage (189.0 km/117.4 miles) was also a sprinters' stage, with only one categorized climb: the Côte de la Hunière (Category 3 at 27.5 km/17.1 miles).\nThe three intermediate sprints were located in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul (at 46.0 km/28.6 miles), Chantrigné (at 116.5 km/72.3 miles) and Juvigné (162.5 km/101.0 miles).\nIn the beginning of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton to be part of the daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López who are just riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to remember is Benoît Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.\nAfter that a very large group of 17 riders forms who manage to ride away almost 2 minutes in front of the peloton, the most important riders in this group are — Tom Boonen, wearing the yellow jersey, Pavel Padrnos, Antonio Flecha, Axel Merckx, Thor Hushovd, Patrick Sinkewitz and Philippe Gilbert. However, the peloton does not want to let them go, mainly influenced by the teams and . Three less important riders manage to break away from the leading group and when the peloton catches the other 14, they decide to let the three go. Those three are Anthony Geslin, Florent Brard the current French national champion, and Magnus Bäckstedt. They get caught just four kilometers before the finish line and so the sprinters can have another go at the stage victory. Robbie McEwen wins the sprint by a big margin after excellent work by his teammate Gert Steegmans. Robbie takes his third stage win in this tour and his eleventh overall.\nIn the standings, Tom Boonen remains in yellow but is expected to lose it the next day when there is an individual time trial, Robbie McEwen enlarges the gap between him and the other sprinters in the standings for the green jersey. He will probably be wearing that jersey for another two days, just like Jérôme Pineau is not likely to lose the polka dot jersey any day soon since not many hills or mountains are to be overcome the next few days. Benoît Vaugrenard is now leader of the young rider classification, but will have to be faster than Markus Fothen and the other youngsters in the time trial as he only has a small time advantage over most opponents. Anthony Geslin wins the combativity-trophy for the day and remains in the lead of the team classification.\nStage 7.\n8 July 2006 — Saint-Grégoire to Rennes, (ITT)\nThe first time trial took place in Brittany. It was a flat stage with no major climbs. The stage was long.\nDue to the doping scandal a number of riders did not start in the tour, among those riders were the biggest favorites to win the tour, Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso and Alexander Vinokourov. With those riders not starting, the 2006 Tour de France did not have real favorites and opinions were hugely divided over who was going to win the tour. Stage 7, an individual time trial, was going to be the first real test to see who was up to the task and who wasn't.\nPositive results came from , who were all very strong in the time trial with 6 riders in the top 16 and Serhiy Honchar, a Ukrainian time trial specialist topping it off to take first place in the stage and also the yellow jersey. Other positive results came from Floyd Landis, who finished second and Cadel Evans the Australian climber who manages to put himself into ninth position in the general standings. Disappointing results came from big time-trial favorite David Zabriskie, finishing out of the top 10 in 13th, The whole Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team underachieved, with George Hincapie, Paolo Savoldelli, Yaroslav Popovych and José Azevedo all setting moderate to bad results for their being. But the biggest surprises came from Levi Leipheimer, who finished more than 6 minutes behind Serhiy Honchar and Bobby Julich who crashed badly and injured his wrist and thigh severely before being driven away in an ambulance which means they can both forget about winning the tour this year. Leipheimer failed, but nevertheless there is still good news for as both Sebastian Lang and youngster Markus Fothen set good times and managed to finish in the top 10. Fothen now takes back the leading position in the young rider classification and has a considerable lead over his opponents. Other names worth mentioning are Gustav Larsson the Swede and Joost Posthuma the Dutchman who can be very happy with their top 10 place in the time trial.\nLooking at the general classification after stage 7, has 4 riders in the top 10 which looks promising going into the mountains. However the other major contenders for the victory in this tour seem to be Floyd Landis, Cadel Evans and Denis Menchov. It is unsure what to expect exactly from Vladimir Karpets, Markus Fothen and David Zabriskie but they have possibilities left too. Paolo Savoldelli and George Hincapie are not out of it yet also, being behind respectively 2'10\" and 2'30\", with a few other possible contenders between them in the standings as there are Carlos Sastre, Eddy Mazzoleni and French favorite Christophe Moreau. In conclusion, the tour is still wide open since not many people expect Serhiy Honchar to hold on to the jersey until Paris.\nThe green and polka dot jersey stay with Robbie McEwen and Jérôme Pineau respectively, while the best team is now clearly .\nStage 8.\n9 July 2006 — Saint-Méen-le-Grand to Lorient, \nStage 8 (181.0 km/112.5 miles in length) had a somewhat rolling profile, with four categorized climbs and three intermediate sprints. The weather was also a factor with the ocean winds blowing. The four climbs were as follows:\nThe three intermediate sprints were located in Plessala (at 38.0 km/23.6 miles), Locmalo (112.5 km/69.9 miles) and Plouay (142.0 km/88.2 miles).\nIn Stage 8, a group of five riders formed after about , consisting of the following riders:\nwith Patrice Halgand, , making the jump from the peloton to the leading group on his own before the gap became too big which made the final number of escapees in the breakaway group of this stage six.\nThe peloton, mainly under influence of , did not let the lead grow too much, since Zabriskie and Kessler were both standing 2'03\" behind the leader, or just 1'03 behind Phonak's leader, Floyd Landis. As the race progressed and the lead of the leaders was brought back from its maximum of 7'30 to about 3'30, the riders from the Phonak team stopped chasing as it was the sprinter's teams to start chasing and close the final gap. However, most teams were probably afraid of 's Robbie McEwen as he had impressively won three sprinters' stages in this tour already, so there were no chasing riders from (for Tom Boonen), no riders from (for Daniele Bennati) and no riders also for as they already had Mario Aerts in the lead. The only team that kept chasing was , because they were the least successful French team so far in the tour and the lead group featured two riders from other French teams.\nMeanwhile, in the lead group, Sylvain Calzati had stormed away from the other five escapees with about to go, only to be chased after somewhat later by Patrice Halgand and Kjell Carlström. The other three riders mainly looked at each other and did not believe they could stay out of the peloton's grip. However, the peloton would catch up with those three non-believers, but the other three were not to be caught before the finish line. Sylvain Calzati proved to be too strong for the other two as they coöperated to get back to him but never saw him again before Lorient, instead the gap only became bigger. In the end Sylvain Calzati scored his most beautiful professional victory of his career as he came over the finish line more than two minutes ahead of Carlström and Halgand, who both just ended a few seconds before the peloton. In the peloton, Robbie McEwen again won the sprint, enlarging his lead in the standings for the green jersey over the other sprinters.\nIn the top 10 of the general standings and best young rider classification, nothing changed as all the main contenders finished together in the peloton. The polka dot jersey also remained with Jérôme Pineau.\nThe intermediate sprints of this stage did not have any major influence on the classification for the best sprinter, but David Zabriskie, who was part of the breakaway group, took 10 bonus seconds and so moved into ninth position overall and reduced his deficit to 1'53\" from the leader Serhiy Honchar.\nSylvain Calzati did not only win the stage, he also came through first on top of all classified climbs of the day. He scored 4 points for de Mûr-de-Bretagne and 3 points for the three other côtes which made him end with 13 points and this moved him into fourth position in the polka dot jersey standings.\nRest Day.\n10 July 2006 — Bordeaux\nAll the riders had flown from Lorient to Bordeaux on the evening of July 9 and now spent their rest day in Bordeaux or some place nearby. Important news on this day came from Floyd Landis, as he announced that he seriously injured his hip, during training in 2003, which still hinders him while riding due to a bad position on the bike and also causes sleeping problems. He has decided to undergo surgery to receive an artificial hip after the Tour which would hopefully relieve him of these problems. However this also means that it is very well possible that he will never be able to ride at a professional level again. As a conclusion he mentions this is an extra motivation for him to try to win this Tour. Floyd's teammate Axel Merckx on this day signed a new contract with for one extra season. Merckx, who is now 33 years old, announced that the 2007 season will be his last season, as he wants to spend a lot more time with his family thereafter. The Phonak team will be called \"iShares\" next season.\nStage 9.\n11 July 2006 — Bordeaux to Dax, \nThe peloton got a completely flat stage today, which was also relatively short (169.5 km/105.3 miles in length). This stage looked to be one of the last chances for the sprinters as the next day they were moving into the Pyrenees.\nThe peloton did not have to pass by any categorized climbs during this stage but instead there were three intermediate sprints which were located at Le Barp (at 25.5 km/15.8 miles), Parentis-en-Born (72 km/44.7 miles) and Saint-Girons (128.0 km/79.5 miles).\nLike many of the preceding stages, an early break away was allowed to escape, but kept within reach of the sprinter teams. In this stage, the break away consisted of Christian Knees (Team Milram) who initiated the break away, and Walter Bénéteau () and Stéphane Augé () who joined soon after. The break away was eliminated with four kilometers to go, and so was an attack from Stuart O'Grady () two kilometers later. The final sprint was won by Óscar Freire (), after an impressive manoeuvre by Robbie McEwen ().\nImportant detail at the finish line was that many riders lost a few seconds because the peloton broke into groups during the sprint. Important riders who lost 13\" — Matthias Kessler, Denis Menchov and Markus Fothen.\nStage 10.\n12 July 2006 — Cambo-les-Bains to Pau, \nStage 10 (190.5 km/118.3 miles) enters the Pyrenees and is the first mountain stage. It is considered an in-between stage, as it features two major mountains, but the finish line lies more than 40 kilometres beyond the last climb of the day. Expected is that the winner of the stage will not be a climber, maybe even a sprinter.\nIt has three categorized climbs: \nBeing a mountain stage, it has only two intermediate sprints instead of the regular three: at Larceveau (at 37.5 km/23.3 miles) and Laguinge (at 74.5 km/46.3 miles)\nDuring the first 40 kilometres, no riders managed to get away from the peloton. At the sprint in Larceveau a few riders sprinted for the points and that group grew to 15 riders who were allowed to break away from the peloton:\nHushovd and Steegmans dropped on the Col d'Osquich, then the rest of the group got split into lots of different smaller groups during the climb of the Col de Soudet with Cyril Dessel and Juan Miguel Mercado passing the top of the climb first. During the descent Landaluze, Rinero, Isasi, Vasseur and Moreni managed to return. The peloton was about 10 minutes behind at that time, as had decided they were not going to defend their yellow jersey and leave the work for the next stages for some other team.\nDuring the climb of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again proved to be the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind at some point during the descent, but the two leaders worked together not to let that happen. However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to be getting the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.\nSprinters Erik Zabel and Daniele Bennati were able to stay in the peloton and therefore they took points in the competition for the green jersey as they sprinted for the eighth place behind the seven of fifteen escaped riders that were not caught. Bennati won the sprint and finished 7'23\" behind Mercado and Dessel.\nAs a result of this stage, Cyril Dessel is now holding the yellow and polka dot jersey, Robbie McEwen is still in green and Markus Fothen is still in white. The best team is now . Other important facts:\n\"Note:\" Juan Miguel Mercado got to wear the polka dot jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 11.\n13 July 2006 — Tarbes to Val d'Aran, Pla-de-Beret (Spain), \nStage 11 is a mountain stage with five categorized climbs: the Col du Tourmalet (Hors catégorie) with an ascent of 7.7% over 18.4 km, the Col d'Aspin (Category 1) with an ascent of 5.2% over 12.3 km, the Col de Peyresourde (Category 1) with an ascent of 7.1% over 9.5 km, the Col du Portillon (Category 1) with an ascent of 8.4% over 7.9 km, and the Pla-de-Beret (Category 1 in Spain) with an ascent of 5.4% over 13.5 km. It begins at Tarbes at 325 m and ends at Val d'Aran at 1830 m.\nIn contrast to the previous stage, many fewer riders were interested in joining an early breakaway group as the stage featured over 60 kilometers of climbing. 17.5 kilometres into the stage, at the first sprint, there were still no riders who had escaped and so Robbie McEwen saw the possibility of going for it. He succeeded, but mainly because the other sprinters did not even challenge him; this means that they have probably given up for the points classification. It seems now that McEwen just needs to make it to Paris to win that green jersey.\nNot much later, four riders did get away from the peloton. They included three Spaniards:\nThey left, together with Fabian Wegmann, the German from . All this happened before the first climb of the day, the Col du Tourmalet. On the Tourmalet, Wegmann and de la Fuente looked to be somewhat stronger than their two companions as they both sprinted to finish first on the top. De la Fuente won the sprint and so took the most points for the polka dot jersey, but also he won the \"Souvenir Jacques Goddet\" for coming through first on the top of the highest climb in the Pyrenees of this Tour which rendered him 5000 Euros. In the peloton, the team of maintained the tempo to keep the leaders within reasonable distance and thus protect their yellow jersey. Thomas Voeckler won the sprint against Michael Rasmussen for the remaining points on top of the Tourmalet and he kept going. Although the leaders were about 4 minutes ahead at that time, he thought it would be useful to go after them on his own. At first, his plan appeared to be correct, as he closed the gap during the descent and managed to climb faster than the leaders on the Col d'Aspin. Halfway up the Aspin he was only 2'30\" behind, on top of the Aspin only 1'30\". The four leaders stayed together on the Aspin, with now Wegmann sprinting faster than de la Fuente at the top. In the peloton, Rasmussen again took the points, but nothing more happened.\nDuring the climb of the Col de Peyresourde, Wegmann suddenly attacked and de la Fuente easily followed and beat him at the top for the points. Flecha had tried to follow them but came through more than 2 minutes behind at the top. Camano and Voeckler, whose plan had not been so smart after all, had used up most of their strengths and had been overtaken by the peloton before the top, who were 3 minutes behind at the top with yet again Rasmussen taking the points. Flecha was caught in the descent and on the Col du Portillon Wegmann was also caught; he had not been able to counter an attack from de la Fuente. On the Portillon something happened in the peloton also, because now suddenly it were the riders from who took over from the guys from AG2R Prévoyance and pumped up the pace. As a result, the peloton grew thinner and thinner, until only 19 riders remained:\nCyril Dessel, the holder of the yellow jersey, was already about 2 minutes behind at that time. In the valley that came between the Col du Portillon and Pla-de-Beret, Arroyo and Cunego broke away from that elite group and closed the gap to de la Fuente, but they were all caught even before the climb towards Pla-de-Beret. On the last climb it was due to some extraordinary work by Michael Boogerd that the group kept getting smaller and smaller, with only five riders remaining in the end:\nEvans and Sastre had to give in at the end and finished only 17 seconds behind the other three who sprinted for the victory at the top. Menchov outsprinted both Americans and won the stage, the third stage victory already for during this Tour. In the General Classification, Floyd Landis became the leader and thus holder of the yellow jersey, as Cyril Dessel finished 4'45\" behind, the exact time he was in front of Landis before the stage—but since Landis finished third, he won 8 bonus seconds and so he moved into the lead with an eight-second advantage.\nLooking at the \"lesser climbers\", 37 riders just managed to avoid being disqualified for finishing late, as a group of 36 came in 44'20\" behind Denis Menchov and Christophe Mengin even managed to finish 46'13\" behind. The time limit was about 46'30\". Amongst this group were sprinters Robbie McEwen, Thor Hushovd and Óscar Freire. Tom Boonen would have been delighted to see them finish late as he was in an earlier group. Being on time however, Robbie McEwen remains the leader of the points classification. Cyril Dessel not only lost his yellow jersey; he also lost the polka dot jersey, which went to David de la Fuente—who also got the combativity award for the day. Of the youngsters, only Markus Fothen was able to keep up with the pace during the day, he now has a big lead of exactly twelve minutes over the number two in the young rider classification and almost half an hour or more over all the other youngsters in this tour.\nOther news in this stage:"

Weighing in at just 73 kg, and only 1.70m in height, Collins made a name for himself playing club rugby for Stratford and Clifton, and in 1927 was selected for the Taranaki Rugby Football team. He went on to make 81 appearances for Taranaki over the next eleven years, building a reputation as \"a reliable last line of defence and an accurate goalkicker\".”\nBy 1932 Collins had caught the attention of the national selectors, making the North Island side for the North vs South match. He was selected for the All Black team to tour Australia, first donning the All Black jersey on 15 June in a preparation game against Wellington. Collins missed selection for the first test match, which was lost 21-17, but took over for the second in Brisbane on 16 July in which he contributed a penalty goal to New Zealand's 21-3 victory. He went on to play the third test match in Sydney which New Zealand also won. His overall tour performance was considered \"creditable\", scoring 54 points in his nine matches and kicking a penalty and two conversions in his two tests.\nNo test matches were played in 1933, and Collins was again selected in 1934 for the tour to Australia. He played the first test in Sydney where the All Blacks were beaten 25–11. Collins could not play the second test due to injury, but played in the All Blacks vs \"Rest of New Zealand\" match when the team returned from Australia. This was his last game in the All Black jersey, having in those two years played 15 matches and scored 110 points.\nCollins retired from representative rugby football in 1937, and went on to serve as a coach and an administrator for Clifton Club, being honoured with life membership in 1970. A son, Bruce, played seven matches for Taranaki as a forward in 1962–63. Collins died on 11 January 1988, in Waitara.\nBibliography.\nChester, R.H. &amp; McMillan N.A.C. (1994).

        "title": "Swimming Upstream",
        "text": "Swimming Upstream is a 2003 Australian biographical drama film written by Tony Fingleton and directed by Russell Mulcahy. It stars Jesse Spencer, Geoffrey Rush, and Judy Davis. It shows the life of Fingleton (Spencer) from childhood to adulthood, and dealing with a topsy-turvy family. It is based on Fingleton's autobiography of the same name.\nPlot.\nThe film shows ten years in the life of Anthony Fingleton, from when he was a young boy in the mid-1950s, to the day of the men's 100m backstroke final at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Growing up in Brisbane, Australia, Tony was the second of five children of working-class parents Harold and Dora Fingleton. It was a dysfunctional family, since Harold – who as a child had witnessed his alcoholic mother's degradation as a prostitute – was violent and unable to show equal love to all his children, and favored those showing sporting prowess. Harold was physically and emotionally abusive, especially toward Tony and his wife Dora. She tried to protect Tony from that abuse which only angered Harold more. The abuse was exacerbated by Harold's alcoholism, which in turn led to frequent difficulties with money as Harold, who worked at the docks only when ships were in port, was often off work, sometimes due to divisive labour unrest on the wharf, and strikes.\nTony was on good terms with most of his siblings, especially \"number 3\", John. But each of the five children did whatever they needed to do as self-preservation measures against Harold's abuse, sometimes at the expense of harmony with the others. As a refuge, the four youngest felt comfortable in the local pool. It was only when he found out that both Tony and John were good swimmers that Harold began to pay Tony any attention, and became their trainer. But nothing Tony did was ever good enough, Harold spurring on anyone else but Tony, and especially John. Initially the two swam different strokes, freestyle and backstroke, but Harold secretly shifted John to compete directly against his brother in state finals. After losing, Tony responded by training on his own, eventually placing second at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, without his father's support - who had by this time become withdrawn and continued to drink. John, meanwhile, abandoned competitive swimming after failing to qualify, and his relationship with Tony remained strained.\nTony wanted to make his father proud, but also revealed to his mother that he saw swimming as a means to an end, a way to escape their life of poverty in Brisbane. This he did after his Commonwealth medal, when his application to Harvard University to enter with a sports scholarship was successful. He was offered a spot on the Australian Olympic team, but chose instead to attend Harvard. The film ends in the pool at Harvard, where he obtains an excellent backstroke time, as his life and family flash before him as he swims. The 1964 Olympics are being aired, with Dawn Fraser competing, and his coach asks him if he would rather have swum there. He replies no, he is \"exactly where he wants to be\". He has achieved his goal of escape from a dysfunctional childhood and is on track to a successful career, which is hinted in the closing credits.\nReception.\n\"Swimming Upstream\" received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 61% rating with an average score of 5.7/10, sampled from 38 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\", based on 14 reviews from critics.\nJohn Fingleton has disputed the portrayal of events in the film, and went on to author a book about the life of his parents in 2011."

Including the previous incarnations as the Home Nations and Five Nations, this was the 113th series of the international championship. Fifteen matches were played over five weekends from 3 February to 17 March.\nIn this year, France again won on points difference above Ireland, after four teams had at least a mathematical chance of topping the table going into the final week. Italy had their first away win of the tournament, beating Scotland in Edinburgh. It was also the first time that they won two of their matches, as they went on to beat Wales in Rome, finishing in 4th place, their best result so far. Scotland won the wooden spoon on points difference below Wales, and Ireland won the Triple Crown for the second straight year and third time in four years.\nThe first four rounds.\nIn the build-up to the competition, Ireland were being tipped as favourites for the Grand Slam, having played well during the Autumn Tests. However, despite having started strongly with a win against Wales, they lost to France 20–17 in an historic encounter at Croke Park. In turn, Ireland went on to beat England, who subsequently won against France.\nRound 3 of the competition saw Italy win their first ever away match in the Six Nations. Scotland conceded three tries (all converted) in the first six minutes, and Italy went on to secure an historic 37–17 victory. In the same round, England's defeat by Ireland at Croke Park 43–13 marked their worst result ever in the history of the tournament, both in number of points conceded and in points difference (30 points).\nIn round 4, Italy achieved a second victory in the same tournament for the first time, when they defeated Wales 23–20 in Rome in a match that ended in controversy. Trailing by three points, Wales had the chance to equalise in the closing moments of the game when they were awarded a kickable penalty near the Italian 22-metre line. But, having been informed by the referee that 10 seconds remained, they chose to kick for touch, believing that there was time for an attacking line-out and possible try-scoring opportunity, only for the referee to blow his whistle and end the game before the line-out could form. The Welsh players were incensed and the referee later apologised for the misunderstanding that had arisen.\nFinal day.\nAll three matches in week five of the tournament were played on the same day and four teams — France, Ireland, England and Italy — still had a chance of winning the tournament: France were narrowly ahead of Ireland on points difference, England and Italy could become champions if they won by a large margin and the other results favoured them.\nThe game between Ireland and Italy was played first. At half-time, Ireland led by a single point, but they extended their lead in the second half. As time ran out, Ireland were in possession and could have kicked the ball into touch, ending the game and leaving France requiring a 30-point margin in their game; instead, they opted to seek another try, supposedly to set France a bigger target, only for Italy to regain possession and score a converted try, reducing France's target to 23 points.\nThe second game was between France and Scotland. After starting slowly, France steadily extended their lead, but were still three points short of their target when, with time running out, Elvis Vermeulen scored a try in injury-time, which was converted, to give France a 27-point victory and put them in the lead in the tournament. The referee referred the try to the Television Match Official (TMO), an Irishman, asking if there was any reason why the try should not be awarded. The TMO advised that there was no reason, and the referee awarded the try.\nIn the final match, England needed to beat Wales by 57 points to overtake France, while Wales were trying to avoid the wooden spoon. Wales led 15–0 after 15 minutes and 18–15 at half-time, and though England managed to draw level in the second half, James Hook then kicked two penalties and a drop goal, to give Wales the victory by 27–18. This result confirmed France's position as champions and handed the wooden spoon to Scotland, both on points difference."

        "title": "List of Somerset cricket captains",
        "text": " Somerset County Cricket Club are an English cricket club based in Taunton, Somerset. The club was founded in 1875 after a match between \"Gentlemen of Somerset\" and \"Gentlemen of Devon\" in Sidmouth, Devon. Somerset played their first undisputed first-class cricket match in 1882 against Lancashire. After missing the first season of the official County Championship, Somerset were admitted for the second in 1891, and have participated in the competition ever since. The club have played both List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket since their introductions into the English game in 1963 and 2003 respectively.\nConsidered in terms of trophies won, Brian Rose was Somerset's most successful captain, with the county winning five one-day trophies in as many seasons under his captaincy. The county's longest serving captain was Sammy Woods, who was club captain for thirteen seasons from 1894 to 1906. Woods also captained the side on the most occasions, leading his team in 230 first-class fixtures. John Daniell, Brian Close, Marcus Trescothick and Rose are the only other captains to have led Somerset over 200 times, and Rose's total of 112 List A matches as captain is the most by a Somerset player. Lewis Gregory has captained Somerset in Twenty20 cricket on the most occasions, doing so 52 times.\nCaptaincy history.\nSince attaining first-class status, Somerset have named 37 official captains. Stephen Newton was the club's first official captain, holding the position during the county's first three seasons of first-class cricket, from 1882 to 1884. Due to his commitments as a schoolmaster in London, he did not play in the opening three matches of 1882, so other players were required to deputise for him in these fixtures. Edward Sainsbury, who took over from Newton for the 1885 season, captained the side in the joint fewest matches along with Mandy Mitchell-Innes: both players captained Somerset in six first-class matches. During the 1885 season, Somerset failed to arrange sufficient fixtures with the other first-class teams to be retain its first-class status, and matches played between 1886 and 1890 were considered 'second-class'. During this time, the captaincy was transferred to Herbie Hewett who, after captaining his side unbeaten against county opposition in 1890, retained the captaincy upon Somerset's return to first-class cricket the following summer. Hewett continued as captain for three further seasons, but retired from the captaincy and the club at the end of the 1893 season following an incident in which he felt his authority had been undermined by the club. His successor as captain was Sammy Woods, who remained in the position for twelve years, the longest by any Somerset captain. Woods, born on the outskirts of Sydney in Australia had played three Test matches for Australia in the late 1880s, and was Somerset's first captain of overseas origin, although he lived the rest of his life in Somerset and also played three Tests for England. He led Somerset in 230 first-class matches, and holds the record for both the most first-class and the most overall matches captained by any Somerset player.\nBetween 1894 and 1946, the club captaincy remained reasonably stable, six official captains spanned the 52-year period. In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two. Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches. In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones. Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain. In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season. Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season. The next three captains – Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff – all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\" This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain.\nThe Australian, Colin McCool had been favoured by many, but claimed that he \"wouldn't have taken it had there been a life pension to go with it.\" He observed that the rapid turnover of captains in the previous few years meant that the club had \"no feeling of being a cricket team.. players just didn't know what was going on.\" The decision to pick a professional captain had not been the committee's first choice, and they had chosen Tremlett only after considering a number of amateur options. Even once he had the position, his four years as captain did not run smoothly; club officials felt he was too lax, and there were numerous attempts to remove him from the captaincy. During his tenure, Somerset rose rapidly in the County Championship standings. In 1955, the season before he took over, they had finished in 17th place, bottom of the table. In 1958, his penultimate year as captain, they finished in third, their joint highest position since formation. Despite this success, the Somerset committee was critical of Tremlett's captaincy. Tremlett, in face of constant criticism, lost interest in the captaincy and after a poor 1959 season, was removed from the position.\nUnofficial captains.\nThis is a list of players who have captained Somerset without having been appointed official club captain."

        "text": "The Blackshirts are the starting defensive players for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team.\nHistory.\nThe term dates back to the 1960s, and was inspired by the black jerseys that Nebraska's first-string defenders began to wear during practice. Recent NCAA rule changes permitted two-platoon football teams (different players dedicated to offense and defense), and head coach Bob Devaney ensured the two squads would be visually distinguishable during practice by having the offense and defense wear contrasting colors. Assistant coach Mike Corgan was tasked with obtaining the new jersey pullovers. The sporting goods store he visited reportedly gave him a good deal on black, because the color had not been selling well. The new jerseys were assigned to be worn by the defense.\nThe black jerseys immediately helped the coaches quickly identify starting players. The unmarked jerseys were collected each day for laundering and then redistributed during the next practice. After a time, the black jerseys were only given to the defensive players who practiced and performed well. \"There probably wasn't a day when we didn't make switches,\" said George Kelly, Nebraska's defensive line coach from 1960 to 1968.\nLong-time sports information director Don Bryant credits much of Blackshirt mystique to Kelly, who was often heard yelling and exhorting the Blackshirts during practices and scrimmages. Eventually, the rest of the coaches began calling the top defensive unit by the same name, and by the time Kelly retired and was succeeded by Monte Kiffin, the \"Blackshirts\" had become a widely recognized name for Nebraska's defensive starters.\nThe choice of black to bring about the name \"Blackshirts\" was not intentional. Said Kelly in later years, \"Honestly, it was an accident of availability\".\nUse.\nBlackshirts are awarded to defensive starters and other key defensive players. Punters have also occasionally been honored for their individual efforts when covering punts, including Jesse Kosch and Alex Henery. Besides the black practice jerseys, which today have each player's name and number imprinted on them, the Blackshirts also have a black circle on the back of their helmet. These players will often cross their arms in an \"X\" across their chests, representing the skull and crossbones, a longtime logo for the Blackshirts. This is called \"throwing the bones.\" The defensive players not awarded a Blackshirt wear red practice jerseys, while offensive players wear white practice jerseys.\nThe student section at Memorial Stadium is named the \"Boneyard\" after the Blackshirts. The Blackshirt logo and the \"throwing the bones\" motion is often displayed there.\n2007 suspension / 2008 reinstatement.\nOn October 16, 2007, the defensive players and coaches made a joint decision to remove the Blackshirts. The first player to remove his Blackshirt was senior captain Zackary Bowman, who felt he wasn't playing up to the standards of the Blackshirt tradition. On November 11, 2008, the Blackshirts were given back to the eleven defensive starters by new head coach Bo Pelini, three days after a win against a strong Kansas team. The win also made the Cornhuskers bowl eligible.\nThe Blackshirt jersey was temporarily suspended again after Nebraska yielded 271 rushing yards to the Minnesota Golden Gophers in 2013, a game which snapped Minnesota's 16-game losing streak to Nebraska and knocked the #24 Huskers out of the AP and USA Today college football rankings.\nThough Blackshirts have been handed out in the interim, no unit has finished in the top 25 annually in defense since."

Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft, but was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year.\nLópez served four stints with Boston in 2006. In 2007, he had three different stints but appeared in 61 games, posting a 3.10 earned run average (ERA). He posted a 15.43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first World Series ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games. In 2008, he spent the entire season on a major league roster for the first time since 2003. He posted a 9.26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent to the minors for the rest of the season. In 2010, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season. He had his lowest ERA that year (2.34) and won another World Series as the Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, López was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw at least 50 innings without giving up a home run. He won his third World Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, López posted a career-best 1.83 ERA. He won his fourth World Series in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games. López announced his retirement on February 8, 2017.\nEarly life.\nAlthough he was born in Puerto Rico, López grew up in Fairfax, Virginia. He and his wife, Renee, attended Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia. Growing up, his dream was to be an FBI agent like his father.\nLópez went to college at the University of Virginia (UVA) and played for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team. Through June 2022, he was one of 38 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with Mark Reynolds and Ryan Zimmerman among others. While playing at UVA, he went 12–9 with a 6.30 earned run average (ERA). As a hitter, he had a batting average of .319, 15 home runs, and 71 runs batted in (RBI). However, while still at UVA, he discovered that pitching was most likely to get him to the major leagues. Despite leaving college after only three years to play professional baseball, López continued working on his degree in psychology, which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise to his father-in-law. He also said, \"I had done three years at a great university. I figured I should finish.\"\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nAfter three seasons at UVA, López was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. He began his minor league career as a starting pitcher for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the A Midwest League. In 16 games (nine starts), he had a 2–4 record, a 6.55 ERA, 31 strikeouts, and 30 walks in 44 innings pitched. He remained at South Bend in 1999, posting a 4–6 record, a 6.00 ERA, and 70 strikeouts over 99 innings pitched in 20 starts. In 2000, López was promoted to the High Desert Mavericks of the A-Advanced California League. In 30 games (21 starts), he had a 4–8 record, a 5.22 ERA, 98 strikeouts, and two saves in innings.\nIn 2001, deciding that he would not be able to reach the major leagues as a starter, López converted to a submariner and moved to the bullpen. He said, \"I don't know if that was desperation as much as it was admitting failure.\" He began the season with Arizona's A-Advanced affiliate, which was now the Lancaster JetHawks. In 17 games, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.62 ERA, 18 strikeouts, and one save in 24 innings pitched. He was promoted to the El Paso Diablos of the AA Texas League that season, where he had a 1–0 record, a 7.42 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 40 innings pitched in 22 games (one start, his last professionally). In 2002, he played in 61 games for El Paso as a reliever, allowing only a .204 opponent batting average. That year, he went 2–2 with a 2.72 ERA, 47 strikeouts, and six saves in innings.\nColorado Rockies (2003–2005).\n2003.\nIn December 2002, the Boston Red Sox selected López in the Rule 5 draft, intending for him to compete for a role as a left-handed specialist in the Red Sox' bullpen. However, on March 18 he was traded to the Colorado Rockies for a player to be named later (Ryan Cameron). López made the roster and made his MLB debut for the Rockies on Opening Day in 2003, pitching a scoreless inning in a 10–4 loss to the Houston Astros. He got his first major league strikeout in his next game on April 5, punching out Tony Womack in a 4–3 victory over the Diamondbacks. On April 10, he got his first win, pitching scoreless innings in a 7–6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. He posted an 0.72 ERA, which led all NL relievers, in his first 30 games through June 8, posting an innings scoreless streak at the end of that run. However, his ERA jumped up to 3.16 on June 12, when he allowed seven runs in of an inning in a 15–3 loss to the Minnesota Twins. From July 31 through August 16, López almost tied a franchise record by retiring 18 straight hitters over the span of 17 days, but he fell short of the record of 21 set by Darren Holmes in 1996 when he intentionally walked Jason Phillips in a 13–4 loss to the New York Mets. On August 12, he recorded his first career save by pitching a scoreless 11th inning in a 6–3 victory over the Montreal Expos. He played in 72 games, the third-most among rookies in the major leagues, trailing only Óscar Villareal (86) and Brad Lidge (78). He had a 4–1 record, a 3.70 ERA, and 1 save.\n2004.\nLópez started off poorly in 2004, going 0–2 with a 9.93 ERA in 46 games by mid-season. He was then sent down to the AAA Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League on July 18. While in AAA, he went 0–1 and had a 4.00 ERA in eight games. He was called back to the majors on August 10 to replace an injured Aaron Cook and played the rest of the season in Colorado. He pitched better the rest of the season, allowing only two runs for a 1.54 ERA in his final 18 games. In 64 games, López had a 1–2 record, a 7.52 ERA, 20 strikeouts, and no saves in innings.\n2005.\nLópez began 2005 with the Rockies, but after allowing five runs in his first three games (for a 22.50 ERA), he was optioned to Colorado Springs on April 11.\nArizona Diamondbacks (2005).\nBefore he could appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona was unable to call him up until April 24. He had another poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, the highest in the majors among relievers who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, López was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando Almanza. He cleared waivers and was sent down to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League for the rest of the season. He went 0–1 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted free agency.\nChicago White Sox.\nLópez signed a minor league deal for the Chicago White Sox in 2006. He competed with Boone Logan for the role of left-handed specialist, but Logan won the role, and López was sent to AAA to begin the season. Playing for the Charlotte Knights of the International League, he went 2–1 with 12 saves and an 0.55 ERA in 26 games.\nBoston Red Sox (2006–2009).\n2006.\nOn June 15, 2006, López was traded to the Boston Red Sox for David Riske. He posted a 4.32 ERA in 14 appearances before getting sent to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League on July 17 because it was too \"tough\" for the Red Sox to carry a left-handed specialist at that point in the season, according to manager Terry Francona. He was called up for two short stints from July 28 through August 1 and from August 20 through 22, appearing in one game each time. On September 4, he was recalled for the remainder of the season. In 11 September outings, López allowed only one run. He finished the year going 1–0 with a 2.70 ERA in 27 games. With Pawtucket, he had no record and a 4.86 ERA in 13 games ( innings).\n2007.\nLópez made the Red Sox' Opening Day roster in 2007, but after four scoreless outings he was optioned to Pawtucket on April 9 to make room for Mike Timlin, who had started the season on the disabled list. He was recalled on May 11 when Devern Hansack was sent down. On this stint, he posted a 3.18 ERA in 40 appearances before getting sent down on August 5 to make room for Curt Schilling, who was returning from the disabled list. With the Red Sox about to face several tough left-handed hitters in late August, Jon Lester was sent down on August 23 to make room for López on the roster.\nIn 2007, López made 61 appearances, posting a 2–1 record with a 3.10 ERA in innings. Despite his three stints in the minors, his 61 appearances ranked second on the club to Hideki Okajima's 66. He made 17 appearances for Pawtucket, going 2–1 with a 3.78 ERA. López was a member of the playoff roster for the Red Sox, posting a 15.43 ERA but winning his first World Series as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.\n2008.\nOn January 18, 2008, López agreed to a one-year contract with the Red Sox for $840,000, avoiding the arbitration process. In 2008, López spent the full season on a major league roster for the first time since his rookie year. On June 6, he threw a career-high three innings, allowing no runs in an 8–0 loss to the Seattle Mariners. In 70 games, López had a 2–0 record, a 2.43 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in innings pitched. He had the fifth-lowest ERA among major league left-handed relievers and appeared in the fifth-most games of AL left-handers. He had the second-lowest ERA among Red Sox pitchers in 2008.\nLópez made the playoffs for the second year in a row as the Red Sox won the AL Wild Card. He made one appearance in the AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, taking the loss in Game 3 after giving up a game-winning, twelfth-inning single to Erick Aybar. That was Boston's only loss of the series, as they defeated the Angels in four games. He made two appearances in the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tampa Bay Rays, allowing no runs as the Red Sox were defeated in seven games.\n2009.\nOn April 30, 2009, López allowed five runs in inning and played the remainder of the eighth inning in right field after Francona switched him with right fielder Jonathan Van Every. This game, a 13–0 loss to the Rays, was the first time a Red Sox pitcher had played another position in a major league game since Tom Burgmeier played left field on August 3, 1980. On May 10, López was designated for assignment to make room for pitcher Daniel Bard after he started the year 0–2 with a 9.26 ERA in 14 games. Shortly thereafter, he was outrighted to the minors. He spent the rest of the season in Pawtucket, going 1–1 with a 3.18 ERA in 38 games. On October 5, he was granted free agency. López ended his Red Sox tenure with a string of 152 straight games without a save, the longest stretch for a Red Sox pitcher since Rhéal Cormier had 160 in 1995 and from 1999 to 2000.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2010).\nOn December 18, 2009, López signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates where he replaced John Grabow, who was traded mid-2009, as the Pirates' left-handed specialist. After posting a 10.80 ERA in his first two games, he posted a 2.43 ERA over his next 48 through July 31.\nSan Francisco Giants (2010–2016).\n2010.\nOn July 31, 2010, López was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Joe Martinez and John Bowker. He appeared in 27 games for the Giants, earning a 2–0 record with an ERA of 1.42. His combined record of 4–2 for the year with both Pittsburgh and San Francisco came in 77 appearances with an ERA of 2.34, both career records. Left-handed batters hit only .162 against López, lowest among all National League left-handers (minimum 85 at-bats). He ended the season five days short of qualifying for free agency.\nLópez reached the playoffs as the Giants won the NL West for the first time since 2003. He made two appearances in the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves to face Jason Heyward, whom he struck out both times. The Giants won the series in four games. Against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for Game 4, in which he allowed a run. In the deciding Game 6, he pitched a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after Juan Uribe hit a game-winning home run against Ryan Madson in the eighth inning. López made two appearances against the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out Josh Hamilton to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second and preserve a 2–0 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9–0. He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.\n2011.\nAfter joining the Giants in 2010, López became one of the premier lefty specialists in the game. On May 12, 2011, he recorded his first save since 2006 in a 3–2 victory over the Diamondbacks. Following the game, he crossed his arms, imitating Giants' closer Brian Wilson's post-save gesture. In 70 games in 2011, he had a 5–2 record, a 2.72 ERA, and 40 strikeouts in 50 innings pitched. He and Brad Ziegler were the only relief pitchers in the major leagues to toss at least 50 innings without allowing a home run. His .163 opponent batting average (OBA) against left-handers was the eighth-lowest in the NL.\n2012.\nAfter the 2011 season, the Giants re-signed López to a two-year, $8.5 million contract. On July 6, 2012, López gave up his first home run since joining the Giants in 2010 when he allowed a 457-foot home run to Pedro Álvarez in a 6–5 victory over the Pirates. That brought his ERA to 4.00, but he posted a 1.00 ERA over his last 32 games. Following struggles by Santiago Casilla (who had replaced an injured Wilson as the Giants' closer), Giants' manager Bruce Bochy announced on August 7 that the Giants would be going to a \"bullpen by committee\" strategy, with López, Sergio Romo, and Jeremy Affeldt pitching the final two innings of close games, depending on which hitters they would be facing. Romo and López received most of the save opportunities; Affeldt only had one save after that point. López received six save opportunities after August 7 and converted each of them. In 70 games, López had a 3–0 record, a 2.50 ERA, and 28 strikeouts in 36 innings while converting seven out of nine save opportunities. He stranded 87.9% of inherited runners, the third-best mark in the NL. López made five appearances in the NLDS and the NLCS, allowing no runs as the Giants won both of those series. He did not pitch in the World Series but won his third career World Series ring as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers.\n2013.\nLópez recorded his only save of the 2013 season on September 19, pitching the final of the ninth inning in a 2–1 victory over the Mets. He made 69 appearances in 2013, going 4–2 with a career-best 1.83 ERA and striking out 37 in innings. He held left-handed hitters to a .156 OBA. On November 20, 2013, López was re-signed by the Giants to a three-year, $13 million contract.\n2014.\nLópez appeared in 65 games in 2014, recording a 3.11 ERA with 22 strikeouts and 19 walks. In the 2014 NLDS, NLCS, and World Series, he recorded 11 outs over nine appearances, allowing 4 hits and a walk. Lopez won his fourth World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games.\n2015.\nIn 2015, López matched his career high with 77 appearances, setting new career-bests with a 1.60 ERA and 0.89 WHIP. He struck out 26 batters in 39 innings pitched. Of all MLB pitchers, he held left-handed batters to the lowest batting average, .112 (in 20 or more innings).\n2016.\nLópez appeared in 68 games in 2016, recording a 4.05 ERA with 15 strikeouts and 15 walks in 26 innings pitched. Along with teammate Brandon Crawford, López won the Willie Mac Award, which honors the Giants' most inspirational player.\nRetirement.\nLópez announced his retirement on February 8, 2017. Soon afterwards, he re-joined the Giants as a special instructor during spring training. In February 2017 it was announced that Lopez, along with Jeremy Affeldt, would be serving as part-time color analysts on Giants telecasts throughout the 2017 season, due to regular analyst Mike Krukow reducing his schedule. On June 2, Lopez joined, for the first time, the other KNBR Giant's radio broadcasters during the after-game 'wrap-up' show.\nPitching style.\nLópez's main pitch is a two-seam fastball in the mid 80s, and his secondary pitch is a slider in the high 70s. Against left-handed hitters he will sometimes mix in a curveball. López's distinctive sidearm delivery makes him appealing as a left-handed specialist; through his career, lefties hit only .202 against him, while righties hit .297.\nAfter López struggled to begin his professional career, throwing over the top, he decided he needed to change his style. In the Diamondbacks' system in 2002, with the help of Mike Myers, he began throwing sidearm (or submarine), which Andy Baggarly called \"a decision that changed his life.\"\nPersonal life.\nLópez is married to Renée Richards, with whom he attended high school and college. The couple has two children: Kylan (March 19, 2010) and Christian (October 26, 2012). Because López was in the 2012 World Series when Christian was born, he had to fly back home for the birth between Games 2 and 3. He and his family reside in Georgia. López is a Christian. He says, \"I do everything through faith, for sure.\""

        "text": "Mike Dunn (born 20 November 1971) is an English retired professional snooker player who lives in Redcar.\nHaving first turned professional in 1991, Dunn has been ranked within the top 64 players in the world since 2002, reaching his highest ranking, at 32nd, in October 2010. He has enjoyed the best form of his career since 2013, reaching the last 16 stage of three tournaments, and the semi-finals of the 2014 China Open and the 2015 Ruhr Open. He announced his retirement from the game after losing in the third qualifying round of the 2020 World Championship.\nCareer.\n1991 to 1997.\nBorn in 1971, Dunn turned professional in 1991. His first six seasons came without any success, and although he improved his ranking each year, he was relegated as the world number 139 in 1997, as the secondary UK Tour was formed to run below the professional main tour.\nCompeting on the UK Tour for the 1997/1998 season, Dunn reached the last 16 at Event Three, where he lost 2–5 to former world number two Tony Knowles. His performances that season were sufficient for him to regain his professional status at its conclusion.\nSince 1998.\nIn his first season back on the main tour, Dunn reached the last 32 at the 1999 Welsh Open, where he beat five opponents, including Munraj Pal, Ian Brumby, Paul Wykes and Mark King, before being eliminated 5–1 by Alain Robidoux.\nBeginning 1999/2000 ranked 134th, Dunn would enter the 2000s within the top 100 professional players; a run to the last 32 at the 2000 Thailand Masters, where Matthew Stevens beat him 5–1, contributed to £13,000 in prize money for that season, and he finished it in 93rd position.\nDunn's stock continued to rise steadily the following year, but his only showing in the latter stages of an event came at the 2001 Thailand Masters; there, he recovered from 1–3 down to 3–3 against Stephen Lee, but lost 3–5.\nAs the world number 72 for the 2001/2002 season, Dunn enjoyed his best form yet at the 2002 World Championship, defeating Stephen Croft 10–2, David McDonnell 10–8, Lee Walker 10–2, David Finbow 10–5 and Billy Snaddon 10–9 – having trailed 1–5 – to qualify for the main stages at the Crucible Theatre for the first time. Drawn against Stevens, he came to trail 1–7 and, although he recovered well to 6–9, could not prevent a 6–10 loss. Nevertheless, the performance earned Dunn £14,500, and he broke into the top 64 as a result.\nThe next few seasons were anticlimactic, Dunn's best progress being a run to the semi-final of the non-ranking Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, where he lost 3–6 to Mehmet Husnu; however, 2005 heralded a first-ever last-16 finish, at the 2005 Malta Cup. There, he beat Leo Fernandez, Michael Judge, Marco Fu, local wildcard entry Simon Zammit and David Gray – whitewashing the latter 5–0 – before losing 3–5, again to Stevens.\nHaving begun 2004/2005 ranked 53rd, Dunn finished it 54th – the first time he had ever finished a season in a lower position than at the start.\nAt the 2006 UK Championship, Dunn defeated Jamie Jones, Mark Davis and James Wattana to reach the last 32, but was heavily beaten by the resurgent Ken Doherty, losing 1–9 to the Irishman.\nDoherty again overcame him at the China Open the following season, this time a 5–2 victor; Dunn came within one match of making his second Crucible appearance in 2008, but having led Dave Harold 4–3, went on to lose 4–10.\n2008/2009 brought a run to the last 16 at the inaugural – and only – Bahrain Championship, where he beat Shaun Murphy 5–4 in the last 32, but lost by the same scoreline in his next match against Barry Hawkins.\nAfter several last-64 finishes at the start of season 2010/2011, Dunn briefly entered the top 32 in the rankings in October 2010, but dropped back out within several months; he beat Stevens, Alfie Burden and Stuart Bingham in the 2011 Snooker Shoot-out, but lost his quarter-final 'match' 14–90 to Ronnie O'Sullivan.\nBy 2014, Dunn had endured several years of poor form and was in danger of losing his place on tour at the end of the season. However, at the 2014 China Open, he mustered the best performance of his career, beating Tom Ford, Peter Lines, Tian Pengfei, Craig Steadman and world number one Mark Selby to reach the semi-finals. There, he faced the home favourite, Ding Junhui, for a place in the final, but was outclassed, losing 6–0. This run earned Dunn £21,000 and was enough to ensure he would begin the 2014/2015 season ranked 58th, keeping his professional status.\nThe next season brought only one last-16 finish, at the 2014 Haining Open, where he lost 3–4 to the eventual finalist, Peter Lines's son Oliver, but Dunn's results were sufficient to move him up to 42nd in the end-of-season rankings, his highest position since 2011.\nOn 25 July 2020, Dunn announced his retirement from competitive snooker, ending his 29-year career as a professional.\nPersonal life.\nMike Dunn is now the manager of Q House Snooker Academy Darlington, He is also a WPBSA director for World Snooker, and was in the presentation party at the final of the 2007 UK Championship. Dunn supports Middlesbrough F.C."

        "title": "James Shields (baseball)",
        "text": "James Anthony Shields (born December 20, 1981) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays from 2006 through 2012, the Kansas City Royals in 2013 and 2014, the San Diego Padres in 2015 and 2016, and the Chicago White Sox from 2016 to 2018. He was an All Star in 2011.\nAmateur career.\nShields grew up in the Newhall neighborhood of Santa Clarita, California. He has two older brothers. While attending William S. Hart High School, he was named the \"Los Angeles Times\" Valley Player of the Year in 1999, his junior season after leading Hart to the Division II championship. He had an 11–0 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) with 123 strikeouts in innings pitched. He also batted .478 with a then-school record 11 home runs and 45 runs batted in, being named the Southern Section's Division II Player of the Year. He declined a full scholarship to play baseball at Louisiana State University in favor of signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. \"Baseball America\" ranked him the 16th best high school prospect in 2000.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays.\nThe Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Shields in the 16th round of the 2000 MLB draft. After pitching well during his first season at the Class-A level in 2001, Shields underwent serious shoulder surgery that caused him to miss the entire 2002 season. His fastball lost some velocity as a result, forcing him to change his pitching approach and develop a changeup as he worked his way up through the Devil Rays system.\nShields made his Major League debut against the Baltimore Orioles on May 31, 2006. He surrendered five runs over five innings as he earned a no-decision. On June 5, Shields picked up his first big league win against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, striking out six over six innings of work. On June 21, 2006, Shields became the first Devil Rays pitcher to start his career with 4 straight wins.\nShields' rookie season with Tampa Bay was relatively unimpressive. He finished with a 6–8 record and an ERA of 4.84. However, his 104 strikeouts in just under 125 innings was promising.\nIn 2007, Shields began to emerge as a legitimate top of the rotation starter to complement Scott Kazmir. On May 9, he pitched nine shutout, 3-hit innings, only to receive a no decision due to lack of run support in an eventual 10-inning loss. Later, on May 30, he pitched a complete game in a 5–3 win vs the Detroit Tigers in which after a 3-run first inning, he retired 13 straight batters. Shields finished the season 12–8 with a 3.85 ERA in 31 starts. His 184 strikeouts in 215 innings placed him among the league leaders. He was also second-best in the AL in strikeout-to-walk ratio (5.11 K/BB) and third-best in walks per 9 innings (1.51 BB/9) and WHIP (1.107).\nBased on less than two full years of major league work with Tampa Bay, the Rays signed him to a 4-year, $11.25 million contract after the 2008 season. This deal contained 3 team options and multiple performance bonuses that could expand the deal to 7 years and upwards of $44 million.\nAfter an injury to Tampa Bay's ace, Scott Kazmir, Shields made the 2008 Opening Day start for the Rays against Baltimore, earning the win by giving up two runs in seven innings in the 6–2 victory.\nOn April 27, 2008, Shields threw a two-hit complete game shutout against the Boston Red Sox, throwing only 98 pitches for his first of his career. On May 9 (exactly one year after his gem against Detroit), Shields had a one-hit shutout against the Angels, posting a Game Score of 93.\nOn June 5, 2008, during a game against the Boston Red Sox, Shields hit Coco Crisp with a pitch and Crisp charged the mound. Shields threw a punch and missed, while Crisp countered with a punch at Shields that also missed. Moments later, both teams' benches emptied onto the field. Shields stated afterward that he was protecting his teammates, believing he did the right thing following an incident the night before involving Crisp. Following the incident, Shields and Crisp were suspended for 6 and 7 games, respectively.\nShields threw a changeup 26.3% of the time in 2008, tops in the AL.\nShields became the first winning pitcher in a postseason game in the history of both the Rays and Tropicana Field when the Rays beat the Chicago White Sox in Game 1 of the 2008 ALDS. He was the first Tampa Bay Rays pitcher to win a World Series game, having done so in Game 2 of the 2008 World Series. The Rays ended up losing the series to the Philadelphia Phillies within 5 games. Shields led the Rays in innings pitched in 2008 with 215, and also tied Edwin Jackson to lead the Rays with 14 wins, which also tied the record for most wins by a Rays pitcher.\nIn 2009, Shields was the Opening Day starter for the Rays. The Rays fell, 5–3, to the Red Sox, in an ALCS rematch. On August 3, Shields had a no-hitter going into the 8th inning against the Kansas City Royals. It was broken up by Royals catcher John Buck. Shields finished the 2009 season at 11–12 with 4.14 ERA in 33 starts.\nOn August 7, 2010, Shields gave up 6 home runs to the Toronto Blue Jays (2 by Aaron Hill, and 1 by Edwin Encarnación, Adam Lind, José Bautista, and J. P. Arencibia), tying a modern-day record of home runs allowed in one game. Arencibia's home run was the first of his career, hit in his first at-bat off Shields' first pitch. Shields finished the 2010 season at 13–15 with a 5.18 ERA, which was the fourth-highest among qualifying starting pitchers. He led the majors with 246 hits and 117 earned runs allowed.\nShields was selected as an All-Star for the first time in his Major League career in 2011. He was named the 2011 Tampa Bay Rays team MVP by the Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, compiling a 16–12 win–loss record, 2.82 ERA, a career-high 225 strikeouts, and a team-record 11 complete games. The 11 complete games earned him the nickname \"Complete Game James\" among fans and local media. Shields also finished 3rd in the American League Cy Young voting.\nDespite continued success on the mound in 2012, Shields did not receive much run support from the Rays and finished the season with a record of 15-10 and a 3.52 ERA. During his final start of the season on October 2, he pitched a complete game against the Baltimore Orioles, setting a franchise record with 15 strikeouts. Despite only giving up two hits, Shields took the loss as the Orioles won the game 1–0, with the deciding run coming off a home run by Chris Davis.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 9, 2012, Shields was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with Wade Davis) in exchange for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard. In his first year as a Royal, Shields posted a 13-9 record with a 3.15 ERA, also setting a personal best in games started. On October 31, 2013, the Kansas City Royals exercised a $13.5 million option on Shields for the 2014 season.\nOn May 13, 2014, in a 5-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies, Shields struck out Troy Tulowitzki in the sixth inning to record his 1,500th career strikeout. Shields started the first postseason game for the Royals in 29 years on September 30. He allowed 4 earned runs over 5 innings as the Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics in 12 innings, 9-8. On October 5, 2014, Shields started Game 3 of the American League Divisional Series against the Los Angeles Angels. He pitched 6 innings, allowed 2 earned runs on 6 hits and struck out 6 and earned the win as the Royals swept the Angels. After then sweeping the Orioles, he led Kansas City to their first World Series in 29 years. In the 2014 World Series, Shields started in games 1 and 5, but lost both, and the Royals lost the series 4 games to 3. Following the 2014 season, Shields became a free agent.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn February 11, 2015, the San Diego Padres signed Shields to a four-year contract, worth $75 million, with a fifth-year club option.\nIn 33 starts for the Padres in 2015, Shields went 13-7 with a 3.91 ERA and 216 strikeouts. However, Shields also gave up a league-leading 33 home runs. He also gave up Bartolo Colón's first major league home run on May 7, 2016. \nChicago White Sox.\nOn June 4, 2016, Shields was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Erik Johnson and Fernando Tatís Jr. Shields made his first start with the White Sox against the Washington Nationals on June 8. He allowed 7 earned runs in innings pitched before being taken out of the game. The White Sox lost the game by 11–4. Shields went 4-12 with a 6.77 ERA in the 114.1 innings pitched for the White Sox. For the 2016 season, between the two teams he led the majors in giving up the most home runs (40), in giving up the most home runs per nine innings (1.98), and had the highest WHIP among major league pitchers (1.48). He had the lowest zone percentage of all major league pitchers, with only 37.7% of his pitches being in the strike zone.\nOn April 6, 2017, Shields won his first game of the season, pitching innings, allowing only two hits and one run (solo homer in the second inning), throwing five strikeouts and five walks. On June 24, he gave up the first major league home runs to 3 Oakland Athletics rookies; Matt Olson (who later hit his 2nd home run off of reliever Jake Petricka), Jaycob Brugman, and Franklin Barreto; this was the first time 3 rookies have hit their first major league home run in the same game.\nThe White Sox declined the 2019 option on Shields' contract on October 29, 2018, making him a free agent.\nScouting report.\nShields had good command of his fastball and changeup. His four-seam and two-seam fastballs typically reached 91 to 94 miles per hour, and he also threw a changeup, a cut fastball, and a spiked curve. Shields used an awkward windup where he shifted his weight back toward second base by moving his left leg in the air and moving it behind him. He then paused for about one second before delivering the pitch.\nPersonal life.\nShields married Ryane Barber in November 2007 in Kauai, Hawaii. They make their home in Rancho Santa Fe, California with their two daughters. The couple is involved with The Heart Gallery and Eckerd Youth Alternatives, two initiatives benefiting children in foster care, and in 2010 donated a suite at Tropicana Field called \"Big Game James Clubhouse\" for the use of foster children attending games through the two initiatives. They also hosted an annual \"Heart Gallery Night at the Rays\" during Shields' tenure with the club.\nShields is the first cousin of former MLB outfielder Aaron Rowand."

        "text": "Samuel Herbert \"Pop\" Harding (January 19, 1873 – May 19, 1919) was an American college football player and coach. He served as head football coach at Maryland Agricultural College—now known as the University of Maryland, College Park—in 1893 and led the team to a perfect 6–0 record and its first winning season.\nBiography.\nHarding was born on January 19, 1873, in Highland, Maryland. He attended the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland), where he played on the football team as a tackle from 1892 to 1894. In 1899, the \"Baltimore American\" wrote that he was \"regarded as one of the best general athletes the college ever had.\" Harding served as the team captain and player-coach during the 1893 season and the Aggies amassed a perfect 6–0 record. His assistant coach was fullback Arthur Pue Gorman Jr., son of a United States Senator from Maryland. Harding graduated from Maryland Agricultural College in 1895 with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Scientific Course.\nBeginning in 1896, Harding worked as a skilled laborer for the Water Department in Washington, D.C. In the first football game of the 1899 season, Maryland was defeated, 21–0, by Western Maryland, and its coach and best player, fullback S. S. Cooke, was forced to retire after an arm injury. The athletic director, H. A. Harrison, decided the team would finish out its schedule, and Harding returned to fill in as coach.\nHarding married Marian Boyle on October 15, 1901. In 1906, he rose to the position of foreman in the Water Department. Harding later worked as a clerk for the Washington, D.C. city government. He died on May 17, 1919, and was interred in Forest Glen, Maryland."

        "text": "Matt Cooper (born 18 April 1979) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s and 2010s. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australia international representative , he played his entire National Rugby League career for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, with whom he won the 2010 NRL grand final.\nBackground.\nCooper was born in Port Kembla, New South Wales on 18 April 1979. He originally gained an interest in rugby league football as a supporter of Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies, the club his father followed. He began playing football at the age of six for his local junior club, the Shellharbour Sharks, while also participating in athletics and surf lifesaving. After moving to Illawarra, Cooper began supporting the Illawarra Steelers. He signed on to the Illawarra Steelers club as a teenager prior to their joint-venture with the St. George at the end of 1998. After the joint-venture of the Dragons and the Steelers clubs prior to the 1999 NRL season, Cooper was signed on with the newly formed St. George Illawarra Dragons team.\nProfessional playing career.\n2000s.\nAt the age of twenty-one Cooper made his NRL début for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the opening round of the 2000 season against local rivals the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After making his début Cooper was replaced in the St. George Illawarra line-up for the second game of the season and was not re-called until round seven in which he crossed the line for his first try against the New Zealand Warriors, Cooper in total scored two tries in limited appearances in the 2000 season.\nThe 2001 season was not a successful one for Cooper, with minor injuries causing him to miss many games. He returned just before the finals, scoring two tries in the semi-final victory over Canterbury-Bankstown. In 2002, Cooper was able to retain his position in the team for the majority of the season and finished the year with a total of seven tries from nineteen games.\nCooper held down his spot for the duration of the 2003 season. In total, Cooper scored eleven tries including three doubles during the regular season, he then tasted his first representative honour being selected to play for Country in the annual City and Country Origin. Although the season eventually finished on a low note both for the Dragons and Cooper with another injury yet again forcing him out of the team. Though all was not lost for Matt as he was nominated for the Dragons player of the year, eventually losing out to Ben Hornby while he picked up the Geoff Selby Memorial NRL Coaches Award.\nThe 2004 season yet again was one of improvement and new opportunity, Cooper began the season well scoring a total of eight tries in six matches for St. George Illawarra including four tries in a single match against the reigning premiers the Penrith Panthers. Later Cooper was called up for the third and deciding game of the 2004 State of Origin series for New South Wales after the team had lost the second match, replacing Luke Lewis to partner his clubmate Mark Gasnier in the centres. At the conclusion of the 2004 St. George Illawarra Dragons season Gasnier had scored the most tries, with a total of seventeen, and the international selectors assigned him a spot in the Australian team for the 2004 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, France and the United States. His club coach Nathan Brown had recommended that Cooper be selected for the Australian rugby league team under coach Wayne Bennett, though he eventually opted for the usual more experienced international representatives and Cooper did not play a competitive match on the tour.\nAfter having an impressive début match in the previous series, Cooper was subsequently re-selected for New South Wales in the 2005 State of Origin series, playing in all three matches of the series helping New South Wales to another series win, scoring one try along the way in game two. He finished the NRL season well with thirteen tries from twenty games and was again selected to go on to tour of Great Britain with Australia. He appeared in the first three test matches on the tour, scoring five tries.\nInjury yet again hit Cooper early on in the 2006 NRL season in the form of a damaged hamstring while playing in the season opening fixture against the Wests Tigers. Cooper was forced to miss several fixtures for St. George Illawarra after failing to recover from a hamstring injury sustained during the round one NRL fixture. However Cooper was once again selected to play for Australia in the mid-season test match on 5 May 2006, he scored once during a dominating 50 to 12 win over New Zealand. This was the last time Cooper has represented Australia. His hamstring injury forced Cooper to withdraw from the starting line-up for the 2006 State of Origin series, being replaced by winger Eric Grothe, Jr. from the Parramatta Eels. After missing the first game of Origin for New South Wales, Cooper failed to be called up for game two with Grothe retaining his position after a solid performance in game one. On 11 June it was announced that Cooper had been called up as 18th man on stand by for the game.\nIn August 2008, Cooper was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. \nHe was selected for Country in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. However, he did not play in the match after withdrawing with injury.\n2010s.\nIn the first round of the 2010 finals, St. George Illawarra defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 28–0, with Cooper scoring two tries, surpassing Nathan Blacklock's record of 100 tries to become the Dragons highest try scorer, with 102 tries. In 2010 he got a recall to the Origin team. He played Games 1 and 2 but sustained an injury which kept him out of Game 3. On 3 October 2010, Cooper was a part of the St. George Illawarra team that beat the Sydney Roosters 32–8 in the 2010 NRL Grand Final, helping the joint venture club claim its first premiership. This was also Cooper's 100th career win out of a possible 199 NRL games.\nThe following February Cooper travelled with the St. George Illawarra to England to play the Super League champions, Wigan Warriors in the 2011 World Club Challenge. He scored a try in St. George Illawarra's victory. Cooper ended the 2011 season as St. George Illawarra's leading tryscorer with 14. Cooper scored six tries in 15 games in the 2012 NRL season. He scored two tries in eight games in the 2013 NRL season.\nAfter football.\nCooper was a participant in the fourteenth season of \"Dancing with the Stars\". In 2015, Cooper was a contestant in the fourth season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice Australia\".\nIn late 2016, he admitted to an addiction to the drug endone, following pain relief required for a bulging disc in his vertebrae.\nIn August 2021, Cooper was announced as a contestant on the celebrity version of \"Big Brother Australia\".\nIn October 2022, Cooper launched an attack on his former club St. George Illawarra saying “There’s no pride in the jersey anymore, From 2001-2011 we only missed the finals twice. Since then, we’ve only made them twice. Obviously it changed when Wayne Bennett left. It all starts from the top… that’s where the culture comes from. There’s no pride in the jersey now, no team-first attitude. You can see that when players are asking to be released – and I’m not blaming them. There’s a reason they want to go elsewhere\"."

The games were played on 22 and 29 November 1997 in Tehran and Melbourne respectively. Australia was hoping to play in the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1974 and Iran in 1978.\nPlay-off match.\nFirst leg.\nPrior to arrival in Tehran, Terry Venables and others involved in the Australian national team had made negative comments about Iran, stating it as being dangerous, and going so far as to bring their own drinking water for their stay.\nThe first leg of the play-off, on 22 November 1997, took place in Tehran, Iran, with the result a 1–1 draw. Attendance for this match was extremely high, as 128,000 fans packed Azadi Stadium, despite it only having a capacity for 100,000 fans at the time.\nSecond leg.\nThe second leg, held on 29 November at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, had a crowd of 85,022. With Australia holding a 1–0 lead at half-time and scoring a second goal just after the break, it looked likely that they would progress to the World Cup. Immediately following Australia's second goal, spectator Peter Hore, known for disrupting major events, ran onto the field and cut up Iran's goal net, causing a halt in play. However, Australia's dominance continued until a controversial booking of Harry Kewell following a collision with Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh in the 72nd minute. This seemed to quell the Australians' momentum, as an Iranian revival, led by Khodadad Azizi, saw Iran score two quick goals to make the score 3–3 on aggregate, with Iran progressing on away goals. \nDespite being undefeated throughout their entire qualifying campaign, Australia had again failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Along with host nation and eventual winner France (who as host nation did not need to qualify), and Saint Kitts and Nevis, Australia were one of three teams to not lose a game in the entire campaign. The broadcast of the game on SBS featured closing comments from a clearly distraught Les Murray and Johnny Warren, with Warren openly weeping on air. In 2000, coach Terry Venables said the game was \"one of the saddest sporting moments of my life.\""

The Czechoslovak participant Karel Dvořák described the weather of the day as extremely mild with temperatures of about 0 °C at the starting point at the upper cableway station (2,486 m) on top of the Corviglia in the morning. The participants wore military equipment, 10 kg of baggage on the back and a military rifle. Only the officers, the patrol leaders, had pistols and did not compete in shooting. At the shooting range they had to shoot on three rubber balloons at a distance of 150 m. Every hit gave a bonus of 1 minute for the team.\n\"Event held on 8 February 1948\""

        "title": "World Cup Live",
        "text": "World Cup Live was a soccer related news and analysis program that aired on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC every four years during the FIFA World Cup. Lead commentators and specialists dissect worldwide matches both through a live feed, and after they have already been played. \"World Cup Live\" was created for the 2006 World Cup and continued through the 2010 World Cup. It is planned to broadcast the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup as ESPN has English-language rights. As for anchors, \"SportsCenter\" hosts Dave Revsine and Rece Davis worked with ESPN while Brent Musburger hosted the ABC airings. Advertisements are not shown seeing as that play does not stop for two forty-five-minute half's, other than a halftime report, during which, commercials are aired. Logos are shown on the screen during broadcasting throughout the game and advertisements from sponsors can be seen before and after the game. Both pregame and post-game segments are included with a large number of games if time between matches permits, and are always aired for USMNT games. \nWorld Cup Live has kept this basic format over the past couple tournaments and plans on continuing for the 2014 World Cup. The show ended after the 2014 FIFA World Cup when Fox Sports acquired the World Cup rights beginning with the 2018 tournament.\n2006 World Cup Broadcast.\nThe shows debut came on June 9, 2006, for the World Cup held in Germany. It usually ran between 12:00 and 00:00 seeing as that was when most games were played and when most viewers would be tuned in. This time slot is known as the Trifecta. During the Trifecta, World Cup Live was shown on ESPN and ABC, however; it was also aired at different times throughout the afternoon on ESPN2. They had a total of forty-seven telecasts, throughout the 2006 tournament. Thirty-two were nightly, twelve were in-between matches and three were pre-game issue. The 2006 edition offered several technological aspects that were meant to make it easier for non-specialists to understand the sciences of each game. A “Shot-Tracker” was used to trace the velocity and power of a kick.\nAs far as critics were concerned, the broadcasts were seen as successful, however; soccer in America had not yet blossomed to its full potential and that was made obvious.\nSponsor: Vonage\n2010 World Cup Broadcast.\nWorld Cup Live later returned for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The same format was brought back and specific segments and ideas such as the “Shot-Tracker” were also reused. New commentators from ESPN and from global soccer programs such as Ian Darke and Chris Fowler joined the broadcasting team. The use of the Internet also came into effect more so then in 2006. A live feed of the show was available to not only Americans but also a variety of other countries that relied on US broadcasting for their coverage.\n2014 World Cup Broadcast.\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup was held in Brazil. ESPN had the rights to broadcast the event in English. Therefore, World Cup Live covered all games. Matches were shown uninterrupted by commercials and were commentated and analyzed before, during, and after the match. Qualifying matches that have been shown were aired on ESPN, although when the tournament started, ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC all broadcast games. The games were, once again, available for viewing on ESPN’s website. Because becoming global has played such a large part in broadcasting World Cup Live, the internet has immensely been utilized by ESPN and ABC.\nPersonalities.\nThese are the personalities that regularly appear on the program.\nGiorgio Chinaglia (analyst, 2006)\nIan Darke (analyst, 2010–present)\nRece Davis (host, 2006)\nEfan Ekoku (analyst, 2010–present)\nJulie Foudy (analyst, 2006–present)\nChris Fowler (host, 2010–present)\nJohn Harkes (analyst, 2006–present)\nAllen Hopkins (analyst, 2006–present)\nAlexi Lalas (analyst, 2006–present)\nBob Ley (host, 2010–present)\nRoberto Martínez (analyst, 2010–present)\nSteve McManaman (analyst, 2010–present)\nBrent Musburger (host on ABC, 2006)\nRuud Gullit (analyst, 2010–present)\nDave Revsine (host, 2006)\nTommy Smyth (analyst, 2006)\nRob Stone (analyst, 2006–present)\nMike Tirico (host, 2010–present)\nMartin Tyler (analyst, 2006–present)\nEric Wynalda (analyst, 2006)\nIan Darke.\nLead commentator Ian Darke has been a huge part of World Cup Live since its 2010 year. He has continued to work with ESPN both throughout the World Cup and various other tournaments including the USMNT qualifying matches. His popularity has helped bring in viewers during the off-season and will continue to do so in 2014. He has stated before that he enjoys working with ESPN and American broadcasting such as World Cup Live and also looks forward to contributing to commentating 2014's airings of the show. In past interviews, Darke has said that he respects America's ability to broadcast soccer and he enjoys helping it become a bigger part of American television. He will work with World Cup Live and ESPN but strongly believes that he will continue to work more with his homeland: Great Britain."

        "text": "Portstewart Golf Club consists of three 18-hole courses situated in the town of Portstewart, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Golf was first played there as far back as 1889.\nThe three courses are: the Strand Course (par 72), a championship course, the Riverside Course (par 68) and the Old Course (par 64), which is where the club was founded in 1894.\nPortstewart Golf Club hosted the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open in 2017, setting up a three-week spell of links golf culminating in The Open Championship.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1894 and started off as 9 holes at the existing location of the Old Course. This was upgraded to 18 holes in 1934.\nIn 1920 the club built another clubhouse at Strand Head and Willie Park Jr. designed 18 holes and this is now currently the Strand Course. In 1986 the club purchased land in the sand dunes known as 'Thistly Hollow' which allowed seven new stunning holes to be built in these towering dunes and in natural links land, these holes were designed by club member Des Giffin.\nDue to this makeover on the Strand Course left an extra 9 holes from the original layout, which was expanded to 18 holes in 2001 and this is now currently the Riverside Course.\nTournaments.\nThe club held a qualifying round for The Open Championship in 1951 when it was played at Royal Portrush.\nThe club played host to the Irish Amateur Close Championship in 1992, and has hosted other events such as the Irish Professional and Irish Amateur. The British Girls Championship was also hosted in 2006, won by Belen Mozo of Spain.\nMost recently it has co-hosted The Amateur Championship in 2014 along with Royal Portrush which was won by Bradley Neil of Scotland. It also co-hosted the Boys Amateur Championship in 2018 alongside Royal Portrush which was won by Conor Gough of England. It has hosted the British Ladies Amateur Championship as well in 2015, won by Céline Boutier of France.\nIn 2017, Portstewart hosted the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, from 6–9 July for the first time in the club's history. This was by far the biggest tournament the club had ever hosted and attracted crowds of 92,000+ for the whole week. The young Spaniard Jon Rahm took the title and shot an Irish Open record score of 24 under par for 4 days. David Drysdale broke the course record for The Strand Course by carding a 63 on the final day.\nPortstewart hosted the North of Ireland Amateur Championship in 2019 along with Castlerock due to Royal Portrush's closure as the 2019 Open Championship host.\nScorecard.\nStrand Links – Championship tees"

        "title": "Canada men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Canada men's national basketball team () represents Canada in international basketball competitions since 1923. They are overseen by Canada Basketball, the governing body for basketball in Canada.\nIn nine Olympic appearances, Canada has won one medal in basketball – a silver at the 1936 Games in Berlin. The team finished fourth in 1976 and 1984. Canada has won six medals at the FIBA AmeriCup – two silver medals in 1980 and 1999, as well as four bronze medals in 1984, 1988, 2001, and 2015. In recent decades, the team also won its first medals at the Pan American Games, a silver medal in 2015, and the FIBA World Cup, a bronze medal in 2023.\nThe Canadian senior national team won its only gold medal at a university-level tournament, the 1983 Summer Universiade, which the country hosted in Edmonton, Alberta.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nAs the country credited for bringing forth the inventor of the game, Canada's national team has often been a major competitor at the global stage.\nThrough the 70s and 80s, Team Canada consistently placed among the top teams in the world. The emergence of Steve Nash gave another boost to the team in the 1990s. Yet, great performances became more scarce when he retired.\n2009–2016.\nCanada began the new cycle entering the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship. Canada advanced to the quarterfinals, after posting a 2–2 record in the Preliminary round. A Uruguay loss to Argentina on the final day of group play meant that the winner of the Canada-Dominican Republic game would advance to the semifinals. Canada would go on to defeat them 76–80. In the semi-finals, Canada would lose to top-seeded Brazil 73–65. By finishing in the top four, this guaranteed the team a place in the 2010 FIBA World Championship held in Turkey. Canada unfortunately finished last (6th) of the Group D, and got ranked 22nd of the FIBA World Cup.\nCritics blamed the absence of Steve Nash, Samuel Dalembert, Jamaal Magloire and Matt Bonner for Canada's disappointing performance at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Ambitions to gather Canada's most outstanding basketball players for the 2010 squad failed as Nash retired from the national team in 2007,\nBonner did not get his citizenship in time, Dalembert was cut from the team after issues with former head coach Rautins and Magloire simply opted not to play.\nWith a spot at the 2012 Summer Olympics up for grabs, Canada entered the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship with aspiration of making the quarterly tournament for the first time since 2000. Canada would ultimately bow out in the Second round of group play, and miss out on both a direct ticket to Beijing and the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nOn May 9, 2012, Steve Nash was named general manager of the national team of Canada.\nAfter a disappointing showing at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, Team Canada would not find success until the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship. In the tournament, Canada advanced to the semi-finals where they were defeated by Venezuela in a nail-bitting 78–79 loss. In the third-place game, they would defeat Mexico 87–86 to claim the bronze medal.\nWith there 3rd place showing at the FIBA Americas Championship, Canada qualified to the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament – Manila. Needing to finish first to qualify for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Canada would advance all the way to the finals to face France. In front of a crown of 13,000, at the Mall of Asia Arena, Canada would fall 74–83 and miss out on yet another Summer Olympics.\n2017–2020.\nAfter failing to qualify for the Olympics, Canada participated at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup in South America. The team was composed mostly of non-NBA players, and ended group play with a 1–2 record. The poor performance led them to finishing in 8th place.\nThe Canadians made their debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, winning a silver medal.\nWith the approaching 2019 FIBA World Cup, Rowan Barrett hired Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse to coach Team Canada through the World Cup and possibly the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nThe team withdrew from its FIBA AmeriCup qualifying games against Cuba on November 29, 2020, and against the U.S. Virgin Islands on November 30, 2020, on the advice of medical experts due to risks posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence on January 20, 2021, the International Basketball Federation docked the team a point in the standings in addition to a 160,000 Swiss francs fine levied against Canada Basketball.\nAt the 18th edition of the FIBA Basketball World Cup, Canada was drawn in Group H, with Australia, Lithuania, and Senegal. Canada finished in 21st place, their second worst showing at the men's international tournament.\nCanada had one last change to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, participating at the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments – Victoria. Canada began the Preliminary round finishing with a 2–0 record, advancing to the semi-finals were they would face Czech Republic. A closely fought game, Canada would ultimately fall 101–103 in OT, missing out on the Summer Games for a 5th straight tournament.\n2021–present.\nAfter numerous setbacks in tournament play, Canada Basketball introduced the concept of the 'Summer Core' consisting of 14 players who were willing to commit to represent Canada for three consecutive summers. This included the 2023 FIBA World Cup and participation at the 2024 Summer Olympics, where the Canadian men are making their first appearance since Nash led them to Sydney in 2000.\nIn 2022, the Canadians participated at the 19th edition of the FIBA AmeriCup. They finished group play in second place with a 2–1 record. In the quarter-finals, Canada defeated Mexico 77–82. In the semi-finals, they were defeated by Brazil 86–76. They ended the tournament finishing in 4th place, after a narrow 84–80 loss to the United States, in the third place game. Dalano Banton, one of the standouts of the tournament, was named to the All-Tournament Team.\nOn June 27, 2023, Sacramento Kings assistant coach Jordi Fernández was hired to replace Nick Nurse as Team Canada's head coach.\nLeading up to the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Canada Basketball announced a five-game exhibition series where they would play matches in Germany and Spain, against some of the top nations in the world. Canada finished the exhibition tour with a 3–2 record, which included wins over Germany and Spain, both of which were higher-ranked.\nCanada carried their form into the group phase of the World Cup, defeating France 95–65 in the opening match. Canada finished the first group phase with a 3–0 record, and a +111 point differential, following large wins over Lebanon and Latvia. However, the team suffered their first loss of the tournament to Brazil in the first game of the second stage. The loss meant that their next match against world number one ranked Spain, was a game Canada had to win if they hoped to gain an automatic berth at the 2024 Olympics. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led a fourth quarter comeback from 12 points down, as Canada edged the defending World champions in an 88–85 victory. The win secured a quarter-final spot and Canada's first Olympic berth since 2000. Canada then defeated Slovenia in the quarter-final by a score of 100–89, reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time. After a loss to Serbia in the semi-final, Canada defeated the United States in the bronze medal game, which went to overtime and concluded 127–118. Dillon Brooks recorded a team-best 39 points in the game, which secured the team's first global championship medal since 1936. Gilgeous-Alexander became the first Canadian to be named to the World Cup All-Tournament Team, while Brooks received the Best Defensive Player award. The team was subsequently named Team of the Year by The Canadian Press.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nPast rosters.\n1936 Summer Olympics: finished 2nd of 21 teams\nGordon Aitchison, Ian Allison, Arthur Chapman, Charles Chapman, Edward Dawson, Irving Meretsky, Douglas Peden, James Stewart, Malcolm Wiseman were awarded silver medals for having played in at least one match during the tournament.

        "text": "Bob Nicholson (born May 27, 1953) is a Canadian ice hockey executive, administrator, and businessman. He has worked for Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG) since 2016, and was previously the president and chief executive officer of Hockey Canada from 1998 to 2014.\nNicholson grew up playing hockey in Penticton, British Columbia, winning a provincial title, then attended Providence College on a scholarship. He began his hockey administrator career in 1975 with BC Hockey, and worked his way up to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association in 1989. During his tenure as president of Hockey Canada, national teams won 71 medals in international competitions, including 44 gold medals, seven Olympic gold medals, 12 world junior titles, five men's world championships, and 10 women's world championships. He transformed Hockey Canada into a profitable business, and raised the profile of the World Juniors. In addition to his work on Canadian national hockey, he spent four years as an International Ice Hockey Federation vice-president and council member.\nNicholson was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame, and is a recipient of the Order of Hockey in Canada and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. He is married to Lorna Schultz Nicholson.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBob Nicholson was born May 27, 1953, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He grew up in Penticton, and played pond hockey and minor ice hockey in the Okanagan area. His midget team was coached by Ivan McLelland, and won a provincial championship. \nNicholson moved up to the junior ice hockey level, played three seasons with the Penticton Broncos, and was named team captain in his third season. His Broncos team won the Mowat Cup for the British Columbia Hockey League championship, and then went on to win the Doyle Cup for the BC–Alberta championship in 1973. In the Western Canada finals for the Abbott Cup, Pentiction lost in seven games to the Portage Terriers from Manitoba. Nicholson attended Providence College on a scholarship to play NCAA hockey. While in Rhode Island, he played for head coach Lou Lamoriello, and was teammates with Brian Burke, and Ron Wilson.\nBritish Columbia hockey.\nNicholson's career as a hockey administrator began in 1975, when he accepted a job at the Oak Bay Recreational Centre, in Greater Victoria, British Columbia. In Oak Bay, he created programs for youths to play hockey for fun and develop skills, and successfully grew enrollment each year, then he was hired by Dave Andrews in 1979, to become technical director of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association. Nicholson served in this capacity until 1989, and continued with fundamental skills development while touring the province. He was also in charge of coaching clinics for the BCAHA, and led player development camps for annual junior Olympic programs, and the program of excellence for the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team. Nicholson also coached at the junior A level, and the provincial Under-17 team at the Winter Canada Games. During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Nichsolson was a commentator for CBC Sports.\nNational hockey vice-president.\nNicholson was named vice-president of technical operations by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association as of July 1, 1989, when the organization looked to improve domestic programs, and became more involved in the growth of international hockey. He was appointed vice-president of programs for the CAHA in 1990, then senior vice-president in 1992. He continued in the same role after the merger of the CAHA with Hockey Canada in 1994. During that time he was responsible for overseeing the new Canada women's national ice hockey team program, the existing Canada men's national junior ice hockey team, coaching and refereeing certification, developmental programs, marketing, licensing and special events. Nicholson helped negotiate with the National Hockey League to allow its players to participate in the Winter Olympic games, beginning with the 1998 Winter Olympics, which also marked the first time women's hockey was played in the Olympics.\nHockey Canada president.\nNicholson served as president and chief executive officer of Hockey Canada from June 1, 1998, until June 1, 2014. He was considered a relative unknown in the hockey world when he took over as president. He credited his predecessor Murray Costello, for bringing him into Hockey Canada, and for the opportunity to build on Costello's work. Nicholson's vision for Hockey Canada was to make it a more self-sufficient business, to ensure Canadian youth could play the game in a safe and fun environment, and to promote skills development and coaching education. He wanted Canadian hockey teams to aim for gold at international competitions, and disagreed with the Canadian Olympic Committee talking about personal bests, and just going to the Olympics to enjoy it. Nicholson was credited with instilling team-building components for developing team chemistry quickly in shortened competitions, which helped the national men's team win its first Olympic gold medal after a 50-year drought.\nDuring his tenure, Canada won 71 medals in international competition including 44 gold, 20 silver, and 7 bronze. The Canadian men's team won three Winter Olympic Games gold medals in 2002, 2010, and 2014; three Ice Hockey World Championships gold medals in 2003, 2004, and 2007; and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. The Canadian women's team were undefeated in Olympic play during his tenure, and won four consecutive Winter Olympic gold medals in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014; and won five IIHF World Women's Championships in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2012. The Canadian junior team won a total of 12 IIHF World U20 Championships, including 7 while he was vice-president in 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, and 5 while he was president in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The Canadian under-18 men's team won the IIHF World U18 Championship in 2003, 2008, and 2013. The Canadian under-18 women's team won four IIHF World Women's U18 Championships in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Canada men's national ice sledge hockey team won its first-ever gold medal, at the 2006 Winter Paralympics, and won two International Paralympic Committee World Championships in 2000 and 2008.\nUnder his management, the business side of Hockey Canada grew from 23 employees when he started, to nearly 120. Nicholson oversaw all components of the organization, including corporate sales and marketing, licensing, insurance and regulations, communications, and hockey development programs both nationally and internationally. He also led the 1999 Open Ice Summit and the 2010 World Hockey Summit, and the implementation of development programs such as the Hockey Canada Skills Academy program, the Initiation Program, and grassroots initiatives. Hockey Canada became financially successful, as rights fees for the World Juniors Championships became lucrative. Profits were also reinvested in non-North American clubs to help perpetuate the annual event. At the local youth level, he helped maintain Canadian minor hockey enrollment of over 600,000 young players, and grass-roots efforts to curb injuries, violence, and maintain the quality of coaching.\nNicholson recognized the need to surround himself with good people, such as choosing Steve Yzerman, and Mike Babcock to lead the way for the national men's team in the 2010, and 2014 Winter Olympics. He also looked to create a network of businesses and leagues, which included developing a television deal with The Sports Network to generate income, and reaching out to the International Ice Hockey Federation, the National Hockey League, the Canadian Hockey League, and Hockey Canada branches to make a comprehensive hockey program for Canada, and the world. Nicholson also used others to bring change, including knowledgeable people in the hockey world with similar ideas, and not being afraid to change his mind as his personal strengths. Nicholson also sacrificed a lot of personal time, and often worked day and night for success on the national stage, and thanked his family for support in trying to find balance.\nNicholson announced his resignation effective June 1, 2014, at a press conference on April 4, 2014. He began to consider his departure shortly after the 2014 Winter Olympics, stating that the time right for new leadership to take Hockey Canada to the next level, and that he would miss having \"greatest job in hockey in the world.\" He wanted to be remembered for his impact on people, and keeping his focus on children playing the game. Hayley Wickenheiser stated that he had done a lot for her career, the national women's program, and for hockey in Canada. His personal highlights include the Canadian men's sledge hockey team winning its first gold medal, Canada's men's and women's teams winning gold at the 2010, and 2014 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and the growth of the World Juniors tournament. Nicholson offered some advice for his successor, which included keeping the game safe for youth, and being involved in small-town hockey across Canada, keep talking about the women's and sledge hockey programs, and the rest will take care of itself. Prior to his resignation, Nicholson was rumored for the Toronto Maple Leafs general manager position in 2003, and again in 2013, and was also rumored to be joining the front office of the Calgary Flames later in 2013. Nicholson's right-hand man during his tenure was vice-president Scott Smith, who was rumored to be Nicholson's successor, however, Tom Renney replaced Nicholson as president and CEO.\nIIHF executive and committee member.\nNicholson was elected a vice-president of the International Ice Hockey Federation on September 25, 2012. He was chairman of the development and coaching committee, the competition and inline committee, and sat on the events and coaching committees. In this role, Nicholson had the privilege of awarding Team Canada gold medals at the 2016 IIHF World Championship. \"The Hockey News\" had speculated since 2012 that Nicholson would be in line to replace René Fasel as IIHF president, instead he remained vice-president until his term expired in 2016.\nOilers Entertainment Group.\nNicholson was hired by Daryl Katz on June 13, 2014, to oversee business operations and serve as vice-chairman of the Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG), working with Kevin Lowe in charge of hockey operations, and Patrick LaForge in charge of day-to-day business operations. The announcement came as part of a corporate restructuring for the Katz Group of Companies, which owns the Edmonton Oilers, the Edmonton Oil Kings, the Oklahoma City Barons, and the Bakersfield Condors, through its OEG subsidiary. Nicholson said he chose to join OEG due to previous ties with Lowe and Katz on Canada's Olympic teams, to oversee completion of Rogers Place in 2016, and turn around a franchise criticized for poor scouting and player development, which had missed the playoffs every season since 2006. Nicholson immediately engaged with team scouts, and providing ideas on improvement for the Oilers.\nNicholson also serves as an alternate governor for the Oilers on the National Hockey League board of governors. On April 20, 2015, Nicholson was appointed as chief executive officer of OEG, to oversee both the business and hockey operations. Later that week, Nicholson announced further management changes which brought in Peter Chiarelli in a dual role, to replace both Kevin Lowe as president of hockey operations, and Craig MacTavish as general manager. He also transferred Lowe to business duties, after LaForge stepped down.\nNicholson was appointed CEO and vice-chair of OEG on April 24, 2016. He then oversaw expansion of OEG's assets, fan experiences, sponsorships, and operating Rogers Place. As of 2023, he serves as special advisor of hockey operations for OEG, and sits on the board of directors. From 2019 to June 2023, he was chairman of the Edmonton Oilers.\nPersonal life.\nNicholson is married to Lorna Schultz Nicholson, and they have two daughters and one son.\nHonours and awards.\nIn 2004, Nicholson received the City of Penticton 55 Award, and was inducted into the BC Hockey Hall of Fame. His uniform # 6 was retired in Penticton in 2005.\nNicholson received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2013, to honour contributions to Canada. In 2014, he received the Canadian Hockey League Distinguished Service Award, the Ontario Hockey Association Gold Stick award, and was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame.\nHockey Canada recognized Nicholson in 2016, naming him to the Order of Hockey in Canada."

With Chicago he won the Stanley Cup in 1961. After his playing career he worked as a coach, and coached the California Golden Seals, Cleveland Barons, and Hartford Whalers between 1975 and 1988.\nEarly life.\nEvans was born in Morriston, Wales, but emigrated with his parents to Drumheller, Alberta, in his youth. He spoke only the Welsh Language and no English until he entered school, and later spoke the language with an elongated drawl; the similarities between Evans' manner of speaking and the traditional American Southern accent led to him earning the nickname of \"Tex\" from teammates. Although he did not begin playing hockey until age 14, by age 20, Evans was a leading junior league defenceman and participated in the 1948 Memorial Cup. That same year, he signed a minor league contract with the Rangers.\nCareer.\nEvans played five games over the next two seasons, while gaining experience in the American Hockey League. He would then spend the next four years as the Rangers' seventh defenceman, moving in and out of the lineup as needed and serving as a valuable defensive reserve. During the 1954–55 NHL season, Evans finally cracked the regular lineup and worked significant minutes for the next three years on the blue line. In 1958, he was claimed by Chicago, where he would play in a similar role for his final four seasons. He was a member of the 1961 Stanley Cup winning team making him the first Welsh born Stanley Cup Champion. Jack Evans played in 1962 NHL All Star game in Toronto also making him the first NHL All Star player originating from Wales. In 1964, the Black Hawks released Evans, but the veteran continued to play in a variety of minor leagues until he finally retired in 1972 at the age of 44.\nIn 1974, Evans was hired to coach the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the WHL. After one season that included coach of the year honours, he was promoted to the parent club California Golden Seals. He coached the anemic franchise in its final year in the San Francisco Bay Area and its two seasons as the Cleveland Barons before the financially-troubled organization merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978.\nEvans returned to the ECHL bench before being hired by the Hartford Whalers in 1983. In his third season with the club, he earned a playoff berth, and in 1987, he led the club to a division title. A poor performance the following year resulted in Evans being fired midseason.\nPersonal life.\nEvans died of prostate cancer at his Manchester, Connecticut, home in 1996 at the age of 68."

        "text": "Leonard Leslie \"King\" Cole (April 15, 1886 – January 6, 1916) was an American professional baseball player in the early 20th century. He started his baseball career as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1909.\nWith the 1910 Cubs, Cole had a record of 20–4 and helped the team win the National League pennant. On July 31 of that season, he pitched all seven innings in a 4–0 Cubs win over the St. Louis Cardinals, without giving up a hit. It was the second game of a doubleheader: the teams had agreed to end the game at 5 p.m. so they could catch their trains. Due to a 1991 change to the official MLB definition of a no-hitter—it must last at least nine innings—Cole's effort is not recognized by as a no-hitter by MLB.\nCole's 20–4 record in 1910 was the third-best single-season winning percentage (.833) for a Cubs pitcher in the 20th century. \nCole's career went into a slump around 1912, and he developed a reputation for inventing excuses for his poor performance. Ring Lardner (who reputedly gave him his nickname \"King\") allegedly used the personality trait of Cole's as inspiration for the 1915 short story \"Alibi Ike\", about a baseball player who \"never pulled a play, good or bad, on or off the field, without apologizin' for it.\"\nCole was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in May 1912, did not play in the major leagues in 1913, then played for the New York Yankees in 1914 and 1915. On October 2, 1914, Cole gave up a double to Babe Ruth, then a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, for Ruth's first hit in the major leagues.\nAt the opening of the 1915 season, Cole was diagnosed with lung cancer, and was told the disease was terminal and that he had only months to live. Cole had surgery to remove the cancerous tumor, and rejoined the Yankees in July, appearing in 10 games through the remainder of the season, going 2-3 with a 3.18 ERA. At the season's conclusion, the Yankees refused to renew Cole's contract due to the terminal diagnosis. The cancer reappeared in November, and Cole died at his home in Bay City, Michigan in January 1916."

        "text": "Robert James \"Bobby\" Boucher (February 14, 1904 – June 10, 1931) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who played 11 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens during the 1923–24 season. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1919 to 1929, was spent in the minor leagues. He won the Stanley Cup in 1924 with Montreal. He was one of four brothers who played in the NHL.\nPersonal life.\nBobby was one of six sons born to Tom Boucher and Annie Carroll. His paternal grandfather, Antoine Boucher was French while his other grandparents were of Irish descent. His brothers Billy, Frank and Georges would also become professional ice hockey players. There were two other brothers, Carroll and Joseph, and two sisters, Irene and Lily. Their father played rugby football, winning the Canadian championship in 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1901.\nBobby had a daughter with his wife Kay Wilson. Kay was a successful speed skater, who won civic titles in Hamilton and Ottawa. Bobby died at 27 years of age on June 10, 1931, of tuberculosis. Bobby's funeral was held at his brother Carrol's in Ottawa followed by a service at St-Theresa's church and was attended by many members of the sporting circle of the Nations's Capital including all of his famous hockey playing siblings. He was later interred at Notre Dame cemetery alongside his parents.\nPlaying career.\nBoucher played junior hockey with the Ottawa New Edinburghs, Ottawa Muchmore and Creighton Public School. During this time he was no stranger to professional hockey, as he was also a mascot for the Ottawa Senators until 1921. Although no details of what that entailed are available, he was likely a stick-boy. He then spent the next three seasons with the Iroquois Falls \"Baby\" Eskimos before returning to Ottawa to play for the Ottawa Gunners for a portion of the 1923-24 season.\nOn January 24, 1924, Bobby was signed as a free agent by the Montreal Canadiens. He played 12 regular season games alongside his brother Billy, as well as three of the four Stanley Cup playoff games. Despite having shared in the success in Montreal, he was traded to the Vancouver Maroons of the WCHL on the very day the Canadiens were celebrating their Stanley Cup win. Team owner Leo Dandurand felt Bobby was \"too small\", and traded him for Charlie Cotch. This may well have been one of the shortest stints in the NHL on a Stanley Cup winning team for a player.\nHe then bounced between 5 teams in the next 4 seasons in the WHL, Can-Pro and the Can-Amhockey leagues, and had his best season with the London Panthers in 1926-27, marking 8 goals and 2 assists and a career high 39 penalty minutes. His last season was with Sprague Cleghorn's Newark Bulldogs, with which he played only 5 games, presumably because his tuberculosis began to hinder his performance.\nAfter Boucher retired from hockey, he became a referee in the Ottawa Valley Hockey League."

He founded the fitness and leisure business David Lloyd Leisure in 1982.\nHe was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. He and his younger brother John Lloyd became two of the most successful British tennis players throughout the 1970s and 1980s. David captained the British Davis Cup team and was active in the Lawn Tennis Association.\nFor a short time he was chairman of Hull City A.F.C. and Hull FC. He also played a major part in making Tim Henman a world top 10 tennis player.\nTennis career.\nDavid Lloyd grew up in Westcliff-on-Sea near Southend and began playing tennis at Westcliff Hard LTC, where his parents were members, together with his brothers Tony and John.\nIn 1965 he won both singles and doubles titles at the British Junior championships held at Wimbledon and the following year was runner up in the junior singles (losing in the final to future rugby star J.P.R. Williams). In 1972, he reached the last 32 at Wimbledon, losing to Australian former world No. 1, John Newcombe. \nHe was a member of Great Britain's Davis Cup squad between 1972 and 1974, and again between 1976 and 1980, and in 1978, was part of the first British team to reach the final since 1937. In 1976, he and his brother John won a doubles title in London.\nHe retired from professional tennis in 1981, having attained a career-high of No. 128 in the world singles rankings (September 1973) and 40 in the world doubles ranking (August 1977).\nHe was appointed British Davis Cup captain in 1995 and went on to work in the Lawn Tennis Association, and coached Tim Henman. \nDavid Lloyd Leisure.\nFollowing his retirement from professional tennis, Lloyd worked for a number of years as a coach at a tennis club in Canada. On his return to Britain he founded the David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, opening the first club in Heston, near Hounslow in west London, in 1982.\nThe business was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992 and by 1995, there were 18 David Lloyd Leisure clubs, when Whitbread Plc acquired the company for a reported £200 million, incorporating it into its Restaurants &amp; Leisure Division. Lloyd remained as managing director of the division until 1996.\nLloyd, together with his son Scott, went on to create Next Generation fitness clubs and in 2007, London &amp; Regional Properties in partnership with Bank of Scotland, acquired David Lloyd Leisure from Whitbread and incorporated Next Generation into the group, in a deal worth £925 million.\nIn 2013 the group was taken over by TDR Capital and now includes 89 UK and European David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, two Harbour Clubs and five David Lloyd Studios, with a membership of around 440,000 and employing some 6,000 staff.\nProperty and other businesses.\nFollowing the sale of the leisure business, Lloyd developed the Sugar Hill Resort in Barbados.\nLloyd was later involved in the development of an estate in Phuket, Thailand and the building of a villa near Marbella in Spain.\nIn May 2007, Lloyd bought the collection of artist Willard Wigan, estimated to be valued at £11.2 million."

        "title": "List of first-class cricket records",
        "text": "This list of first-class cricket records itemises some record team and individual performances in first-class cricket. The list is necessarily selective, since it is in cricket's nature to generate copious records and statistics. Both instance records (such as highest team and individual scores, lowest team scores and record margins of victory) and season and career records (such as most runs or wickets in a season, and most runs or wickets in a career) are included.\nOfficially, there was no \"first-class cricket\" in Great Britain before 1895 or in the rest of the world before 1947 (see First-class cricket for details of the official rulings). The performances noted in this article include several which occurred in earlier years but it is understood that all were achieved in matches that are retrospectively recognised by most historians or statisticians as first-class (i.e., \"unofficially\" so). Some matches have not been universally accepted as first-class for statistical purposes and there are thus variations in published cricket statistics, mainly because of the different proposals that have been made for the starting date of the statistical records, ranging from the 17th century to 1895.\nRecords shown here are quoted by either CricketArchive or Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, unless otherwise stated.\nTeam records.\nTeam scoring records.\nGreatest margins of victory by an innings.\nQualification: Innings and 550 runs.\nGreatest margins of victory by runs.\nQualification: 575 runs.\nTies.\nThere have been 33 ties in first-class cricket since 1948. Before then, a tie was sometimes declared where the scores were level when scheduled play ended, but the side batting last still had wickets in hand. Matches where this happens are considered a draw today, and a tie is now recognised only where the scores are level \"and\" the side batting fourth is dismissed.\nHighest totals.\nQualification: 900.\nLowest totals.\nQualification: 15.\nHighest totals in the fourth innings.\nQualification: 510.\nIndividual records.\nIndividual records (batting).\nHighest individual score.\nThe highest individual score in first-class cricket is 501* scored by Brian Lara for Warwickshire in 1994. There have been ten other scores of 400 or more, including another by Lara and two by Bill Ponsford.\nScorecards began to be kept regularly from the 1772 season which is now seen as the commencement of the \"statistical\" first-class record, though \"historical\" first-class cricket began a century earlier. There is no certainty of a complete statistical record of any season until well into the 19th century, which is why Roy Webber and others have been reluctant to begin their first-class cricket statistics before the 1864 season, notwithstanding the \"official\" commencement of first-class cricket in 1895.\nThe earliest century definitely recorded in a match generally regarded as first-class is the 136 scored by John Small in the 1775 season (see below). There can be little doubt that centuries had been scored before this but the records are either lost or the known details are incomplete. Some of the main instances of high scoring prior to 1772 are as follows:\nThe following individual scores in first-class matches from 1772 are progressively the highest \"definitely\" recorded on contemporary scorecards:\nWard's record survived for 56 years until W. G. Grace scored the first triple-century in first-class cricket in 1876. The table below shows the progressive world record from 1876.\nMost runs in a career.\nQualification: 40,000.\nHighest career average.\nQualification: 20,000 runs, average 54.\nThe highest first-class batting career average of all is 207.00, by Norman Callaway, who aged 18 scored 207 in his only first-class innings on his début for New South Wales against Queensland in 1914–15. He died during the Second Battle of Bullecourt in 1917.\nHigh proportion of team's runs.\nIt is not unusual for a batsman to dominate the scoring while he is at the wicket; it is more unusual for a batsman to dominate his side's completed total if they are all out.\nThe lowest completed first-class innings to include a fifty is Indians' 66 against Yorkshire at Harrogate in 1932, to which Nazir Ali contributed 52 (78.79%) and his partners 9 (there were 5 extras).\nThe lowest completed first-class innings to include a century is Nottinghamshire's 143 against Hampshire at Bournemouth in 1981, to which Clive Rice contributed 105* (73.4%) and his partners 35 (there were 3 extras) and Gujranwala's 143 against Bahawalpur at Bahawalpur in 2001–02, to which Rizwan Malik contributed 100* (69.93%) and his partners 41 (there were 2 extras).\nThe lowest completed first-class innings to include a double-century is Namibia's 282 against Kenya at Sharjah in January 2008, to which Gerrie Snyman contributed 230 (81.56%) and his partners 43 (there were 9 extras).\nThe lowest completed first-class innings to include a triple century is the Rest's 387 against Hindus at Bombay in 1943–44, to which Vijay Hazare contributed 309 (79.84%) and his partners 59 (there were 19 extras).\nThe lowest completed first-class total to include a score of 350 is Otago's 500 against Canterbury at Christchurch in 1952–53, to which opener Bert Sutcliffe contributed 385 (77.0%) and his partners 86 (there were 29 extras).\nThe highest percentage of runs scored in any completed innings is 83.43% by Glenn Turner who scored 141* out of Worcestershire's 169 against Glamorgan at Swansea in 1977. The remaining batsmen scored 27 and there was one extra.\nIn the 2007 English cricket season, Mark Ramprakash scored a record 30.02% of Surrey's runs excluding extras. In 16 matches he scored 2,026 runs at an average of 101.30, while his team mates managed 4,721 between them at an average of 26.08.\nConversely, the \"highest\" completed first-class innings \"not\" to include an individual century is 671 for nine declared by Surrey against Kent at Beckenham in 2022. Seven batters passed 50, and the top score was Ollie Pope's 96.\nMost boundaries in an innings.\nQualification: 55 boundaries.\nMost triple-centuries.\nQualification: 3. Includes all scores of 300 or more. Entries in bold are for batsmen still playing first-class cricket.\nMost double-centuries.\nQualification: 15. Includes all scores of 200 or more.\nEntry in bold denotes player still playing first-class cricket.\nMost centuries.\nQualification: 115.\nIneffective batsmen.\nMany cricketers with short first-class careers fail to ever score a run, and finish with a batting average of 0.00. Seymour Clark (a wicket-keeper for Somerset in the 1930 season) is believed to hold the record for most innings in a scoreless career with nine innings in his five matches, including seven ducks. The record for most matches in a career without ever scoring is believed to belong to John Howarth (a Nottinghamshire fast-medium bowler in the 1960s), whose thirteen matches included seven innings and four ducks.\nThe longest sequence of consecutive scoreless innings is 12 by Mark Robinson for Northamptonshire in 1990, whose scores that season were 1*, 0*, 1, 0, 0*, 0*, 0*, 0*, 0*, 0, 0, 0, 0*, 0*, 0 and 1*.\nThe most consecutive single-figure innings by a batsman is 71, which has occurred twice. The first occurrence was by Jem Shaw who played chiefly for Nottinghamshire and the All England Eleven between his first-class debut on 26 June 1865 against Surrey with a score of 9, which he did not surpass until scoring 15 in the second innings of his last match of 1870 for “Richard Daft’s XI” against the United North of England Eleven. This was equalled by Eric Hollies of Warwickshire and England between 20 July 1948, when he made 12 not out against Glamorgan, and 16 August 1950, when he made 14 against Nottinghamshire. Hollies also holds the record for most consecutive innings without reaching 20, playing a total of 284 innings between 23 August 1939 when he made 22 against Gloucestershire and 19 May 1954, when he almost doubled his previous highest first-class score in making 47 against Sussex. Billy Bestwick of Derbyshire did not reach 20 in his last 258 first-class innings after making 20 against Warwickshire on 9 August 1906.\nThe lowest career batting average by a player with more than fifty first-class matches is almost certainly 2.63 by Francis McHugh of Yorkshire (three matches) and Gloucestershire (92 matches) between 1949 and 1956. McHugh batted in 111 innings for only 179 runs, with only four double figure scores. No other regular first-class cricketer is known to have had a batting average of under 3.00.\nIndividual records (bowling).\nMost wickets in a career.\nQualification: 2,400.\nMost wickets in a season.\nQualification: 275 wickets.\nBest figures in an innings.\nThe most wickets possible in an eleven-a-side innings is ten, and this has been achieved on a number of occasions. The first to do so was Edmund Hinkly in 1848 for Kent v England at Lord's. Perhaps the most famous early instance was two years later, when John Wisden, playing for the North of England v South of England at Lord's in 1850, clean bowled all ten South batsmen. In these early matches, the number of runs scored off each bowler was not recorded. The only other all-ten analysis not to contain any direct assistance from a fielder was by Eric Hollies, who got seven Nottinghamshire batsman out clean bowled and three leg before wicket in his ten for 49 for Warwickshire v Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1946.\nThe cheapest all-ten (and therefore the best innings bowling analysis in first-class cricket) was achieved by Hedley Verity in 1932 at Headingley, when he took ten for 10 for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. The most expensive all-ten recorded was ten for 175 by Eddie Hemmings playing for a touring International XI against a West Indies XI at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica in 1982.\nThe only bowlers to take all ten wickets in an innings more than once were Tich Freeman (three times in 1929, 1930 and 1931), John Wisden (twice, in 1850 and 1851), Vyell Walker (1859 and 1865), Hedley Verity (twice, 1931 and 1932), and Jim Laker (twice, both against the 1956 Australians). W. G. Grace also achieved a ten-for analysis twice, in 1873 and 1886; on the first occasion, he also scored a century, but the second occasion was in a twelve-a-side match.\nBest figures in a match.\nThe most wickets ever taken in a first-class match is nineteen, by Jim Laker for England against Australia at Old Trafford, Manchester in 1956, in the fourth Test match of that year's Ashes series. His figures were nine for 37 in Australia's first innings, and ten for 53 in their second.\nLaker's feat has never been paralleled in first-class cricket. Eighteen wickets in a match was achieved by William Lillywhite for eleven Players against sixteen Gentlemen at Lord's in 1837, and by Henry Arkwright for MCC against Kent in a 12-a-side match at Canterbury in 1861, but seventeen is the most otherwise recorded in an eleven-a-side match. Apart from Laker's, there have only been two instances of seventeen wickets in a match since World War II, by John Davison for Canada against United States of America in an ICC Intercontinental Cup match in 2004, and Kyle Abbott for Hampshire against Somerset in the First Division of the County Championship in 2019.\nFive wickets in an innings.\nIndividual bowlers take great credit if they can capture five or more wickets in an innings. The earliest known instance of this was by William Bullen, who bowled five batsmen out when playing for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine in 1774. Scorecards were still uncommon at the time and bowling analyses were incomplete; bowlers were only credited with \"bowled\" victims, catches being awarded to the fielder only.\nTich Freeman took five wickets in an innings a record 386 times. Wilfred Rhodes achieved it 287 times.\nTen wickets in a match.\nIt is a notable achievement for a bowler to capture 10 wickets in a match, and the feat is usually highlighted in career statistics. The earliest known instance was by Thomas Brett of Hampshire against Surrey at Laleham Burway in 1775. Brett's victims were \"all bowled\" as he was not credited with wickets falling to catches. He took seven in the first innings and four in the second (but Surrey still won by 69 runs).\nTich Freeman took ten wickets in a match a record 140 times. Charlie Parker achieved it 91 times.\nHat-tricks.\nA hat-trick is when a bowler takes three wickets from three consecutive deliveries. Doug Wright achieved the most hat-tricks in first-class cricket with seven. Tom Goddard and Charlie Parker each took six. In 2019–20, Ravi Yadav uniquely took a hat-trick in his first over on first-class debut, for Madhya Pradesh against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy.\nIn 1907, Albert Trott of Middlesex took four wickets in four balls, and another hat-trick, in the same Somerset innings. In 1963–64, Joginder Rao playing for Services took two hat-tricks in the same Northern Punjab innings during his second first-class match, after having also taken a hat-trick in his début match. Other instances of two hat-tricks in a match have been achieved by Alfred Shaw (in 1884), Jimmy Matthews (1912 in a Test match), Charlie Parker (1924), Roly Jenkins (1949), Amin Lakhani (1978–79), and Mitchell Starc (2017-18).\nFour wickets in four balls is a rarer achievement, first done by Joseph Wells (father of science fiction author H. G. Wells) for Kent against Sussex in 1862. Alan Walker, for Nottinghamshire in 1956, uniquely took the last wicket of Leicestershire's first innings, and a hat-trick with the first three balls of their second innings. Bob Crisp is the only player to take four wickets in four balls on two occasions.\nFive wickets in five balls has never been achieved - one of the closest instances coming in 1925, when CWL Parker struck the stumps with five successive deliveries for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire. The second, however, was called a no-ball, so only four wickets were actually taken, including the hat-trick from the 3rd to 5th deliveries. Five wickets in six balls has been achieved five times, by Bill Copson for Derbyshire against Warwickshire in 1937, by William Henderson for North East Transvaal against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein in 1937–38, by Pat Pocock for Surrey against Sussex at Eastbourne in 1972, by Yasir Arafat for Rawalpindi against Faisalabad at Rawalpindi in 2004–05, and by Neil Wagner for Otago against Wellington in 2010–11.

        "title": "Coxswain (rowing)",
        "text": "In a rowing crew, the coxswain ( ; colloquially known as the cox or coxie) is the member who does not row but steers the boat and faces forward, towards the bow. The coxswain is responsible for steering the boat and coordinating the power and rhythm of the rowers. In some capacities, the coxswain is responsible for implementing the training regimen or race plan. Most coaches cannot communicate to boat/coxswain, so the coxswain is the \"coach\" in the boat. A coxswain is necessary in the first place because the rowers sit with their backs to the direction of travel.\nIn most racing, coxswains may be of either sex regardless of that of the rowers, and in fact are very often women, as the desired weight of a cox is generally as close to 125 lbs (USRowing) / 55 kg (World Rowing Federation) as possible; far more females than males fulfill that qualification (see Sex, and Weight, below).\nRole.\nThe role of a coxswain in a crew is to:\nThe coxswain is in charge of the shell. They are responsible for crew safety, which must be the prime concern. Along with steering, their role is to coach the crew. The cox acts as the coach's assistant, but in the absence of a coach, as is the case in a race, the cox becomes the coach. Being in the boat, the cox has a feel for what the crew need and a good view of technical errors. The cox needs to translate the coach's concerns into practical calls. The cox must be able to diagnose problems such as balance and coach the crew into appropriate corrective action. At the start of an outing the cox must be able to take the crew through a technical and physical warm-up so that the coach is presented with a crew which is able to start the training program and has recapped any points that the coach has been emphasising in previous outings. It is essential that the coach and the cox work in good harmony and show respect to each other all the time. It is also essential that the cox is briefed on what the coach wants to achieve in the outing from the point of view of building physical fitness, technical skill, and team spirit. A cox must be positive, a good motivator and very encouraging. While errors must be spotted and corrected, it is also important to catch someone getting it right where they have been struggling.\nSteering the vessel.\nRowing boats are designed for speed, not maneuverability, so steering requires extra effort. Coxswains may steer with either the tiller (a cable connected to the rudder), commands for increased \"pressure\" or strength from rowers on one side of the boat, or both, depending on what is necessary in the situation. In the most extreme cases, the coxswain may go \"full tiller\", turning the rudder to its maximum angle, and may enlist the rowers to help the boat turn faster. This technique is usually reserved for only the sharpest turns, as the sharp angle of the rudder increases drag and upsets the balance of the boat. For more conventional turns, the coxswain may move the tiller slightly to one side or the other over the course of a few strokes. To minimize disturbance of the boat's stability, the motion of the tiller must be smooth and not sudden. The coxswain may also initiate the turn during the drive phase of the stroke, when the propulsive force of the oar blades in the water helps stabilize the boat. For very small steering adjustments, the coxswain may move the tiller very subtly during the recovery phase of a single stroke. This technique is most effective at higher speeds and on straight courses, and must be used sparingly as motion of the tiller during the recovery can easily disturb the boat's balance.\nSome coxswains advocate that the rudder should be applied \"only\" during the drive phase (and centered during the recovery phase), citing the fact that the boat is most stable when the oars are in the water and least stable when the oars are out of the water. The technique that often accompanies this view involves repeatedly moving the rudder back and forth over several strokes, making sure that the rudder is centered before every recovery. However, the rudder has much less steering power during the drive phase because of the very large forward propulsion force it must overcome. As a result, this technique often causes more boat drag due to longer rudder use, and the back-and-forth motion of the rudder tends to rock the boat.\nThe cox will also need to take into account the stream and the wind as well as the river. As a general rule, still waters do \"not\" run deep: rather the stream is strongest where the river is deepest. This explains why in The Boat Race coxes tend to steer in the centre of the river.\nCoxless boats.\nA boat without a cox is known as a coxless or \"straight\" boat. Besides single and double sculls, straight pairs and fours are the most common coxless boats. Because of their speed and lack of maneuverability, eights without a cox are very rare and dangerous.\nSex.\nCoxswains may be of either sex, regardless of the sex of the rowers, under the rules of the World Rowing Federation, USRowing British Rowing Henley Royal Regatta, Rowing Australia, and Rowing Canada.\nBefore 2017, the World Rowing Federation (then called \"FISA\") rules stated that coxswains must be the same sex as the rest of the crew. In 2017, the Federation voted overwhelmingly to change the rule so that the coxswain may now be of any sex under World Rowing rules. All rule changes applied immediately. New Zealand male cox Sam Bosworth was assigned the New Zealand women's eight in March 2017, and when they won the June 2017 World Rowing Cup II in Poznań, Poland, he was the first male cox to win an international women's rowing event.\nWeight.\nIt is advantageous for the cox to be light – as there is less weight for the crew to move. However, weight is generally considered of minor importance compared to steering, coaching, and motivational ability.\nAn Oxford University physics lecturer estimated that an additional of deadweight in an eight causes a 0.2% loss in speed, which would equate to 0.6 seconds for a six-minute race, or , approximately one fifth of a boat length.\nThe World Rowing Federation minimum weight for coxswains is 55 kilograms (121.25 pounds) in racing uniform. If a cox is underweight they are required to make up the weight with a deadweight up to a maximum of 15 kg, and the deadweight must be carried as close as possible to the cox (usually a sandbag). Articles of racing equipment (e.g. cox boxes, water bottles) cannot be considered as part of the deadweight. Similar deadweight rules are used in the United States.\nCox box.\nCoxes in all boats can use a cox box, most models of which show the rate in strokes per minute of the person sitting in the stroke seat (the seat at the rear of the boat, from whom the rate of strokes per minute and timing is taken).\nAdditional features include:\nHowever the primary function of a cox box is to amplify the coxswain's voice, using a microphone connected to loudspeakers in the boat. This means that the cox needs only to speak for all rowers to hear their voice.\nFor an eight-man crew three or four speakers are set down the length of the boat; for a four-man crew two speakers are used. Pairs may not have speakers if coxed from the stern but will have one if coxed from the bow (in front of the rowers).\nHistorically the cox would have carried (or strapped to their head) a conical, unpowered megaphone to amplify their voice."

        "title": "Rugby union in Argentina",
        "text": " \nRugby union in Argentina is a hugely popular team sport. The first rugby match played in the country dates back to 1873, as the game was introduced by the British. The Argentina national team, sometimes referred to as the Pumas, have competed at the Rugby World Cup, and are considered a tier one nation by the sport's governing body, World Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nThe Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) was formed in 1899 as the \"River Plate Rugby Union\", 26 years after the first rugby match had been played. It was affiliated to the English Rugby Football Union until 1932.\nThe union is a member of World Rugby with two seats and three votes on that body's Executive Council. The UAR is one of the oldest rugby unions in the world. The union became a member of the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board and now as World Rugby, after being invited to the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987.\nPopularity.\nRugby enjoys widespread popularity in Argentina, most especially in the Greater Buenos Aires urban area, which boasts more than eighty rugby clubs, and Tucumán Province.\nWhile rugby in Argentina is still largely amateur, there are many professional players. Prior to the country's entry into Super Rugby in 2016, most national team members played professionally in Europe, mainly in England and France. Today, most members of the national team play on the country's Super Rugby side, the Jaguares and others play in either of the two teams now playing in the Super Rugby Americas championship.\nHistory.\nRugby union began to be played in Argentina in 1873, exclusively by the resident British people to begin with. The first rugby union match in Argentina was played that same year in the Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground, located in the Palermo neighbourhood, where the Galileo Galilei planetarium is located today. Both teams (called \"Bancos\" and \"Ciudad\" for the occasion) were formed by members of the BACC and they play a mix between association and rugby \"football\". Bancos field 11 players while Ciudad fielded 13. On 24 June 1873, another match was contested in Flores, Buenos Aires, between \"Inglaterra\" and \"El Mundo\". After three hours of play, the game ended in a scoreless tie.\nThe first rugby match under the laws of rugby union was played on 14 May 1874 between the Buenos Aires Football Club (formed in 1867 and regarded as the first club in Argentina to practise any form of \"football\"). Teams were unnamed and chronicles referred to them as \"team of Mr. Trench\" and \"team of Mr. Hogg\".\nAnother Buenos Aires F.C., formed in 1886 to play rugby exclusively and predecessor of current Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club, played its first match on 24 June v a team of Ferrocarril del Sud at the Flores Old Ground. It was won by the railway team by a goal, a try and 3 \"touch downs\" to one try.\nOn 29 June 1886, it is recorded that Buenos Aires F.C. and Rosario A.C. played the first inter-clubs match in Plaza Jewell, Rosario. The line-ups were: Rosario: C.E. Baines, W. Graham, A. Musgrove, A. Williamson, R.C. Baines (captain), A. Dickenson, Boland, Geary, E.D. Graham, Hall, Hanckel, Parry, Smyth, Topping, Towse. Buenos Aires: G.E. Gunson, F.J. Bennett, W.R. S. Baikie (captain), J.C. Hutchings, J. Nisbet, A. H. Scott, W.P. Drabble, J. Earnshaw, A. Lace, R. Barton, J. Paterson, A. Hughes, J.P. Simpson, R.W. Anderson, W.H. Stuart. The match was won by Rosario by 3-0 with a try scored by A. Dickenson.\nIt is believed that Lomas A.C. and Flores A.C. were the following clubs to form their own rugby teams, while Quilmes A.C. formed its squad in early 1900s.\nEarly rugby was not immune to political problems either. An 1890 game in Buenos Aires resulted in both teams, and all 2,500 spectators being arrested. National president Juárez Celman was particularly paranoid after the Revolution of the Park in the city earlier in the year, and the police had suspected that the match was in fact a political meeting.\nIn 1899, four clubs from Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires, Belgrano, Flores and Lomas) and one from Rosario (Rosario A.C.) got together to form \"The River Plate Rugby Union\". That same year the Union organised the first club championship (currently Torneo de la URBA), which was won by Lomas.\nThis body, one of the oldest rugby unions in the world, later became known as the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR), which became a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) only after being invited to the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987.\nFrom the founding date until 1903, the only teams taking part in tournaments had been founded by English natives or their descendants. Only they knew the rules of the game and their families were from the high society. It was only in 1904 when the first team formed by \"criollos\" made its appearance, named \"Centro de Estudiantes de la Facultad de Ingeniería\". Some players of that team were the Newbery Brothers, Martín Miguens, Alberto Lagos, Luis Duhau, Mariano Paunero and Germán Dates.\nAlthough rugby went professional in the mid-1990s, the domestic competition in Argentina has largely remained amateur. That has ensured large numbers of Argentines playing overseas, particularly in European competitions, though these players are still eligible for the national team, and make up a large amount of the side.\nIt was originally dominated by the British community in Argentina, but unlike certain other regions, it became successfully transplanted to the local population. For example, in its early days the River Plate Rugby Union (the ancestor of today's national organisation), had a membership whose surnames portrayed their English and Scottish origins - such as Anderson, Baikie, Bellamy, Brodie, Corry-Smith, Elliot, Jacobs, Leicht, Taylor, Thurn.\nAway from Buenos Aires, where the game's background is traditionally somewhat refined, Tucuman is a heartland for the sport, where supporters are passionate, and often burn the opposition's flag on the terraces. This is a region which has provided Argentina with some of its toughest forwards.\nOne of Argentina's main problems has been its geographical isolation, and despite Chile, Uruguay and to a much lesser extent, Brazil playing the game, Argentina towers above them, and has not had a reasonable match on the continent. Its first contact with a team outside the continent was in 1910, when the British and Irish Lions led by J. Raphael toured Argentina, winning all six matches, scoring 213 points, and conceding a mere 31. The British Lions returned to Argentina in 1927, that time led by David MacMyn, playing 9 matches, 4 of them against the Argentina national team. Other rivals of the Lions during the tour included CA San Isidro, Buenos Aires FC, and Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires. The Lions would make a third tour on Argentina in 1936, playing 10 matches.\nOther team that toured on Argentina were the Junior Springboks in 1932, that won all eight matches played.\nDuring the post-War period, the French national team toured Argentina in 1954 playing several matches v. local clubs and combined teams and even the Argentine side. A total of 14 matches were played by France in the country, winning all of them.\nThe national team also turned its sights overseas, touring South Africa in 1965, and despite faring badly there, they made contact with Izak van Heerden, the Natal coaching genius who would revolutionise Argentine rugby in the late 1960s. Van Heerden's coaching was not the only turnaround in Argentina's fortunes at this time, it also saw the emergence of Hugo Porta, who is arguably the greatest Argentine player of all time, and some outstanding packs.\nIn the 1970s, major Argentine rugby clubs included Rosario A.C., Buenos Aires, Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires and both teams from San Isidro, C.A. San Isidro (\"CASI\"), and San Isidro Club (mostly known for their acronyms, \"CASI\" and \"SIC\" respectively).\nArgentina has long been seen as the biggest power outside the Six Nations and the Tri Nations; between 1981-90 in four tests, England won only two out of four, and Scotland lost both tests on their 1994 tour.\nCompetitions.\nClub rugby.\nArgentina is divided into 24 provincial unions which all organise their own provincial club competitions. Since the 1990s, some provincial unions have started organising regional club competitions with neighbouring unions in order to raise the standards of rugby and make their clubs more competitive. An example of this is the Torneo del Litoral, which is organised by the unions of Rosario, Santa Fe and Entre Ríos.\nHistorically, club rugby in Argentina has been dominated by clubs from the powerful Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires (URBA) and the URBA championship was seen as the strongest club competition in the country. In recent years however, clubs from outside Buenos Aires have closed the gap with URBA clubs. To reflect this the Nacional de Clubes was created in 1993. Originally the competition involved 16 clubs from all over the country but the formula was modified in 2009.\nThat year a new competition was created, the Torneo del Interior. This competition involves the best ranked clubs from all regional tournaments outside of Buenos Aires. With the creation of this tournament, the Nacional de Clubes was overhauled. From 2009 on, only 4 clubs qualify for the Nacional - instead of 16 - and the competitions starts directly at the semi-finals stage. The 4 clubs qualifying for the Nacional's semi-finals are the two finalists of both the Interior and URBA tournaments, with the URBA winner meeting the Interior runner-up and vice versa. The first winner of the new and improved Nacional de Clubes was Rosario's Duendes Rugby Club, who beat Buenos Aires' Hindú Club in the final.\nRepresentative rugby.\nThe Campeonato Argentino is contested by representative teams of the 24 unions that exist within the UAR. It is divided into two competitions, the 8-team Zona Campeonato and the 16-team Zona Ascenso. The winner of the Zona Ascenso earns a place in the following years' Zona Campeonato, replacing the last-placed team of the latter competition.\nInternational rugby.\nArgentina had often been linked with joining Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in the Super Rugby Union, possibly as two provinces. Following the hosting of the 2011 Rugby World Cup to New Zealand, who Argentina voted for, rugby figures within Argentina claimed that New Zealand could be helping out the country more, rather than just giving them an All Blacks test (which was actually arranged prior to the 2011 result). Some Argentines were under the impression that New Zealand should be helping them gain entry into Southern Hemisphere competitions, ala Super 14 and the Tri Nations Series. Allegedly, the New Zealand Rugby Union pointed to them not having \"box office appeal\" for their current non-involvement in the competitions. NZRU chief executive Chris Moller, saying that there was no agreement between the nations, did however offer the UAR advice on how to improve its domestic competition and agreed to see All Black camp specialists to provide coaching in Buenos Aires when the All Blacks played the Pumas in June 2006.\nIn the wake of Argentina's series win over in the 2006 mid-year Tests, and realising that the Tri Nations would apparently be a closed shop until at least 2009, \"Pumas\" captain Agustín Pichot publicly urged that Argentina be added to Europe's Six Nations Championship. In an interview with the \"Western Mail\" of Cardiff, he pointed out that all of the starting 15 that defeated Wales would play the 2006-07 season in Europe. Pichot added,\n\"The Sunday Times\" of London reported in February 2007 that the IRB was brokering a deal with SANZAR, the body that organises the Tri Nations, to admit \"Los Pumas\" to the competition as early as 2008. The story noted that logistical issues, specifically the distance between Argentina and Europe plus fixture congestion in Northern Hemisphere rugby, caused the Six Nations to balk at admitting Argentina. The IRB was apparently convinced that the Tri Nations was the proper place for a Southern Hemisphere team, and reportedly found South Africa strongly supporting the move and Australia not opposed. \"The Sunday Times\" indicated that the biggest stumbling block could be the UAR itself, \"some of whose members are deeply attached to amateurism.\" Eventually, the IRB admitted its attempt to get the Pumas into a major competition would be unsuccessful until at least 2010, when the key media contract between SANZAR and News Corporation expires. An IRB spokesman cited fixture congestion in the Southern Hemisphere and the lack of a professional structure in Argentina as additional reasons for the demise of a potential deal.\nIn November 2007, in the wake of the \"Pumas\"' third-place finish in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the team's future status was a key topic of discussion at an IRB conference on the future worldwide growth of the sport. The decisions made at the conference regarding \"Los Pumas\" were:\nHowever, NZRU deputy chief executive Steve Tew subsequently expressed doubts that a professional domestic competition in Argentina would be sufficiently viable within the following 10 years to retain elite players in South America, despite all the good intentions and funding of the IRB. In December 2007 the 23 provincial delegates at an Extraordinary Meeting of the UAR voted unanimously to keep their domestic league amateur, although the Pumas selection pool would be centrally contracted as professionals to the UAR. This decision was almost instantly assailed by Pichot, who told \"The Daily Telegraph\" of London,\nThe UAR, with considerable assistance from the IRB, continued to work towards building a professional structure in the country. Pichot, formerly critical of the UAR, accepted an invitation to join a \"High Performance Board\" to help the country achieve its ultimate goal of a place in a major international tournament. In September 2009, SANZAR announced that it had issued a provisional invitation to Argentina to join an expanded \"Four Nations\" tournament starting in 2012. The main condition for Argentine participation is that the UAR can ensure the availability of its top players for the Four Nations; the deal is also dependent on approval from broadcasters and financial considerations. Tew, skeptical of Argentina's ability to develop a professional structure only two years earlier, was impressed with the country's progress in 2009, stating \"They have made a huge amount of progress in the past six months ... not long ago they were facing bankruptcy and they have come a long way.\"\nArgentina's increasing engagement with the Tri Nations was further cemented in December 2009, when the South African Rugby Union announced that an Argentine team would join the national developmental competition, the Vodacom Cup, starting in 2010. The team, known as Pampas XV, was initially expected to be based in Stellenbosch in the Western Cape, but ultimately found a home in Potchefstroom. Pampas XV won the competition in its second season of 2011.\nAlso in 2011, the IRB also helped to accommodate Argentina's Four Nations entry by making a major change to its Regulation 9, which governs the release of players for international duty. Before the change, Argentina internationals only had to be released for the June and November Tests, as the Pumas were not in a major hemispheric competition. The new Regulation 9 introduces a new release period, from late August to early October, for all four major Southern Hemisphere powers. SANZAR chief Greg Peters noted at the time that this change would make Argentine internationals less attractive to Northern Hemisphere clubs.\nOn 14 September 2009, Argentina was formally admitted into the Tri-Nations competition (which will henceforth be renamed The Rugby Championship) from 2012 onwards.\nNational team.\nThe national team are nicknamed Los Pumas and wear blue and white jerseys. They are considered a top tier nation by World Rugby, and have competed in the Rugby Championship since 2012.\nArgentina played their first international on June 12, 1910, against a touring British Isles, losing 28 points to three. Argentina also competed at the first ever Rugby World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand in 1987. Grouped with the All Blacks, Fiji and Italy, Argentina won their game against the Italians, but finished at the bottom of their pool on points difference. Subsequent World Cups saw similar results, in the 1999 tournament however, Argentina finished second in their pool and made it to the quarter-finals. Argentine Gonzalo Quesada was also the top scorer of the tournament. The 2003 Rugby World Cup saw them finish third in pool A. The Nations Cup is a tournament involving the country's \"A\" national side, now branded as Argentina XV, and was first held in 2006.\nIn recent years Argentina have proven themselves capable of scaring and more than occasionally defeating traditional rugby giants. As of 2020, they have defeated every Tier 1 rugby nation. Argentina also drew with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2005 in Cardiff, notable as a 'moral victory' for the Pumas, who were missing over two dozen players and had to resort to dragging players out of retirement to play. Heading into the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Argentina's most recent Six Nations scalps were a pair of wins over an experimental Ireland side and one over Italy in 2007. In the World Cup itself, Argentina beat the host nation, France, in the opening game and Ireland in a later pool match. The Pumas went on to defeat Scotland in the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions South Africa in the semifinals. They met France again in the bronze final and won again, this time by a convincing 34-10 margin. Out of the last 10 matches between Argentina and France—four at José Amalfitani Stadium and six in France—Argentina have seven wins, with their three losses by a combined total of 13 points. Today (November 2020) Argentina is ranked eighth in the World Rugby Rankings.\nPlayers.\nProbably the best known players are: \nRugby sevens national team.\nThe Argentina national rugby sevens team plays in the IRB Sevens World Series. Argentina is scheduled to host an annual tournament in that competition beginning with the 2013-2014 season.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Argentina's women's team are in their infancy and have not yet played a test match, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004. (Current playing record).\nMedia coverage.\nESPN Latin America show all of the national team's internationals as well as games from the domestic league. A magazine show is also broadcast on the channel. Additionally many international rugby union competitions and internationals are broadcast by Fox Sports en Latinoamérica, for example, the Super Rugby competition between provincial sides from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as South Africa's domestic competition, the Currie Cup, and New Zealand's ITM Cup. Fox also broadcasts numerous internationals, such as the Tri Nations Series, as well as other tests and tours.\nSocial attitudes and controversy.\nIn recent years, rugby culture in Argentina has become increasingly associated to violent acts, as well as racist, sexist and homophobic attitudes. Prominent cases such as the murder of Ariel Malvino in 2006, and most recently the murder of Fernando Báez Sosa in 2020—all perpetrated by rugby players amateur—have been highlighted by Argentine media as examples of the \"violent\" nature of the country's rugby culture. Following Báez Sosa's murder, former national rugby team captain Agustín Pichot stated that rugby culture had \"naturalized violence\".\nArgentine stadiums used for rugby union.\nThe list contains Argentine stadiums used for rugby union with a capacity of 10,000 or higher."

Midway through the 2006 season, he was loaned to the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and was released from his contract at the Huddersfield Giants at the end of the season. He announced his retirement from the game on 8 November 2010 after failing to recover from a groin injury.\nBackground.\nEvans was born in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.\nAustralia.\nEvans started playing for the Canberra Raiders in 2001. He was injured in season 2002 against Parramatta after a strong start to the season. Evans collided with the goal post when scoring a try and required a complete knee reconstruction of all three ligaments of the knee, seeing him miss 12 months of football.\nHe was offered an opportunity to play with Huddersfield in the Super League where he played for three seasons. He was then loaned out after rumours of a rift with head coach Jon Sharp. Huddersfield's loss was Wakefields Trinity's gain as Evans secured top flight success with two tries in the Scratch night relegation battle against Castleford.\nEvans was then courted by the Bradford Bulls for season 2007 where he was an instant hit scoring 15 tries in 23 games.\nBradford Bulls.\nEvans signed for Bradford for the 2007 season, and was an ever-present in the centres scoring 15 tries in 23 games. It was announced in September 2008 that Evans would leave the Bulls at the end of 2008 to join Castleford due to salary cap restrictions."

        "title": "2006 FIFA World Cup Group A",
        "text": "Group A of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was one of eight groups in the opening round of the tournament. The group featured four teams, competition hosts Germany, Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador. Play began on 9 June with the first game of the tournament between Germany and Costa Rica, with the former attaining a 4–2 victory in the highest scoring opening game in World Cup history since the competition introduced a single game opener. Later the same day, Poland and Ecuador faced each other, with Ecuador winning 2–0. On 14 June, Germany secured their second victory of the competition, defeating Poland 1–0 following Oliver Neuville's injury time goal. The following day, Ecuador defeated Costa Rica 3–0 to guarantee both they and Germany would advance to the round of 16.\nThe final set of matches was played on 20 June 2006. Germany and Ecuador contested the top place in the group, with the hosts winning 3–0. With both sides already eliminated, Poland defeated Costa Rica 2–1 to claim their only victory of the competition. Ecuador were eliminated in the following round by England while Germany reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual winners Italy. Germany finished third after beating Portugal in the third place playoff match.\nBackground.\nGroup A was the first of eight groups to start play at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The competition consisted of 32 competitors, split into eight groups of four teams. The sides would play each other on a round-robin basis with the top two teams in each group advancing to the round of 16.\nAs hosts, three-time World Cup winners Germany qualified automatically for the tournament and were placed into Group A. Manager Jürgen Klinsmann had been appointed in 2004, but due to qualifying as hosts, had yet to take charge of his side in a competitive fixture. His team were considered one of the favourites to win the competition with bookmakers offering odds of around 13/2, but had received criticism in the country, notably from Bayern Munich general manager Uli Hoeneß who had labelled the side \"a disaster\". CONCACAF members Costa Rica endured a poor start to qualifying, narrowly avoiding an upset defeat against Cuba in the second qualifying round, before appointing Alexandre Guimarães as manager midway through the stage. They qualified for the tournament after finishing third in their qualification round, reaching the finals for the third time in their history. However, they were classed as rank outsiders to win the competition, with odds as high as 500/1 being offered.\nTo provide an even number of teams for the playoff bracket, the two teams from the UEFA qualification groups who had finished second in their group with the best record automatically gained qualification to the World Cup. Poland, who finished second in UEFA qualification Group 6 behind England, were one of the teams who were eligible, along with Sweden. Ecuador qualified after finishing in the third of four automatic qualification places in the CONMEBOL qualifying group behind Brazil and Argentina, reaching the finals for only the second time. Similar to Costa Rica, Ecuador were given low odds of around 400/1. In their preview of the tournament, \"The Guardian\" labelled Group A as the \"weakest\" in the competition.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times local (CEST/UTC+2)\"\nGermany vs Costa Rica.\nThe opening match of Group A, and the World Cup, was between hosts Germany and Costa Rica. This was the first time the two sides had ever played each other in international football. Germany captain Michael Ballack was forced to withdraw from the starting line-up after failing to overcome an injury and was replaced by Tim Borowski. Defender Philipp Lahm gave Germany the lead after six minutes with a 30-yard curling shot from outside the penalty area that beat opposition goalkeeper José Porras and was described as \"unstoppable\" by the BBC. In doing so, Lahm became the fourth German player to have opened the scoring at a World Cup. Germany had further long range efforts soon after, before Costa Rica's Paulo Wanchope, already his country's record goalscorer, equalised after 12 minutes after breaching the German defence and finishing past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Wanchope's goal saw him become the first Costa Rican player to have scored in more than one World Cup and the second to have scored more than one World Cup goal after Rónald Gómez four years earlier.\nGermany regained their lead five minutes later when Miroslav Klose finished from Bernd Schneider's cross. Costa Rica's Danny Fonseca became the first player to be booked in the competition after 30 minutes and the midfielder missed a chance to equalise shortly after half-time, heading wide despite being unmarked. Klose netted his second goal just after the hour-mark, putting in the rebound after his own header was parried by Porras. However, after 12 minutes Costa Rica again cut the deficit with Wanchope again scoring past Lehmann with a composed finish after receiving a cross from Walter Centeno, although the German players believed Wanchope was offside. The Germans sealed victory three minutes from time with Torsten Frings firing in a long-range shot that beat Porras in similar fashion to Lahm's goal. The six goals scored during the match made it the highest-scoring opening game in World Cup history since the tournament began using the single opening match format.\nPoland vs Ecuador.\nPoland and Ecuador had previously met once before their opening World Cup match, playing out a 1–1 draw during a friendly in November 2005. The Poles pressed the attack for the opening 20 minutes of the match, but were unable to create any significant chances. 24 minutes in, Ecuador took the lead when Carlos Tenorio got ahead of Marcin Baszczyński to head in after teammate Agustín Delgado had nodded the ball towards him from a long throw. Tenorio became only the third player to have scored a World Cup goal for Ecuador after Delgado and Édison Méndez. Buoyed by their goal, Ecuador took control of the game and had several chances before the end of the first half but failed to convert. However, Poland had struggled to make an impression and Jon Brodkin of \"The Guardian\" noted that they had \"forced not a single meaningful save\" from the opposition goalkeeper. \nIn the second half, Poland began pushing forward with Mirosław Szymkowiak creating several near chances, the best of which sent Jacek Krzynówek through before being called offside. In the final third of the game, Poland were denied by the woodwork twice; first when Ireneusz Jeleń struck the crossbar with a shot and later when Paweł Brożek hit the post. Despite their attacking threat, it was Ecuador who were able to score when Iván Kaviedes broke through before laying the ball off for Delgado to give his side a 2–0 lead. Delgado's goal made him his country's record World Cup goalscorer, which he would remain until being surpassed by Enner Valencia at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This match was the fifth consecutive time that Poland had failed to score in their opening match at a World Cup finals.\nGermany vs Poland.\nThis was the 15th international meeting between Germany and Poland since 1933 and their third in World Cup competition, having previously met at both the 1974 and 1978 World Cup finals, with Germany having never lost to their opponents. The Germans, with captain Ballack restored to the starting line-up in place of Borowski, dominated play and had a number of chances in the first half, with both Klose and his strike partner Lukas Podolski failing to convert more than one chance each. Poland's best chance came early on when Maciej Żurawski sent a scuffed shot towards Lehmann which was easily gathered.\nDuring the second half Poland threatened with Jelen testing Lehmann early and Poland offered more attacking threat in the opening period. Germany also continued to push forward and forced Poland goalkeeper Artur Boruc into several saves, while both Klose and Ballack were denied by the frame of the goal during the same attack. With 15 minutes remaining, Polish midfielder Radosław Sobolewski was sent off for a second bookable offence after fouling Klose. In the last seconds of injury time, German substitutes David Odonkor and Oliver Neuville combined, the latter converting a cross from his teammate to secure a 1–0 victory, the first time Germany had ever won a World Cup game through an injury time goal. The win marked the first time Germany had beaten another European nation at a major international competition since defeating the Czech Republic in the UEFA Euro 1996 final.\nEcuador vs Costa Rica.\nThis was the ninth meeting between Ecuador and Costa Rica, but the first in a competitive fixture. Costa Rica had not beaten their opponents since the first meeting between the two in 1992 and defeat would eliminate them from the finals. Ecuador manager Luis Fernando Suárez deliberately left his squad announcement until the latest time allowed, noting that he aimed to \"not give any clues to our rivals\". Costa Rica were forced to omit fullback Gilberto Martínez due to injury. His side started brightly but Tenorio gave Ecuador an early lead, heading in from Antonio Valencia's cross after eight minutes for his second goal of the tournament. Costa Rica struggled to threaten their opponent's goal, registering their first shot on target after 39 minutes as Ecuador controlled possession.\nNine minutes into the second half, Ecuador doubled their lead through Delgado's second goal of the competition. Receiving a pass from Kaviedes, Delgado chested the ball down before beating Porras at his near post. Spurred into action by the second goal, Costa Rica first forced a save from Cristian Mora before Alvaro Saborio hit the crossbar. However, Ecuador sealed victory when Kaviedes added a third goal with a volley in the 92nd minute. As a result of their victory, both Ecuador and Germany were guaranteed to advance while Poland and Costa Rica were eliminated. In only their second finals, Ecuador qualified from the group stage for the first time in their history and the result remains the nation's biggest victory at a World Cup finals.\nEcuador vs Germany.\nThis was the first time that Ecuador and Germany had ever played each other. Both teams had already qualified for the next round, with Ecuador ahead on goal difference ahead of the game. Germany fielded a full strength side, but were forced to deny the presence of a rift between strike partners Klose and Podolski after the former had criticised his teammate. Ecuador instead chose to rest several first team players, including forwards Delgado and Tenorio and captain Iván Hurtado. Klose gave Germany the lead after just four minutes, scoring from eight-yards after Bastian Schweinsteiger had capitalised on a failed clearance by the opposition defence to play in his teammate. His goal was the second fastest ever scored by a German player at a World Cup, coming one minute after Rüdiger Abramczik's record in 1978. Germany continued to press and had several chances, the best being Podolski racing through before being beaten to the ball by Mora. With the goalkeeper out of his penalty area, Ballack attempted to loop the ball over Mora from 40-yards but his attempt went wide of the goal. \nKlose added a second goal shortly before half-time; captain Ballack chipped the ball over the Ecuadorian defence, allowing Klose to round Mora in the opposition goal to score his fourth of the tournament. Early in the second half, Ecuador attempted to get back into the game, Edwin Tenorio forcing a save from Lehmann from 25-yards out. Podolski scored his first World Cup goal following a swift counterattack. Schweinsteiger's pass allowed Bernd Schneider to cross from which Podolski scored. With a three goal lead, Germany made several substitutions to rest key players and saw out the game to finish top of the group, the fifth consecutive time that they had done so at the World Cup finals.\nCosta Rica vs Poland.\nPoland and Costa Rica had previously met on two other occasions, both ending in victories for the Poles, but this was their first competitive fixture. With both teams already eliminated, their final match was a dead rubber played in high temperatures. Poland held the majority of possession early on but Costa Rica took the lead after 25 minutes, Gomez scoring via a direct free-kick which went through the defensive wall and the legs of Boruc who was unable to react. However, Poland equalised eight minutes later when Bartosz Bosacki scored his first international goal and his nation's first of the competition, volleying in off the crossbar from Żurawski's corner, the Poles' sixth of the game, after Porras had failed to gather the ball. Bosacki added a second in the 66th minute, again from a corner, this time with a powerful header. Wanchope had a late goal ruled out for offside as the match eventually finished 2–1 to Poland. Referee Shamsul Maidin gave out 10 yellow cards during the game, the fourth highest in World Cup history at the time.\nAftermath.\nGermany finished top of the group with nine points having won all three of their group matches. They faced Sweden, the runners-up of Group B, in the round of 16, winning 2–0. They went on to defeat Argentina in the quarter-finals on penalties before suffering defeat to Italy in the semi-finals. Germany finished third after defeating Portugal 3–1 in the third-place playoff. As runners-up in the group with six points, Ecuador faced the winners of Group B, England, in the next round but were eliminated after a 1–0 defeat. Poland would not return to the competition until the 2018 World Cup while Costa Rica failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup before returning for the 2014 tournament.\nKlose's four goals during the group stage contributed to him winning the Golden Boot as the competition's top goalscorer. He finished the World Cup with five in total, the lowest tally needed to win the award since 1962. His teammate Podolski went on to win the young player of the tournament award.\nReferences.\nBibliography"

        "title": "Turtling (sailing)",
        "text": "A boat is said to be turtling or to turn turtle when it is fully inverted. The name stems from the appearance of the upside-down boat, similar to the carapace (top shell) of a sea turtle. The term can be applied to any vessel; turning turtle is less frequent but more dangerous on ships than on smaller boats. It is rarer but more hazardous for multihulls than for monohulls, because multihulls are harder to flip in both directions. Measures can be taken to prevent a capsize (where the boat is knocked over on its beam-ends but not yet inverted) from becoming a turtle (with bottom up).\nDefinition and prevention.\nWhen a boat is \"turned over completely\" it has turned turtle. Some sources treat the term \"turtle\" as synonymous with \"capsize\" or \"keel over\". but most others make a distinction. Carrying too much sail or loss of control can lead to broachingthe boat heels too far to one side, or capsizes. While all turtlings involve a capsize, the converse is untrue. Prevention is the first priority. \nWith the exception of self-righting watercraft, vessels have an angle of vanishing stability (AVS). External forces aside, if they are tilted at an angle less than the AVS, they will pop back upright. If they are tilted at an angle greater than the AVS, they will turn turtle and stay there. In other words, non-self-righting vessels are stable when turtled. Their primary stability and secondary stability are greater than zero, tending to right them, but their tertiary or inverted stability is less than zero, and tends to keep them upside-down.\nCapsizing (but not necessarily turtling) is an inherent part of dinghy sailing, and is considered to be \"routine\". It is not a question of \"if\" but a question of \"when\".\nFor those who prefer to avoid the experience, a keelboat monohull has physics on its side. (See limit of positive stability.) But even yachts can capsize and turtle in extraordinary conditions, so design considerations and suitability for particular tasks, locations, weather, duration and situations are essential queries. \"Such events can overcome skill and experience\"; boats need to be appropriate for foreseeable conditions. It is a fundamental question of seaworthiness.\nTurtling commonly occurs when a boat capsizes and is not righted or attended to in time, allowing it to roll through the approximately 90 degrees of a capsize through to 180 degrees from upright.\nPrevention and delay of turtling in dinghies is the highest priorityturtling can be catastrophic in consequencesbut it depends on skill, ability and athleticism, which vary greatly. As John Rousmaniere wrote: Testing confirms the Royal Yachting Association's conclusion that \"a decisive way to address entrapment is to immediately right the boat by putting weight on the centerboard\", daggerboard, (or bilgeboard in a ). His 2012 report advises that \"US Sailing and other organizations should consider establishing this as doctrine.\" Thus, reliance on boat handling and seamanship may be misplaced.\nSealing masts and attaching flotation are effective preventatives for turtling of dinghies, but not widely utilized. More certain preventatives for this includes various forms of flotation added to the tip of the mast or top of the mainsail. These include floats (e.g., one that looks like a streamlined blimp used on Hobie 16s) or a \"sail patch\"a sleeve with built in flotation that fits over the top of the sail, available for example as option on the Wayfarer (dinghy) Mark IV. Another alternative is to seal the mast, thereby increasing its buoyancy.\nAs an emergency palliative, putting flotation (i.e., a spare life vest or other personal flotation device), onto the end of the mast straight away after a capsize and without delay, can forestall a turtle. Conversely, climbing onto the side of a knocked down boat can increase the likelihood of turtling, as it moves weight higher over the center of gravity, may also increase windage, and thus can effectively drive the mast downward.\nSeveral devices have been patented to prevent turtling. Capsizing is particularly troublesome for catamarans and trimarans, which are especially hard to right.\nThe use of a trapeze, harness, jackline or other tether can cause injury or death due to entrapment if a boat turtles.\nPractice and cure.\nRighting a turtled dinghy is one of the most difficult maneuvers. Recovery in a monohull requires releasing the main sheet and jib sheet, lowering the spinnaker if it is deployed, standing on the bottom of the boat and levering on the centerboard, or standing on the centerboard (there may be weight and placement restrictions). It is important that other members of the crew not be on top the boat, as this can drastically increase resistance to righting the craft. The use of \"righting ropes\" materially aids the process. Standing on the centerboard and \"piggybacking\" of crew members can be highly effective to right a turtled dinghy, as it increases both the weight and leverage being applied. Use of powerboats to aid is problematical, and depending on the technique usedthere are severalmay or may not succeed. See Capsize. Rigging righting lines depends upon proper placement, and critically should be done in advance of the need to use them.\nMultihulls.\nIn yacht sailing, multihulls are deemed to be more prone to turtling than keeled monohulls, and there is essentially no way to right them if they overturn. The juxtaposition of the hulls and sail when turtledit makes them inherently stable when invertedmakes them especially resistant to righting. Consequently, some larger multihulls are built with a turtle emergency escape hatch beneath the hull. Indeed, some locales require such safety hatches. There are, however, those who feel that the likelihood of a capsize of a large multihull is overrated. There are others who state that a self-righting multihull is the answer, along with designing in safety and proper operation. A patent has been issued specifically concerning righting of turtled large multihulls. It is intended to avoid the necessity to use divers and special equipment in a recovery.\nIt is, however, possible (and often successfully) to right a capsized small multihull, e.g., a Beachcat and Hobie 16. The process begins with positioning ropes so that the crew can get leverage (acting together is key). Righting Beach catamarans that are turtled can be extremely difficult. Loss of sails, rigging, masts and boats can occur, not to mention sailors. A singled-handed self-rescue can be assisted by filling a garbage bag (called in this context a \"righting bag\") with water, and throwing it over the rescuer's shoulder. See Hobie 16 which suggests sitting on the rear of one sponson, which will upturn a turtled Hobie.\nEven some large multihulls can be righted at seait is a long shotprovided that the skipper is well prepared, knows what they are doing, and has appropriate devices, tools, skills, a workable plan, cooperative waves, weather and wind, and some luck.\nNotable events.\nThe Fastnet race, and particularly the 1979 Fastnet race (the disastrous race that changed yacht racing for all time), has been the occasion for many sailboat capsizes, turtlings and fatalities. In the 1979 race, \"15 sailors died, five boats sank, and at least 75 boats flipped upside down.\" In any event, adopting heaving to as a storm tactic proved to be a good preventive of capsize during the race. Not one of the hove to yachts were capsized or suffered any serious damage. See also Capsize of Drum (1985) and Capsize of Rambler (2011), both of which involved large Maxi yachts that lost their keels.\nIn December 2008, the high speed experimental sailing hydrofoil trimaran Hydroptère set a world speed record, then pitchpoled while going over 60 knots. The turtled yacht had to be towed back to port for being turned right side up.\nIn the 2011 Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, the high performance monohull sportsyacht \"WingNuts\", a Kiwi 35, turtled in an extreme storm, killing the captain and one crew member. Later inquiry determined the boatspecifically its high performance extremely wide low displacement hullwas unfit for the location, weather, and the lengthy multiday race format, and urged race officials to change ratings and revoke privileges for similar boats to enter the race. The waves were not all that unusual, although the wind was. The boat may have buried one of its hiking wings into a wave, causing it to 'trip', and had the other lifted by the wind. It is rare but not unheard of for keelboats to turtle and remain upside down, particularly if its keel is intact. However, this boat's unique hull form, which made it very fast, also rendered it more stable upside down than right side up. This was a recipe for the disaster. This loss was occasioned despite a competent and experienced crew which was as well equipped and prepared as thought to be necessary. \"WingNuts\" met then current offshore stability standards, which failed to adequately take into account the dynamic effect of the \"radical\" winged hull.\nOn 13 June 2012, in the trials leading to the America's Cup, Oracle Team USA on an AC45 spectacularly capsized the boat, and it was righted with minimal damage (\"there's a little rip there\") ten minutes later. Skipper Russell Coutts dismissed it as \"a learning experience\". This was an epilogue to earlier similar incidents by other teams in Australia.\nOn 9 May 2013, the 2013 America's Cup challenger Artemis broke apart, broached, capsized, and turtled destroying its wing/sail and trapping two crew members under its hull. The AC72 wing-sail catamaran was sailed on behalf of the Royal Swedish Yacht Club, sponsoring Team Artemis. Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson, an Olympic-gold medal-winning British sailor, died as a result.\nLegal implications.\nCapsize and turtling can result in legal liability for damages due to negligence."

        "title": "Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)",
        "text": "\"Sailing\" is a song composed by Gavin Sutherland of the Sutherland Brothers in 1972, best known as a 1975 international hit for Rod Stewart.\nSutherland Brothers original recording.\n\"Sailing\" was written and recorded by the Sutherland Brothers – a duo consisting of Gavin and Iain Sutherland – in a June 1972 session. The brothers provided their own backing with Gavin on bass drum and Iain on harmonium. They intended the song to have a \"Celtic feel to it\", and overdubbed their vocals. In a 1975 interview with the Scottish Daily Express, Gavin Sutherland said of the song:\nIssued as a single, the song reached No. 54 in July 1972, and the single's sales were reportedly 40,000 units. The Sutherland Brothers had recorded \"Sailing\" subsequent to completing the tracks intended for their upcoming album release \"Lifeboat\", and that album was issued in November 1972 without the inclusion of \"Sailing\": included on the US edition of the \"Lifeboat\" album, \"Sailing\" by the Sutherland Brothers would make its UK album debut on the 1976 Sutherland Brothers' compilation album entitled \"Sailing\".\nRod Stewart version.\nOverview.\n\"Sailing\" was recorded by Rod Stewart for his first album recorded in North America rather than Great Britain: \"Atlantic Crossing\", which was recorded April – June 1975 at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with Tom Dowd producing. The first single from the album, \"Sailing\" was an international hit, notably in the UK, where it was number 1 for four weeks in September 1975. It returned to the UK chart in 1976 and, with less success, in 1987. \"Sailing\" remains Stewart's biggest single hit in the UK. However, \"Sailing\" was not a hit in Stewart's newly adopted US homeland.\nBackground.\nAccording to Iain Sutherland the connection between the Sutherland Brothers and Rod Stewart which led to Stewart's recording of \"Sailing\" began when Stewart's live-in girlfriend Dee Harrington saw the Sutherland Brothers on the 20 June 1972 broadcast of the BBC2 music program \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\": Harrington recommended the Sutherland Brothers as a musical act that would interest Stewart, and Stewart did indeed become a Sutherland Brothers fan after seeing them perform at the Marquee Club. According to Gavin Sutherland, the Sutherland Brothers co-wrote two original songs with Stewart which Stewart hoped to record for \"Atlantic Crossing\": however the only Sutherland Brothers tune Stewart would record for the album would be \"Sailing\" whose seemingly nautical theme complemented the album's title.\nStewart would recall the recording of \"Sailing\" being a challenge: he was awoken in his hotel room by a 10 am phone call from Dowd at Muscles Shoals, in which Dowd said \"Get down here in half an hour; we've mixed the track and need the vocal\"; Stewart (quote): \"I was like: 'You're joking, recording at 10:30 in the morning. I need a drink to calm the old nerves'There was nothing [alcoholic] to be had anywhere and I was terrified to sing without [a drink]\"\"I'd never sung anything in a studio without having a drink – let alone a big old anthem. And I'd never sung anything, anywhere that early in the morning. Got it in six or seven takes though.\"\nImpact and legacy.\nDespite his enthusiasm for the Sutherland Brothers, Stewart said that he \"argued vehemently\" against the release of \"Sailing\" as the lead single from \"Atlantic Crossing\", instead advocating his own composition \"Three Time Loser\". Gavin Sutherland concurs: \"I don't think Rod personally wanted [\"Sailing\"] put out as a single. He just saw it as a big ballady-kind of last track, side two, finish to \"Atlantic Crossing\" which had several other great tracks on it.\" However \"Sailing\" had an August 1975 UK single release parallel with the album release of \"Atlantic Crossing\": reaching No. 2 UK in its second week of release, Stewart's \"Sailing\" would have a four-week tenure at No. 1 UK.\nStewart's \"Sailing\" had a UK chart revival in 1976 as a result of the track being utilized as theme song for \"Sailor\" a documentary series on which BBC1 aired for ten weeks from 5 August 1976: \"Sailing\" ranked at No. 50 on the UK chart dated 4 September 1976 and the track's renewed popularity continued even after the 7 October 1976 finale of the \"Sailor\" TV series, as \"Sailing\" reached its 1976 chart peak of No. 3 on the UK charts dated 16 – 23 October 1976, with the track remaining in the UK Top 50 into January 1977. Stewart performed \"Sailing\" live on the \"Top of the Pops\" broadcast of 23 September 1976. \"Sailing\" remains Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK: in November 2012 it was reported that \"Sailing\" by Rod Stewart had sold 1.12 million units in the UK with a resultant ranking at No. 112 of the 123 UK million-selling singles.\nIn the US, where \"Atlantic Crossing\" had been issued in August 1975 without a single release, \"Sailing\" was issued as the album's lead single in October 1975 but failed to reach the Top 40 of \"Billboard\", attaining a Hot 100 peak of No. 58. Overall \"Sailing\" did afford Stewart a major international success reaching No.1 in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; No. 2 in Australia, Belgium's Flemish Region, South Africa and Switzerland; No. 3 in New Zealand; No. 4 in Germany; No. 7 in Austria; No. 13 in Sweden.\nThe first music video for \"Sailing\" was filmed in the Port of Dublin and also featured footage shot on the major Dublin thoroughfare Moore Street: featuring Stewart and his partner Britt Ekland, the video aired on the Top of the Pops broadcast of 28 August 1975. Another music video for \"Sailing\" was shot in New York Harbor in 1978, and would become one of the first to be aired on MTV when it launched on 1 August 1981.\nAs the British task-force sailed out of Portsmouth Harbour on 5 April 1982 – the third day of the Falklands War – the recording of Rod Stewart's \"Sailing\" was broadcast from the quay's public address system.\nIn 1987 Rod Stewart's \"Sailing\" was reissued as a charity single after the \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" disaster off the Flemish port of Zeebrugge, becoming a moderate hit in Belgium's Flemish Region (No. 24) and also the British Isles (No. 41 UK/ No. 30 Ireland) (\"Sailing\" would be the only charting Rod Stewart single in the British Isles in 1987).\nLive performances.\nAlthough Stewart had been touring the US with the Faces at the time of the autumn 1975 single release of \"Sailing\" that tour's setlist was focused on Stewart's collaborations with the Faces, with \"Three Time Loser\" being the only \"Atlantic Crossing\" number to be included. \"Sailing\" would debut as a Rod Stewart concert number during his European tour of November 1976 – January 1977 with the song usually serving as each show's purported finale to be followed with \"Stay With Me\" as encore: Stewart's 1 November 1976 performance at the Trondheim Spektrum in Norway launched the tour which after dates in Scandinavia, Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands played nine cities in Great Britain including six nights (21 -24 December 1976/ 14–15 January 1977) at the Olympia London.\nStewart's 1982 \"Absolutely Live\" concert album features a performance of \"Sailing\". He performed \"Sailing\" at the 20 June 1986 Prince's Trust All-Star Rock Concert – with Elton John on piano and Eric Clapton on guitar – and at the 1 July 2007 Concert for Diana memorial gala for Diana, Princess of Wales: both events were held at Wembley Stadium.\nRock Against Repatriation version.\nIn December 1990 \"Sailing\" was remade as a protest song against the repatriation of Vietnamese boat people who had fled to Hong Kong: Steve Hackett, who organized this multi-artist recording intended to raise funds to assist those living in refugee camps, would recall: I remembersitting there with Brian May and we were overdubbing the song on Christmas Eve. I had gotten people to work in England on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing DayI was becoming a professional beggar as you do when you undertake charity work. I was worried that I pushed a lot of my friends, family and management to the limit with this. But even as we sat there Christmas Eve doing the overdubs, they showed [the participating artists] working on TV from when they filmed us earlier. It had everyone singing along and it was a nice buzz for Brian and me. I was worried I pushed him on it, but he said 'No, you got me out of myself by doing that. I'm glad you did that.' So, it was a good effort.\nIt was announced that both the Sutherland Brothers: Gavin and Iain, would be featured on the recording, although only Iain Sutherland would in fact be featured. Recorded at Surrey Sound Studios – with additional recording at the Cambridge Park and Maison Rouge studios (both in southwest London) and also Real World Studios – the version of \"Sailing\" by Hackett et al. was issued 19 February 1990 with the artist credit Rock Against Repatriation to spend a single week on the UK chart ranking at #89 for the week ending 3 March 1990, and – despite Hackett's allegation that \"I must have done over twenty TV shows here in North America\" in support of the single and its cause – a US release went unnoticed. Hackett would admit: \"The single didn't accomplish what I wanted it to.\"\nA video was prepped for the Rock Against Repatriation version of \"Sailing\" which intercut footage of the featured artists performing with media images of the Vietnamese refugees forcibly repatriated from Hong Kong.\nOther versions.\n\"Sailing\" has also been recorded by Joan Baez (album \"Blowin' Away\" 1977), Brotherhood of Man (album \"20 Number One Hits\" 1980), the Nolan Sisters (album \"20 Giant Hits\" 1978), Smokie, (album \"Uncovered Too\" 2002) and Dame Vera Lynn. Robin Trower (with bassist James Dewar on vocals) covered the song on the 1976 album \"Long Misty Days\" and Roger Whittaker on the 1978 album \"Roger Whittaker Sings the Hits\"., Aled Jones. Instrumental versions of \"Sailing\" have been recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra (album \"Classic Rock\" 1977) and Richard Clayderman (album \"A Little Night Music – 12 Classic Love Songs\" 1988).\nA French version (\"Ma musique\") has been recorded by Joe Dassin in 1975.\nA re-worded rave version by Slipstreem was a top 20 hit single in the UK in 1993.\nThe song's melody is used for the football chant \"No one likes us, we don't care\", sung by Millwall supporters. The melody is also used by German football club Hertha BSC Berlin for their chant \"Nur Nach Hause\" (\"Just homewards\"), written by Berlin-based Entertainer and Hertha-Fan Frank Zander.\nAt the time of the Voyage of Greta Thunberg in 2019, climate strikers in Steyning performed the song with the lyrics \"Greta's Sailing\"."

        "title": "Cricket field",
        "text": "A cricket field or cricket oval is a large grass field on which the game of cricket is played. Although generally oval in shape, there is a wide variety within this: perfect circles, elongated ovals, rounded rectangles, or irregular shapes with little or no symmetry – but they will have smooth boundaries without sharp corners, almost without exception. There are no fixed dimensions for the field but its diameter usually varies between for men's cricket, and between and for women's cricket.\nCricket is unusual among major sports (along with golf, Australian rules football and baseball) in that there is no official rule for a fixed-shape ground for professional games. In some cases, fields are allowed to have even greater peculiarities, such as the 2.5m slope across the Lord's Cricket Ground, or the lime tree which sat inside the fence of the St Lawrence Ground.\nOn most grounds, a rope demarcates the perimeter of the field and is known as the \"boundary\". Within the boundary and generally as close to the centre as possible will be the \"square\" which is an area of carefully prepared grass upon which cricket pitches can be prepared and marked for the matches. The pitch is where batsmen hit the bowled ball and run between the wickets to score runs, while the fielding team tries to return the ball to either wicket to prevent this.\nField size.\nThe ICC Standard Playing Conditions define the minimum and maximum size of the playing surface for international matches. Law 19.1.3 of ICC Men's Test Match Playing Conditions as well as ICC Men's One Day International Playing Conditions states: 19.1.3 The aim shall be to maximise the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the boundaries, no boundary shall be longer than , and no boundary should be shorter than from the centre of the pitch to be used.The equivalent ICC playing conditions (Law 19.1.3) for international women's cricket require the boundary to be between from the centre of the pitch to be used.\nIn addition, the conditions require a minimum three-yard gap between the \"rope\" and the surrounding fencing or advertising boards. This allows players to dive without risk of injury.\nThe conditions contain a heritage clause, which exempts stadiums built before October 2007. However, most stadiums which regularly host international games easily meet the minimum dimensions.\nA typical Test match stadium would be larger than these defined minimums, with over of grass (having a straight boundary of about 80m). In contrast an association football field needs only about of grass, and an Olympic stadium would contain of grass within its 400m running track, making it difficult to play international cricket in stadiums not built for the purpose. Nevertheless, Stadium Australia which hosted the Sydney Olympics in 2000 had its running track turfed over with 30,000 seats removed to make it possible to play cricket there, at a cost of A$80 million. This is one of the reasons cricket games generally cannot be hosted outside the traditional cricket-playing countries, and a few non-Test nations like Canada, the UAE and Kenya that have built Test standard stadiums.\nPitch.\nMost of the action takes place in the centre of this ground, on a rectangular clay strip usually with short grass called the pitch. The pitch measures (1 chain) long.\nAt each end of the pitch three upright wooden stakes, called the stumps, are hammered into the ground. Two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails, sit in grooves atop the stumps, linking each to its neighbour. Each set of three stumps and two bails is collectively known as a wicket. One end of the pitch is designated the \"batting end\" where the batsman stands and the other is designated the \"bowling end\" where the bowler runs in to bowl. The area of the field on the side of the line joining the wickets where the batsman holds his bat (the right-hand side for a right-handed batsman, the left for a left-hander) is known as the off side, the other as the leg side or on side.\nLines drawn or painted on the pitch are known as creases. Creases are used to adjudicate the dismissals of batsmen, by indicating where the batsmen's grounds are, and to determine whether a delivery is fair.\nCricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north-south direction as practical, because the low afternoon sun would be dangerous for a batter facing due west. This means that some oval fields are oriented with their longer axes straight of the wicket, and others have their longer axes square of the wicket.\nParts of the field.\nFor limited overs cricket matches, there are two additional field markings to define areas relating to fielding restrictions. The \"circle\" or \"fielding circle\" is an oval described by drawing a semicircle of radius from the centre of each wicket with respect to the breadth of the pitch and joining them with lines parallel, to the length of the pitch. This divides the field into an infield and outfield and can be marked by a painted line or evenly spaced discs. The close-infield is defined by a circle of radius , centred at middle stump guard on the popping crease at the end of the wicket, and is often marked by dots."

This schedule change was done in a swap with Martinsville Speedway, which previously had two Truck Series races and zero Xfinity Series races and would now have one Truck Series race and one Xfinity Series race (which replaced the spring race at Richmond).\nIn 2022, the September Xfinity Series race at Richmond was moved to the spring (in exchange for moving the Truck Series race to the summer race weekend) and there was no September race at the track for the first time in the series' history."

        "title": "Hawke's Bay Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Hawke's Bay Rugby Union (HBRU) is the governing body of rugby union in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. The union is based in Napier.\nThe Hawke's Bay representative team are nicknamed \"The Magpies\".\nHistory.\nThe Hawke's Bay Rugby Union was founded in 1884. This makes it the oldest Provincial Rugby Union outside the four main centres. Hawke's Bay has a very good Ranfurly Shield record with 24 defences from 1922 to 1927, 21 successful defences between 1966 and 1969 as well as 2 defences in 1934. Hawke's Bay won the shield again, claiming it from Otago, on 1 September 2013. They lost the shield soon after to Counties-Manukau, before winning it back from them in August 2014 and holding it for eleven defences until October 2015. Hawke's Bay next held the Shield for 14 defences between October 2020 and September 2022 before losing it to Wellington, and they then regained it back from Wellington on 30 September 2023. Because of relatively few periods of holding the Ranfurly Shield and some long series of defences, Hawke's Bay holds the record for the highest average number of defences per Shield era.\nHawke's Bay's glory days as a rugby union came long before the NPC was founded. As such Hawke's Bay does not have a very flattering record in either that competition or the Air New Zealand Cup. The best position they have managed in either is 3rd. Hawke's Bay dominated the second division of the NPC in the 1990s before the Air New Zealand Cup was set up in 2006.\nIn 1996, Hawke's Bay and Manawatu merged their teams to form the Central Vikings. It was an attempt to elevate the unions back to the then first division. Players including Mark \"Bull\" Allen, Christian Cullen, Mark Ranby, Stephen Bachop and Roger Randle featured in the team. The 1997 season saw Central finish overall second with 6 wins, 2 losses and into the semi-finals. In the semi-final, the Vikings avenged their loss to Bay of Plenty in round robin play to face Northland in the final. Northland won the final 63–10. Northland were thus promoted to the First Division. However, had the Vikings won, they would not have been eligible to be promoted. 1998 saw a repeat of form for the Vikings who went unbeaten in the season. They subsequently won the final against Bay of Plenty at McLean Park, Napier and were promoted to First Division. However, due to financial issues, the merger split back to Hawke's Bay and Manawatu. Both unions subsequently became foundation unions of the Air New Zealand Cup which started in 2006.\nIn the past, Hawke's Bay has produced some great All Blacks, including Kel Tremain and George Nēpia. Hawke's Bay also defeated the 1993 British Lions and in 1994 defeated France (who beat the All Blacks twice in that same tour).\nSuper Rugby application.\nIn 2009, Hawke's Bay announced they intended to apply to join the Super Rugby competition, when it was announced a fifteenth franchise was to be created. However, in August 2009 the club's chairman Richard Hunt announced they were withdrawing their bid because they had not had sufficient time to present a business plan. He insisted the club remained very serious about joining the club in the future. Hawke's Bay would be New Zealand's sixth team if they were to join Super Rugby. With the announcement that New Zealand might receive a 6th Super Franchise in the SANZAAR Super Rugby competition beginning 2016, the Hawke's Bay Union announced its interest in forming this franchise together with Manawatu, therefore effectively resurrecting the Central Vikings brand as a Super Rugby franchise.\nClub rugby.\nFormat.\nAfter the 2019 club rugby season, changes to the two highest divisions of men's club rugby in Hawke's Bay were announced. Because the first round of the club rugby season of 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these changes only took effect in 2021.\nThe new format is as follows. In the first round of the season, ten Premier teams play for the Nash Cup. Only the top eight sides from the Nash Cup will play in the second round for the Maddison Trophy. The two lowest ranked Nash Cup teams will play in a modified Division 1 competition for the new Hepa Paewai Memorial Trophy, along with the six best teams of the round 1 Town &amp; Country competition (two of five Country teams, four of 12 Town teams).\nAt the end of the second round, the two clubs that reach the Division 1 final will earn promotion to the following year's Nash Cup, unless those clubs already have a Premier team in the Nash Cup competition. In that situation, the promotion goes to one or both of the beaten semi-finalists (if eligible themselves). In case two beaten semi-finalists are in contention for one spot in the Nash Cup competition, the winner of the earlier round-robin match between the two clubs will earn the promotion.\nThe new format doesn't only introduce the new Hepa Paewai Memorial Trophy for Division 1, but also sees the introduction of a new trophy for Division 2, the Tom Mulligan Cup.\nThere are no changes to the format of the women's, division 3 and colts' competitions.\n2023 Format variation.\nThe 2023 season brought several changes to the club rugby competition format.\nEleven premiers club teams competed for the 2023 Nash Cup in a 10-week round robin competition with the highest ranked team claiming the Cup. The six (not eight) teams that ranked highest on the Nash Cup table played for the Maddison Trophy in the second round of the premiers competition.\nThe five teams at the bottom of the Nash Cup table played in Division 1 for the Hepa Paewai Trophy. The sixth team in Division 1 would have been the winner of the Town &amp; Country final, but neither of the finalists – Napier Old Boys Marist RFC Premiers Reserves (ineligible) or Ōtāne Sports Club (opted out) – did take that spot in the Division 1 round 2 competition and instead played in Division 2 for the Tom Mulligan Cup with the other club teams finishing in the top 3 of the Country grade and the top 5 of the Town grade.\nThe Town &amp; Country grade was played in three separate pools. The five teams in the Country grade (one pool) played four round robin games, with the highest ranked team winning the Arthur Brown Cup and qualifying for the Town v Country final. The ten Town teams played five round robin games in two pools of five clubs. The highest ranked teams of each pool played each other for the Jack Swain Cup and a place in the Town v Country final. The winner of that Town v Country final earned the Pratt Trophy.\nThe two lowest ranked Country teams and five Town teams that didn't qualify for Division 2 in round 2 of the club rugby competition, played in Division 2A for a new trophy.\nIn round 1 of Division 3, nine teams competed for the Maury Coady Cup in an 8-game round robin. The four highest ranked teams played in round 2 for the Ron Parker Memorial Trophy. Four of the remaining teams played in a new Division 3A for the inaugural AJ Gardiner Trophy. Both Division 3 and 3A consisted of three round robin games, with the two highest ranked teams playing a Final.\nFive teams competed in the women's grade, with the highest ranked team after the round robin winning the Marsh Cup and the top two teams playing for the Championship Cup. Different from previous years, the women's teams only played one round in 2023.\nIn the Colts grade, eight club teams played a round robin in pools of four teams, with the top two of each pool playing finals for the Arthur Brown Cup in round 1. In round 2, all eight teams played a 7-game round robin, with the top 4 teams playing for the Pat Ryan Memorial Trophy and the next four teams for a new Colts A-grade trophy.\nCompetition winners.\nRound one champions:\nRound two champions:\nU85kg\nSchool rugby.\nThe Hawke's Bay Rugby Union administers a secondary schools rugby competition, consisting of several boys' grades and two girls' grades. The strongest boys' schools teams, however, compete in interregional competitions. The two best Hawke's Bay rugby schools, Hastings Boys' High School and Napier Boys' High School, compete in the Super 8 competition in multiple grades, while Lindisfarne College and St John's College, Hastings currently participate in the Central North Island (CNI) 1st XV competition.\nNapier Boys High School 1st XV won the Super 8 in 2000, 2002, 2003 and most recently made the Final in 2023. Hastings Boys High School 1st XV won the competition in 2004, 2016, shared the title with Hamilton Boys' High School in 2017, and most recently reached the Final in 2021.\nBoth schools also regularly feature in the (seeded) semi-finals to be played for the Hurricanes Cup against the winner of the Wellington Premiership school rugby competition and the highest ranked school from the Hurricanes region in the CNI competition. The winner of the Hurricanes Cup represents the Hurricanes region in the National First XV Championship or Top 4. In the most recent years, the Hurricanes Cup was won by a Hawke's Bay 1st XV team: in 2016, 2017 and 2019 by Hastings Boys High School and in 2018, 2021 and 2022 by Napier Boys High School. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hurricanes Cup and Top 4 were not played for in 2020; the Top 4 has also been cancelled for 2021.\nHawke's Bay in Air New Zealand Cup.\nHawke's Bay made their debut, along with Tasman, Manawatu and Counties-Manukau, in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup which had 14 teams. Hawkes Bay made their best effort to date in the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup, winning many games even against bigger unions such as Wellington and Waikato. They were the fairytale story of the competition, surprising everyone to reach the semi-finals where they were beaten by Auckland. They repeated this form in the 2008 and 2009 seasons where they were again beaten semi-finalists. This form in back to back seasons attracted warranted attention and many Hawke's Bay players were awarded with Super 14 contracts, both for the Hurricanes and elsewhere."

        "text": "Kenneth Ray Williams (born June 9, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player, most notably with the National Basketball Association's Indiana Pacers. He was known for his stellar leaping ability and off-court problems.\nBiography.\nWilliams, a 6' 9\" forward, was a prep sensation at Elizabeth City (N.C.) Northeastern High School. His sophomore year, he averaged over 20 points and 12 rebounds a game. He played in the Hampton Roads Basketball Classic in Norfolk, scoring 42 points, and winning the MVP award over the likes of Alonzo Mourning, JR Reid, and Dennis Scott. He was named first team AP All-State. Prior to his junior year, he transferred to Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia, where he averaged 17 points and 12 rebounds for a 29-0 team. In his senior year, he averaged 31 points per game and 12 rebounds a game, and was named state player of the year for North Carolina in 1988. Williams was named first-team USA Today (over such players as Shawn Kemp and Stanley Roberts) and first-team Parade All-American. Williams was selected to play in the McDonald's All-American Game and the Capital Classic, though he only played in the Classic, scoring eight points. In addition, he played two scrimmages against Mourning, and more than held his own, scoring 41 points in the first scrimmage and outrebounding Alonzo in both scrimmages.\nWilliams was one of the top four players in the class of 1988, along with Alonzo Mourning, Billy Owens and Kemp. He was heavily recruited by the University of North Carolina, but was not offered a scholarship because of his failure to meet the minimum academic standards.

        "text": "William Edward Travers (born October 27, 1952) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.\nEarly years.\nTravers attended Norwood High School, where he pitched three no-hitters, and was 13-0 with one save as a senior. He also played for the Norwood Post 70 American Legion team. The southpaw was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the sixth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft five months shy of his 18th birthday.\nHis minor league career started off poorly (1-6, 5.62 ERA with the Midwest League's Clinton Pilots in ), and only got worse when he started to develop arm trouble in . Following operations to remove bone chips from his elbow and reroute an ulnar nerve which almost saw his career end (an operation which later became known as Tommy John surgery), Travers received his first call up to the majors in . Used primarily as a long reliever in manager Del Crandall's bullpen, Travers went 2-3 with a 4.92 earned run average.\nHe started the following season with the triple A Sacramento Solons, however, in desperate need of starting pitching, the Brewers called Travers up in June (Travers was one of 13 different starting pitchers Crandall used in ). Travers went 6-11 with a 4.48 ERA as a starter. He also made five relief appearances, and collected the only save of his career on June 21 against the Cleveland Indians.\nAll-Star.\nHis career took off in , when he went 10-6 with a 1.91 ERA in the first half of the season. The highlight of his first half was a pitchers' duel against the New York Yankees' Dock Ellis at Yankee Stadium. Ellis held the Brewers to one run on four hits. Travers, meanwhile, pitched a four-hit shutout, in which he also collected a season high eight strikeouts. He also pitched shutouts against the Chicago White Sox &amp; California Angels on his way to the only All-Star nod of his career. He sputtered in the second half, however, going 5-10 with a 3.92 ERA. For the season, he led his team with 15 victories and a 2.81 ERA. His 240 innings pitched were a career high.\nInjuries.\nTravers was named the Opening Day starter, and started the season 3-4 with a 3.23 ERA, until injuries once again derailed his career. After nearly two months on the disabled list, Travers returned in late July, but was highly ineffective. He went 1-8 with a 6.82 ERA over the remainder of the season. The low point of his season came on August 14 in the second game of a doubleheader with the Indians. Regardless of his ineffectiveness and history of arm trouble, Brewers manager Alex Grammas left Travers in the game for 155 pitches. He finally left the game in the eighth inning, having surrendered 14 earned runs.\nTravers underwent a second ulnar transfer operation during the off-season, this time under Dr. Frank Jobe, the doctor who became famous for performing Tommy John's successful surgery. He returned to the Brewers under new manager George Bamberger in May , and went 12-11 with a 4.41 ERA in 28 starts.\nTravers returned to ace form in , going 14-8 with a 3.89 ERA to help the Brewers to a second-place finish in the American League East for the first time in franchise history. He repeated this success in , going 12-6 with a 3.91 ERA.\nCalifornia Angels.\nTravers signed a four-year free agent contract with the California Angels on January 26, . He faced just one batter in his fourth start with his new club, walking Yankees second baseman Willie Randolph on four pitches before he needed to be pulled from the game. Calcium deposits were found in his pitching elbow. He sat out the remainder of the season in an unsuccessful attempt to let the injury heal. He had surgery during the off season to have the calcium deposits removed, causing him to miss the entire season in which the Angels captured the American League West.\nTravers returned to the mound for the Angels on May 10, . He made ten appearances, going 0-3 with a 5.91 ERA before he was released.\nCareer stats.\nHis only career plate appearance came against the New York Yankees on July 29, 1979. He successfully sacrificed Jim Wohlford over to second. He pitched for the Senior Professional Baseball Association's St. Lucie Legends in . He was an inaugural inductee into the Milwaukee Brewers \"Wall of Honor\" in .\nPersonal life.\nTravers married his high school sweetheart, Linda, and had a daughter named Tiffany. His father was a semi-pro catcher, who later served as a police officer in Norwood for 38 years.\nTravers is also a very good candlepin bowler, He's made appearances on Channel 5's Candlepin Bowling show in Boston, and was on the USA team that won the World Championships."

Chalk appeared in 903 games over nine seasons (–) in Major League Baseball for four teams, and was a two-time American League All-Star. Born in Del Rio, Texas, he batted and threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and .\nChalk played varsity baseball for Justin F. Kimball High School in Dallas, where he was named all-city for two years before graduating in 1968. He also attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a three-time All-American and four-time All-Southwest-Conference selection between 1969 and 1972, appearing in three College World Series. The California Angels then selected him in the first round of the June 1972 amateur draft. His first MLB game occurred at the end of his second pro season when, during an extended September audition, he appeared in 24 games, starting 20 of them as the Angels' shortstop. The following year, , Chalk started 95 games at shortstop and another 38 at third base, and made the All-Star team for the first time. In the 1974 Midsummer Classic, played at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, Chalk replaced starter (and Baseball Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson) as the Junior Circuit's third baseman in the eighth inning; he handled no chances on defense, then struck out in his only at bat, against Mike Marshall in the ninth, and the National League breezed to a 7–2 win.\nChalk's two finest seasons came in and during his tenure with the Angels. In 1975, he started 149 games at shortstop, batted .273, and set a career high with 56 runs batted in. Selected to the 1975 AL All-Star team, he did not appear in that summer's game, played at Milwaukee County Stadium on July 15. In 1977, Chalk was the Angels' regular third baseman, starting 137 games, and he achieved personal bests in hits (144), doubles (27), and batting average (.277). He moved back to shortstop for the Angels in , his last year as a regular in the majors. He was traded to his hometown team, the Texas Rangers, in for veteran shortstop Bert Campaneris, but he spent only five weeks with the Rangers before he was shipped on to the Oakland Athletics. Electing free agency during the 1979–1980 offseason, he signed with the Kansas City Royals, and got into 96 games as a utility infielder in and 1981. Along the way, as a member of the 1980 American League champion Royals, Chalk appeared in his only World Series. In Game 2, he came in for another future Hall of Fame third baseman, George Brett, in the sixth inning. He batted once, against yet another Hall of Famer, Steve Carlton, and played a key role in a three-run rally by drawing a base on balls; he then stole second base and scored on an Amos Otis double. But the Royals could not hold their 4–2 lead, and the opposing Philadelphia Phillies took the game, 6–4, and, eventually, the World Series itself.\nChalk retired from baseball after the 1981 campaign. In his 903 big-league games, he collected 733 hits, with 107 doubles, nine triples and 15 career home runs. He batted .252 lifetime and was credited with 243 runs batted in. He later scouted for the Seattle Mariners.\nIn 2019, Chalk was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Texas Hall of Honor and the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame."

The tournament is part of the International Rugby Board's US $50 million Strategic Investment programme, which also includes the Pacific Nations Cup, the Pacific Rugby Cup and the Americas Rugby Championship (as well as the ARC's predecessor, the North America 4).\nHistory.\nThe Nations Cup is aimed at providing more competition for tier one A sides, as well as offering opportunities for second and third tier nations such as Portugal, Russia, Namibia, Uruguay, Georgia and Romania. The Nations Cup is an important tournament for both Italy and Argentina; at the time of the inaugural competition in 2006, the two sides combined had only nine players that did not play in their respective domestic competitions. The inaugural tournament was won by Argentina A.\nThe Nations Cup was expanded in 2007, with six teams instead of four. Argentina A and Italy A returned, along with Namibia, Georgia, Romania and the Emerging Springboks. This was in part to allow Namibia, Georgia and Romania to warm up for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Originally scheduled to take place in the Tineretului Stadium, Bucharest, Romania, in the event the matches took place at the city's Stadionul Arcul de Triumf. The Emerging Springboks were crowned champions and the Tournament has remained at Arcul de Triumf since then.\nIn 2008 Argentina A, soon to be rechristened as Argentina Jaguars, left the tournament to play in the Churchill Cup, Namibia also withdrew. Uruguay and Russia took their places. The Emerging Springboks were crowned champions for the second time with a 100% record.\n2009 saw the addition of Scotland A and France A to the tournament at the expense of the Emerging Springboks and Georgia, which both had other commitments that year. The Emerging Springboks played the British &amp; Irish Lions during the Lions' tour of South Africa, while Georgia accepted an invitation to the Churchill Cup. Scotland A won that year's edition.\nFor the 2010 edition, Romania and defending champions Scotland A returned from 2009, as did Italy A. France A, Russia, and Uruguay instead played in the 2010 Churchill Cup. Their places were taken by Georgia, returning after a one-year absence, and Namibia and Argentina Jaguars, returning for the first time since 2007. Namibia emerged as winners.\nThe 2011 edition effectively served as a 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-up for host Romania, defending Nations Cup champion Namibia, and Georgia. The Argentina Jaguars also returned from the 2010 edition. Portugal returned for the first time since the inaugural edition in 2006. South Africa made their first appearance since 2008 a successful one, with a team billed as the \"South African Kings\" — in reality, the Southern Kings, the country's planned future Super Rugby franchise — winning the event.\nSouthern Kings did not return to defend their title in 2012, nor did Namibia or Georgia return to take part. Instead, Italy A (missing for a year) and Russia and Uruguay (missing for two years) reappeared. For the first time in the competition's history, host nation Romania won. They went on to retain the title in 2013, this time in a four-team round robin.\nEmerging Ireland made their first appearance in the competition in 2014, along with Uruguay, Russia, and host Romania. This edition is seen as important preparation for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nIn 2015, Namibia made their first appearance since 2011 as they began to prepare for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

Smith, represented Taranaki in 1936–39, and his uncle, Jack Walter, was a 1925 All Black rugby player. Smith took up rugby early, and in 1962 was selected for the Taranaki rugby football team, aged 19. He played for the New Zealand under 23 side which toured Australia in 1963, and first trialled for the All Blacks in 1965. He was selected for the All Blacks for the 1967 tour of Britain and France where he first donned the black jersey. However, due to the dominance of the Meads brothers (Colin and Stan) and stiff competition from Sam Strahan of Manawatu, Smith couldn't get a look-in for the test matches.\nIn 1968 Smith was omitted from the All Black team which toured Australia and played France at home, but after a good 1969 trial, and stellar performance leading Taranaki to a 9–9 draw with Wales, Smith was recalled in favour of Strahan. He made his test debut against Wales on 31 May 1969, in Christchurch, and went on to play the second test as well, both of which the All Blacks won resoundingly.\nSmith played the first test match of the All Black tour of South Africa in 1970, but missed out on selection for the remaining matches.

He scored 1 try against South African Country in East London.\nSmith's 1971 season was plagued by injury, but he managed an appearance for Taranaki against the touring British Lions. This was his last match for Taranaki, retiring after 9 years and 82 games for the \"Amber &amp; Blacks\".\nAs well as being a top-level rugby player Smith excelled in cricket. After retiring from rugby he focused on his pace bowling and played for the Taranaki cricket team in the late 1970s.

The most recent additions were Josh Hodgson, Chelsea Lenarduzzi, Stuart Nelson, and Joanne Taylor during 2022.\nThe Players' Champion.\nThe Rugby League Players' Association's annual awards ceremony, The Players' Champion, recognises the best player in the National Rugby League as voted by their peers.\nFour-time winner of the award Johnathan Thurston, described the Players' Champion as \"the highest accolade a player can get.\"\nIn 2019, the first Players' Champion accolade was awarded to an NRLW player, with Jessica Sergis taking out the inaugural honour.\nCollective Bargaining Agreement.\nIn November 2017, the RLPA negotiated a new Collective Bargaining Agreement with the National Rugby League that secured the biggest pay increase for players in the game's 109-year history.\nThe new CBA deal captures a range of employment related clauses for a five-year period, beginning in 2018 through until 2022.\nIn a show of unity and solidarity behind the RLPA in the ongoing negotiations, NRL players wore branded caps throughout State of Origin press conferences and green tape in Round 21 of the 2017 season. RLPA CEO Ian Prendergast stated it \"was no secret players had become increasingly frustrated\" by negotiations. \"They want to stand up, use their voice and demonstrate their solidarity across the weekend to get this deal over the line so we can deliver certainty in the industry.\"\nThe concluding months of the CBA, and the passage of its deadline in November 2022, saw increasing tensions between the NRL and the RLPA. Although the NRL and RLPA had agreed to an increase in player payments of 37%, with $1.35bn to be designated to players between 2023 and 2027, the two parties were at odds regarding a number of issues regarding working conditions and control of funds, including access to and ownership of personal and medical player data, allocation of funds to the RLPA’s programs, the length of the season, minimum wages, insurance for death and total disability, the ability of players to negotiate with other clubs, payments for international matches, and autonomy over union funding.\nAs part of the standoff, RLPA members covered up the NRL logo on their jerseys during Round 22's matches, refused to speak to the media on game days, released a video titled Stand With Us aimed at garnering support from fans, sent letters to the club chairs and main sponsors of the clubs and the league to complain about the lack of progress in negotiations and asking for support, as well as threatening to delay match kickoff times and boycott the Dally M Awards ceremony.\nThe standoff ended on 10 August 2023 after the NRL and Rugby League Players Association settled on an in-principle collective bargaining agreement (CBA), with the league’s first billion-dollar CBA, which lasts until 2027 and covers men’s and women’s players, expected to be finalised over the coming days, pending documentation and ratification."

Besides steroids it was also notable that every team in the NL East finished the season with at least 81 wins (at least half of the 162 games played).

        "title": "Peek-a-boo (boxing style)",
        "text": "Peek-a-boo is a boxing style which received its common name for the defensive hand position, which are normally placed in front of the face, like in the baby's game of the same name. The technique is thought to offer extra protection to the face while making it easier to jab the opponent's face. The fighter holds their gloves close to their cheeks and pulls their arms tight against their torso. A major proponent of the style was trainer Cus D'Amato, who didn't use the term peek-a-boo and instead referred to it as a \"tight defense.\" The style was criticized by some because it was believed that an efficient attack could not be launched from it.\nConcept.\nPeek-a-boo's key principles are built upon the \"Bad intentions\" concept , which emphasize the D'Amato philosophy. The general idea is that the Peek-a-boo practitioners are counterpunchers, who contrary to accustomed ways of counterpunching perceived as constantly backing-up and jabbing from the safe distance, move forward and do it with a lot of aggressiveness by constantly charging at the opponent, provoking him into throwing punches to counter, and subsequently into making mistakes to capitalize on, by creating openings and dominant angles of attack.\nHands and upper-body movement.\nPeek-a-boo boxing utilizes relaxed hands with the forearms in front of the face and the fist at nose-eye level. Other unique features include side-to-side head movements, bobbing, weaving and blind siding the opponent.\nA fighter using the peek-a-boo style is drilled with the stationary dummy and on the bag until the fighter is able to punch by rapid combinations with what D'Amato called \"bad intentions\". The style allows swift neck movements as well as quick duckings and bad returning damage, usually by rising uppercuts or even rising hooks.The power in punch came from weight shifting.\nFootwork.\nPeek-a-boo footwork is not that frequently noted by observers, which usually focus on the upper-body movement and striking, but it sets the base for both the effective upper-body movement and punching with leverage. The footwork is aimed to close the distance, crowd the opponent, cut off his escape routes, negate his reach advantage, and create dominant angles for attack simultaneously. To be able to slip and counter the opponent's punches, the practitioner should be able to do it from a neutral or near-neutral stance, with his pelvis squared-up in parallel against the opponent's pelvis, for it creates more room for the lateral upper-body movement side-to-side with more amplitude, and places conventional boxers in an unfamiliar position relatively to the Peek-a-boo practitioners. Peek-a-boo pelvic movement also sets the momentum for uppercuts. As the Peek-a-boo footwork requires shifting and occasional stance-switching, ambidextrous boxers prevail over both orthodox and southpaws, gaining the ultimate advantage by constantly and deliberately changing their stance.\nPunches by the numbers.\nFighters would pick combinations from a series of numbered punches:\nInstructing a fighter in the corner (and shouting from ringside) was made simpler by shouting numbered combinations. Probably the most famous example was Mike Tyson's devastating 6-4.\nKnown practitioners.\nIn alphabetical order (with their respective trainees):"

        "title": "John Graham (rugby union)",
        "text": "Sir David John Graham (9 January 1935 – 2 August 2017), generally known as John Graham, was a New Zealand educator and rugby union player. He served as president of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) and was an All Black loose forward; he played 22 Tests between 1958 and 1964, including three as captain. He was headmaster of Auckland Grammar School from 1973 to 1993, New Zealand cricket team manager from 1997 to 1999, the University of Auckland Chancellor from 1999 to 2004, and was elected president of the NZRFU in April 2005.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Stratford, Graham boarded at New Plymouth Boys' High School with his brothers where he received his secondary education, playing in the first XV for two years mainly at first five-eighths. He attended Auckland University College for three years, graduating with a MA (Hons) in history and playing for the Auckland provincial team during that time. He represented Auckland against the 1956 Springboks at Eden Park in just his fourth match for Auckland.\nRugby career.\nUpon completing his tertiary education in 1958 Graham moved to Christchurch and took up a permanent teaching position at Christchurch Boys' High School. He joined the Christchurch High School Old Boys club rugby team and was immediately made captain, remaining so for the rest of his time there. The same year he was selected for the All Blacks for the first two tests against Australia, making his debut on 23 August in Wellington and helping his team to a 25–3 victory. In 1959 Graham withdrew from the All Black trials, but in 1960 was selected to tour South Africa. He played 10 of the 26 matches, including the second and third tests, and captained the team on a number of occasions.\nGraham was an intelligent player with a great turn of speed, and became one of the most intelligent and fastest loose forwards in the All Black side. When Wilson Whineray retired after the tour of Great Britain in 1964, Graham took over the All Black captaincy, a position he held until retiring from rugby in 1965. He had played a total of 31 games for the All Blacks (seven as captain), and a total of 22 tests (three as captain). He scored 11 tries for the All Blacks, two of which were test match tries.\nPost-rugby career.\nAfter retiring from rugby Graham returned to teaching, being promoted to Head of Social Studies at Christchurch Boys' High School which he held until 1970. He went from there to Linwood High School before being appointed Headmaster of Auckland Grammar in 1973, a position he held for 21 years. Following his tenure at Auckland Grammar, Graham was appointed a commissioner of the newly founded low-decile Southern Cross Campus in 1997, with varying success.\nGraham was outspoken about rugby, its organisation and its place in New Zealand culture. After touring South Africa with the All Blacks in 1960, he said that \"if we had any conscience and feeling for humanity, we should not have been touring South Africa\". Along with Wilson Whineray he declined to attend the matches of the 1981 Springbok tour of New Zealand. Graham has also criticised the presence of advertising on the All Black jersey; \"I may be a dinosaur in this respect, but I don't think anything should go on the All Black jersey other than the silver fern\".\nGraham believed New Zealanders focus excessively on the sport of rugby, stating, \"I don't think rugby union is anywhere near as important in this country as solving the problems of poverty and unemployment. We're happy, aren't we, when our rugby team goes well, yet we're prepared to let some aspects of our nation go almost ignored.\"\nGraham spent decades working in education, and served as chairman of the New Zealand Education Scholarship Trust. He was critical of much of what is produced by contemporary educationalists, believing that \"To assume, as so many teachers do today, that the knowledge has to come from the children and all they have to do is pull it out, is educational nonsense.\"\nGraham died of cancer in Auckland on 2 August 2017.\nHonours and awards.\nIn the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, Graham was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to education. He managed the New Zealand cricket team from 1997 to 1999, and was appointed Chancellor of the University of Auckland in 1999 until retiring from the position in 2004. In the business world, Mr Graham held a number of directorships including The University Bookshop Ltd where he was Chair, IT distributor Renaissance Corporation, and transportation company Owens Group Ltd. Graham was also a director of the Auckland-based private education provider, Academic Colleges Group.\nIn 1999 Graham was named \"New Zealander of the Year\" by \"North &amp; South\" magazine, the cover article of the January 2000 edition running under the heading, \"John Graham, the man who set standards\". The break-out quote described him as:\n\"All Black captain, for 21 years headmaster of Auckland Grammar School, rugby coach, company director, businessman, commissioner of the troubled Nga Tapawae College, manager of the New Zealand cricket team. Renaissance man and Chancellor of the University of Auckland.\"\nGraham was elected president of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 2005, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Auckland the same year.\nIn the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, Graham was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to education and sports."

        "text": "U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS), founded in 1970, is a national membership nonprofit supporting masters swimming in the United States. The program began when the first National Masters Swimming Championships were held on May 2, 1970 at the Amarillo Aquatic Club pool with a few dozen swimmers. Captain Ransom J. Arthur, M.D., a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. Arthur's mission of encouraging adults to improve fitness through swimming has grown over the years into a nationwide organization that currently includes more than 60,000 adult swimmers.\nMembers participate in a variety of ways ranging from lap swimming to international competition. The program is organized by USMS, which provides organized workouts, competitions, clinics, and workshops for adults aged 18 and over. Programs are open to all adult swimmers (fitness, triathlete, competitive, noncompetitive) who are dedicated to improving their fitness through swimming. To be eligible for USMS competition, swimmers must sign up with USMS and obtain a membership card for a fee that varies by location.\nCompetition.\nAlthough there are more than 500 local and regional competitions around the country that are available for Masters swimmers to participate in, less than half of the members compete in these meets. However, for those that do, there are a variety of events to choose from including pool meets, ePostal swims, and open water swims. Two national championship pool meets are held each year, which help to determine the USMS Top 10—the top 10 fastest times in the nation in pool meets that are sanctioned or recognized by USMS during the current season and is organized by age, sex and course. The swimmer with the fastest time in the USMS Top 10 in each age group, event, and course, plus the age group winners of the long distance events are further named to the All-American list. In each age group, the swimmer with the most All-American titles is named an All-Star. All of the results from the competitions, as well as a record of the USMS Top 10, All-Americans and the All-Stars are recorded and maintained on the web in the USMS Archives.\nHistory.\nCaptain Ransom J. Arthur, a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. In the early 1970s, Spannuth approached American swimmer June Krauser about the need for competitive swimming for adults. With Arthur and Spannuth, she founded USMS. Krauser helped organize the group and drafted its rules. She became known as the \"Mother of Masters Swimming.\"\nKrauser was an active competitor in masters swimming from the 1970s through the 2000s. Between 1972 and 2001, she set 154 national records recognized by the USMS.\nSpannuth said that Krauser \"literally wrote the book when it came to competitive swimming for adults and for the Special Olympics, and did more to kick-start those two programs than anyone will ever know.\" Masters Swimming Hall of Fame inducted Krauser.\nOnline resources.\nYouTube channel.\nU.S. Masters Swimming has a YouTube channel it started October 28, 2008 where it posts videos to help grow the expertise in those interested in swimming. Videos published range from breaking down nebulous concepts into more tangible terms, such as the journey of a masters swimmer, to more technical videos providing instructional guidance on such topics as how to put on a swim cap and how to circle swim."

He was part of the side that drew 3-all with the Springboks in 1956, as well as the successful Ranfurly Shield triumph over Otago in 1957 and the subsequent two-year possession of the shield. McCullough made his first All Black trial appearance in 1956, and in 1959 finally found the favour of the All Black selectors for the second, third and fourth tests against the touring British Lions, playing at first five-eighths.\nMcCullough was overlooked for the 1960 tour of South Africa, however, and the 1959 matches proved to be the only games he played for the All Blacks. He was part of yet another successful Ranfurly Shield challenge when Taranaki beat Wellington in 1963, and played a total of 94 games for his home province."

        "title": "Rugby union in South Africa",
        "text": "Rugby union in South Africa is a highly popular team sport, along with cricket and soccer, and is widely played all over the country. The national team is among the strongest in the world and has been ranked in at least the top seven of the World Rugby Rankings since its inception in 2003. The country hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and won again in 2007, 2019 and 2023.\nAs with much else in South Africa, the organisation and playing of rugby has been entangled with politics, and racial politics in particular.\nHistory.\nWhen Canon George Ogilvie became headmaster of Diocesan College in Cape Town in 1861, he introduced the game of Winchester College football. This version of football, which included handling of the ball, is seen as the beginnings of rugby in South Africa. Soon, the young gentlemen of Cape Town joined in and the first match in South Africa took place between the \"Officers of the Army\" and the \"Gentlemen of the Civil Service\" at Green Point in Cape Town on 23 August 1862 and ended as a 0–0 draw. The local press reported a series of football matches between scratch sides \"Town v Suburbs\" or \"Home v Colonial-born\".\nAround 1875, rugby began to be played in the Cape colony; the same year the first rugby (as opposed to Winchester football) club, Hamilton, was formed in Sea Point, Cape Town. Former England international William Henry Milton arrived in Cape Town in 1878. He joined the Villagers club and started playing and preaching rugby. By the end of that year Cape Town had all but abandoned the Winchester game in favour of rugby. British colonists helped spread the game through the Eastern Cape, Natal and along the gold and diamond routes to Kimberley and Johannesburg. British troops would also play a key role in spreading the game throughout the country.\nRugby union was introduced to South Africa by British colonists, including miners from rugby union stronghold Cornwall Rugby union in Cornwall (before 1900), and began to be played in the Cape colony around 1875. In 1883, the Stellenbosch club was formed in the predominantly Boer farming district outside Cape Town and rugby was enthusiastically adopted by the young Boer farmers. As British and Boer migrated to the interior they helped spread the game from the Cape colony through the Eastern Cape, and Natal, and along the gold and diamond routes to Kimberley and Johannesburg.\nThe game was strong enough in the Western Cape for the Western Province Rugby Football Union to be formed that same year; Griqualand West followed in 1886; Eastern Province in 1888; Transvaal in 1889 and in 1889 the South African Rugby Board was founded. Kimberley was the founding city of the South Africa Rugby Football Board in 1889.\nIn 1889 the first nationwide tournament was held at Kimberley, with the Western Province (rugby team) prevailing over Griqualand West, Eastern Province and Transvaal.\nThe first-ever tour of the British Isles by a team from Southern Africa (drawing on players from the then independent republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and the British colonies of the Cape and Natal) took place in 1891, with the trip financially underwritten by (the British arch imperialist) Cecil Rhodes of the Cape and (the resolutely Boer) President Kruger of the Transvaal Republic. Seven years later Britain was at war with the Boer republics, and during the Boer war British troops would play a key role in entrenching the game throughout the country, and games amongst the Boer population in prisoner of war camps popularised the game further.\nFrom the early years the game had been enthusiastically and passionately adopted by coloured and black populations in the Cape colony, and the Eastern Cape in particular, but rugby organisation (under the South Africa Coloured Rugby Board formed in 1896) and teams were kept segregated with discrimination against black and coloured players and little government funding.\nEven before the 1948 elections in South Africa in which the apartheid government came to power and legislated systematically along racial lines, foreign sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nēpia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of \"Ranji\" Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time.\nFrom 1960, international criticism of apartheid in particular grew in the wake of \"The Wind of Change\" speech by the British Prime Minister, Macmillan, and the Sharpeville massacre near Johannesburg in South Africa. From then onward, the Springboks, perceived as prominent representatives of apartheid South Africa, were increasingly isolated internationally.\nComing shortly after the Soweto riots as it did, the 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa attracted international condemnation and 28 countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest. The next year, in 1977, the Commonwealth signed the Gleneagles Agreement, which discouraged any sporting contact with South Africa. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was stopped by the French government, which announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France, and after the 1981 Springbok tour of New Zealand went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement, South Africa was banned by the International Rugby Board from international competition until such time as apartheid ended.\nFrom 1990 to 1994 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and in 1992 the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby. On 23 March 1992 the non-racial South African Rugby Union and the South African Rugby Board were merged to form the South African Rugby Football Union. The unified body changed its name in 2005 to the current South African Rugby Union.\nSA Rugby celebrated 100 years of test rugby in 2006 and unveiled a new logo at a function at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. Celebrations continued later in the year, with two tests against England at Twickenham.\nPresent.\nAccording to World Rugby, South Africa has 434,219 registered players broken down into: 157,980 pre-teen males; 121,879 teen males; 143,722 senior males (total male players 423,581); 1,653 pre-teen females; 5,504 teen females; 3,481 senior females (total female players 10,638). However, this is an old report.\nThere are 4,074 referees.\nGoverning body.\nFrom 1990 to 1991 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and in 1992 the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby. On 23 March 1992 the non-racial South African Rugby Union and the South African Rugby Board (the government-approved white-only governing body) were merged to form the South African Rugby Football Union. The unified body changed its name in 2005 to the current South African Rugby Union.\nNational team.\nThe national team are known as the Springboks. The jersey is a dark myrtle green with a gold collar and a logo of a leaping springbuck and a protea.\nThe \"Springbok\" nickname and logo dates from the 1906/7 tour of Britain. The logo was not restricted to the white team alone though, the first coloured national team used the springbok in 1939 and the first black team in 1950.\nNational sevens team.\nSouth Africa also occupies an important place in the sevens version of the sport. The country hosts one of the 10 events in the annual Sevens World Series. From 2001 through 2010, it was held at Outeniqua Park in George, a community along the Garden Route in the Western Cape. Starting in 2011, the tournament moved to the Eastern Cape and the much larger Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, and moved again in 2015 to Cape Town and Cape Town Stadium. The Cape Town Sevens has since become one of the biggest annual events on the South African sporting calendar, attracting numerous local and international visitors over the course of the weekend on which it is held. South Africa's national team, known as Springbok Sevens, and also nicknamed \"Blitzbokke\", have become one of the sport's top national sides, as evidenced by their victory in the 2008–09 IRB Sevens World Series and recently in both 2016–2017 and 2017–18. Cape Town is scheduled to host the 2022 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nDomestic competitions.\nMen's competitions.\nSuper Rugby.\nSuper Rugby is an international provincial competition initially featuring teams from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. South Africa withdrew its franchises in September 2020.\nThe Super 10 (predecessor to Super Rugby) was won in 1993 by Transvaal but the Super Rugby competition was not won by a South African team until 2007, when South Africa provided the two finalists, the Bulls and the Sharks. The Bulls scored a last-second win over the Sharks in the final. The Bulls went on to win the last two titles under the Super 14 format, handing the Chiefs of New Zealand a record 61–17 thrashing in the 2009 final and defeating the Stormers in the 2010 final.\nUnited Rugby Championship.\nFour South African teams have been playing in the United Rugby Championship since the 2021–22 season, alongside teams from Ireland, Wales, Italy and Scotland. The teams are:\nPrior to that, the Cheetahs and Southern Kings played during the previous version of the tournament, the Pro14, from the 2017–18 season. This followed their axing from Super Rugby after its 2017 season.\nCurrie Cup.\nThe Currie Cup tournament has been the premier domestic rugby union in South Africa since its first edition in 1892. Since then, the number of teams participating in the competition varied in different seasons, with the Currie Cup trophy being awarded to the champions of the top tier. Other trophies, such as the Percy Frames Trophy, the W.V. Simkins Trophy and the South African Cup (currently awarded to the winners of the First Division), were also on offer.\nOther competitions.\nBetween 1983 and 1994, teams also competed in a knockout cup competition called the Lion Cup. There was no competition in 1995, as South African rugby adjusted to the advent of professional rugby, but in 1996, a new competition – the Bankfin Nite Series – was launched. That lasted for two seasons before being replaced by the Vodacom Cup. The Vodacom Cup was held between 1998 and 2015 and included teams from Argentina, Namibia, Kenya and the South African Limpopo province in addition to the fourteen South African provincial sides. The Vodacom Cup was discontinued in 2015 and replaced for 2016 with a one-off expanded Currie Cup before its permanent replacement, the Rugby Challenge, launched in 2017. The Challenge now includes only South African sides, plus the Namibian team that had sporadically featured in the Vodacom Cup.\nSince 2008, the Varsity Cup is an annual tournament held between the top university club sides in South Africa. In 2011, a second tier known as the Varsity Shield was added to the schedule.\nNon-university club sides can also compete for national honours; they compete in the annual Gold Cup competition, which was launched in 2013. It was preceded by a similar competition called the National Club Championships.\nThere are also several youth competitions; all the provincial sides compete annually in the Under-21 and Under-19 Provincial Championships. The premier schools competition is known as the Craven Week (there are two editions of this competition – an Under-18 competition for high schools and an Under-13 competition for primary schools), and the other national youth weeks are the Under-18 Academy Week, the Under-16 Grant Khomo Week and the Under-18 LSEN Week for Learners with Special Educational Needs.\nWomen's competitions.\nWomen's Premier Division.\nThe Women's Premier Division was first played in 2003. The Bulls Daisies became the country's first professional team in 2023.\nThe Women's First Division is the second tier competition.\nInternational competitions.\nRugby World Cup.\nSouth Africa did not take part in the first two World Cups, held in 1987 and 1991, as they were still under an international boycott due to apartheid. South Africa however did play an important role in the first World Cup; despite knowing that they would not be able to participate, the delegates voted in favor and provided the swing vote for the World Cup.\nSince then South Africa have won the World Cup four times, in 1995 in their first appearance when they also hosted the event, and again in 2007, 2019 and 2023. The 1995 tournament concluded with then President Nelson Mandela (at the time described as the world's most famous former political prisoner), wearing a Springbok jersey and matching baseball cap, presenting the trophy to the South Africa's captain François Pienaar (a young Afrikaner). Given the political history of South Africa, the moment is seen as one of the most emotional in the sport's history and symbolic of reconciliation and the birth of a new, free South Africa as a \"rainbow nation\".\nIn 2007 the Springboks repeated their 1995 feat winning the 2007 World Cup by defeating England at Stade de France. In the 2011 World Cup, the Boks only managed to reach the quarter-final stage where they were beaten by Australia.\nSouth Africa won the Rugby World Cup for a third time in 2019, once again defeating England, 32–12 in the final in Yokohama.\nSouth Africa won the Rugby World Cup for a fourth time in 2023, once again defeating New Zealand at Stade de France., 12–11 in the final. Upon winning the fourth time, the Springboks became the only team to have held 4 World Cup titles and only the second team to win back-to-back championships.\nTri Nations and The Rugby Championship.\nThe Tri Nations was an annual competition involving New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. Previously this involved each country playing one home and one away game against both other countries. From 2006 the competition was expanded with each nation playing both the other nations three times (except in Rugby World Cup years). Since 's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup a number of commentators believed they should join the Tri-Nations. This was firstly proposed for the 2008 tournament, then for 2010, but eventually this prospect came much closer to reality after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, when SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) extended an official invitation to the Unión Argentina de Rugby (UAR), to join a new revised Four Nations tournament in 2012. This long-anticipated move was generally met with great approval from all parties involved. The invitation was however subject to certain conditions, like the guaranteed availability of the top Puma players, most of whom play highly paid professional club rugby in Europe at present.\nWith Argentina's entry ultimately confirmed, the Tri Nations was renamed The Rugby Championship. The involvement of the Pumas caused the competition to revert to a pure home-and-away series.\nThe Freedom Cup (against New Zealand) and the Mandela Challenge Plate (against Australia) are competed for as part of The Rugby Championship.\nAfrica Cup.\nThe Africa Cup is an annual competition involving ten African nations. South Africa sent its top amateurs to this competition up until 2007."

They remained in the Premier Division of the Currie Cup until the end of 2011 season after beating the from the Southern Cape in promotion/relegation matches at the end of 2009 and 2010.

        "title": "Matt Bush (baseball)",
        "text": "Matthew Brian Bush (born February 8, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers and Milwaukee Brewers. He was drafted by the San Diego Padres with the first overall draft pick in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft.\nDue to numerous personal and legal problems, Bush had only played as high as Double-A, two steps below the MLB level, prior to his MLB debut on May 13, 2016. He was traded by the Padres to the Toronto Blue Jays in 2009, but was released by the Blue Jays without ever playing for them. He then played in the Tampa Bay Rays organization before being released in 2012 after a drunk driving incident. He pleaded no contest to charges related to that incident in December 2012, and was sentenced to 51 months in state prison. He served 39 months, and signed with the Texas Rangers after his October 2015 release from prison. He returned to play in an April 2016 game with the Rangers' Double-A affiliate, leading to his call up, and first MLB pitch, in the aforementioned May 13 game.\nEarly life.\nBush attended Mission Bay High School in San Diego, California. He played shortstop, where his defense and arm strength made him a top major league prospect. He had a .450 batting average with 11 home runs and 35 runs batted in (RBIs). He also pitched, and he threw a 94 mph fastball with a solid curveball. Bush had a 5–1 win–loss record with two saves and a 0.73 earned run average (ERA). Bush was considered one of the best five-tool players ever to come out of high school.\nHe also played soccer and ran track in high school.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nHe was selected first overall by the San Diego Padres in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft, originally as a shortstop. When he signed with the Padres, he received a signing bonus of $3.15 million, the second-largest signing bonus ever given to a Padres draft pick. As it turned out, Bush was actually the Padres' third choice, as they wanted one of two collegiate stars, Stephen Drew or Jered Weaver. However, both were represented by Scott Boras, who was known for demanding hefty bonuses for his clients. Padres owner John Moores was unwilling to meet those demands, so he selected Bush. Bush became the first shortstop drafted first overall from high school since the Seattle Mariners selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993.\nBush's professional career began with his suspension before he ever took the field, for his role in a fight outside an Arizona bar. The shortstop went on to hit .192 in 99 at bats between the Rookie-level Arizona League and the short-season Northwest League.\nIn the 2005 season, Bush hit .221 in 453 at bats for the Fort Wayne Wizards of the Single-A Midwest League. During spring training in 2006, he broke his ankle and missed half the season.\nBush struggled again in 2007, hitting for a .583 OPS as of May 28. The Padres then converted Bush to a pitcher. \nHis fastball reached a speed of , and he had prior knowledge of pitching from his days as a high school ace. After a promising start in rookie league, Bush tore a ligament in his pitching elbow in August 2007, ending his season. He had Tommy John surgery, sidelining him for 2008 as well. The Padres, however, would place Bush on the 40-man roster after the 2008 season to protect him from being selected in the Rule 5 draft.\nBush was designated for assignment on February 5, 2009, to make room for Cliff Floyd. Shortly afterward, it was learned that Bush was allegedly intoxicated in a high school parking lot where he assaulted two freshman lacrosse players.\nOn February 10, 2009, Bush was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later or cash considerations. The Blue Jays, well aware of his behavioral problems, put him on a \"zero tolerance\" policy. At a party on March 30, he reportedly threw a baseball at a woman's head and banged on her car window after accusing her of drawing markings on his face at a party in Dunedin, Florida. The Blue Jays released him the next day. He would be out of baseball for the entire 2009 season.\nOn January 28, 2010, Bush signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. He played one injury-plagued season for the Single-A Charlotte Stone Crabs in the Florida State League before being added to the Rays' 40-man roster in November. During the 2011 season, Bush played for the Rays' Double-A affiliate, the Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League, primarily as a late reliever and occasional closer. He was promoted to the Rays' top affiliate, the Durham Bulls, in September, but never appeared during their playoff drive. Bush was slated to begin the 2012 season in Durham, but the Rays placed Bush on the restricted list after a drunken Bush ran over a 72-year-old man's head during spring training and was released shortly after the 2012 season ended.\nTexas Rangers (2016–2018, 2021–2022).\nOn December 18, 2015, the Texas Rangers signed Bush to a minor league contract, two months after his release from prison. He was signed after tryouts at a Golden Corral parking lot in Jacksonville, Florida (the only place Bush could work out; due to his post-release restrictions he could only travel to and from his Golden Corral job).\nThe Rangers had experience with players struggling with substance abuse issues (notably Josh Hamilton, also a former #1 overall pick). Bush was placed on a zero-tolerance policy. His father, Danny, accompanied him to games and lived with him, paying out of his own pocket. On April 7, 2016, Bush threw his first professional pitch in almost five years for the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Texas League, as he earned a save in one inning, while allowing one hit.\nOn May 13, 2016, Bush was called up to the major leagues by the Rangers. He worked the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays that night, retiring the heart of the Jays \nlineup (Josh Donaldson, José Bautista, and Edwin Encarnación) by inducing a double-play off the bat of Edwin Encarnación after hitting José Bautista with a pitch. On May 15, Bush earned his first major league win in a 7–6 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, a game more noted for the scuffle between Rougned Odor and José Bautista that would wind up in a bench-clearing brawl. Bush made 58 appearances out of the bullpen in 2016, finishing with a 7–2 record, a 2.48 ERA, and one save.\nOn April 12, 2017, it was revealed that Bush was diagnosed with AC joint soreness in his right shoulder. In 57 relief appearances for Texas in 2017, he was 3–4 with a 3.78 ERA and 58 strikeouts in 52.1 innings pitched.\nBush began 2018 with the Rangers. However, he was demoted to the Triple-A Round Rock Express on April 25 to work on his command as he had walked nine batters in 11.1 innings pitched along with posting a 1.50 WHIP.\nBush underwent surgery on his right elbow to fix a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in September 2018. The procedure was expected to keep him from game action until the second half of the 2019 season.\nOn December 17, 2018, Bush re-signed with the Texas Rangers on a minor-league contract, after being non-tendered earlier in the offseason. Bush opened the 2019 season on the injured list as he recovered from surgery. He was activated on June 8 and assigned to Frisco. On July 3, the Rangers announced that Bush suffered a torn UCL and would undergo a second Tommy John surgery; ending his 2019 season. He became a free agent following the 2019 season. On December 16, 2019, he re-signed with Texas on a two-year minor league contract as he recovered from the surgery.\nOn April 1, 2021, Bush was selected to the 40-man roster. On April 12, 2021, it was announced that Bush would miss at least 12 weeks due to a flexor strain. He was placed on the 60-day injured list the next day. On November 5, 2021, Bush was outrighted off of the 40-man roster. On April 5, 2022, Bush had his contract selected to the major league roster.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2022–2023).\nOn August 1, 2022, Bush was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for infielder Mark Mathias and pitcher Antoine Kelly. On November 18, Bush signed a one-year, $1.85 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding arbitration.\nIn 2023, Bush made 12 appearances for Milwaukee, struggling to a 9.58 ERA with 10 strikeouts and 1 save across innings of work. On July 1, 2023, Bush was designated for assignment by the Brewers. The removal of Bush from the roster came the night after he allowed a two–run, walk–off home run to Carlos Santana of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bush was released by Milwaukee on July 3.\nTexas Rangers (second stint).\nOn July 12, 2023, Bush signed a minor league contract to return to the Texas Rangers organization. In 9 games for the Triple–A Round Rock Express, he posted a 2.13 ERA with 16 strikeouts and 2 saves in innings pitched. On September 30, the Rangers selected Bush's contract, adding him to the major league roster.\nCriminality and incarceration.\nA few weeks after the Padres drafted him in 2004, Bush was arrested on suspicion of felony assault, misdemeanor trespass, disorderly conduct, and underage drinking, after he allegedly fought with security trying to escort him out of a bar.\nIn early 2009, Bush was allegedly involved in a drunken assault at a San Diego high school, which was caught on camera. According to witnesses, a drunken Bush beat up a high school lacrosse player with a golf club while screaming, \"I'm Matt fucking Bush!,\" which was recorded on videotape. This led the Padres to designate Bush for assignment following the team's signing of Cliff Floyd and then trade him to the Blue Jays. Only a month later, he assaulted and berated a woman at a party in Florida, and was released by the Blue Jays for violating a \"zero tolerance\" agreement.\nOn March 22, 2012, Bush was arrested and charged with two counts of DUI with property damage, one count of DUI with serious bodily injury, one count of leaving the scene of an accident with an injury, one count of driving with a suspended license, and 2 counts of leaving the scene of an accident with damage to property. In the incident, Bush hit 72-year-old motorcyclist Tony Tufano on the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41) northbound in Port Charlotte, Florida, running over his head as he fled the scene in a Dodge Durango belonging to teammate Brandon Guyer. According to a witness, Tufano survived the incident because he was wearing a helmet. Bush was arrested in North Port, three miles down the road from the accident. He was on the road after getting kicked out of a nearby strip club for trying to climb on the stage. When he was arrested, Bush had a blood alcohol content of .18, more than double the legal limit in Florida. Bush spent the 2012 season housed at the Charlotte County Jail on $440,000 bail (reduced from an initial $1.015 million bond), and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment (via closed-circuit TV from the Charlotte County Jail) on May 21. Bush remains a suspect in two other hit and run accidents further north on the Tamiami Trail in Venice that occurred earlier that day. The following Sunday, Rays general manager Andrew Friedman announced that Bush would never play for the Rays organization again. The Rays placed Bush on the restricted list for the 2012 season, meaning that he was no longer on the 40-man roster, nor did he accumulate service time. He was officially released on October 6.\nOn December 18, 2012, Bush accepted a plea bargain and pleaded no contest to one count of DUI with great bodily injury. He was sentenced to 51 months in prison. As this was Bush's third DUI conviction in 10 years, he was banned from driving legally in Florida for 10 years after his release from prison. In the process, Bush turned down a deal that had less prison time (3 years), but with 7 years probation owing to past alcoholism issues. The Tufanos filed a $5 million civil suit against Bush, but settled in 2013 for a reported $200,000.\nBush was housed at the Mayo Correctional Institution in Mayo, Florida, as of January 2015. He was released from prison on October 30, 2015."

        "text": "The Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf at Big Cedar was a golf tournament on the PGA Tour Champions. From 2014 to 2019, it was played at Big Cedar Lodge in Ridgedale, Missouri on the par-3 Top of the Rock course, designed by Jack Nicklaus and the 18-hole Buffalo Ridge course, redesigned by Tom Fazio. The tournament was sponsored by Bass Pro Shops, which owns the Big Cedar Lodge. It is often called \"The tournament that launched the Champions Tour\". Starting in 2018, a second par-3 course, Mountain Top, a 13-hole course designed by Gary Player, was added to the tournament, which has the oddity of being a 67-hole tournament.\nFrom 1978 until 2012, it was known as the Liberty Mutual Insurance Legends of Golf. Prior to Big Cedar Lodge, it was played in Savannah, Georgia, at The Club at Savannah Harbor. Liberty Mutual was the main sponsor of the tournament.\nIn its final years, it consisted of two separate events using four-ball and alternate shot formats with two-man teams: the 67-hole Champions Division (age 50–65) and the 58-hole Legends Division (age 65+) (on the final day of the tournament, held at Top of the Rock, Legends played the course once, while Champions played the course twice). Only the Champions Division event was an official money/official victory event.\nFor 2002 to 2013, it consisted of three separate events: the Legends Division is a 54-hole two-man team better-ball event for men over 50, the Raphael Division is a 36-hole two-man team better-ball event for men age 50–69, and the Demaret Division is a 36-hole two-man team better-ball event for men over 70. Only the Legends Division event was an official money/official victory event.\nFrom 2014 until 2016, the tournament was held over 54 holes, one round at Buffalo Ridge, and four nine-hole rounds at Top of the Rock. In 2017, because of weather that washed out play and made the full Buffalo Ridge course unplayable, all 36 (or 27) holes were played at Top of the Rock, the first time a PGA Tour event was held exclusively on a Par 3 course.\nThe tournament was founded in 1978 and consisted of a 72-hole two-man team better-ball event for men over 50. Its success provided impetus for the formation of the Senior PGA Tour in 1980. In 1987, a Legendary Division was added. This consisted of a 36-hole two-man team better-ball event for men over 60. These teams also competed in the Legends Division - Charles Coody &amp; Dale Douglass won both divisions in 1998. In 1993, the 36-hole Demaret Division (named after tournament co-founder Jimmy Demaret) was added for men over 70. For this year alone, all three divisions were competed at individual stroke play. In 2002 the Legends Division became an individual stroke play event and became an official money event on the Champions Tour. This format remained through 2007. The Legendary Division was renamed the Raphael Division (after tournament co-founder Fred Raphael who had died in 2001) and became the 36-hole two-man team better-ball event for men over 60.\nThe purse for the 2019 tournament was $1.8 million, with $171,000 going to each member of the winning team.\nTournament hosts.\nThe tournament has been played in several different locations since its founding.\nTeam winners.\nMultiple winners.\nThe following teams have won multiple times through 2017:\nThe following individuals have won multiple times (as part of a team or individually) through 2017:"

He served as the head football coach at the University of Oklahoma for one season in 1966 before his sudden death the following spring.\nEarly years.\nA native of Gary, Indiana, Mackenzie played college football at the University of Kentucky for head coach Bear Bryant, and was an assistant coach under Frank Broyles for nine years, one at the University of Missouri and eight at the University of Arkansas.\nOklahoma.\nAfter the 1965 season, Mackenzie was hired as the head coach at the University of Oklahoma in December. He succeeded Gomer Jones, a longtime Sooner assistant who had failed to match the success of the legendary Bud Wilkinson, but remained as athletic director. The Sooners' 3–7 record under Jones in 1965 was the worst in program history (until 1996).\nIn his first season in 1966, Mackenzie led the Sooners to a 6–4 record, defeated rival Texas for the first time in nine years, upset undefeated rival Nebraska on Thanksgiving, and was named the Coach of the Year in the Big Eight Conference.\nDeath.\nEntering his second season, Mackenzie died at age 37 of a heart attack in late April. He collapsed at his Norman home after returning from a brief recruiting trip to north Texas during a break in spring practice. He was survived by his wife, Sue Newell, and two children, Katheryn and James, Jr.\nRecently departed assistant Homer Rice, the first-year head coach at Cincinnati, turned down the chance to take over for Mackenzie. Assistant coach Chuck Fairbanks, age 33, was promoted to head coach in early May."

He was born in Hargawan, a village in Bihar Sharif, in the Indian State of Bihar. His family moved to Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh where he was brought up. Iqbal started out playing football as child, before taking to hockey in 1969–70 encouraged by his father's colleague and hockey enthusiast, Professor Khan. He was mentored by Swami Jagan Nath, hockey coach of the AMU during that time and manager of India national team during the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Alongside hockey, Iqbal pursued a degree in civil engineering from AMU graduating in 1978 securing 74 per cent marks.\nProfessional career.\nIqbal was selected for the combined university trials after being selected on back of good performances during the inter-university games; Zafar playing for AMU. Iqbal good performances against the India national team which included scoring a goal against Leslie Fernandez prompted his selection to the national team for its tour of Netherlands in 1977. Iqbal till that point had always played in the left-in position, but was asked by coach Kishan Lal to play left-out because Surinder Singh Sodhi played in the former.\nIqbal played at the Asian Games in 1978 at Bangkok and was the captain of the team at New Delhi in 1982, winning the silver medal in both. The crowning glory of his illustrious career in hockey came to him in 1980 when he represented India at the Moscow Olympics and brought home the gold medal after a long hiatus. Further, he had the honour of carrying the Indian Tricolour of the Indian squad at the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics 1984. He also won the bronze medal for the country at the Champion's Trophy 1982 in Holland and won many other tournaments against Pakistan, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, West Germany and other European nations.\nAchievements.\nHis extraordinary game as “Left Out” in the Indian blue jersey with the number 11 embossed at the back is a glorious part of the history of Indian Hockey. After hanging his hockey sticks he immersed himself in coaching as the Chief National Coach, head Coach and National Selector for the Indian hockey squad. The team coached by him won the silver medal at the Asian Games in Hiroshima in 1994.\nMr. Zafar Iqbal is a strong proponent of hard work, team spirit, camaraderie and symbiotic partnership amongst team members. He stresses upon the adoption of modern innovations like sports physiology and psychology in Indian sports administration. He also believes that universities are the nurseries for talent, honing them to represent the country and he has contributed time and again to AMU, making it a nurturing ground for budding talent. Widely and rightly acknowledged by the print and electronic media as the ‘Gentleman of Hockey.\nThe country conferred Mr. Zafar Iqbal with the highest honour for a sportsman, the “Arjuna Award” in 1983. In 2012, the President of India honoured him with the “Padma Shri” for his invaluable services and the U. P. Government gave him the highest citizen award of the state, “Yash Bharti” in 1994. He was felicitated at the ‘Golden Greats’ platform by ‘Hockey India’ along with 34 other Olympic Gold Medalists in 2012.

For a period of 18 years he played for Punjab Police, and led the team a couple of times during the tenure. Udham was named the Captain of the State Hockey team of Punjab in 1954.\nInternational Hockey.\nUdham Singh would have made his Olympics debut in London in 1948, but due to a finger injury he missed the chance. He played in a Hockey Series against Afghanistan in 1949, contributing to India’s victory. Udham was a part of the Indian Hockey squad at Helsinki Olympics in 1952 where Captain K.D. Singh Babu led the Indian team to a Gold Medal win, and at the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 where Balbir Singh Senior successfully led the Indian team to save the Gold Medal. Udham also played in the Rome Olympics in 1960 and at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, his last Olympic games. At Rome, Pakistan defeated India in the Finals, while the Indian team snatched its Gold Medal back from Pakistan in Tokyo defeating the opponents by 1-0. Udham delivered his best performance at the Tokyo Asian Games in 1958 but still couldn’t get India the Gold as Pakistan beat India on the basis of better goal average.\nUdham Singh is one of the two hockey players to win 3 golds and a silver in the Olympics, the other being Leslie Claudius. He was also awarded the Arjuna Award by the Indian Government. He was a Half back but had the adaptability to play from Left Inside, Right Inside, Center Forward and Center Half positions as well.\nCaptaincy.\nHe was named the Captain of the Indian Hockey Federation team that went to a Warsaw tour in 1955 and to East Africa in 1959. Udham also led the Indian squad to World Cup Hockey held at Lyons, France.\nCoaching.\nUdham Singh served as the Coach of the Indian Hockey team and successfully got the team a bronze Medal at the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and the silver medal at the Bangkok Asian Games in 1970. After his retirement from playing hockey, he turned to coaching young male teams.\nReferences.\nsports-reference"

From 1901 through 1907, he played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1901–04) and Cincinnati Reds (1907). O'Neill batted and threw right-handed. A native of Maam, Ireland, he played as \"Michael Joyce\" in his 1901 rookie year with the Cardinals.\nBirth.\nHe was born in the village of Maum, in County Galway, Ireland, to Michael O'Neill, a landholder, and Mary Joyce.\nCareer.\nO'Neill was a good-hitting pitcher who occasionally played in the left field. In 1901, he ended with a 2–2 record and a 1.32 earned run average, including a shutout, and hit .400 (6-for-15). His most productive season came in 1902, when he posted an 18–12 record with two shutouts, a 2.75 ERA, and two saves. On June 3, he was rested until being summoned as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning with the bases loaded. O'Neill responded by hitting the first pinch grand slam in major league history off Togie Pittinger of the Boston Beaneaters. It was an inside-the-park home run as O'Neill became the first National League pitcher to hit a grand slam in the 20th century.\nDespite his 3.26 ERA in 1903, O'Neill had a 4-13 record, in part due to poor run support, as he posted a WHIP of 1.56. He went 10-14 with a 2.09 ERA in 1904 and did not return with St. Louis the next year. He also played with the Cincinnati Reds in 1907, strictly as a reserve left fielder and pinch-hitter, retiring from baseball at the end of the season. In a four-season pitching career, O'Neill posted a 32–44 record with 228 strikeouts and a 2.73 ERA in 694.1 innings. He completed 68 games in 77 starts. In five seasons, he was a .255 hitter with two home runs and 41 RBI in 137 games played (85 as a pitcher).\nO'Neill died in Scranton, Pennsylvania at the age of 81.\nMLB Record.\nPitching Record.\n\"Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\"\nBatting Record.\n\"Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\"\nFamily.\nO'Neill was one of four brothers who played in the major leagues:"

        "title": "Ski jumping at the 1928 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The men's ski jumping at the 1928 Winter Olympics took place at the Olympiaschanze in St. Moritz, Switzerland, on 18 February. Thirty-eight competitors from thirteen nations competed, with the event being won by Norway's Alf Andersen ahead of countryman Sigmund Ruud and Czechoslovakia's Rudolf Burkert.\nNorway sent a strong contingent with four jumpers able to win the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the in-run.\nVenue.\nThe event took place at Olympiaschanze, located in the neighborhood of St. Moritz Bad. The town's first ski jumping hill, Julierschanze, opened in 1895. However, it was not large enough for the Olympic tournaments, forcing the town to build a larger venue. Construction started in 1926 and the venue in inaugurated on 20 January 1927. Olympiaschanze had a size of and a crowd of 8,000 people attended the event. The venue had also hosted the Nordic combined event and would later be used for the 1948 Winter Olympics.\nBackground.\nNorway sent a strong delegation with four participants able to win the event. Jacob Tullin Thams had won the 1924 Winter Olympics event and has also won the 1926 World Championships, making him reigning Olympic and world champion. The rest of the delegation consisted Alf Andersen, Sigmund Ruud—the oldest of the Ruud brothers—and Hans Kleppen. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualifications for the Olympics. Other favorites were Rudolf Burkert, who had won and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event, and the host nation's Gérard Vuilleumier. Asia participated for the first time in an international tournament, represented by Japan's Motohiko Ban.\nCanada had originally planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world record for the longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.\nRace.\nThe jury consisted of Østgaard of Norway, Jilek of Czechoslovakia and Straumann of Switzerland. Because of ice on the in-run, a reduced speed was used during the first round. Andersen jumped 60.0 meters, by far the longest jump. Lengthwise, Ruud and Vuilleumier were in joint second place with 57.5 meters, while Burket was in fourth with 57.0 meters. Thams, Kleppen and Poland's Bronisław Czech all jumped 56.5 meters, but both Kleppen and Czech fell. In terms of points, the three Norwegians Andersen, Ruud and Thams were in the lead, ahead of Burket and Vuilleumier.\nIn the break, a number of Central Europeans, including Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm that they had not given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0 meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5 meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.\nAndersen and Ruud skied down the in-run in a standing position to reduce their speed, and had the two longest standing jumps.\nThe event is regarded as the international break-through for Ruud. Thams gave full speed and landed at 73.0 meters, but fell and ended on a 28th place. Had he stood, it would have been a new world record. The wounds were serious enough that he had to be taken to hospital. Afterwards he stated: \"I at least showed those guys that we are not cowards\". Also Vuillemiuer and Trojani became subject to the higher speeds, both falling and ending with a 30th and 32nd place, respectively. Ban had the shortest jump in both rounds, fell in the first round, and ended last.\nResults.\nThe following is a list of all participants, noting their rank, country, the length in the first and second round, and the judge score for each of the three judges, as well as the final score. (F) denotes a fall.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 38 ski jumpers from 13 nations competed in the event:"

        "title": "1965 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1965 Tour de France was the 52nd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 22 June and 14 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . In his first year as a professional, Felice Gimondi, a substitute replacement on the team, captured the overall title ahead of Raymond Poulidor, the previous year's second-place finisher.\nGimondi became one of only seven riders, the others being Alberto Contador, Vincenzo Nibali, Chris Froome and five-time Tour winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault to have won all three of the major Tours. Besides Gimondi's first tour and win, it was a first for other reasons: the 1965 Tour started in Cologne, Germany (the first time the Tour started in Germany, and only the third time it started outside France), and it was the first time the start ramp was used in time trials.\nJan Janssen, who won the points classification the previous year successfully defended his title; he won another points title in 1967 and the overall title at the 1968 Tour de France.\nJulio Jiménez won two stages and his first of three consecutive mountains classification. Jiminez also won the mountains classification at the 1965 Vuelta a España – becoming one of (now) four riders to complete the Tour/Vuelta double by winning both races' mountains competitions in the same year.\nTeams.\nThe 1965 Tour started with 130 cyclists, divided into 13 teams of 10 cyclists. Each team had to include at least six cyclists with the same nationality. The Molteni–Ignis team was a combined team, with 5 cyclists from and 5 from .\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nJacques Anquetil, who won the previous four Tours de France (1961–1964), did not participate in this tour. Cyclists in that time earned most of their income in criteriums, and Anquetil believed that even if he would win a sixth time, he would not get more money in those races.\nThis made Raymond Poulidor, who finished second in the previous Tour, the main favourite.\nOther favourites were Italians Vittorio Adorni and Gianni Motta. Adorni had won the Giro d'Italia earlier that year, helped by his team-mate Felice Gimondi who finished third in his first year as a professional. Originally, Gimondi was not planning to start the 1965 Tour, but was asked to do so after several team-mates were ill.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1965 Tour de France started on 22 June, and had one rest day in Barcelona. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nThe race started in Germany, and the first stage, ending in Belgium, was won by Belgian Rik Van Looy. On the second stage, run over cobbles, three riders escaped: Bernard Vandekerkhove, Felice Gimondi and Victor Van Schil. Vandekerkhove won the stage, and became the new leader.\nOn the third stage, there was again a group away, including Gimondi and André Darrigade. Darrigade was one of the best sprinters of that time, so Gimondi knew he would not win if it would end in a sprint. Gimondi therefore escaped with one kilometre to go. Gimondi was able to stay away, and won the stage; it was the first victory in his professional career. Gimondi also took the lead in the general classification, represented by the yellow jersey; this made Gimondi a protected rider in his team because his sponsor wanted to keep the publicity associated with the yellow jersey as long as possible.\nThe second part of the fifth stage was run as an individual time trial. It was won by Raymond Poulidor, but Gimondi was second, and kept his lead. He had a margin in the general classification of over two minutes on Vandekerkhove, while his team leader Adorni was in third place.\nIn the seventh stage, Adorni fell. His team-mates, including Gimondi, waited for him and lost some time; because of this, Vandekerkhove took back the lead.\nThe ninth stage was the first Pyrenean stage, and during that stage eleven riders abandoned because of sickness. This included the leader of the general classification Vandekerkhove, and also Adorni. Rumours about doping that went wrong circulated, but nothing was ever proven. Gimondi became the leader of the general classification again, and because his team leader Adorni had left the race, he also became the undisputed leader of this team.\nThere were two more days in the Pyrenees, but these gave no big changes in the general classification. After stage eleven, Gimondi was still leading, with Poulidor in second place, more than three minutes behind. Poulidor expected that the inexperienced Gimondi would fail somewhere, and expected fourth-placed Motta to be his biggest rival. Poulidor announced he would attack on Mont Ventoux in stage fourteen.\nDuring that stage, Poulidor showed his strength, and won. He had a big margin over Motta, but Gimondi had stayed surprisingly close, and kept the lead in the general classification with 34 seconds.\nIn the following Alp stages, Poulidor did not attack; he planned to take the lead in the mountain time trial of stage eighteen. But this was won by Gimondi, who thus increased his lead.\nThe only realistic chance left for Poulidor to win back time was in the individual time trial that ended the race. Poulidor was a good time trialist, and on a good day he should have been able to win back enough time to win the race. But Gimondi was the fastest man that day, and won the stage, and thereby the Tour de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1965 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave \"stars\". The cyclist with the most \"stars\" in all stages lead the \"star classification\". Felice Gimondi won this classification. The jury gave Cees Haast the prize more most unlucky cyclist, because he lost his sixth place in the general classification after a fall, and the prize for most sympathetic cyclist to Gianni Motta, because he was always in a good mood and did not look for apologies after losing to Gimondi. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 17. This prize was won by Francisco Gabica."

It is also the only game in the series to allow users to purchase power-up items such as \"beef\" (for boosting the offensive line) and \"go juice\" (for a second wind on long gains) from a \"sideline shop\" during the game.\nThe game did not have licenses from the NFL, NFLPA or the NCAA. Because of this, pro teams were only referred to by city (Green Bay, Pittsburgh, etc.), state (Minnesota) or region (New England). Most of the college teams featured were ones with names that were based geographically (Michigan, Wisconsin, etc.) or militaristic (Army and Navy). This feature was purely cosmetic as the teams all played the same regardless of which one was chosen. It also allowed users to choose their own team colors no matter which team they chose.\nLike its predecessors, \"All-American Football\" involved the use of a \"spring stick,\" which required players to aim passes and kicks, making for more realistic gameplay."

        "title": "2004 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2004 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match played on 26 May 2004 to decide the winner of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League. AS Monaco, a Monaco-based club representing the French Football Federation, faced Portuguese side Porto at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Porto won the match 3–0, with Carlos Alberto, Deco and Dmitri Alenichev scoring the goals in a dominant game from Mourinho's Porto. Deco was named Man of the Match.\nPorto's previous triumph in the competition had been in 1987 – although they had won the UEFA Cup in the previous season – while Monaco were playing in their first ever UEFA Champions League final. Both teams started their campaigns in the group stage and defeated former European champions on their way to the final: Porto beat 1968 and 1999 winners Manchester United while Monaco defeated nine-time champions Real Madrid.\nBoth teams were considered underdogs in the competition before reaching the final stages and were led by young managers. Monaco had hired former France national football team star Didier Deschamps as manager and Porto were led by rising star José Mourinho, who left the club for Chelsea a week after the match.\nMonaco became the fourth club representing the French league to reach the final after Reims in 1956 &amp; 1959, Saint-Étienne in 1976, and Olympique de Marseille in 1991 &amp; 1993. This was the fifth final in the history of the European Cup in which neither of the teams came from England, Germany, Italy or Spain, the first since the 1991 final when Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia beat Marseille, and as of current, the last time a team not from the four previously mentioned countries won the final.\nBackground.\nMonaco.\nMonaco finished second in the French Ligue 1 the previous season, meaning that they entered the Champions League at the group stage. Monaco were placed in Group C, alongside Deportivo La Coruña, PSV and AEK Athens. After a 2–1 in their first win in the Netherlands and a 4–0 win at the Stade Louis II against AEK Athens, Monaco travelled to Spain, losing 1–0 by Deportivo. The Monegasque adventure really began after the return match against Deportivo, when Monaco won 8–3, which represented the highest number of goals in one match in the history of the new version of the UEFA Champions League; this record lasted until 22 November 2016, when Legia Warsaw lost 8–4 to Borussia Dortmund. Croatian striker Dado Pršo scored four times, while captain Ludovic Giuly (2), Jérôme Rothen, Jaroslav Plašil and Édouard Cissé pulverised the Spanish defensive line. After two more draws against PSV and AEK Athens, Monaco finished at the top of Group C.\nThe first knockout round saw Monaco winning against Lokomotiv Moscow after a 2–1 defeat in Russia and a win 1–0 at Stade Louis II. In the quarter-finals, Monaco played Real Madrid. After a 4–2 loss in Madrid (where Fernando Morientes scored, and was applauded by his former fans), Monaco created a sensation by defeating the Spanish 3–1 at home. Monaco played against Chelsea in the semi-finals, and despite the exclusion of Akis Zikos, Monaco found enough strength to score twice and win the game 3–1. The last goal was scored by striker Shabani Nonda, who just returned from a seven-month injury. The second leg at Stamford Bridge saw Monaco resisting Chelsea's strikes, for a final score of 2–2 to reach the European Cup final for the first time in their history.\nPorto.\nPorto, winners of the Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal and UEFA Cup in 2002–03, were the only Portuguese team in the group stage, after the elimination of Benfica in the third qualifying round by Italian side Lazio. Porto was drawn in Group F, along with Real Madrid, Marseille and Partizan. Porto's first match was at Partizan Stadium in Belgrade. Costinha scored the opening goal on 22 minutes, but Andrija Delibašić scored the equaliser on 54 minutes. The next match, the first at the Estádio das Antas, was a 3–1 loss to Real Madrid. Costinha scored the opening goal again, on seven minutes. Iván Helguera equalised on 28 minutes; Santiago Solari on 37 minutes and Zinedine Zidane on 67 scored Real Madrid's winning goals.\nTwo straight wins against Marseille followed by a win at home against Partizan secured Porto's place in the first knockout round before the last match of the group stage, a draw in Madrid. In the first knockout round, Porto met Manchester United. The Portuguese won 2–1 at home and managed to qualify in the final minutes of the second leg, when Costinha scored an equaliser in injury time in a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. In the quarter-finals, Porto met a French team for the second time in the tournament: a 2–0 win at home and a 2–2 draw in France eliminated Lyon from the competition. In the semi-finals, Porto played Deportivo La Coruña, eliminating them 1–0 on aggregate.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nMonaco, in their first European final since the 1992 Cup Winners Cup final, were up against Porto, the UEFA Cup winners from the previous season, who were appearing in the European Cup final for a second time, after defeating Bayern Munich in the 1987 European Cup final. Porto were the favourites after eliminating Manchester United and Deportivo La Coruña in the knockout phase, while Monaco had eliminated Real Madrid and Chelsea. Porto won the match 3–0; Carlos Alberto opened the scoring in the first half, while Deco and Dmitri Alenichev extended Porto's lead in the second half."

        "title": "Rugby union in Samoa",
        "text": "Rugby union in Samoa is the country's most popular sport. The national teams in both the standard 15-man game and rugby sevens are consistently competitive against teams from vastly more populous nations.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union is governed by Lakapi Samoa who are also members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance.\nSamoa were awarded 'second tier' status by the International Rugby Board which entitles them to funding from the IRB.\nLakapi Samoa was founded in 1924, as the \"Apia Rugby Union\", and affiliated to the NZRFU in the same year. As the Western Samoa Rugby Football Union, it joined the IRB in 1988. When Western Samoa amended its constitution to change the country's name from \"Western Samoa\" to \"Samoa\", the union also changed its name, and dropped the word football to become the \"Samoa Rugby Union\". The union is also a member of the Federation of Oceania Rugby Unions (FORU).\nHistory.\nThe Marist Brothers brought the game to Samoa in 1920 and The Apia Rugby Union was formed in 1924.\nOn August 18, 1924 Western Samoa played its first international against Fiji in the capital Apia, the visitors winning 6–0.\nThe Pacific Tri-Nations series between Tonga, Fiji and Western Samoa was established in 1982.\nThe Western Samoa Rugby Football Union joined the International Rugby Board in 1988. Western Samoa played in the World Cup for the first time in 1991.\nThe Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) was set up in 2002 as a basis of co-operation between the Fiji Rugby Union, Samoa Rugby Union and Tonga Rugby Football Union.\nIn 2006, the Pacific Tri-Nations was replaced by the IRB Pacific 5 Nations which was then renamed the Pacific Nations Cup. The IRB Pacific Rugby Cup started in 2006 with Upolu Samoa and Savaii Samoa representing Samoa.\nRugby was first introduced into Samoa around the turn of the 20th century, when it was still a German colony. It is believed that the first people to introduce it there were missionaries from New Zealand.\nFor many years, Western Samoa's international contact was confined to the other South Sea islands of Fiji and Tonga. This is partly because of the isolation of the islands. Their first international was against Fiji, in 1924, and featured a palm tree in the middle of the pitch.\nThere was also a large amount of contact with New Zealand, where many Samoans would migrate to in the 20th century.\nSamoa first came to major international attention in 1986, when they toured Wales. Their test against the Welsh national side produced a result of 32–14. This was also seen as a major turning point as previously there had been a debate as to whether to have an international team at all, as many players had traditionally defected to New Zealand. Samoa rugby's relationship with New Zealand rugby has been a mixed blessing. On the one hand it has allowed Samoa to recruit amongst the massive pool of first and second generation Samoan migrants in New Zealand, but conversely it also meant that for many Samoans, their highest ambition was to win a cap in the All Blacks. Notable Samoan-New Zealander players include Michael Jones and Peter Schuster.\nControversially Samoa was \"not\" invited to the first World Cup - although Tonga and Fiji were. This led to a massive campaign to build up a side good enough to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. They selected Bryan Williams, who had been a winger for the All Blacks to be their coach, and using a mixture of home grown backs such as Brian Lima and Mathew Vaea, and no nonsense New Zealand based forwards such as Mark Birtwistle, Pat Lam Mat Keenan, and Peter Fatialofa, he wielded a disparate group of talented individuals into a side which quickly came to dominate Fiji and Tonga and gain access to the world cup.\nSamoa's performance at the 1991 Rugby World Cup was superb, and proved that they were an international force to be reckoned with. After beating Wales in the first game in Cardiff, they beat Argentina. In a nail bitingly close finish, they were beaten 9-3 by Australia, who would later win the tournament. However, they were beaten 28-6 by Scotland.\nPopularity.\nRugby union is the most popular sport in Samoa, with 12 provincial unions made up of around 120 clubs and nearly 5,000 senior and twice as many junior players in a country with a population of just under 175,000 people.\nProminent Samoan players include Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu Alesana Tuilagi Freddie Tuilagi, Apollo Perelini, Lome Fa'atau, Lolani Koko, Pat Lam, Brian Lima, current sevens captain Lolo Lui, and two winners of the IRB International Sevens Player of the Year Award in Uale Mai and Mikaele Pesamino.\nThe huge numbers of players playing professionally abroad can work to Samoa's disadvantage when it comes to team training as it is difficult to get them all together as a squad. But Samoa still manage to remain competitive on the world-stage and are regarded as tough opponents.\nCompetitions.\nNational Provincial Championship.\nThis is the second highest level of domestic competition within Samoan rugby union and is a stepping stone for local players into international rugby. Teams play within their respective unions, and then the top teams from each union then contest the finals series held at Apia Park. The Apia West and Apia union teams usually dominate.\nPacific Rugby Cup.\nThe IRB Pacific Rugby Cup started in 2006 and involves representative teams from the three Pacific rugby unions, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. Samoa, along with Tonga and Fiji, have two sides in the tournament, Savaii Samoa and Upolu Samoa. The aim of the tournament is to improve the quality of rugby in the Pacific Islands.\nRepresentative teams.\nNational.\nThe national team known as Manu Samoa have competed at every Rugby World Cup since 1991, and have made the quarter-finals in 1991, 1995 and 1999.\nSamoa also play in the Pacific Nations Cup and the Pacific Tri-Nations. The sport is governed by Lakapi Samoa, were members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, and thus, also contributed to the international Pacific Islanders rugby union team.\nPacific Tri-Nations.\nThe Pacific Tri-Nations is the series between Tonga, Fiji and Samoa. It has been played since 1982. It was replaced by the Pacific Nations Cup.\nPacific Nations Cup.\nThe Pacific Nations Cup is a competition most often held between six Pacific rim sides; Fiji, Japan, Samoa, Tonga, Canada, and the United States. The inaugural competition in 2006, known as the IRB Pacific 5 Nations, featured New Zealand's \"A\" side, the Junior All Blacks. In 2007, Australia A joined the original IRB Pacific 5 Nations teams in the new IRB Pacific Nations Cup. The 2008 competition saw the Junior All Blacks replaced by the New Zealand Māori, a developmental side made up entirely of players from the country's indigenous Māori people. In 2009, Australia A did not play and the Junior All Blacks returned. The 2010 competition had no participation from Australia or New Zealand, and was won by Manu Samoa.\nNational (sevens).\nThe Samoa national rugby sevens team is one of the 15 \"core teams\" that compete in every event in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series. Long a solidly competitive side, Samoa Sevens burst into prominence in 2006–07, when they ran traditional favourites New Zealand and Fiji very close for the title. They cemented their status as one of the world's sevens powers by winning the 2009–10 season title.\nSamoa rules.\nSamoa rules is a traditional sport derived from Australian rules football and rugby union that is occasionally played in Samoa. It generally uses rugby pitches, H posts and 15-a-side teams, but is played to Australian rules otherwise."

Italy won their first match with Wales (30-22), finishing in 6th place for the first time in the process.\nThis was the sixth time in the Championship's history, but the first time since it became the Six Nations, that two teams met in the final round with undefeated records, both England and Ireland having won their first four games, making the final match a decider for the Grand Slam. It was also the first time Ireland had been involved: and the first that was won by the away team. Wales were whitewashed, losing all five of their games, and earned themselves the wooden spoon as a result.\nResults.\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nRed carpet incident.\nThe deciding game between Ireland and England was overshadowed by an incident in the pre-game ceremonies in which the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, had to walk on the grass instead of the red carpet to meet the Irish team. England had lined up on the left-hand side when facing the tunnel, which was said to be Ireland's lucky side. When asked to move his team, England captain Martin Johnson refused, so Ireland lined up to the left of them, with no team now on the right hand side, leaving insufficient red carpet on that side. A day after the game the Irish Rugby Football Union sent a written apology to the president for the England team's failure to \"follow established and communicated protocol\", while the Rugby Football Union also sent her a \"full and unreserved apology\". Having dismissed it at the time as \"a fuss about nothing\", Johnson later explained ahead of meeting the president again in Ireland for the 2011 Championship that he had lined up on that side as it was customary to line up on the side you warmed up on, that he had no prior knowledge of the protocol, and his subsequent refusal to move was because the request came from some \"random guy\", rather than the match referee."

        "title": "North Brisbane Rugby Club",
        "text": "North Brisbane Rugby Club or Norths is an Australian rugby union club. The club plays in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition, and fields teams for males and females in several other grades and age-group competitions.\nNorth Brisbane has undergone several mergers and name changes since being founded in 1933 as the Teachers Rugby Club. The club has won two Premierships; in 1963 (as Teachers), and in 1976 (as Teachers-Norths).\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, the North Brisbane area was represented by the Eagle Junction Rugby Football Club, which was founded in 1931 and then promoted to first grade for the 1935 season after starting in the lower grades of the Brisbane competition. The club went on win four first grade Premierships from 1935 to 1938. Eagle Junction merged with the original Northern Districts club in 1952, and was rebranded as the Northern Districts Rugby Football Club and continued to play in first grade until 1955, but went back to the lower grades and ultimately disappeared from the Brisbane club rugby scene in 1960.\nThe Teachers Training College Football Club played in the Brisbane Rugby League from 1927 in the lower grades until the end of the 1932 season. The club left the BRL competition and affiliated with the Queensland Rugby Union at the QRU Executive meeting on 21 March 1933.\nWith the Army Rugby Club dropping out of the \"A\" Grade competition in 1960, there was an opportunity to promote the Teachers Training College Club to the Brisbane first grade competition in 1961 and maintain the 7 team competition format. The club's first \"A\" Grade Premiership was won in 1963.\nHugh Courtney, then Principal of the College, maintained Teachers Rugby Club throughout the 60s and the early 70s. In 1974, Teachers amalgamated with the third club to use the Northern Districts name (founded in 1966) to become the Teachers-Norths Rugby Club. Teachers-Norths enjoyed a successful decade in the 1970s, winning the Premiership in 1976.\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Teachers-Norths was very competitive, with at least five Wallabies players in the team. The club contested all finals series during this period, and reached the Grand Final in 1981. But the nature of the teaching profession resulted in a large turn-over of players, with teachers graduating and moving away to take up positions outside Brisbane. By 1984, when Teachers-Norths moved to their present club facilities at Shaw Rd, the fortunes of the club were in decline.\nIn 1991, Teachers-Norths merged again; this time with Redcliffe Rugby Club (founded in 1969) to become the North Brisbane Rugby Club. Norths had a name change to the Brisbane Barbarians Rugby Club for a brief period in the late 90s, but reverted to North Brisbane Rugby Club for the 1999 season.\nIn 2001, Norths formed an alliance with Queensland University of Technology and became known as Norths-QUT, but the university moved away from an emphasis on sport and Norths decided to sever the alliance in 2008 to stand alone as the North Brisbane Rugby Club.\nChris Roche, a former Wallaby, and star player for Teachers-Norths during the 1970s and 1980s, became the club's Coaching Director in 2005. He fostered a strong relationship with players from Papua New Guinea and recruited many players of PNG heritage to the club, including Wallaby Will Genia, who elected to join his brother, Frank, at Norths in 2009.\nPremiership finals results.\nTEACHERS COLLEGE (1933–73)\nPremiers (Hospital Challenge Cup)\nRunners-Up (Vince Nicholls Memorial Trophy)\nTEACHERS-NORTHS (1974–90)\nPremiers (Hospital Challenge Cup)\nRunners-Up (Vince Nicholls Memorial Trophy)\nNORTH BRISBANE (1991–present)\nPremiers (Hospital Challenge Cup)\nRunners-Up (Vince Nicholls Memorial Trophy)\nRepresentative players.\nNorths players who have represented the Wallabies include: Dick Marks, John Cornes, Geoff Richardson, Laurie Lawrence, Rod Hauser, Greg Cornelsen, Tom Barker, Peter Horton, Michael O'Connor, Chris Roche, and Will Genia.\nIn addition, a number of players distinguished themselves at Queensland State level, including Greg Dux, Damien Barker, Peter Trehern, Michael Want and Nev Cottrell.\nChris Roche was the first person in the history of the Rothmans Medal (the forerunner to the XXXX Medal) to win the medal twice. Nev Cottrell from Norths also was a winner of this award.\nThree Norths Players have been named in the top 100 Wallabies of all time, being Greg Cornelsen, Michael O'Connor and Chris Roche.\nAs of 2018, Norths have four contracted players in Queensland Reds Super Rugby Squad: Karmichael Hunt, Duncan Paia'aia, Kane Douglas and Reece Hewat. Two other players, Nick Jooste and Tony Hunt, also spent the majority of the 2018 preseason with the Reds."

        "title": "Professional Women's Bowling Association",
        "text": "The Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) organizes and oversees a series of annual tournaments for the top competitive women ten-pin bowlers. The series is often referred to as the \"women's tour\" of bowling.\nThe PWBA was formed in 1960 but ceased operations in 2003. The PWBA Tour was re-launched in by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) and Bowling Proprietors' Association of America (BPAA) with a three-year funding commitment. In addition, through a new partnership with the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), the PBA began conducting PWBA Regional (women-only) events and PWBA members are now allowed to bowl all PBA events.\nHistory.\nThe PWBA was formed in 1960 by a group of professional women bowlers. After the organization struggled, some of the players left the PWBA in 1974 to form the Ladies' Professional Bowlers Association (LPBA). The two merged again in 1978, forming the Women's Professional Bowlers Association (WPBA). When the WPBA dissolved in 1981, bowling center proprietor John Sommer of Rockford, Illinois, started the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour (LPBT), a private company, to continue the women's tour. The LPBT adopted the PWBA name and a new logo in 1998. In the fall of 2003, the PWBA Tour ceased operations before the completion of its 2003 season, primarily due to dwindling interest in sponsoring women's bowling.\nThe Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) then acquired the rights and assets of the PWBA. This gave the WIBC control of the PWBA name, trademark, logo, website domain (pwba.com), as well as the PWBA's historical records. The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) acquired the PWBA when the WIBC merged with the American Bowling Congress (ABC), Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA) and USA Bowling in 2005.\nWithout a PWBA Tour, women either retired from professional bowling, competed in the remaining women-only tournaments in the United States, or moved on to other bowling tournaments outside of the United States. Wendy Macpherson started competing in the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA) in 2004, going on to earn ten JPBA titles. In 2007, the Japan Bowling Congress (JBC) started the DHC Cup Girls Bowling International - at the time the third largest women's tournament in the world in prize money, just behind the U.S. Women's Open (bowling) and the USBC Queens.\nSome women chose to bowl in professional men's tournaments. The Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) opened its membership to women in April 2004. PWBA members such as Kim Adler, Carolyn Dorin-Ballard, Liz Johnson, and Kelly Kulick became members of the PBA, with Kulick becoming the first female to earn an exemption on the PBA Tour ().\nWomen have had limited success in PBA events. Missy Parkin was the first female PBA member and now holds three PBA Regional Titles. Johnson was the first woman to make a televised appearance on the PBA Tour, at the , and the first to defeat a male bowler in a PBA Tour event when she beat Wes Malott in the semifinal match. She would lose to Tommy Jones in the championship final to finish runner-up. Kulick became the first woman to win a national PBA tournament major with her defeat of Chris Barnes in the . Johnson became the second woman to win a national PBA tournament with her defeat of Anthony Pepe in the at the 2017 World Series of Bowling.\nThe USBC sponsored the PBA Women's Series starting with the 2007–08 season, allowing women PBA members to compete in a small number of events without their male counterparts. The final head-to-head match for that week's women's tournament would air in the same telecast as the PBA men's final round. The PBA Women's Series was discontinued after the 2009–10 season.\nThe PBA created the PBA Women's Regional Tour program in 2014, in which women bowl with and against their male counterparts, but there are specific prizes and benefits for women only.\nIn the media before 2015.\nMany PWBA events were nationally televised on the TVS Television Network (as the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour) under a five year contract in the 1980s. When TVS could not maintain payments, it worked with Tom Ficara of the Cable Sports Network to continue coverage. After that agreement expired, Ficara acquired the TVS Network but did not renew the LPBT deal. LPBT final rounds were then televised on ESPN and ESPN2 from the late 1980s up until 2003, when the association folded. From 2004-2006, the WIBC Queens event (renamed USBC Queens in 2005) was the only scheduled event for female bowlers that received TV coverage.\nFor the autumn of 2007, the USBC acquired rights to the U.S. Women's Open. The event was televised for five Sundays on ESPN, with the action being called by PBA legends Nelson Burton Jr. and Marshall Holman. This event also served as the qualifier for the PBA Women's Series, a special four-stop mini-tour for the top 16 females. The finals for the mini-tour events were televised along with the regular PBA broadcasts for four Sundays on ESPN in November–December, 2007.\nThe U.S. Women's Open returned for five weeks in September–October, 2008. The PBA Women's Series was expanded to eight events in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons but was then discontinued.\nSeason-by-season breakdown.\n2015 PWBA rebirth.\nThe PWBA Tour returned from a 12-year hiatus in 2015, thanks to a three-year funding commitment from the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) and Bowling Proprietors’ Association of America (BPAA). The 2015 tour had ten stops (seven standard tournaments and three majors), running from May 13 to September 13.\n2016 season.\nThe PWBA Tour expanded to 13 events in 2016, with one additional major (GoBowling.com PWBA Players Championship). CBS Sports Network aired the final round of all PWBA Tour events this season on a tape-delay basis, except for majors which aired the final round live.\n2017 season.\nThe 2017 PWBA Tour retains the format of 2016, with nine standard tournaments and four majors. CBS Sports Network aired the final round of all PWBA Tour events this season on a tape-delay basis, except for majors which aired the final round live or same-day delay.\n2018 season.\nAlthough the three-year funding commitment from the USBC and BPAA ended with the 2017 season, the PWBA announced in 2017 a 2018 season with two enhancements. The final three standard events are replaced with \"elite format\" events in which the top 24 players on the 2018 PWBA points list after eight events will earn automatic spots, and the remaining eight spots will be filled through an on-site eight-game qualifier each week, for a total field of 32 players. More significantly, the finals of each of the 13 events will take place in the same center where the event's other play took place, with the finals of the standard format events live-streamed, and the finals of the elite format events and majors televised live on CBS Sports Network.\n2019 season.\nThe continued the enhancements started in 2018 and added one event, for a total of 14 events.\n2021 season.\nThe 2020 PWBA Tour season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe features 20 title events (the most since 2001), plus a non-title made-for-TV event hosted by the PBA Tour called King of the Lanes: Empress Edition.\n2022 season.\nThe 2022 PWBA Tour season had a total of 12 title events scheduled in eight locations. These included 8 standard singles title events, three major title events, and one mixed doubles event. While the 2022 schedule had a reduced number of tournaments from 2021, there were more events televised and prize funds increased over previous seasons.\n2023 season.\nThe 2023 PWBA Tour season was similar to 2022, with a total of 12 title events in eight cities. However, only the three major events were televised.\nTop 20 in professional titles.\nList includes singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles earned on the PWBA, WPBA, LPBA and LPBT tours. Includes major titles earned during the PWBA Tour hiatus (2004 through 2014), which were retroactively credited as PWBA titles. Excludes PBA Women's Series titles.\nTelevised perfect games.\nThere have been five televised 300 games in title events over the history of the PWBA. Liz Johnson is the only player with multiple televised 300 games, accomplishing the feat in 2001 and 2021."

        "title": "Formula 1 (video game)",
        "text": "Formula 1 is a racing video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It is the first installment in Sony's \"Formula One\" series.\n\"Formula 1\" is based on the 1995 Formula One World Championship. It is distinct from its sequels because it was made at the end of the season, meaning that it features driver substitutes. The game also allows two players to compete against each other either head-to-head or with other computer cars via the PlayStation Link Cable. Both players may then compete over a 17-race Championship season, or in a single race of the player's choice.\nGameplay.\n\"Formula 1\" contains 17 tracks, 13 teams and 35 drivers. If a player is to complete a season after winning every race, and leading the Constructor's Championship, a special hidden circuit is unlocked. The track is a fictional lower-level city circuit called Frameout City, which when viewed at the Race Preview page is in the shape of a Formula One car. The only way to keep the track available is to save just after having completed the season, then loading the data at the next turning on of the console.\nLater tracks have 24 competitors on them instead of 26 because Simtek pulled out of the actual championship after the Monaco Grand Prix. It is still possible to drive a Simtek on any course after Monaco, creating a field of 25 drivers. If two players are playing the game via the link cable setup (where players would connect two PlayStation consoles together with two copies of the game), it is possible to play as both Simtek cars, thus creating a field of 26 drivers on any course after Monaco. Every starting grid (in dry races) is the same as the real 1995 Grand Prix, timing included.\nDevelopment.\nThe track models in \"Formula 1\" were modelled from surveyors' track data. The designers started with wire-frame models of the track data, then exported these from their Silicon Graphics workstations to a custom Windows 95 track editor. The track editor was used to reformat the tracks so that they could be used in-game, before exporting them back to the SGI workstations where scenery and other details were added in. To create the in-car sound, a Digital Audio Tape was strapped to a driver.\nCar models were created based on a combination of information provided by FOCA and real life photographs of the cars. The result was that all car models were unique rather than just a single model with different coloured \"skins\".\nThough Psygnosis was the game's publisher, development team Bizarre Creations opted to create their own 3D engine for the game rather than utilizing the one from the Psygnosis hits \"Wipeout\" and \"Destruction Derby\". To reduce demand on the PlayStation's processor without significantly reducing the game's visuals, the developers programmed a level of detail method so that when a car reaches a certain distance away, it switches from its normal high-detail model (composed of 440 to 450 polygons, depending on the car) to a low-detail model composed of only 90 to 100 polygons.\nThe game's original release date was pushed back to allow the developers time to make last-minute tweaks, fix bugs, and make the complex graphical changes needed to remove cigarette and alcohol advertising, which is illegal in video games in some parts of the United States.\nProbe Software started work on a port of the game for the Sega Saturn in 1997. Psygnosis's Formula One license had expired by this time, presenting a potential obstacle to this conversion being released. It was cancelled by June 1997.\nCommentary.\nThis game saw the introduction of in-game commentary, which was done in the English version of the game by Murray Walker, the German version by Jochen Mass, the French version by Philippe Alliot, the Spanish version by Carlos Riera and the Italian version by Luigi Chiappini.\nSoundtrack.\nThe in-game music – credited to \"Overdrive\" – was composed by Mike Clarke, who worked in-house at Psygnosis at the time, and Stuart Ellis, a session guitarist from Liverpool and owner of Curly Music, an independent music retailer. The soundtrack also features the songs \"Juice\" by Steve Vai (from \"Alien Love Secrets\"), as well as \"Summer Song\" and \"Back to Shalla-Bal\" by Joe Satriani (from \"The Extremist\" and \"Flying in a Blue Dream\", respectively).\nReception.\nThe game was a best-seller in the UK. Worldwide sales across all computer and console versions of \"Formula 1\" surpassed 1.7 million units by August 1997. In August 1998, the game's PlayStation version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nThe PlayStation version was reasonably well-received, with critics generally commenting that the realistic handling and real-world Formula One elements make it an ideal game for the hardcore racing fan. Some reviewers added that the game was too complicated and difficult to appeal to those looking for arcade-style racing or multiplayer gaming, though most praised the selection of modes as opening up the game to both novices and experts. Critics were more divided about the graphics. Todd Mowatt wrote in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" that \"the fluidity of the animations were not that realistic in terms of the way a real race car would handle\", \"GamePro\"s Air Hendrix praised the detailed cars and sense of speed but complained of break-up problems, and \"Next Generation\" hailed the graphics as a major leap over the first wave of PlayStation games. \"GameSpot\" called the game \"a high-octane masterpiece\", while \"Next Generation\" said that \"Formula 1\", with its \"exquisite\" graphics, wide range of challenges, and startling amount of depth, is the game that changed everything in the racing genre. PSM gave the game 9/10, praising the AI, and called it a PS1 killer app of 1996.\nReviewing the PC version in \"GameSpot\", Tim Soete praised the graphics and audio commentary but found the lack of depth and realism in the driving made the game become dull after a short while.\nReview aggregation website GameRankings provides an average rating for the PlayStation version of 87.75% based on 4 reviews. The PC version received an average rating of 56.40% based on 10 reviews."

        "text": " John Fitzgerald Blake (March 6, 1961 – July 23, 2020) was an American college and professional football coach. He played college football as a nose guard for the Oklahoma Sooners. He served as the head coach of the Sooners from 1996 to 1998.\nCoaching career.\nBlake served as the head coach for the Oklahoma Sooners from 1996 to 1998, succeeding the one-year term of Howard Schnellenberger. He compiled a career record of 12–22, which is the worst three-year stretch in University of Oklahoma football history. Despite his overall record as college head coach, Blake was a great recruiter, bringing in more than half of the 2000 championship team's 22 starters, including future NFL players like safety Roy Williams and linebacker Rocky Calmus.\nPrior to his arrival in Norman, Blake had served as the defensive line coach for the Dallas Cowboys, working alongside future UNC coach Butch Davis as well as former Sooner and then Cowboys head coach Barry Switzer. The Dallas Cowboys won two Super Bowls during Blake's stint. Blake also worked as a defensive assistant at Oklahoma in the early 1990s under Gary Gibbs.\nBlake served as the defensive line coach at Mississippi State University in 2003. He later held the same position on Bill Callahan's staff at the University of Nebraska from 2004 to 2006. Blake resigned his position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Sunday, September 5, 2010. On February 16, 2016 Lamar University announced that they had hired Blake to serve as their defensive line coach. After one month at Lamar and during the Cardinals' spring camp, Blake accepted the defensive line coach position with the Buffalo Bills on March 15, 2016 following the Bills' firing of Karl Dunbar.\nControversies.\nBlake was involved in a controversy towards the end of his tenure as defense line coach for the Dallas Cowboys. According to \"The New York Times\", Blake made claims to head coach Barry Switzer that Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman treated his black teammates differently and was a racist. In response to this, many members of the Cowboys organization, including black coaches and players, came to the defense of the quarterback. Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith, and Charles Haley went on the record to stand by Aikman. Aikman also asked a number of black players, including Deion Sanders and Darren Woodson, if there was a problem, and they said there wasn't one. Blake was dismissed from his position with the Cowboys to begin serving as head coach at Oklahoma.\nIn 2010, Blake resigned from North Carolina in the midst of an investigation into players' relationships with agent Gary Wichard, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011. At the time, Blake was suspected of being an employee and receiving cash benefits from Wichard. Blake denied all allegations, and said he was secretive about his communications with Wichard because he did not want to reveal his friend's then-secret cancer diagnosis. On March 12, 2012, the NCAA announced that Blake had received a three-year show-cause penalty, which effectively barred him from college coaching during that period. The NCAA determined that Blake had received personal loans from Wichard and failed to disclose them to UNC, and also misled NCAA investigators.\nDeath.\nBlake died on the morning of July 23, 2020 at the age of 59. He suffered a heart attack while walking near his home and was transported to Baylor University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead."

She won one singles title and one doubles title on the WTA tour.\nCareer.\nCoached by her father, Reinhard Müller, Martina had her best success on clay courts: she won her only WTA Tour singles title at the Budapest Grand Prix and one WTA Tour doubles title in 's-Hertogenbosch. On the ITF Women's Circuit, she won ten singles and ten doubles titles in her career. On 2 April 2007, she reached a career-high WTA ranking of world No. 33. In February 2008, she peaked at No. 47 in the doubles rankings.\nIn 2007, she started the year with middling results, reaching the second round at the Australian Open, losing to Elena Dementieva in three sets. From January to April, Müller never came past the second round of a tournament. In May, at the Qatar German Open in Berlin, she defeated Eleni Daniilidou and 13th seed Shahar Pe'er to reach the round of 16 where she lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova 3–6, 2–6. She reached the second round of Roland Garros, losing to Dominika Cibulková, and the second round at Wimbledon, retiring against Agnieszka Radwańska. In the previous round, Müller double-bageled Anna Smashnova. She reached the final at the Internazionali Femminili di Palermo before being defeated by Hungarian Ágnes Szávay in two sets.\nMüller married longtime boyfriend Florian Skibbe in August 2011 and subsequently announced her retirement."

        "title": "Golf etiquette",
        "text": "Golf etiquette refers to a set of rules and practices designed to make the game of golf safer and more enjoyable for golfers and to minimize possible damage to golf equipment and courses. Although many of these practices are not part of the formal rules of golf, golfers are customarily expected to observe them. The R&amp;A rule book states that \"[t]he overriding principle is that consideration should be shown to others on the course at all times.\"\nCare of the course.\nDivots.\nDivots should always be repaired, either by placing sand in the divot or replacing the grass. Some courses also place containers of divot repair mix on carts and at tees, which can be poured into the divot.\nPitch marks.\nA ball hitting the green often leaves an indentation, a pitch mark, where it strikes the ground. These need to be repaired to keep the green in good condition. After golfers have arrived at the green, they should make it a point to find their pitch marks and repair them to aid recovery of the turf.\nBunkers.\nAfter playing from a bunker, a player should smooth the sand to even out any footprints and divots, usually by means of a rake. Not all sand filled areas are classified as bunkers, e.g. coastal courses (e.g. Myrtle Beach) frequently feature designated waste areas; these areas need not be smoothed following play.\nWalking.\nGolfers should avoid distracting fellow golfers. Golfers should not run during play, but instead walk quickly but lightly during play and remain stationary while others play their shots. Players should be still and remain silent during a fellow player's pre-shot routine and subsequent shot.\nGolf carts and equipment.\nGolf carts should not be used to annoy or distract other players. The cart should be parked on the cart path when at the tee box or putting green. Carts should normally stay only on the paths, and are required to do so on many courses. Golfing equipment (bags, clubs and carts) should never be placed in front of the green as annoyance to the approaching players. \nShould carts be permitted off the paths, golfers should observe the \"90 degree rule\": make a 90 degree turn off the path toward the fairway to a given ball, and return straight back to the path, not along the path of greatest convenience. Carts inflict wear and tear on the course, and can be accidentally driven over another player's ball. Golfers should keep the noise of backing up to a minimum and must always set the park brake before disembarking.\nHonour.\nTraditionally, the player with the best gross score on the previous hole, or the winner of the hole in match play, has the honour of teeing off first; if there is no outright winner of a hole, then the order of play does not change from the previous tee. In informal games one can play \"ready golf\" and not wait for the best score on the hole to tee up first. With the update to the rules in 2019, ready golf is now encouraged in all stroke play formats.\nPutting lines.\nGolfers should note each player's putting line, and avoid stepping on it as they play on the green or stand on a line of sight, that is, in the line of sight either ahead or behind a player who is attempting to putt. Players should not stand close to or directly behind the ball, or directly behind the hole, when a player is about to play. In the event that your ball is in another player's line, it is important to mark your ball's position, and only then remove it (pick it up) from the green. A golfer should also avoid stepping close to the hole.\nSlower players.\nSlower players should allow following faster players to play through if there is substantial room in front of them. Golfers should try to follow closely the group ahead of them, and not to be \"pushed\" by the group behind them.\nTee boxes.\nA golfer should choose the correct tee box for their skill level, regardless of where the other members of the group are playing. Varying course lengths from different tees are one way to help even the playing field.\nDress.\nMany golf clubs have dress rules, commonly requiring men to wear collared shirts and explicitly banning jeans or denim."

        "text": "William Earl White (August 26, 1939 – May 21, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and coach. He played in the National Hockey League with the Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Black Hawks from 1967 to 1976. He then coached Chicago during the 1976–77 season. White was one of the most notable defensive defencemen of the 1970s.\nPlaying career.\nAfter playing his junior hockey for the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, White turned professional in 1960. Held back due to the paucity of jobs available in the Original Six days of the National Hockey League, he would star for seven seasons in the minor league American Hockey League, mostly for the Springfield Indians. While with the Indians, White was instrumental in the players' strikes which led to the prominence of agent Alan Eagleson and the creation of the National Hockey League Players' Association.\nThe Los Angeles Kings of the NHL acquired the rights to White in the 1967 NHL expansion, and White was the Kings' best defenceman, leading the team in scoring both full years he played for them. During the 1970 season, White was traded to the powerful Chicago Black Hawks, for whom he would play the remainder of his career. Paired with rushing defenceman Pat Stapleton, they formed one of the greatest defensive pairings of the decade, and despite recurring minor injuries, White averaged nearly 30 assists a season in his five full seasons with Chicago. During that time, he was named to the NHL's Second All-Star squad on defence in 1972, 1973 and 1974, as well as being named to play in the All-Star Game for six consecutive seasons between 1969 and 1974. He was also a member of the Canadian team in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, playing eight games.\nAlready missing significant time in the previous seasons due to injuries, White suffered a neck injury in the 1976 playoffs from which he sustained lingering nerve damage, and retired in consequence.\nWhite finished his NHL career with 50 goals, 215 assists and 265 points in 604 games, with 495 penalty minutes. At the time of his retirement, even though he had played only six full seasons with the Hawks, he was in the top five of all-time Black Hawk defence scorers.\nTeam Canada 1972 member.\nWhite was chosen to be part of Team Canada '72 that battled the Soviet Union's National Team in a famous eight-game series in September 1972. White scored a goal for Canada in the decisive final game in Moscow. He also finished the series with a plus/minus of +7--the best mark of any Canadian player.\nRetirement and death.\nWhite replaced long-time Black Hawks coach Billy Reay as interim coach midway through the 1977 season, but failed to improve the team's fortunes and left after that season. He later went on to coach his old junior team, the Toronto Marlboros.\nWhite died on May 21, 2017, at the age of 77."

In his 28 seasons in the NFL, he was selected as the referee in three Super Bowls, XIII in 1979, XVI in 1982, and XIX in 1985. He wore the number 40 for most of his career (was number 4 from the 1979 to 1981 NFL seasons when the numbering system for officials was temporarily modified). Haggerty's trademark signal upon a team scoring a touchdown, field goal or extra point, featured raising both arms, but momentarily pausing them before raising them over his head.\nFootball was always a Haggerty pastime, even with Jim, Pat's brother. Pat's cousin, Donald \"Cal\" Snyder (1909–1975) was 1935 NIAA All-conference quarterback at Kearney State Teachers College (now the University of Nebraska at Kearney).\nHaggerty attended Denver North High School in Denver, Colorado, and played basketball and baseball at the Colorado State College of Education (now the University of Northern Colorado) in Greeley.\nFollowing college, Haggerty played minor league baseball in the Detroit Tigers organization, including one year with the Denver Bears in 1953. After deciding that baseball was not going to be his career, he turned to teaching and started at Valverde Elementary School in Denver and later was a teacher and coach at Abraham Lincoln High School in Denver.\nPrior to joining the NFL, his previous officiating experience included college football and basketball in the Big Eight Conference and Western Athletic Conference.\nAt Super Bowl XIX, he supervised the coin toss that was conducted by President Ronald Reagan from the Oval Office of the White House via satellite, with Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Hugh McElhenny joining captains from the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers at Stanford Stadium in California. Reagan had been sworn in for his second term as president in a private ceremony earlier that day, with the public inauguration held the next day, since January 20, 1985 fell on a Sunday.\nAfter retiring from active officiating after the 1992 season, Haggerty continued to work for the NFL, monitoring how games were called and scouting college officials as potential new NFL officials.\nHaggerty died from cancer in 1994 at age 67 and is buried at Linn Grove Cemetery in Greeley. He was nominated as a 2005 Pro Football Hall of Fame candidate in Canton, Ohio as a contributor."

        "text": "Nester's Funky Bowling is a bowling video game developed by Saffire and published by Nintendo for the Virtual Boy console. It was only released in North America on February 1996, and was the second-to-last game released for the system before it was discontinued. Players control Nester, a character from the \"Nintendo Power\" comics, or his twin sister Hester, as they compete to see who is the superior bowler. It features standard bowling mechanics and rules, and has three modes of play - Bowling, Challenge, and Practice, all three supporting one or two players.\nIt has received generally mixed reception; while some found it to be a poor or average game, such as staff for \"IGN\" and \"GamePro\", \"Nintendo Power\" and \"Allgame\" were more forgiving, toting it as a quality game compared to other titles in the Virtual Boy library. Its graphics received some recognition, though it was faulted for its lack of a save function and lack of game modes.\nOverview.\n\"Nester's Funky Bowling\" was developed by Saffire Corporation and published by Nintendo for the Virtual Boy console. It was released exclusively in North America on February 1996. Players control Nester, a character from the \"Nintendo Power\" magazine's comic section, or his twin sister Hester, as they attempt to prove their superiority over one another. Like all other Virtual Boy games, \"Nester's Funky Bowling\" uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect. There are four ranks that are achieved based on their score, which is based on normal bowling rules - the ranks are Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Pro. Players may adjust their character in order to hit it how they like, such as using pins ricocheting or bouncing in order to knock more down.\nThere are three modes of play, all of which support one or two players. These include Bowling, Challenge, and Practice. In Bowling, players play a standard game of bowling. In Challenge, players must knock down all of the pins that appear with only once chance to do so as the pin set-ups become increasingly difficult. Players are given more points for knocking all of the pins down depending on the difficulty of the shot. In Practice, players may choose from 28 different pin variations. When playing with another player, players pass the Virtual Boy back and forth in between turns.\nReception.\n\"Nester's Funky Bowling\" received generally mixed reviews, selling poorly according to \"Joystiq\" writer Eric Caoili. Tony Brusqul for \"The Daily Gazette\" criticized the randomized and unrealistic behavior of the ball and pins, and suggested players looking for a bowling game play it on a different system, citing the eye pain incurred from playing. \"GamePro\" staff called it \"challenging and fun at first\", but found that it became easy after just a few games. They felt that the graphics improved the game, though adding that they became repetitive over time. \"Next Generation\" staff regarded it as one of the platform's most enjoyable games, citing its simple interface and non-intrusive visuals. In their review, \"Nintendo Power\" praised its gameplay, calling it \"solid\", as well as its modes of play. However, they criticized the two player mechanic, calling the method awkward. It was an editor's pick for \"Nintendo Power\" editors Scott, Dan, and Henry. They named it one of the top games released for the platform.\nIn a retrospective over of the Virtual Boy, \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" called it an average bowling game. GameSpy's Luke McKinney commented that the Virtual Boy's library consisting of \"almost five percent\" bowling games was a poor decision. Allgame's Scott Alan Marriott called it a fun game for the Virtual Boy, praising the graphics but bemoaning the lack of replay value due to few modes of play and no save function. \"Wired\"s Chris Kohler stated that \"Nester's Funky Bowling\" had increased in price over time."

It was developed and published by T&amp;E Soft in Japan and published by Nintendo in North America. \"Golf\" uses standard golf rules and is set in the fictional 18-hole Papillion Golf &amp; Country Club. Hazards include water, sand traps, trees, and deep rough grass. It is displayed in the Virtual Boy's standard red and black color scheme with 3D effects by use of a 3D processor. It was met with critical praise for its controls and physics and mixed reviews for its graphics. \"Nintendo Power\" called it the third best Virtual Boy release of its year.\nGameplay.\n\"Golf\"s gameplay follows traditional golf rules, where players must reach the hole on the green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. It takes place in the fictional 18-hole Papilion Golf &amp; Country Club. Players choose between two modes of play: Tournament, where they compete against 47 virtual computer-controlled opponents, and Stroke, where they attempt to surpass their previous high scores. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course respectively. In advance of their turn, they choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review the positives and negatives of their last shots.\nDevelopment.\n\"Golf\" was developed by T&amp;E Soft for the Virtual Boy. It was originally known as \"VR Golf\". Like all other Virtual Boy games, \"Golf\" uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect. It was published by T&amp;E Soft in Japan on August 11, 1995, and by Nintendo in North America sometime in November 1995.\nReception.\n\"Golf\" had mixed to positive reception. Critics such as \"Official Nintendo Magazine\", \"Edge\", \"AllGame\", and \"Nintendo Power\" noted T&amp;E Soft's experience with golf games, the latter which called it the third best Virtual Boy game of the year. \"Nintendo Power\" also called \"Golf\" the most realistic sports game on the Virtual Boy at the time of its release. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said that the gameplay holds up surprisingly well to golf simulations on systems better suited to the genre. However, \"Total!\" magazine felt that the game was very basic and lacked in content and features.\nThe audiovisual elements received mixed reviews. \"GamePro\" and Electronic Playground both found the game fun but were disappointed by its graphics. \"GamePro\" additionally criticized the audio quality. \"Total!\" felt that the game had some of the console's worst 3D effects. \"Next Generation\" felt that the console's limitations and the game's ineffective use of its 3D abilities hindered it, making features in the distance difficult to make out. \"AllGame\" felt that the audio and sense of depth were poor, but commended its use of shading. \"Nintendo Magazine\" was more positive, praising its presentation and perspective."

        "title": "Rugby union in Canada",
        "text": "Rugby union () is a moderately popular sport in Canada; it is quite strong as a participation sport, particularly in several hotspots like British Columbia, Atlantic Canada (particularly in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador), the West Island of Montreal, Quebec City and Ontario but does not attract the same level of spectator support yet, likely because the CFL's popular brand of Canadian Football is still similar to rugby in many ways, whilst also being the dominant football code in the country. Rugby Canada is the administrative body for rugby union in Canada. Every province also has its own union.\nCanada has around 26,000 seniors and twice as many junior players spread across the country, the leading domestic competitions are the Americas Rugby Championship, a cross-border regional competition including the United States, Argentina, and Uruguay. The Rugby Canada National Junior Championship for under-20 players organised solely within Canada by Rugby Canada, the sports governing body, and Major League Rugby, the top level of club rugby in the country.\nCanada is classified by World Rugby (WR) as a tier two rugby nation. Tier two nations do not have a full-time professional domestic structure in place, but they are considered by WR to be the most promising countries in which to expand the sport. The Canadian national side have competed in every Rugby World Cup to date yet have only won one match each tournament, with the exception of the 1991 tournament where they reached the quarterfinals, and 2015 and 2019, where they failed to win a single pool game.\nCanada's main problems have included the climate, because many grounds are under snow/ice for significant portions of the year, leading to a split season.\nCanada has long been a regional power in the sport, albeit in one of the sport's weaker regions. Argentina are the leading team in the Americas, usually followed by Canada, the United States and Uruguay. \nPopularity.\nThe sport is played across Canada, with clubs even in places like Yukon. It is popular in Ontario,Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland in British Columbia on the west coast, and Newfoundland, where rugby is considered to be the most popular summer sport. It is also quite popular in Prince Edward Island, where it is played by far more people than Football, but is less popular than Baseball as a summer sport.\nRugby in British Columbia has had a strong international flavour, with the University of British Columbia playing a regular series against the University of California, and representative BC sides have made tours to Japan and England.\nUp until just after the Second World War, rugby union was very popular on the west coast, and the east coast respectively. However, despite increasing interest in the Canadian football strongholds of Quebec and Ontario, rugby union was weakened in its western and eastern strongholds, particularly the latter. Despite its battle for survival, rugby has managed to maintain a presence in all parts of Canada. Rugby in the Central Provinces was reinforced partially by immigration from other Commonwealth Countries.\nRugby in Canada has been experiencing a growing popularity. 20,396 fans came out to BMO Field in Toronto in June 2013 to watch Canada take on Ireland, a new attendance record for Canada.\nHistory.\nThere is a considerable overlap between the early history of rugby in Canada, and the origins of Canadian football.\nEarly forms of rugby football were being played in Canada from 1823 onwards, in east Canadian towns such as Halifax, Montreal and Toronto.\nRugby football proper in Canada dates back to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Esquimalt, British Columbia.\nIn 1864 the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in Montreal among artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s when brief mentions of \"football\" appeared in print.\nF. Barlow Cumberland and Fred A. Bethune first codified rules for rugby football in Canada, in 1865 at Trinity College, Toronto, and the first proper Canadian game of rugby took place in 1865 when officers of an English regiment played local civilians, mainly from McGill University.\nRugby is also an ancestor of Canadian football, currently its main competitor. A \"running game\", resembling rugby, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868. By the late 19th century, the game was popular in Vancouver on the west coast.\nEarly Canadian rugby clubs included the following:\nThe first major figure in the introduction of rugby to Canada was Alfred St. George Hamersley of Marlborough, an England international who had played in the first Calcutta Cup match in 1871, and he helped establish the game in British Columbia. The game took root there, and as the \"Canadian Encyclopedia\" says:\nThe first recorded game in British Columbia was played on Vancouver Island in 1876, between members of the Royal Navy and the Army. It was played regularly after this in Victoria by local players and sailors on the British ships stationed at Esquimalt.\nThe first club was formed in 1868. At that time no international agreed set of rules existed and the Rugby Football Union of England would not publish its official set of rules until 1871. Shortly after the game in Montreal, Trinity College, Toronto published the first set of Canadian rugby rules.\nThe Canada RFU was founded in 1882, and administered Canadian football - after this, Canadian rugby fell back to a provincial level, taking administrative directions directly from the Rugby Football Union in England. Despite such encroachments, rugby remained popular in some parts of Canada, notably British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, particularly around Toronto.\nAs Canada's two main languages are English and French, it has long been influenced by not only the Commonwealth, but the French rugby community.\nAs early as 1902, a Canadian XV toured the British Isles. And in 1908, the British Columbia rugby union team travelled to California to play the All Blacks.\nThere was a brief resurgence in the sport, but that was halted with the onset of World War I. From 1914 to 1919, only in British Columbia and Nova Scotia were there the numbers for semi-regular rugby. In most other areas the game was not played on a regular basis. It has been suggested that some kept rugby alive during the period in an effort to boost morale during the war.\nFollowing World War I, there was an increase in rugby in Canada, as servicemen rejoined their previous clubs. In 1919, a Canadian Services team, the Canadian Expeditionary Force, took part in an Inter-Services Championship played in Great Britain. The Championship consisted of matches played between six service teams from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, with the final played at Twickenham. The Rugby Union of Canada was formed in 1929, which was followed by a tour of Japan by a Canadian side.\nDuring World War II the sport was only played on a limited basis, with most games being played involving mainly members of the Commonwealth Forces. In 1949, there were only three active provincial unions — British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.\nQueen's University RFC from Belfast, toured British Columbia in 1953.\nIn 1958, the Carling Cup was set up, which was won by British Columbia, but which lay dormant between 1959 and 1966. British Columbia retained the cup until Ontario won it in 1971.\nCanada first broke through into the top rank of rugby nations when it beat a touring Scotland side in 1991, and this was followed by an outstanding performance in the 1991 Rugby World Cup, in which they beat Romania and Fiji, and were narrowly beaten by France, reaching the quarterfinals. In 1992, they compounded their success by beating Wales 26–24.\nAlthough it was first introduced into eastern Canada, British Columbia has long been seen as the traditional centre of the Canadian game, and although there have often been as many players in Ontario as BC, there has been a steady drift westward of players. This westward drift has ensured that Canadian rugby now has an outlook to the Pacific Rim, rather than one merely fed by a heritage of largescale British emigration.\nRugby and Canadian football.\nConfusingly, in Canada, Canadian football has also frequently been referred to as \"rugby football\", and a number of national and provincial bodies were called \"Rugby Football Unions\" or \"Rugby Unions\", such as the Ontario Rugby Football Union, Quebec Rugby Football Union. For example, in the \"Encyclopedia Canadiana\", the entry \"Rugby Football\" begins \"the Canadian development of rugby union or \"English rugger\" introduced into Canada in the third quarter of the nineteenth century.\", but admits later that \"the Canadian game is a radical departure from rugby union\". Canadian football is in fact a descendant of the rugby code.\nThe first documented gridiron football match was a game played at University College, University of Toronto on November 9, 1861. A football club was formed at the university soon afterwards, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.\nIn 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. However, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada.\nThis rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a game, in 1874. It is through this varsity play that the game now known as American football entered the United States.\nPredecessors of the Canadian Football League and the present-day governing body Football Canada include the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), established 1882, and the Canadian Rugby Union, established 1892. Representatives from the Montreal (Rugby) Football club (now known as the Westmount Rugby Club), the Toronto Rugby Football Club and from the Hamilton Rugby Football Club had meetings in Toronto and Montreal. It was decided that the union would continue to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship would play the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion.\nThis organization (also known at different times as the Canadian Rugby Union), was the forerunner of the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football. To make matters more confusing the word \"rugby\" continued to be applied to Canadian football. It was not until 1967 that the original CRU finally cleared up this confusion by renaming itself the Canadian Amateur Football Association; it adopted its current name of Football Canada in 1986.\nInternational competition.\nCanada is classified by World Rugby (WR) as a tier two rugby nation alongside Fiji, Japan, Romania, Samoa, Tonga and the USA (there are ten tier one rugby nations).\nIn terms of international rugby, Canada has not been so isolated, since European sides touring Australia and New Zealand, and vice versa, would frequently stop off there, in the days before proper long distance jet flight. As early as 1905, Dave Gallaher's \"Originals\" from New Zealand played there, and a long line of All Blacks sides have played there.\nRugby World Cup.\nThe Canadian national team have competed in every world cup since the first tournament held in 1987, until 2023 when they failed to qualify. The team's best result came during the 1991 tournament, held in the United Kingdom, when they reached the quarter finals beating out Fiji and Romania before narrowly losing 19–13 to France in the pool stage then New Zealand in the quarter final.\nCanada managed only one win in the 1987 Rugby World Cup (against Tonga). They also managed only a single win in 1995 Rugby World Cup (against Romania) 1999 Rugby World Cup (against Namibia) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup (against Tonga). Canada could only manage a draw in the 2007 Rugby World Cup (against Japan), but in the 2011 Rugby World Cup managed a win (against Tonga) and a draw (against Japan).\nThe performance and ranking of the national men's team has been in a steady decline since 1991, and the leadership of the sport has been unwilling, or unable, to make the necessary adjustments to reverse this decline.\nCanadian women's rugby by contrast has been very successful and internationally competitive for the last several years.\nChurchill Cup.\nThe Churchill Cup was a tournament conducted from 2003 through 2011, intended to help build depth in rugby in Canada and the United States, and an opportunity to develop new players for the England national team. The New Zealand Māori also competed in most of the tournament's editions. Although Canada was one of the three regular teams in the Churchill Cup, they never made the final until 2010, losing out to the England Saxons (that country's \"A\" national side). They also lost to England Saxons in the final of the last Churchill Cup in 2011. Rugby Canada, USA Rugby, and the Rugby Football Union of England all agreed to end the Churchill Cup after the 2011 edition, as both Canada and the USA will be included in WR's international Test schedule starting in 2012.\nSuper Powers Cup.\nIn 2004 and 2005 Canada replaced China in the Super Powers Cup. In 2005 Canada won the tournament beating Japan 15–10. The competition was discontinued in 2005 but representatives of Canada, USA, Russia and Japan have met to discuss reviving the competition, starting in November 2010.\nAmericas Rugby Championship.\nRugby Canada participated in the Americas Rugby Championship, an annual competition established by WR and designed to help grow the sport in Canada and the USA. It was the successor to the North America 4, established in 2006 for the same purpose. The NA4 involved four regionally-based teams, two each from Canada and the USA. The ARC, launched in 2009, includes four Canadian teams:\nThese teams were joined by the Argentina Jaguars, which have now become the country's \"A\" (second-level) national team, and a \"USA Select XV\", an \"A\" national team in all but name.\nWhen the ARC was established, Rugby Canada decided to scrap its former semi-professional national competition, the Rugby Canada Super League.\nPacific Nations Cup.\nStarting in 2013, Canada (along with the United States) has joined the Pacific Nations Cup. The tournament is intended to strengthen the Tier 2 rugby nations along the Pacific Rim by providing competitive test matches in a tournament format.\nDomestic competitions.\nCanadian Rugby Championship.\nThe Canadian Rugby Championship (CRC) is an amateur rugby union league located in Canada, partially funded by World Rugby. It is the highest level of domestic rugby in Canada.\nIt has four representative teams from regions across Canada, competing for the MacTier Cup. The regular season goes from August to September, and there is no post-season.\nThe CRC was started in 2009 by Rugby Canada. The league continues to grow every year, with more games being added to the schedule, and the format having changed in each of its first three years, making the league more competitive, and a prospect of becoming professional one day.\nCanadian Direct Insurance Premier League.\nThe Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League (also known as the CDI Premier League) is a provincial rugby union competition contested by eight clubs in British Columbia, Canada. The CDI Premier League is organized by the British Columbia Rugby Union.\nThe Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League runs from January to April each year. The teams that play in the CDI Premier League compete in the Lower Mainland Spray League and the Vancouver Island Elite League from September to December.\nThe teams compete for the Rounsefell Cup. The Rounsefell Cup was first awarded to Vancouver Rowing Club in 1922, and has been competed for annually ever since.\nMajor League Rugby (2017– ).\nIn November 2015, the Professional Rugby Organization (PRO Rugby) announced a USA Rugby and World Rugby-sanctioned professional rugby championship. Six teams in \"major metropolitan areas in the US Northeast, the Rocky Mountains and California\" will play at medium-size venues, with a 10-match schedule from April to July 2016. The league was expected to include Canadian teams upon expansion in 2017, but has since folded. In 2018, the top-level competition of rugby in the United States became Major League Rugby, and the Toronto Arrows were announced to join in the 2019 season.\nAge Grade Rugby.\nThe Junior Inter-Provincial Championship was started in 1976, and in 1982, Canada started up a junior national team, which played Welsh Schoolboys in 1983 and 1986, and England Colts in 1985.\nSince 2009, the top age-grade competition in the country is the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, involving under-20 teams. It was established as a replacement for the Super League, and most of the clubs that fielded teams in that league now send under-20 teams to the National Junior Championship.\nWomen's Rugby in Canada.\nIn 1983, the Western Canada Women's Championship was established.\nBy 1999, thirty women's clubs were registered in Canada."

        "title": "Nagano Winter Olympics '98",
        "text": "Nagano Winter Olympics '98, known in Japan as , is a multi-event sports game from Konami. It is based on the 1998 Winter Olympics and features 10 Olympic events including skating, skiing, luge, bobsleigh, slalom, curling, halfpipe and snowboarding. The game is part of the \"Track &amp; Field/Hyper Sports\" series and would be the last licensed Olympic video game released on a Nintendo home console until \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" about nine years later.\nGameplay.\nThere are two modes of play, Olympic and Championship. In the Olympic Mode, the player selects an event and competes in order to win the gold medal. In championship, the player competes in seven events, with points being awarded for performance in each event. The athlete with the most points at the end wins gold.\nPlayable nations.\nThere is a total of 16 playable countries per version of the game. They are:\nDevelopment.\nBoth the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of the game were developed by Konami's Japanese branch, but by different divisions of it. A playable demo of the Nintendo 64 version was exhibited at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show.\nReception.\n\"Nagano Winter Olympics '98\" received unfavorable reviews. The Nintendo 64 version and PlayStation version respectively held a 48% and 49% on the review aggregation website GameRankings, but those critics which compared the two versions unanimously declared the Nintendo 64 version the superior one, citing faster play, shorter load times, and better graphics with less polygon breakup and draw in than the PlayStation version. \"GamePro\" went so far as to give the Nintendo 64 version a positive recommendation, giving it 4 out of 5 scores in graphics, control, and fun factor, and a 3.5 in sound. The reviewer argued that while the game has substantial flaws, such as lack of a practice mode and difficulty select and the passive controls of some of the events, the fun of the multiplayer competition makes it a good value. \"Next Generation\" called the PlayStation version \"a mixed bag\"; the magazine praised the graphics and sound, but commented that some events are \"mediocre\", while others are \"fun\".\nOther publications were more negative. The most commonly cited problem, regardless of the reviewer's overall opinion of the game, is that the controls for many of the events are so simplistic that the player feels no connection to the action occurring onscreen. \"GameSpot\" described the resultant gameplay as \"about as tough as answering a phone when it rings\" and summed up the game as \"an unmixed bag of terrible, underdeveloped games whose feeble, undernourished gameplay comes down to timing one or two button taps, not just per race, but per event\". Crispin Boyer wrote in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" that most events are not just difficult but also neither fun nor exciting, and was critical to control setups.\n\"IGN\" and \"GamePro\" both praised the sound effects in the Nintendo 64 version. \nSome reviewers found the selection of events uneven. \"GamePro\", reviewing the PlayStation version (which, unlike the Nintendo 64 version, they suggested as a rental only), said that some events are \"boring\". Critics overwhelmingly said that the curling is the best event, with most commenting that this is rather unexpected given what an obscure sport curling is."

It was established in 2000 and is located near to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium The facility is also used for the rehabilitation of injured players.\nFormer cricketer VVS Laxman is the director of the NCA.\nActivities.\nThe NCA has collaborated with the MRF Pace Foundation to train fast bowlers from across the country.\nThe facility also works as a rehabilitation centre for injured members of India's cricket team. Ravi Shastri, in comments about frequently injured cricketers, sarcastically called some players \"permanent residents of NCA\", which he said was \"not a good thing at all\". , Jasprit Bumrah, Prasidh Krishna, and Rishabh Pant were admitted to the centre.\nHistory.\nThe NCA was the brainchild of cricket administrator and former BCCI President Raj Singh Dungarpur.\nIn 2000, NCA member and adviser Sunil Gavaskar argued that the NCA team should not have played the visiting Zimbabwe team, saying \"I thought it was unfair on the performers who were not given a chance to play first class matches against touring sides\". In response, NCA chair Raj Singh Dungarpur said, \"Such people should either resign from the committee, or take it on, or fall in line.\" Gavaskar resigned as NCA committee member.\nIn 2014, BCCI collaborated with Cricket Australia and the ECB to get expert opinions on the creation of its new structure.\nOn 16February 2022, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah announced the construction of a new NCA facility at near the Bangalore airport. Plans included three cricket grounds, a gymnasium, 40 practice pitches, a swimming pool, and rooms for upcoming players.\nBorder-Gavaskar Scholarship.\nNCA awards a scholarship to three promising players to visit Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. The scholarship is named after the legendary Australian and Indian captains, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, who both scored more than 10,000 runs in Test cricket.\n2009.\nram"

Many villages have their own teams that play at varying levels in local or regional club cricket leagues.\nWhen organised cricket first began in the 17th century, matches were played between rival parishes or villages and this form of competition endured. In representative cricket a team includes players from multiple parishes, for instance one that represents a county or a country.\nVillage cricket teams may be made up of local residents only, although other first XI can include players with connections to minor counties cricket clubs, and members of the academies of the county cricket club of the county in which the team lies.\nCricket in this form might be played on a village green or other public space instead of a dedicated ground.\nIn some non-professional cricket leagues, the adjective \"village\" is a descriptor used humorously, self-deprecatingly, or, sometimes, pejoratively to convey a sense of amateurishness of some aspect of the players' preparation, dress, conduct or play.\nVillage Cup.\nThe annual National Village Cup competition began in 1972 and each year's competition is covered in detail (particularly the final) in the following \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". \"The Cricketer\" magazine is responsible for organising the competition.\nIt is open to teams from English, Scottish or Welsh villages with a population up to originally 2,500 but , 10,000. The final is played at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. The competition's headline sponsor has changed often in recent years; the 2017 competition was chiefly sponsored by British milk producers, Watsons."

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He is currently a coach with the Providence Knights.\nCareer.\nReed was the Twins' first-round pick (and 12th overall) in the 1980 amateur draft.\nDespite playing for 17 seasons in the majors, he was usually relegated to a backup role. Reed rarely appeared in more than 100 games per year. He was regarded as a solid defensive catcher.\nOn February 3, 1987, Reed was traded from the Twins along with Neal Heaton, Yorkis Perez and Al Cardwood to the Expos for Jeff Reardon and Tom Nieto.\nOn September 16, 1988, Reed, filling in for an injured Bo Díaz, caught Tom Browning's perfect game in the Cincinnati Reds' 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium. In his autobiography, Browning credited Reed as an integral part of the performance: \"He did a phenomenal job, especially considering what was at stake in the later innings.\"\nDuring the late innings of Browning's perfect game, Reed had to continually slow down his pitcher. According to Browning's book, Reds manager Pete Rose was worried that his pitcher was working too quickly, which could lead to an errant pitch. At one point in the game, Reed stood up and raised his arms, palms facing out, to signal Browning to slow down.\nJeff Reed was a part of the Cincinnati Reds 1990 World Series winning squad when his team beat the Oakland Athletics in four, sweeping them."

        "title": "Rugby union in Russia",
        "text": "Rugby union in Russia is a moderately popular sport. Russia was in 2011 ranked 20th worldwide by the World Rugby, having over three hundred clubs and close to 22,000 players nationally. Russian Rugby Championship is the top-level professional competition held in Russia. Krasnoyarsk, in the middle of Siberia, is traditionally the heartland of Russian rugby.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rugby Union of Russia is the governing body for rugby union in Russia. It was founded in 1936 originally as the Rugby Union of the Soviet Union, and a specifically Russian body was set up in 1966. The Rugby Union of Russia became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1990.\nHistory.\nMedieval times.\nSince the early medieval times Russians played a ballgame, in many ways similar to rugby. In Russian it has been called \"Kila\" (,) the earliest written accounts of which go back to the 12th Century Novgorod Republic. As the game was strongly associated with pre-Christian pagan traditions, the Russian Orthodox Church didn't tolerate it. By the 19th Century the sport declined and died-out, especially after the English-type soccer was adopted and spread throughout the late Russian Empire.\nPre-Revolutionary Russia.\nRugby football in the Russian Empire pre-dated the Russian Revolution by a number of years, but it was only played sporadically. It appears to have been the first (non-indigenous) football code to be played in Russia, around a decade before the introduction of association football. Mr Hopper, a Scotsman, who worked in Moscow arranged a match in the 1880s; the first soccer match was in 1892. In 1886, however, the Russian police clamped down on rugby because they considered it \"brutal, and liable to incite demonstrations and riots\" Condemnation by the tsar's police probably deterred many people from playing, and records of rugby over the next thirty years are sparse. Some rugby union was still being played in 1908, however the first \"official\" match took place in Moscow in 1923.\nSoviet period.\nBecause of the Russian Revolution, some Soviet/Russian players emigrated and/or ended up playing for foreign sides, a notable example being Prince Alexander Obolensky (Александр Сергеевич Оболенский) who played for Oxford and England in the 1930s. His noble birth precluded him from playing in his home country and his family had fled the country when he was only a year old.\nIn 1934 the Moscow Championship was started, and in 1936 the first Soviet Championship took place.\nThe game was more or less banned for a number of years in the Soviet Union because of an incident in a final in Moscow, when supporters of Llanelli and a Bucharest team were involved in a brawl.\nAccording to popular myth, in 1949 rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the \"fight against the cosmopolitanism\". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975 the Soviet national team played their first match. Although there was the Soviet Cup and the Soviet Championship, rugby never became a major sport in the USSR. Union was the bigger of the two codes though - rugby league only really took off in the former Soviet Union after the collapse of Communism.\nPost-Soviet Russia.\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up, there were two main consequences - firstly the loss of a much larger pool of players and fans, and secondly, the defection of many players to rugby league, which had previously been frowned on by the Soviet authorities. The two main areas for Russian rugby were to be Moscow and Siberia, and to a lesser extent, Leningrad/St Petersburg.\nThe most notable Russian player perhaps is Igor Mironov who played for the Barbarians several times during the 1980s. Vasily Artemyev played for Northampton Saints in the English Premiership.\nRussian rugby terminology.\nRussian language terminology for Rugby union positions\nClimate.\nIn 1978, Russia set the record for one of the coldest matches ever to be played, when Krasnoyarsk played Polyechika Alma at -23' C. Because Krasnoyarsk had travelled over 2,000 km to be there, the game was not called off. Instead, players resorted to wearing balaclavas, gloves, and several pairs of tracksuits to combat the cold. Nonetheless, the extreme climate of Russia remains a problem, with winter sometimes being a split season, or the game of snow rugby being played.\nPopularity.\nAlthough association football is the most popular spectator sport in Russia, rugby has been growing in terms of player base, spectator interest and media coverage in recent years. Rugby's rise into mainstream media happened a few years ago when the Heineken Cup, a club tournament in Europe, was given television coverage on the 7TV sports channel. 7TV also broadcast the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Subsequently, Russia's domestic championship, the Professional Rugby League, has earned weekly coverage on the RTR-Sport channel (a number of countries also receive this channel, such as Ukraine), though the games are not shown live. In addition to television coverage, rugby now features in mainstream news publications. In early 2006, RTR-Sport purchased the rights to cover the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In 2007 Moscow made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. It was announced in February 2009 that the Rugby Union of Russia would again bid to host the Rugby World Cup Sevens, in 2013. After two other bidders (Brazil and Germany) withdrew, leaving Russia the only country with an active bid, Russia was officially named as host in May 2010. Russia also hosted the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy, the IRB's second-tier international competition for under-20 men's teams, in 2010.\nCompetitions.\nThe main club competition in Russia is the Professional Rugby League, a fully professional competition. The competing clubs are VVA Saracens from Monino in Moscow Oblast and Slava from Moscow, Enisei-STM and Krasny Yar both from Krasnoyarsk, RC Penza, RC Novokuznetsk, and Universitet from Chita Oblast.\nInternational.\nThe Six Nations B, also known as the European Nations Cup (ENC) is similar to the Six Nations Championship. Russia finished third in the 2001 and 2001–02 competitions and second in the 2007–08 and 2008–10 competitions. Their second-place finish in 2008–10 also secured Russia's first appearance in the Rugby World Cup, which took place in 2011 in New Zealand. The Nations Cup was introduced by the IRB in 2006, in which Russia and Portugal along with Argentina A and Italy A competed in Portugal.\nSuper Powers Cup.\nThe Super Cup was an annual international rugby union competition contested by national teams from Canada, Japan, Romania and the United States. It was previously known as the Super Powers Cup.\nThe Super Powers Cup was first launched in 2003. It was planned that China, Japan, Russia and the United States would play each other once. However, because of the SARS outbreak the Chinese team were forced to withdraw. Russia won the inaugural competition, defeating the United States 30–21 in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. For the 2004 competition Canada replaced China.\nEuropean Challenge Cup\nIn 2015 Russian club Yenisey-STM was included for the 2015–2016 season of the European Challenge Cup. The first fixture was against Irish club Connacht at their home stadium. During the match temperatures got close to -20 °C and the field was covered in ice. Yenisey-STM lost 14–31 against Connacht.\nNational team.\nRussia previously played as part of the USSR, and in the early 1990s, as a combined CIS team. Since 1992 however, they have been playing as Russia. The team qualified for its first Rugby World Cup by tying Romania 21-21.\nRussia competes regularly in the European Nations Cup, and more recently, in the Nations Cup.\nRussia succeeded in qualifying for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and for the 2019 Rugby World Cup."

He displayed great promise as a hitter, but his career was spoiled by two severe knee injuries.\nLife and career.\nBorn in Seguin, Texas, Jones was drafted in 1982 and 1983 but chose not to turn professional. Eventually, in 1984, he signed with the Phillies as a free agent. The stocky outfielder battled some problems with weight and injuries, but he displayed great hitting talent in the farm system. His ability at the plate and capable defense eventually earned him a spot with the big league club. However, after a promising first couple of months in August and September 1988, in April 1989 Jones suffered the first of two torn patellar tendons. The other, to his opposite knee, came in June 1990. Jones also came back from that injury; however, his time in the majors was all but finished. Nonetheless, he continued in the minors, Mexico, Taiwan, independent baseball leagues, and semi-pro ball through 2000.\nUpon retirement, Jones began working as a hitting instructor and coach for youths, eventually forming the Big League Batting Academy in Houston, Texas, alongside another former major leaguer, Charlie Hayes. In June 2006, after Jones did not show up at the academy for a few days, he was found dead in his home. He is thought to have died of either an aneurysm, heart attack, or stroke."

        "title": "Tommy Brown (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Michael Brown (born December 6, 1927) is an American former professional baseball player. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with his hometown Brooklyn Dodgers at 16 years and 241 days old, starting at shortstop at Ebbets Field against the Chicago Cubs, on August 3, 1944, during the World War II manpower shortage. Brown thus became the youngest non-pitcher to ever play in a major league game, and the second-youngest overall after Joe Nuxhall, who was 15 years and 316 days old when he first appeared as a hurler for the Cincinnati Reds on June 10, 1944. In Brown's debut game, he collected his first big-league hit, a double off the Cubs' Bob Chipman, and in the field handled three chances, with one error, as the Dodgers fell, 6–2.\nNicknamed \"Buckshot\", Brown threw and batted right-handed, stood tall, and weighed . The Brooklyn native had signed with the Dodgers after a 1943 tryout and spent the first four months of the 1944 season with Newport News of the Class B Piedmont League; while there, Brown collected 101 hits and a league-leading 11 triples, and batted .297 before his recall to Brooklyn in August. He appeared in 46 games for the Dodgers through the end of that season. The following year, 1945, Brown batted .286, with ten home runs, in 85 games, playing in the top-level American Association, and appeared in another 57 contests for Brooklyn, becoming a 103-game big-league veteran before his 18th birthday. He became the youngest player ever to hit a home run in the major leagues on August 20, 1945, at the age of 17.\nBrown spent 1946 in the United States Army, then in 1947, the second postwar season, returned to a Dodgers team with a set lineup that included Baseball Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. He became a utility man for the remainder of his MLB career, appearing in 166 games as a shortstop, 94 as an outfielder, 50 as a third baseman, 24 as a second baseman, and 21 as a first baseman. The Dodgers traded Brown to the Philadelphia Phillies in June 1951, and the Phils sold his contract to the Chicago Cubs a little more than a year later.\nAs a hitter, Brown batted over .300 twice in part-time duty (1949 and 1952). On September 18, 1950, against the Cubs at Ebbets Field, Brown hit three home runs and a single, with a base on balls, in five plate appearances, scoring three runs and collecting five runs batted in (RBI). The Dodgers, however, lost the game, 9–7.\nBrown's big-league career came to an end September 25, 1953, as a member of the Cubs; he had played in 494 games during all or parts of nine National League (NL) seasons, and was 25 years of age. Brown's 309 MLB hits included 39 doubles, seven triples, and 31 homers. He hit .241 lifetime with 159 runs batted in. Brown appeared as a pinch hitter in the 1949 World Series and went hitless in two at bats, as Brooklyn fell to the New York Yankees in five games. He played minor league baseball through 1959 before retiring."

        "title": "Penis fencing",
        "text": "Penis fencing is a mating behavior engaged in by many species of flatworm, such as \"Pseudobiceros hancockanus\". Species which engage in the practice are hermaphroditic; each individual has both egg-producing ovaries and sperm-producing testes.\nThe flatworms \"fence\" using extendable two-headed dagger-like stylets. These stylets are pointed (and in some species hooked) in order to pierce their mate's epidermis and inject sperm into the haemocoel in an act known as intradermal hypodermic insemination, or traumatic insemination. Pairs can either compete, with only one individual transferring sperm to the other, or the pair can transfer sperm bilaterally. Both forms of sperm transfer can occur in the same species, depending on various factors.\nUnilateral sperm transfer.\nOne organism will inseminate the other, with the inseminating individual acting as the \"father\". The sperm is absorbed through pores or sometimes wounds in the skin from the partner's stylet, causing fertilization in the other, who becomes the \"mother\". The battle may last for up to an hour in some species.\nParturition, while necessary for successful offspring production, requires a considerable parental investment in time and energy, and according to Bateman's principle, almost always burdens the \"mother\". Thus, from an optimality model it is usually preferable for an organism to inseminate than to be inseminated. However, in many species that engage in this form of copulatory competition, each \"father\" will continue to fence with other partners until it is inseminated. In \"Alderia modesta\", individuals will store sperm from several \"fencing matches\" before laying their eggs, and smaller individuals will more often inseminate a larger partner, with larger individuals spending more energy on laying eggs when paired with a smaller partner on the occasion that they transfer sperm unilaterally.\nIn the absence of potential mates, some species such as \"Neobenedenia melleni\" are capable of reproducing through self-insemination.\nBilateral sperm transfer.\nCommonly, many hermaphroditic species mutually inseminate, or trade sperm, rather than compete, \"Chelidonura sandrana\" as an example. The tiger flatworm, \"Maritigrella crozieri\", also transfers sperm bilaterally. In many species that engage in bilateral insemination, sperm trading is conditional. If one partner \"cheats\", and does not transfer sperm, the other partner will either prematurely abandon the partner, or will engage in typical mating behavior without transferring sperm. Other species will alternate which partner transfers sperm, engaging in multiple bouts of fencing with the same partner over time. In \"A. modesta,\" bilateral sperm transfer is the most common, especially in similarly sized mate pairs.\nOther uses.\nThe term is also applied, usually informally, to homosexual activity between two males among bonobos; same-sex genital-genital rubbing is used in bonobo society to cement bonds, reduce conflict, and express communal excitement over food. Several whale species also engage in penis fencing."

        "title": "2006 FIFA World Cup sponsorship",
        "text": "Corporate sponsorship during the 2006 World Cup has been a major source of revenue for FIFA, but it has also led to criticism for overly commercializing the event and allocating too many game tickets to sponsors, as well as for prohibitive actions against non-sponsor advertising around the stadiums. FIFA has defended its policies by pointing out that all of its profits from the World Cup are invested back into worldwide football.\nExamples of sponsorship.\nAs sporting events have become increasingly commercialized, a wide variety of sponsorship opportunities have emerged - or been created - and the 2006 FIFA World Cup was no different. Hyundai supplied team buses for each of the thirty-two finalists, and held a contest to decide the team bus slogans. Adidas supplied fifteen personalized match balls for every match of the tournament. Each Teamgeist ball has the name of the stadium, the national teams, the date of the match and the kickoff time are printed. The balls used for the final match were gold, rather than the normal white. Casio acted as the official timekeeper and provided giant countdown clocks in 8 cities across Germany to promote the oncoming tournament.\nThe tournament itself also had a myriad of 'official' items including an official video game (2006 FIFA World Cup) and song (\"The Time of Our Lives\", sung by Il Divo and Toni Braxton).\nThe fifteen official partners of the 2006 World Cup were: Adidas, Budweiser, Avaya, Coca-Cola, Continental, Deutsche Telekom, Emirates, Fujifilm, Gillette, Hyundai, Mastercard, McDonald's, Philips, Toshiba, and Yahoo!.\nAs companies who are not sponsors are not allowed to have their names overly associated with the World Cup, FIFA temporarily renamed seven of the twelve stadiums to \"FIFA World Cup Stadium, [Name of City].\"\nRevenue.\nFIFA raised €1.9bn in marketing revenue and €700m from sponsorship from the 2006 World Cup. The 2006 FIFA World Cup has fifteen \"official partners\", each thought to have paid €40 million for the privilege. It has a further six \"National Partners,\" who paid €13m each for local advertising rights.\nSponsor controversies.\nThere has been some controversy about several of FIFA's sponsors. FIFA has been criticized for taking on McDonald's as a sponsor because many feel the chain's unhealthy food should not be connected to a sporting event. Budweiser also has endured criticism for being the official beer of the World Cup in a country where, because it contains rice and fails the German Reinheitsgebot, it cannot be sold as a beer. Because of a longstanding copyright dispute with Czech brewery Budweiser Budvar it can also not be sold under the name of \"Budweiser\" in Germany. Anheuser-Busch signed its sponsorship deal with FIFA before the 2006 World Cup's host country was chosen, and opted to advertise the brand as \"Bud 百威\", combining the first three letters of its English brand name with its Chinese brand name. Budweiser is the only sponsor with non English writing on its billboards.\nDuring the first round match between the Netherlands and Ivory Coast, over 1,000 Dutch fans who arrived at the stadium wearing orange lederhosen were forced to remove their trousers because the lederhosen had the logo of Dutch brewery Bavaria. Bavaria, who had sold the lederhosen as part of an offer, was accused by FIFA of ambush marketing at the expense of American beer maker Budweiser who had paid millions of Euro to sponsor the competition and for the title of \"Official Beer of the 2006 World Cup.\"\nIn April 2007, Mastercard sued FIFA for reneging on a World Cup credit card sponsorship deal after it had awarded the sponsorship to Visa. Mastercard had the right of first refusal to sponsor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups but was not given the opportunity to do so. On December 7, 2006, Mastercard won its US federal lawsuit against FIFA. The judge issued a ruling stating that FIFA had breached the contract and that Mastercard was entitled to sponsor the next two World Cups. The judge also brought to light that FIFA officials had repeatedly lied to both Mastercard and Visa during the negotiations.\nTicket availability.\nFIFA allocated approximately one in six of the 3.1 million World Cup tickets to its sponsors. Each of the fifteen official partners received 25,000 World Cup tickets, while the six national partners split a total of 115,000. This has led to FIFA being heavily criticized for not making enough tickets available to fans."

He played college football as a guard at the University of Minnesota from 1926 to 1928. He was captain of the 1928 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team and was named to the 1928 College Football All-America Team. Gibson was a teammate and roommate of Bronko Nagurski. The two are jointly honored as the namesakes of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football training complex, the Gibson-Nagurski Football Complex. While at the University of Minnesota, Gibson was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. Gibson later worked as an assistant coach at Minnesota.\nGibson was one of eleven All-American football players to appear in the 1930 film \"Maybe It's Love\".\nGibson was a professional player and coach in the early National Football League (NFL). In 1930, Gibson joined the Minneapolis Red Jackets as a player-coach. Later that season, he moved to the Frankford Yellow Jackets. His career NFL coaching record was 3–10–1.\nGibson later coached the line at Carleton College and signed a contract to play with the Green Bay Packers but did not play. Instead, he chose to earn his Ph.D. in geology from the University of Minnesota and became a geology professor at Carleton College, where he also coached the football team from 1934 to 1938. In 1936, Carleton went 6–1 with the only loss coming to Iowa. His coaching record at Carleton was 21–13–2.\nIn 1938, Gibson worked as a geologist for the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company in Egypt. In 1941, he took a job as a geologist for the Magnolia Petroleum Company and moved to Midland, Texas. He later worked as a geologist for the Richfield Oil Company and for the Seaboard Oil Corporation. In 1952, he started his own consulting business and worked as a geologic consultant in the Philippines, New Zealand, Turkey, Egypt, South Africa, and Lesotho, as well as in the United States. He was inducted into the Petroleum Museum Hall of Fame in 2001.\nGibson died at his home in Midland, Texas on August 19, 2004, at the age of 98."

He played college football at Purdue.\nEarly years.\nEdwards attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati and was a student and a letterman in football and basketball. In football, he was a two-year starter and posted 20.0 sacks, 110 tackles, and seven forced fumbles as a senior.\nCollege career.\nEdwards played college football for three years at Big Ten school Purdue from 2003 to 2005. In his college career, Edwards played 36 games (starting in 18). He recorded a total of 16 sacks and received many honors including \"All-Freshmen team choice\" by \"The Sporting News\" (2003), honorable mention \"All-Big Ten\" (2004) and semifinalist for the \"Ted Hendricks Defensive End of the Year Award\" (2005).\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nEdwards was drafted as the 127th pick (fourth round) of the 2006 NFL draft. During his rookie season, he appeared in 15 of the 16 regular season games, (the most for a Vikings rookie that year) and started in 2 of the last 4 games. He recorded 3 sacks and 10 tackles. In 2007 Edwards had 5 sacks and 30 tackles in 12 games. He scored one touchdown on a fumble recovery against Detroit. On December 5, Edwards was suspended for four games by the National Football League for a violation of the league's Steroid policy. He was not eligible to play for the remainder of the Vikings regular season. In 2008 Edwards made 55 tackles and 5 sacks as the starting left defensive end after the acquisition of Jared Allen. In 2009, Edwards had a breakout year, recording 8.5 sacks, and having a strong performance against the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round of the post-season. Edwards became a restricted free agent in the 2010 offseason due to the CBA dispute instead of an unrestricted FA as he would have been if there were a labor agreement. The Vikings gave him a first-round restricted free agent tender. He signed the tender on June 14, 2010, after deciding to miss the Vikings offseason program.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn July 29, 2011, Edwards was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to a five-year contract for 30 million dollars with 11 million dollars guaranteed. During the Falcons' 8–1 start in 2012, Edwards was largely invisible, with most of his snaps being taken by players with much lower salaries.\nEdwards was released by the Falcons on November 12, 2012.\nCatfish.\nIn a 2020 episode of \"\", hosts Nev Schulman and Kamie Crawford discover that the catfish they are tracking down in the episode used Edwards's photos in his fake Instagram account, along with two other men's photos.\nBoxing.\nEdwards made his professional boxing debut at a Minnesota casino on May 20, 2011, defeating Tyrone Gibson in a four-round bout. Edwards told the Star Tribune that he had signed a two-fight contract. His trainer was Jeff Warner, a former heavyweight boxer and pro wrestler."

Milan's preparation before the final was in disarray: legendary striker Marco van Basten was still out with a long-term injury, and £13 million young sensation Gianluigi Lentini (then world's most expensive footballer) was also injured; sweeper and captain, Franco Baresi was suspended, as was defender Alessandro Costacurta; and UEFA regulations at the time that limited teams to fielding a maximum of three non-nationals meant that coach Fabio Capello was forced to leave out Florin Răducioiu, Jean-Pierre Papin and Brian Laudrup. On Barcelona's side, the rule saw Johan Cruyff choosing not to pick Michael Laudrup in his squad for the final which caused Capello to state after the game: \"Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake\". Laudrup left Barcelona for their arch-rival, Real Madrid, at the end of the season.\nMilan played in their all-white away strip, which historically they use in finals of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, while Barcelona played in their red and blue strip. Milan dominated early and were rewarded when Dejan Savićević ran down the right flank and passed to Daniele Massaro, who tapped the ball into an empty net. Massaro banged in his second just before half-time to make it 2–0 after a solo run by Roberto Donadoni down the left wing.\nIn the 47th minute, Savićević capitalised on a defensive error by Miguel Ángel Nadal to lob goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta for the third goal. Eight minutes later, after Savićević had hit a post and the Barcelona defence had failed to clear, Milan midfielder Marcel Desailly beat the offside trap to make it 4–0, which ended up being the final score.

He was the Golden State Warriors television analyst from 1985 to 2019, and currently splits time with Tom Tolbert as the team's radio color analyst on 95.7 The Game.\nBasketball career.\nYouth and college career.\nBarnett was born in Greenville, South Carolina and raised in Riverside, California. He is a member of the Riverside Hall of Fame, and was selected as an NCAA All-American as a University of Oregon basketball player.\nHe is in the University of Oregon Hall of Fame and the State of Oregon Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor during the 2012 Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament on March 10, 2012.\nPro career.\nBarnett's NBA career began when the Boston Celtics selected him with the eighth pick overall in the 1966 NBA draft. He later played for the Warriors for three seasons (1971–74) and five other teams during his 11-year career, including the San Diego Rockets, the Portland Trail Blazers, the New Orleans Jazz, New York Knicks, and the Philadelphia 76ers.\nWhile playing for the Trail Blazers in 1971, Barnett attempted a rushed long-range shot against the rival Los Angeles Lakers. His shot went in, prompting Blazers play-by-play announcer Bill Schonely to exclaim \"Rip City! All right!\" The phrase \"Rip City\", the meaning for which Schonely has no explanation, nonetheless caught on and became synonymous with the team and the city of Portland.\nBarnett played alongside many of the league's Hall of Famers, including Warriors stars Rick Barry and Nate Thurmond, as well as Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Pete Maravich and Julius Erving. Nicknamed \"Crazy Horse\", Barnett averaged 11.7 points, 3.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists in 732 games.\nBroadcasting.\nBarnett currently works for NBC Sports Bay Area and was the Warriors' television analyst from the 1985–1986 NBA season, working alongside play-by-play announcer Bob Fitzgerald until the 2018—2019 NBA season. During the playoffs, or when games were nationally televised, he moved over to radio and worked alongside Tim Roye on KGMZ-FM's 95.7 The Game.\nBeginning with the 2019—2020 NBA season, he became the Warriors' full-time color analyst on 95.7 The Game, and was replaced by fellow former player Kelenna Azubuike as the color commentator on NBC Sports Bay Area. Barnett joined Fitzgerald for the first Warriors home game telecast from the Chase Center in San Francisco, and travels with the team for road games.\nPersonal life.\nBarnett married his wife Sandy in 1966. Divorced in 1998. They have one daughter named Jennifer, along with one granddaughter, Stella. "

Although every tournament is different, a typical Gus Macker event involves basketball courts set up in parking lots or closed-off public streets. Tournaments are mid-level to major sports media events and are held virtually every weekend from spring through summer.\nHistory.\nAccording to the tournament's website, the \"Original Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament\" began in 1974 in Lowell, Michigan. Scott McNeal (alias Gus Macker) and brother Mitch gathered 18 friends who played competitively for a tournament purse of $18. As the tournament grew, the McNeals moved their tournament to Belding in 1987, then took the tournament on the road to other communities, branding it as the \"Gus Macker All-World Tour\". According to the website, over 10,000 players entered the tournament as it visited five cities that year.\nThe tournament currently holds both indoor and outdoor competitions annually in more than 75 cities, with over 200,000 players and 1.7 million spectators in attendance. The tournament prohibits alcohol and tobacco sponsorships.\nRules.\nThe Macker rules significantly differ from those of FIBA-sanctioned 3x3 basketball."

The playoffs concluded on June 9, 2003, with the New Jersey Devils defeating the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games.\nThe 16 qualifying teams played best-of-seven series in the conference quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Each conference champion proceeded to the Stanley Cup Finals. These playoffs marked the first time the Minnesota Wild qualified, in only their third season in the NHL. The Minnesota Wild, a sixth-seed, made an unlikely advance to the Western Conference Final as underdogs after being down three games to one in two consecutive rounds. This, along with the Canucks' comeback against the Blues, made for three 3–1 series comebacks in the playoffs, the second time this had happened in NHL playoff history.\nDespite losing to the Devils in the Stanley Cup Finals, Mighty Ducks goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player during the playoffs, marking only the fifth time that the Trophy had ever been awarded to a player on the losing team. \nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Ottawa Senators vs. (8) New York Islanders.\nThe Ottawa Senators finished as the first overall seed in the Eastern Conference with 113 points.

In game four, Marian Hossa had a goal and an assist to help the Senators take a 3–1 series lead in a 3–1 win.

The Boston Bruins finished seventh overall in the Eastern Conference with 87 points. This was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams with New Jersey winning two of three previous series.

The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim finished as the seventh seed with 95 points (losing the tiebreaker with Minnesota in total wins). This was the third playoff meeting between these two teams with Detroit winning both previous series via four-game sweeps. They last met in the 1999 Western Conference Quarterfinals which Detroit won in four games. Detroit won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nFor the first time in their history, Anaheim won a series in a four-game sweep. In game one, the score remained tied 1–1 through three periods of play. In the first overtime, Luc Robitaille appeared to score the game-winner with most Detroit players heading down the locker room when replay actually showed the puck hit the crossbar and post but stayed out. Finally in the third overtime, Paul Kariya scored at 3:18 to end the game; Jean-Sebastien Giguere made 63 saves in the 2–1 win for the Mighty Ducks. Rob Niedermayer had two assists in the Mighty Ducks' 3–2 victory in game two.

Giguere making 36 saves in the process. Anaheim ended Detroit's season in the first overtime of game four on Steve Rucchin's goal.

The Minnesota Wild finished as the sixth seed in the Western Conference with 95 points (winning the tiebreaker with Anaheim in total wins). This was the Wild's first playoff appearance since joining the League in 2000. This was also the first time since 1992 that an NHL team from Minnesota made the playoffs. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Colorado won this year's four game regular season series earning six of eight points.\nThe Minnesota Wild came back from a 3–1 deficit to defeat the Colorado Avalanche in seven games. In game one, Minnesota scored three goals in the second period, two on the power play, to win the game 4–2. Colorado vanquished the Wild in game two with defenceman Rob Blake assisting twice in a 3–2 victory. Patrick Roy earned his 23rd and final playoff shutout in game three stopping all 18 shots he faced in a 3–0 win for the Avalanche. In game four, Minnesota Wild head coach Jacques Lemaire replaced goaltender Dwayne Roloson who had given up two goals, both to Joe Sakic, on four shots with Manny Fernandez. The switch did not help the Wild as they fell to the Avalanche in a 3–1 loss. Minnesota gained a 3–0 lead within the first two periods of game five before they had to withstand a comeback by the Avalanche in the third period notching the score within one goal. The Wild forced a sixth game with a 3–2 victory. Game six was a scoreless affair until the third period in which both teams each scored twice with Greg de Vries scoring the tying goal for the Avalanche with 1:32 left in the third period. In overtime, Richard Park scored his second goal of the game for the Wild to force a seventh game. In game seven, the Avalanche twice had one goal leads before the Wild tied the game a minute and a half later. Finally in overtime, Minnesota completed the comeback with Andrew Brunette's goal to send the Wild to the Conference Semifinals. This game was also Patrick Roy's last NHL game as he announced his retirement during the offseason.\n(4) Vancouver Canucks vs. (5) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Vancouver Canucks finished as the fourth seed in the Western Conference with 104 points. The St. Louis Blues finished as the fifth seed in the Western Conference with 99 points. This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams.

The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Devils defeated the Lightning in five games. In game one, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur stopped all 15 shots he faced in a 3–0 win.

The teams split this year's five-game regular season series. Both teams had come off of 3–1 comebacks in the first round, and fittingly enough, the same thing happened in this series.\nThe Minnesota Wild became the first team in NHL history to come back from being down 3–1 twice in one playoff season to win both series in seven games.

After giving up a 2–0 lead in game one, the Senators won in overtime on Shaun Van Allen's goal giving Ottawa a 3–2 win. In game two, Jay Pandolfo scored a goal and an assist to help the Devils win 4–1. Game three was a low-scoring affair as Sergei Brylin had the only goal in the Devils' 1–0 victory; Martin Brodeur stopped all 24 shots he faced. New Jersey scored three times in the third period to take game four 5–2 and extend their home winning streak to eight games. Jason Spezza had a goal and an assist during game five in the Senators' 3–1 victory forcing a sixth game. In overtime of game six, both teams were deadlocked at one goal each until Chris Phillips scored the game-winner for the Senators becoming the fourth team this season to force a seventh game after facing a 3–1 series deficit. In game seven, Ottawa scored the first goal, but Jamie Langenbrunner, who did not score a goal in this series up until this game, scored twice in the second period. Ottawa tied it up early in the third period on Radek Bonk's goal. The game looked like it was going into overtime, until Jeff Friesen of the Devils gave New Jersey the lead with 2:14 left in the third period. New Jersey hung on for a 3–2 victory, moving onto the Stanley Cup Finals for the fourth time in franchise history, and avoiding the same fates as St. Louis, Colorado, and Vancouver.\nWestern Conference final.\n(6) Minnesota Wild vs. (7) Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. This was the first Western Conference Final since 1994 to not feature either the Detroit Red Wings or Colorado Avalanche. This was the first Conference Finals appearance for both teams; the Mighty Ducks made the Conference Finals in their tenth season, while the Wild did so in their third season; the teams entered the NHL in 1993 and 2000, respectively. Anaheim won this year's four-game regular season series earning five of eight points.\nAnaheim earned their second four-game sweep this playoffs season. Anaheim also only allowed one goal in the four games they played against Minnesota setting an NHL record for the fewest goals allowed by one team in a playoff series. In game one, Petr Sykora scored the only goal of the game in the second overtime period. Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped all 39 shots he faced. Kurt Sauer and Rob Niedermayer both scored short-handed goals in game two as the Mighty Ducks shut out the Wild again, this time 2–0. Paul Kariya scored twice in game three, and J.S. Giguere shut out the Wild for the third time this series, stopping 35 shots, bringing his total consecutive shutout time to 213 minutes and 17 seconds. Determined to score, Minnesota got on the board for the first time since game seven of the Conference Semifinals when Andrew Brunette scored on a power-play. However, Anaheim followed up by scoring two power-play goals themselves, both by Adam Oates. The score remained 2–1 as the Mighty Ducks moved onto the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams. New Jersey made their fourth appearance in the Finals, they last made the Finals in , where they lost to the Colorado Avalanche in seven games. Anaheim made their first Finals appearance in their tenth season since entering the league in 1993–94. New Jersey won both games during this year's two-game regular season series.\nThis was only the third time in NHL history and the first time since that the home team won all the games in the Stanley Cup Finals. \nPlayer statistics.\nThere was a tie for the playoff point lead between Jamie Langenbrunner and Scott Niedermayer, both of the New Jersey Devils and both with 18 points. Langenbrunner led the playoffs with 11 goals and Niedermayer led the playoffs with 16 assists. The 18 points to lead the playoffs was the lowest total since the 1968–69 season.\nGoaltending.\nThese are the top six goaltenders based on either goals against average or save percentage with at least four games played."

        "text": "The 1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia was a controversial six-week rugby union tour by the Springboks to Australia. Anti-apartheid protests came to being all around the country. The tour is perhaps most infamous for a state of emergency being declared in Queensland.In total, around 700 people were arrested whilst the Springboks were on tour.\nOverview.\nThe first games were then played in Adelaide and Perth, which were disrupted mainly by youth-led protesters. The third match was set to take place in Melbourne. A 5,000 strong crowd, made up mostly of university students, gathered in the streets of Melbourne to march on Olympic Park in protest. Police had set up a wall of units around the stadium, around 650 policemen many armed with batons and some on horseback.\nIn Sydney, several people, including the Secretary of the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation, attempted to saw down the goal posts at the Sydney Cricket Ground prior to the match. In addition, a gigantic anti-apartheid effigy was hung from the Sydney Harbour Bridge but subsequently cut down.\nQueensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen declared a month-long state of emergency. Protests at the Tower Mill Motel where the South African team were staying were responded to by police. The game was instead played at the Exhibition Ground, being moved from its original venue at Ballymore, as it was deemed easier to erect barricades at the Exhibition Ground. A two-metre chain wire fence was erected to separate players and spectators, backed up by police in full riot gear standing ten meters apart and facing the spectators. \nAccording to Meredith Burgmann and Peter McGregor, both leading firebrands, the rugby tour was a crucial target but to stop the summer's cricketing visit was the ultimate goal. They were successful in this regard as the cricket tour was called off due to security reasons.\nFixtures.\n\"Scores and results list South Africa's points tally first.\"\nTouring group.\nHookers\nProps\nLocks\nLoose forwards\nFullbacks\nWings\nCentres\nFlyhalves\nScrumhalves\nTest matches.\nSouth Africa won the Test Series 3–0\nSouth Africa: McCallum, Nomis, Cronje, Jansen, Viljoen, Visagie, J Viljoen, Du Plessis, Ellis, Greyling, Williams, Du Preez, Marais (c), Van Wyk and Sauermann\nTries by Hannes Viljoen, Joggie Viljoen and Jan Ellis.

        "text": "John Thomas Stone (October 10, 1905 – November 30, 1955), nicknamed \"Rocky,\" was an American baseball outfielder. He played 11 season in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1928–1933) and Washington Senators (1934–1938). Stone hit over .300 seven times and had a career batting average of .310.\nEarly years.\nStone was born in 1905 in Lynchburg, Tennessee. He attended Maryville College from 1925 to 1928. The school's baseball team was 15-2 in Stone's senior year. \nProfessional baseball.\nDetroit Tigers.\nStone signed with the Detroit Tigers and, after a short stint in the minor leagues at Evansville, he appeared in his first major league game on August 31, 1928, just a few months after leaving college. In his first partial season, Stone hit an impressive .354 in 26 games with 15 extra base hits and a .549 slugging percentage.\nIn 1929, Stone's batting average dropped 94 points to .260, but he returned to solid hitting in 1930 with a .311 batting average and a .452 slugging percentage. During July and August 1930, Stone had a 27-game hitting streak. Only five Detroit Tigers (Ty Cobb, Goose Goslin, Ron LeFlore, Dale Alexander, and Pete Fox) have had longer hitting streaks.\nStone's fourth big league season in 1931 was his best. His .327 batting average was 10th best in the American League. He led the league in singles (142) and was also among the league leaders with 191 hits, 11 triples, and 13 stolen bases. Stone was also 16th in the American League's Most Valuable Player voting for 1931.\nIn 1932, Stone continued as one of the top batters in the league, with 64 extra base hits, 108 RBIs and a .486 slugging percentage. He ranked ninth in the American League with 283 total bases and also ranked among the Top 10 in triples, home runs and RBIs.\nOn April 30, 1933, Stone became the first major leaguer to collect six extra base hits in a regulation length doubleheader‚ as he collected four doubles and two home runs against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the 1933 season with a .283 batting average, a .434 slugging percentage, and 55 extra base hits.\nOn December 13, 1933, Stone was traded to the Washington Senators in exchange for Goose Goslin. Goslin went on to help the Tigers win back-to-back pennants in 1934 and 1935, while the Senators dropped from first place to seventh place in 1934.\nWashington Senators.\nStone played for Washington for five seasons from 1934 to 1938, appearing in 556 games and compiling a .317 batting average, .393 on-base percentage, and .476 slugging percentage. Stone retired from baseball after the 1938 season due to a lung ailment.\nLater years.\nStone was married to Ruth Ellis Stone. They had a son, John T. Stone, Jr., and a daughter, Suzanne Stone. \nWhen his playing career ended, Stone retired to his farm in Bedford County, Tennessee. He died of a heart attack in 1955 at his home in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He was 50 years old when he died. He was buried at the Odd Fellows-Masonic Cemetery in Lynchburg."

        "text": "The NCAA Division I Baseball Championship is held each year from May through June and features 64 college baseball teams in the United States, culminating in the eight-team Men's College World Series (MCWS) at Charles Schwab Field Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska.\nThe tournament is unique in that it features four tiers of competition, alternating between double-elimination brackets and best-of-three series. In fact, throughout the entire 64-team tournament, a team can lose a total of four games and still be crowned champions.\nDuring team selection, sixteen teams are given \"national seeds\". The top eight of these teams automatically host a super regional if they advance past the regional round, assuming that they have the facilities to do so. Only 2 times has a national seed not hosted due to lack of proper facilities. As in other NCAA tournaments, conference champions (usually determined by a tournament) receive automatic bids, and the selection committee fills the remaining spots.\nThe first tier, called Regionals, consists of 16 locations that include four teams, seeded 1 through 4, competing in a double-elimination bracket. The 16 host sites are determined mostly by merit – most No. 1 seeds host – but are also contested by bids from schools guaranteeing the NCAA a certain amount of revenue from that regional. Host teams traditionally have a large advantage, although the home team for each game is determined by rule, so the host school sometimes plays as the visiting team. The winner of each regional moves on to the second tier, the Super Regionals.\nSuper Regionals are played at eight locations throughout the country and consist of the 16 surviving teams, matched up by predetermined regional pairings. National seeds 1–8 cannot meet each other in the super regional and are guaranteed to host. If the higher national seed in the bracket is eliminated in the regional stage, but the lower national seed advances, the super regional will be played at the national seeded team's field. If the two seeds are not national seeds, the Super Regional will be bid upon by the two competing teams. If the national seed wins the regional but is unable to host, the Super Regional is awarded to the other regional winner in its bracket. This scenario played out in 2015 when national seed Missouri State could not host a Super Regional because the minor league Springfield Cardinals, which have scheduling priority at the stadium where both teams play, were playing a home series at that time. The Super Regional was thus awarded to Arkansas. The two teams play a best-of-three series to determine who moves on to the MCWS. Although one school hosts all three games, the teams split home-team status in the first two games, with the host school batting last in the opening game and first in game 2. If a third game is needed, a coin toss determines home-team status.\nThe final eight teams meet in Omaha, Nebraska, in the Men's College World Series. The MCWS mimics the earlier rounds, consisting of two double-elimination brackets of four teams each. Thereafter, the winners of each bracket meet in a best-of-three final. The winner of this final series wins the MCWS and is crowned the national champion. The school with the most national champions is USC with 12, though the Trojans have not won one since 1998, and have not appeared in the World Series at all since 2002. They are followed by LSU, with 7 national champions between 1991 and 2023.\nTeam titles.\nThe following table shows the total national championships won by school, as well a map of all champions.\nAppearances.\nThe following tables show the total appearances in the NCAA Tournament by school. The official NCAA record only includes the District playoff games starting in 1954, so only the top 8 teams from earlier years appear on this table.

Starting in 1999, there were 16 Regionals, and the top 8 national seeds are shown with , while the next 8 seeds are shown with . These seeded teams are not always the host of the Regional, but in recent years, the list of hosts aligns very closely to the list of top seeds.\nPast formats.\n1947.\nThe first tournament was an 8 team single elimination tournament. Four teams each were put into two playoff brackets, named the \"Eastern playoff\" and the \"Western playoff.\" The winner of each bracket moved on to the College World Series, which was, at that time, a 2 team best-of-three-game series.\n1948.\nThe second year of the tournament maintained the \"Eastern playoff\" and \"Western playoff\" format, however, they were now double elimination. The winner of each bracket moved on to the College World Series to play a best-of-three-game series.\n1949.\nThe third year of the tournament consisted of four regions named Region A, Region B, Region C, and Region D. Each region consisted of two teams playing in a best-of-three-game series. The winner of each region moved on to the College World Series, which was now a four-team double-elimination tournament.\n1950–1953.\nFrom 1950 through 1953, the preliminary rounds were not managed by the NCAA but rather by the district colleges, and thus these games are not recorded in the official history books of the NCAA. The winner of each district managed playoff (although some districts did not have playoffs and chose to select their teams by committee) were sent to the College World Series, which was an eight-team double-elimination tournament. The 1950 event was the first in Omaha, where it has remained.\n1954–1974.\nFrom 1954 through 1974 the tournament consisted of eight districts, named by number. Each consisted of between two and five teams playing in differently formatted tournaments. Some years included automatic College World Series qualifiers, and that team played no district games; for an example see 1959. The winner of each district moved on to the College World series, which was double-elimination.\n1975.\nThe first year of the regional format was 1975. Eight regionals consisted of four teams in a double-elimination tournament. The winner of each regional moved on to the College World Series, also double-elimination.\n1976–1981.\nThe tournament essentially remained unchanged from the 1975 version, however, one regional consisted of six teams in a double-elimination tournament, with four teams in each of the other seven regionals. The winner of each regional moved on to the College World Series, also double-elimination.\n1982–1987.\nThe tournament expanded again in 1982—to 36 teams—to include two regionals with six teams while the other six regionals only had four teams. The Regionals remained double-elimination with the winners moving onto the College World Series, also double-elimination.\nSubsequently, the tournament field expanded to 38 teams in 1985, 40 teams in 1986, and 48 teams in 1987.\n1988–1998.\nFrom 1988 through 1998, the NCAA tournament featured 48 teams, which contested in eight regionals of six teams each for the right to go to the College World Series.\n1999–2017.\nThe four-team regional format and the best-of-three super regional format debuted in 1999, with the expansion of the tournament to 64 teams.\nThe best-of-three championship series at the College World Series debuted in 2003 after CBS ceased coverage of the \"one-off\" College World Series championship game. This allowed the NCAA to institute the best-of-three series for the finals, which better mimics the traditional three-game series played during the regular season and makes a pitching staff's depth a key factor. ESPN and ESPN2 now cover the entire CWS. After 61 years at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, the College World Series moved to the new TD Ameritrade Park in 2011.\n2018.\nFor the first time, the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball tournament will seed the top 16 teams, rather than only the top 8 teams as has been the practice since 1999. This will ensure that the regional featuring top ranked team will be paired with the regional hosted by the sixteenth seeded team, where in the past Super Regionals were paired generally along geographical lines.\nESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SEC Network, &amp; ESPN3 covered every regional. Longhorn Network also covers games that Texas hosts for people in Texas for regionals but featured on ESPN3 since Longhorn Network is an ESPN sports network only in Texas. All Super Regionals are on ESPN, ESPN2 &amp; ESPNU. However they are mainly on ESPN2 &amp; ESPNU. The CWS is on ESPN &amp; ESPN2.\nNational seeds.\nIn 1999, the NCAA began awarding eight teams with a national seed. These teams automatically host a super regional if they advance past the regional round, unless their facilities are considered inadequate by the NCAA and thus do not bid to host, or their home stadium is unavailable because of scheduling conflicts; in some cases, a team may share a stadium with a minor league professional baseball team, or if their stadium does not meet NCAA requirements, host the event at the professional team's stadium. The former was the case for Cal State Fullerton in 1999, as its ballpark lacked the required seating capacity and media facilities at the time. In 2015, Missouri State was unable to host because of scheduling conflicts with the minor-league team whose off-campus ballpark it used. In 2018, the NCAA expanded the national seeds to 16 teams, guaranteeing the lower seed the ability to host the super regional if the higher seed does not advance.\n\"Gray Shade and Italics\" indicates team made the Men's College World Series.\nBold Italics indicates team won the Men's College World Series.&lt;br&gt;\nRegional and Super Regional Hosts (1999-present).\nStarting in 1999, the NCAA expanded to a 64-team format with a regional and subsequent super regional round, with the winners of the super regionals advancing to the MCWS. The tournament begins with 16 double-elimination regional sites of four teams each; the NCAA seeds the teams 1–4 and announces the host school and venue, which is generally hosted by the highest seeded team in the region at their home stadium. The winners of each regional (16 teams) advance to the super regional round, divided into eight super regional locations, each with two teams facing off in a best-of-three series; once again, the NCAA announces the host site between rounds, and each super regional is generally hosted by the higher-seeded of the two teams.\nTeams must submit a bid for hosting rights. At times, the host venue has been hosted at a venue of the highest seed's choosing that is not its home field, or hosted by a team that is not the highest team in the region, due to a number of factors including scheduling conflicts at the highest team's home venue, the host school's home venue being inadequate to host according to NCAA criteria, the host school not submitting a bid, and severe weather.\nAttendance.\nThe highest single-game attendance for an NCAA Super Regional was at Dudy Noble Field, Polk-Dement Stadium at Mississippi State University. On Saturday, June 12, 2021, 14,385 watched Mississippi State beat Notre Dame 9–8 in game 1 of a best of 3. The second highest was set the day after as 13,971 fans saw Notre Dame even the series with a 9–1 victory. For the decisive Monday game, 11,784 fans saw the Bulldogs defeat the Fighting Irish 11–7 to send Mississippi State on to the College World Series. This set the overall Super Regional at 40,140, breaking the former record of 35,730 set when Arkansas hosted Missouri State in a Super Regional in 2015. The highest for an off-campus facility was set at Zephyr Field, a minor-league park in New Orleans. In 2001, Tulane and LSU battled for 3 games in front of 34,341 fans.\nThe highest single-game attendance for an NCAA Regional game was also set at Mississippi State; 11,511 watched Mississippi State vs Central Michigan on June 1, 2019. For total attendance during a Regional series, LSU holds the top 2 spots at 67,938 in 1998 and 66,561 in 1997. Mississippi State holds the next three to round out the top 5--64,723 in 1997, 63,388 in 1989, and 62,191 in 1990. All of those Top 5 regional attendance records were set under the old six-team Regional format.\nLongest game in college baseball history.\nThe longest college baseball game was a 2009 regional game between Boston College and host Texas on May 30 in Austin. Texas won 3–2 in 25 innings, which lasted over seven hours.\nThe third-longest game in tournament history occurred in a 2012 regional game between Kent State and Kentucky at U.S. Steel Yard in Gary, Indiana, where Kent State won 7–6 in 21 innings."

        "text": "The Otago Rugby Football Union is the official governing body of rugby union for the Otago region of New Zealand. The union is based in the city of Dunedin, and its home ground is Forsyth Barr Stadium. The top representative team competes in the ITM Cup, New Zealand's top provincial competition. The union was to have been liquidated in March 2012. However a deal involving the Dunedin City Council allowed it to keep operating. Otago have won the Ranfurly Shield on seven occasions (1935, 1938, 1947, 1957, 2013, 2018 and 2020). They were the National provincial championship winners in 1991 and 1998. They have a proud record playing international teams, having defeated South Africa and the British and Irish Lions.\nHistory (1881-1975).\nThe Otago Rugby Football Union was founded in 1881 and celebrated its 125th year in 2006.\nRanfurly Shield.\nOtago held the Ranfurly Shield between 1935 and 1938 and successfully defended it eight times, and then again in 1938 for a further five defences. They had a successful run between 1947 and 1950 defending the shield on eighteen occasions before losing it.\nOtago then won it in 1957 and defended it once before losing it to Taranaki 11–9, after leading 9-0 earlier in the game. Afterwards the Otago coach Charlie Saxton told the Taranaki captain Peter Burke that 'the better team lost'. Burke replied: 'Charlie, you can say what you like, we've got the shield.'\nOtago victories over the Lions (1950, 1959 and 1966).\nOtago has had a good record against the British and Irish Lions having beaten them in 1950 and 1959. In 1966, Otago again defeated the British and Irish Lions 17–9. On that day Carisbrook was full with 25,500 fans attending the game. Dave Edwards, playing on the wing, scored one try and Maurie Collins, playing on the opposite wing, scored two tries for Otago to help seal the victory.\nThe 1975 Otago rugby team was recognized as one of the greats as it won 15 games and only lost two games all season. They beat Scotland 19–15, Auckland 22-4 and went undefeated on their North Island tour.\nNational provincial championship (1976–2005).\nAfter the success of the 1975 team, a number of players left the team and performances slowly went downhill in the late 1970s. Otago came 7th in 1976; 9th in 1977; 9th in 1978 and 11th in 1979 in the national provincial championship.\nLee Smith was appointed the Otago coach in 1980 and coached the team for three years including against the 1981 South African team who Otago lost to 17–13 in a close game. During his coaching reign Otago played 52 games for 25 wins and 27 losses. Lee Smith was replaced by Laurie Mains as Otago coach for the 1983 season as the Otago team had narrowly avoided relegation from the first division in 1982 after coming in 10th place with 2 wins from 10 games.\n1983 Laurie Mains appointed coach.\nIn 1983, Otago provided an improved performance coming 7th in the National Provincial Championship. Captain Wayne Graham led the team to 4 wins, 2 draws (including a nil all draw with Auckland) and 4 losses.\n1984 provided the best performance from an Otago team for some years as they achieved third place with seven wins and three losses. They also played France losing the game 20–10.\nLaurie Mains appointed Mike Brewer when he was 20 years old as captain of Otago in 1985 to take over from Wayne Graham. Otago played a very structured game with the forwards attempting to dominate and Dean Kenny, John Haggart or Lindsay Smith kicking for position and attempting to force the opposition to make errors. Mike Brewer and Laurie Mains worked on a plan for Otago to improve with the aim to win the National Provincial Championship by 1992. Otago finished 5th in the National Provincial Championship in 1985. They defeated Auckland at Carisbrook 12–10, one week after Auckland had lifted the Ranfurly Shield from Canterbury. Otago also played England at Carisbrook losing by 25 -16.\nIn 1986, Otago finished one better coming 4th in the National Provincial Championship. Outside of the NPC, Otago played East Coast winning a one sided game 91–10. Paul Turner scored two tries, kicked 14 conversions and one penalty.\nOtago had had a good year in 1987 coming third in the National Provincial Championship. Otago won six games and lost four games. They played a further seven non championship games in 1987, winning all of them including a 51–7 victory over Sydney.\nThe following year (1988) was also good for Otago. They finished third in the National Provincial Championship winning eight games and losing only two games, one to Wellington and a close game in a Ranfurly Shield challenge to Auckland. The Otago team had a forward pack including Gordon Macpherson, Richard Knight, Paul Henderson, Mike Brewer, Arran Pene and Brent Pope. On the wings were John Timu who scored 16 tries (including two bags of four tries) and Noel Pilcher who scored 15 tries respectively that season for Otago. Otago played Wales and almost beat them 13–15 in a close match at Carisbrook in May 1988. They had a short tour to Australia, defeating the Australian Baabaas 32–16, ACT 50-3 and drawing with Sydney 11-11.\nOtago came 5th in the 1989 edition of the National Provincial Championship. They also toured Argentina and played three games defeating San Isidro 28–15; Banco Nacionale 37-27 and a Mendoza Selection 25–21.\nOtago came 3rd in 1990 in the National Provincial Championship. They won eight out of their ten games only losing to Waikato and Auckland They also toured Canada, winning all three games, against Canada 23–6; British Columbia 20-9 and the University of British Columbia 36-12. Otago played Australia at Carisbrook losing 20–24 in a close match. John Timu scored two tries and Paul Cooke one try for Otago in the game.\n1991 National Provincial Championship Victory.\nThe Otago team captained by Mike Brewer and coached by Laurie Mains won every game that season bar the second game of season against Counties in the National Provincial Championship. The crunch game was against Auckland at Carisbrook where Otago won 17–6 with tries from Greg Cooper and Jamie Joseph. The final game of the season was against North Harbour at home with Otago winning 26–10. Marc Ellis, Paul Cooke and John Haggart all scored tries. Of the 1991 team, eleven of the regulars ended up playing more than 100 games for the province and the other eight played more than 50 games. The team had a great culture and Steve Hotton commented that \"There were country guys, town guys and university students and we all got on really well\".\n1992 Second place in National Provincial Championship.\n1992 was the year that playoffs were introduced into the National Provincial Championship. The Otago team, now coached by Gordon Hunter, reached the semi-final against North Harbour which was played at Carisbrook. At half time, Otago led 13-3 thanks to a Paul Cooke try, a John Timu drop goal and Greg Cooper's goal kicking prowess. In the second half, North Harbour pulled the score back to finish with a 16 -16 draw prompting extra time. In extra time, Frank Bunce scored a try for North Harbour and then Greg Cooper kicked a penalty and scored a converted try in the corner for Otago to win 26–23.\nThe final was played in Waikato and was a disappointing game for Otago who lost 40–5. Waikato had a dominant forward pack in the game. The game is of note as Richard Loe was suspended for six months for eye gouging Greg Cooper.\n1993 Second place in National Provincial Championship.\nOtago defeated Waikato in the semifinal with a solid 36–22 victory at Carisbrook. The final was against Auckland in Auckland. Unfortunately, it started badly and by halftime, Auckland was ahead 20–3. Otago came back in the second half to score two tries but by this stage it was all over. The final score being 27–18. Josh Kronfeld ended up going off with a smashed cheekbone. and Jason Chandler from Auckland was sent off as a result.\n1993 Otago victory over the Lions.\nOtago played a high tempo game against the touring British and Irish Lions in 1993. Otago scored five tries in their 37–24 victory. Paul Cooke scored twice and David Latta, John Leslie and John Timu all scored tries against the near-full strength team which was preparing for the first test against the All Blacks. The BBC said that \"In scoring five tries and 37 points, Otago gave the tourists a record kicking\".\nThe Lions were expected to dominate the tight five but could not match the mobility of the Otago pack. Stu Forster commented that \"We were given no chance, and we stuffed it right up them.\" Gordon Hunter (who also worked as a police detective) was asked a question by an English journalist in the post match press conference. He reached for his notebook and after flicking through a few pages, paused, and said to the surprise and mirth of everyone: \"Sorry, they're my murder inquiry notes.\"\n1994 Otago victory over the Springboks.\nOtago played the Springboks on the 27th of July 1994 in very wet conditions. 22,000 people attended Carisbrook to watch the game. The Springboks made a great start with Joost van der Westhuizen scoring 16 seconds after the kick off after a Stephen Bachop kick was charged down. Otago came back and John Leslie running on an angle scored under the posts. Jeff Wilson kicked 5 out of 6 goal kicks over for Otago to win 19–12. David Latta played one of his greatest games as captain with the Otago forward pack outplaying the much larger Springbok pack.\nThe Springbok head, given to the first provincial team to beat the touring South Africans on each tour was presented by Springbok captain Tiaan Strauss to David Latta at the after-match function under the Rose Stand.\n1995 Second place in National Provincial Championship.\nAfter a mixed season, Otago beat Counties at Pukekoke in the semi-finals to set up a final against Auckland in Auckland. It was to be the last games for Otago for Arran Pene, Jamie Joseph and coach Gordon Hunter. It was also the 100th game that Stu Forster and Paul Cooke were to play for the province. Injuries forced Otago to put Jamie Joseph and reserve Lio Falaniko at lock. Early on in the game, during a lineout, Anton Oliver was hit from behind and turned and threw a punch at Craig Dowd, knocking a few teeth out. Oliver received a one match suspension as a result. The game was played at a high pace and Josh Kronfeld, after being tackled, was taken from the field with a badly sprained ankle. David Latta was brought on as a replacement open side flanker.\nTony Brown kicked an early penalty. Marc Ellis kicked a grubber kick through that lead to a try in the corner for Jeff Wilson.\nOtago was ahead by 19–17 with minutes to go when referee Colin Hawke penalized Stu Forster and awarded a penalty try to Auckland to give them the game. Stu Forster said of the penalty try: \"I saw Zinny [Brooke] after the game, and he said the ball was definitely out of the scrum when I kicked it. But that's life, that's sport.\"\nArran Pene said of the game: \"I was wide and left a gap for [Mark Carter] because I was going to slam him over the top of the ruck. But I slipped on the surface and let a try in, and that was a turning point. It was a hell of a game, and I remember Zinny dropping the ball with the line open too.\"\nMarc Ellis was very upset by the loss commenting that \"We had a cool team, a lot of bloody good guys, and Gordy Hunter was a great bloke as coach. He knew his limitations, but he made us believe in ourselves. And we almost pulled off the unthinkable.\"\nGordon Hunter lamented that \"the final nail was a very cruel call. With both front rows standing, there is no way the penalty try should have gone through.\"\nReferee Colin Hawke admitted in 2020 that he probably should not have awarded the penalty try to Auckland that decided the game. He says that \"I could have re-set that scrum.\" He did not have the benefit of video replays or Television Match Officials (TMOs).\nThe whistle from this game was auctioned off and fetched $2500. It now resides in the Mornington Tavern, Dunedin.\n1997 British tour.\nOtago toured Great Britain in 1997 playing seven games.

The front row of Carl Hoeft, Anton Oliver and Kees Meeuws dominated the scrums, Tony Brown scored 196 points and Brendan Laney scored 15 tries during the season. Otago defeated Wellington 84-10, Northland 82-10, Southland 60-10 and North Harbour 39-8 in the round robin stage, and beat Taranaki 62-12 in the semi-finals.\nThe Otago team coached by Tony Gilbert and captained by Taine Randell won the 1998 National Provincial Championship final with a resounding victory over Waikato at Carisbrook.

The 40,000 strong crowd cheered on the Otago team singing \"We are the Champions\" at one point. John Leslie, playing his last game for Otago was carried on the shoulders of his team mates at the end of the game.\nJeff Wilson commented that holding the NPC trophy \"was one of the most satisfying moments of my rugby life\". Anton Oliver said of the team: \"I can't recall, before or since, having played with a pack that was regularly as efficient, skilled and ruthless all round. And our backs were also skilled and penetrative all year...crucially our reserves were talented, resolute and reliable\". Josh Kronfeld said: I was just stoked by the result, stoked to see a successful end.\"\n2001 Second place in National Provincial Championship.\nOtago played in the round-robin stage of the 2001 National Provincial Championship defeating Northland 37–19 in Whangarei; Southland 53–20; losing to Counties-Manukau 14–11 away and Canterbury 62–19 at home before defeating Auckland in a very close game 23–22 at home.

Brendan Laney, playing his last game for Otago scored the only try for Otago. Otago lead at half time 16–6. In the second half, penalties kicked by Andrew Mehrtens and tries to Justin Marshall and Nathan Mauger took Canterbury to the full time score of 30–19. The 10,000 Otago supporters who travelled north to Christchurch to watch the final were left disappointed by the result especially as they lost to Canterbury twice in the 2001 season.\n2003 Finished first in the round robin section of the National Provincial Championship.\nThe Otago team coached by Greg Cooper had success in the round robin stage. They finished first after winning seven games and losing three games. The team, captained by Kevin Middleton, defeated Auckland first up at Carisbrook in a very low scoring game (6-3).

Otago finished 3rd.\n2013 Ranfurly Shield victory.\nIn August 2013, Otago overcame 56 years and 22 previous challenges of disappointment to again hold the log o' wood. The Otago team, coached by Tony Brown played Waikato in Hamilton and won 26–19. It was the first time the shield had come to Otago since 1957. Hayden Parker playing at first five scored 21 points and TJ Ioane came off the bench and scored a try from a scrum 5 metres from the Waikato goal line.\nTony Brown said of the team: \"I think every one of my players left nothing in the tank and they emptied it for past Otago rugby players,\" The team made 158 tackles, turned the ball over at nine breakdowns and only had one lineout throw in miss its target.\nOtago's shield fever was short lived as Hawkes Bay defeated Otago 20–19 nine days later to take the shield in front of 20,000 supporters at the Forsyth Barr stadium.\n2014 onwards.\n2014 was a bit of a downfall for Otago.

Their dreams of promotion to the premiership were ended once again but this time by Bay of Plenty (32-48).\n2018 saw Otago beat Manawatu (17-50), Northland (27-23), Southland (24-43), Auckland (29-34), Bay of Plenty (45-34) and Waikato 19–23.

The first against 2018 Heartland Championship champions Thames Valley and the second against neighbours North Otago. The first challenge saw the Razorbacks defeat Thames Valley 41–21 in a gutsy display from the visitors.\nOtago defended the Ranfurly Shield against North Otago in Oamaru 49–14 in July 2019. Otago played a completely different backline to the one that played against Thames Valley.\nOn 17 August, Otago played against rivals Southland at Forsyth Barr Stadium in a duel where the Ranfurly Shield was at play.

Otago defeated Taranaki 35–27 with Vilimoni Koroi scoring one try, kicking three touchline conversions and three penalties. Otago then saw off Waikato 45–35 on 29 September.\nThe season ended with disappointment for Otago, as Canterbury beat Otago 35–25 to lift the Ranfurly Shield on 5 October 2019. Sio Tomkinson, Adam Thomson and Jona Nareki all scored tries for Otago with Josh Ioane converting two of them and kicking two penalties.\n2020 Ranfurly Shield victory.\nOtago won the Ranfurly Shield off Taranaki in September 2020.

Josh Ioane kicked three penalties which were the only points that Otago scored in the game.\nClub rugby.\nClubs within the union are split into two groups, Metro and Country. Clubs include:\nOtago in Super Rugby.\nFrom the start of the Super Rugby competition in 1996, Otago was one of three unions (along with Southland and North Otago) to comprise the Highlanders, and Otago players traditionally formed the bulk of the Highlanders' playing squad.\nThis changed in 2010 with the move to direct-contracting for Super Rugby teams, meaning that Otago players are free to sign with any of the New Zealand-based teams. Despite this change, in the 2011 Super Rugby season all Otago players in the competition were still playing for the Highlanders. However, due to the recent struggles of Otago and an influx of players from other areas, Otago players no longer represent the majority of the Highlanders' playing personnel.\nRecords and honours.\nHonours.\n1991, 1998.\n1935–38 (8), 1938 (5), 1947–50 (18), 1957 (1), 2013 (0), 2018–19 (6) and 2020 (0)"

        "text": "Match officials for the 2006 FIFA World Cup were nominated by the six confederations to FIFA, who, after a series of tests in Frankfurt/Neu-Isenburg in March 2006, selected 23 referees and a support and development group of a further 5, from a shortlist of 44.\nKyros Vassaras of Greece and Manuel Mejuto of Spain were selected to be on the panel, but the assistants who were to make up their teams were not deemed to have reached the required standards, and so they were replaced by Roberto Rosetti and Luis Medina. Jamaican referee Peter Prendergast was selected for the tournament panel, but suffered a knee injury and was removed from the list without replacement. Massimo De Santis of Italy was also on the panel of 23 referees, but after he was implicated in the Serie A match-fixing allegations, he was withdrawn by the Italian Football Federation and not replaced.\nThe 21 referees, along with their assistants and the support group, are based in Neu-Isenburg for the duration of the tournament. FIFA announces the referees selected for each fixture three days in advance of the match.\nHoracio Elizondo was chosen to officiate the final match, which took place in Berlin on July 9.\nRefereeing teams.\nBelow are the details of the 21 groups of match officials in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. For assistants, a flag is only shown if his nationality varies from that of the referee with whom he is grouped.\nMost teams (consisting of a referee and two assistants) are drawn from the same nation, and all are made up of officials from the same confederation. In the first round of the tournament, officials other than from UEFA member associations only operate in groups that do not include a representative of their confederation.\nMexico is the only country with 2 referees on the panel.\nFor the first time at a World Cup, match officials will be equipped with microphones and earpieces so they can communicate better with each other during each game. Furthermore this World Cup sees the introduction of a fifth official who can be called upon to replace an injured assistant referee. The fourth official would replace the referee..\nSupport officials.\nFive teams of officials were named to be on standby in the case of injury to any of the officials nominated for a match. None of them were called upon, however, and from the quarter-finals onwards, referees from among the 12 retained for the latter stages of the tournament were given standby appointments to matches.\nFinal Match Officials.\nOn Wednesday 28 June, one day after the Second Round matches were completed and two days before the Quarterfinals, the FIFA announced the 12 referees that were retained for the remaining matches. This is the standard process, meant to ensure only the best referees are in charge of the final few games. The twelve are:"

        "text": "Griquas (known as the Windhoek Draught Griquas for sponsorship reasons since April 2022) are a South African rugby union team that participates in the annual Currie Cup tournament. Their home ground is Griqua Park in Kimberley and they draw their players mostly from Northern Cape Province. They have won the Currie Cup three times – in 1899, 1911 and 1970 – and the Vodacom Cup a joint-record five times.\nHistory.\nThe rugby team was established in 1886 in the then British colony of Griqualand West. Five years later, during the 1891 British Lions tour to South Africa, Griqualand West played the British Lions in Kimberley. Although they lost 3–0, the British presented the team with the Currie Cup, as they thought that Griqualand West produced the best performance out of the provincial games on their tour. The Currie Cup became South Africa's domestic prize, and Griqualand West first won it in 1899. Griqualand West subsequently won the Currie Cup again in 1911. After the introduction of official annual championships in 1969, Griqualand West won the final the next season, defeating Northern Transvaal 11–9 to claim their third title. Since then, Griquas have not won the Currie Cup.\nThe majority of Griquas supporters hail from the Northern Cape province of South Africa, most notably in and around Kimberley, where the team plays their home games. Their traditional rivals are , a rivalry that stems back to the earliest days of the Currie Cup, when Griqualand West were a dominant force in South African rugby. Since the 1970s, a friendly rivalry has also developed with neighbours the in what has become known as the 'central derby'. Griquas are nicknamed the \"Peacock Blues\".\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been included so far in the Griquas squad for the 2023 Currie Cup Premier Division:\nHonours.\nCurrie Cup.\nGriquas have won the Currie Cup three times, and have been losing finalists once:\n1 Western Province and Transvaal did not compete.&lt;br&gt;\nThey were defeated in the semi-finals in 1998, 2019 and 2021.\nVodacom Cup.\nGriquas have won the Vodacom Cup five times, and been defeated in the final three times."

        "title": "Western Province (rugby union)",
        "text": "Western Province (known for sponsorship reasons as DHL Western Province) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Newlands, Cape Town, that participates in the annual Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup tournaments. Founded in 1883, the team has won multiple titles, a record of 34 Currie Cup titles including the inaugural competition, the Vodacom Cup, the Absa Nite Series, and the Lion Cup.\nThe club is nicknamed \"Die Streeptruie\" (\"The Striped Jerseys\" in Afrikaans) in reference to their legendary blue and white hooped jerseys. These Striped Jerseys were the colours of Malmesbury Rugby Football Club, established in 1881. They are also known simply as \"Province\" by all South African rugby lovers, while Afrikaans-speaking supporters also refer to the team by its abbreviation, W.P. (pronounced: \"vee pee\" [\"ee\" as in \"beer\"]).\nWestern Province were the 2012 Vodacom Cup Champions, having defeated the Griquas in 2012 by 20 points to 18. They also are the 2014 Currie cup champions, having defeated the Lions 19–16 in the final. Western Province is the only South African Team besides the Blue Bulls to have appeared in every final of every competition in South African rugby: the Vodacom Cup, the Lion Cup, the Absa Nite Series, the Currie Cup the Super Rugby Competitions and the United Rugby Championship (as the DHL Stormers).\nAnother accomplishment of Western Province, which no South African team has ever been able to match, is the double victories over the All Blacks the first being (10–3) played on 15 August 1928 and again (12–11) on 16 July 1976, while several countries have never been able to beat the All Black team, Province managed this feat. In 2010 province again did a remarkable victory over all of New Zealand's five super unions, this was the first and only time such an accomplishment has been achieved. Province has also beaten the Wallabies 17–6 in a thrilling encounter in 1963. Province has also drawn to other countries including England in 1984 with a score of 15 all, however province has beaten the British and Irish Lions numerous times, including three times in 1903 and won another match in 1924, the match then had been regarded as \"test\" status. The only two teams to have beaten overseas countries as well as combination teams (Lions) are yet again the Blue Bulls and Western Province. Province was unstoppable by any other opposition in the 1980s except for Northern Transvaal. Among the ten Currie Cup trophies in the 1980s 5 went to Province 4 went to Northern Transvaal and 1 was shared, this shows the dominance between the two teams and the constant intense rivalry between the unions.\nSince 1983 Western Province has been sponsored by Adidas, in 2013 this will mark the 30th Anniversary of the sponsorship and the 130th anniversary of the team itself. In 1983 Province launched their centenary jersey of which 50 only ever came into existence, but this is not the rarest province top, the rarest being a complete maroon kit of which only 15 were ever made, this team played under the WP Presidents XV. The maroon jersey along with the centenary jersey as well as the original Stormers orange tops are the three most sought after Province and or Stormers tops.\nTeam sponsor DHL has officially renewed their sponsorship with Western Province until 2016, following an emphatic 2012 season.\nBoland falls within the Western Province and combines with Boland Cavaliers to compete as the DHL Stormers in the United Rugby Championship competition.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1883. The club claimed their first Currie Cup title in 1889; they repeated this success just three years later, winning the title again in 1892. Western Province continued to dominate the Currie Cup throughout the 1890s, winning the competition in 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1898. This success continued into the early 1900s, as they won in 1904, 1906 and 1908. The competition still being contested irregularly at this stage, was next won by the Western Province in 1914. They won a further seven times over the next two decades – four times in the 1920s and again three times in the 1930s, sharing two with Border. When the first Currie Cup championship was introduced in 1939, Western Province featured in the final, but lost to Transvaal 17–6 in Cape Town.\nAfter losing the final in 1946 to Northern Transvaal, Western Province won their first final in 1947. The Currie Cup became an annual competition in 1969 and Western Province made it to the final that year, though they lost to Northern Transvaal. The team had to wait another seven seasons before making another final appearance, which they lost against the Orange Free State (recently renamed as the Free State Cheetahs) in Bloemfontein. Three years later they won the Currie Cup, sharing with Northern Transvaal at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town. The next year Province again lost in the final to Northern Transvaal. Northern Transvaal became Western Province's biggest rival during this time. During South Africa's sporting isolation (brought about as a result of the country's apartheid policy) this rivalry took centre stage and became the climax of the Currie Cup season. The teams met in another six championship finals until the 1990s. In the 1980s Western Province experienced what many described as their \"golden years\", winning the title outright for five years in a row. This feat is yet to be equaled. (Northern Transvaal had achieved this before but their third victory in the winning streak was shared with Western Province) After drawing 16 all with Northern Transvaal in the 1989 final, their next final appearance would be in 1995, when they were defeated by the Sharks in Durban. They won the Currie Cup in 1997, defeating the Free State Cheetahs, but the following season they lost to the Blue Bulls (Northern Transvaal).\nWestern Province won the championship twice in 2000 and 2001, defeating the Sharks on both occasions. 2010 saw the return of the club as they managed to make both the Super Rugby and Currie Cup finals losing on both occasions. After winning the Vodacom Cup and the Super Rugby Conference Cup, Western Province beat the Sharks in Durban to win the Currie Cup in 2012 as well. In 2013 the Province went unbeaten throughout the Currie Cup but lost in the Final. Western Province continued to dominate the Currie Cup by making the 3 finals in as many years and won the 2014 title beating the Lions in a tight fought match. In 2015 the club went on to win their 3rd and unprecedented Super Rugby Conference Cup in 5 years. In the recent times and in terms of competitions won on all levels, Western Province has been the most successful Rugby Union in South Africa over the period 2011–2015.\nName.\nThe name of the club comes simply from the province they represent. In the 1990s many teams changed their names as a result of pressure by the new ANC government. Previously many teams were named after the provinces they were based in and seeing as these provinces no longer existed, the names were no longer valid. Some teams simply added some form of animal or mascot name (e.g. Boland became the Boland Cavaliers) whereas others had to change their entire name. Transvaal for example had to change their name to the Golden Lions. Northern Transvaal were also renamed the Blue Bulls although this was less of a problem for their supporters as this had been the team's nickname for many years. Western Province is the only union that has never changed its name or added anything to it.\nStadium.\nNewlands Stadium.\nUntil 2021, the Western Province Rugby Football Union was based at Newlands Stadium. Newlands is commonly referred to as the home of South African rugby. The first official matches played at Newlands were in 1890. The ground has been continually developed over the past century, entirely due to the efforts of the Western Province Rugby Football Union and its administrators. Since the advent of professional rugby, the stadium has taken on various names due to sponsorship of the Western Province side, but is today simply named Newlands, a decision made by former sponsors Investec. Vodacom has since taken over sponsorship of the team and stadium, but chose not to rename the stadium. This decision proved very popular among the faithful supporters who deeply respect the traditions associated with W.P. rugby and Newlands itself. Newlands normally draws the largest average crowds of any stadium in the Super Rugby competition. In 2002 the Stormers welcomed their millionth spectator through the gates. The ground was bought in 1888, and currently has a capacity of 50,900. Currently Western Province have the highest supporter bases in South Africa, with the Stormers averaging crowds of 45,000 at home Super rugby games and Western Province averaging crowds of 31,000 in the Currie Cup competition. Western Province continued to have the largest crowd attendance of all the local and international Super Rugby Teams.\nCape Town Stadium.\nThe Western Province Rugby Football Union is currently based at Cape Town Stadium.\nHonours.\nBoard Trophy (1): 1889\nCurrie Cup (34) (4 Shared): 1892, 1894, 1895, 1897, 1898, 1904, 1906, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1932 (shared), 1934 (shared), 1936, 1947, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1966, 1979 (shared), 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1989 (shared), 1997, 2000, 2001, 2012, 2014, 2017\nLion Cup (3) 1984, 1988, 1989\nCurrie Cup / Central Series Percy Frames Trophy (1) 1986\nSuperSport Rugby Challenge (1) 2017\nVodacom Cup (1) 2012\nBankfin Nite Series (1) 1997\nGlasgow Academicals Sevens (1) 1993\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were included in the Western Province squad for the 2023 Currie Cup Premier Division:\nFinals results.\nNotes.\n1 Transvaal are now known as the Golden Lions.&lt;br&gt;\n2 Contested over two seasons.&lt;br&gt;\n3 Orange Free State were renamed the Free State Cheetahs.&lt;br&gt;\n4 Northern Transvaal were renamed the Blue Bulls."

        "text": "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes is a 1969 American science fiction comedy film starring Kurt Russell, Cesar Romero, Joe Flynn and William Schallert. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista Distribution Company.\nIt was one of several films made by Disney using the setting of Medfield College, first used in the 1961 Disney film \"The Absent-Minded Professor\" and its sequel \"Son of Flubber\". \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" is the first film for the series \"Dexter Riley\".\nPlot.\nDexter Riley (Kurt Russell) and his friends attend a small, private college known as Medfield College, which cannot afford to buy a computer. The students persuade wealthy businessman A. J. Arno (Cesar Romero) to donate an old computer to the college. Arno is secretly the head of a large illegal gambling ring which used the computer for its operations.\nWhile installing a replacement computer part during a thunderstorm, Riley receives an electric shock and becomes a human computer. He now has superhuman mathematical talent, can read and remember the contents of an encyclopedia volume in a few minutes, and can speak a language fluently after reading one textbook. His new abilities make him a worldwide celebrity and Medfield's best chance to win a televised quiz tournament with a $100,000 prize.\nRiley single-handedly leads Medfield's team in victories against other colleges. During the tournament, on live television, a trigger word (\"applejack\") causes him to unknowingly recite details of Arno's gambling ring. Arno's henchmen kidnap Riley and plan to kill him, but his friends help him escape by locating the house in which he is being kept, posing as house painters to gain access, and sneaking him out in a large trunk. During the escape, he suffers a concussion which, during the tournament final against rival Springfield State, gradually returns his mental abilities to normal; however, one of his friends, Schuyler, is able to answer the final question (\"A small Midwest city is located exactly on an area designated as the geographic center of the United States. For 10 points and $100,000, can you tell us the name of that city?\" with the answer \"Lebanon, Kansas\"). Medfield wins the $100,000 prize. Arno and his henchmen are arrested when they attempt to escape the TV studio and crash head-on into a police car.\nMusic.\nThe film's theme song, \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\", was written by Robert F. Brunner and Bruce Belland.\nReception.\nA. H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"This 'Computer' isn't I.B.M.'s kind but it's homey, lovable, as exciting as porridge and as antiseptic and predictable as any homey, half-hour TV family show\". Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported: \"I rather enjoyed \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" and I suspect children under 14 will like it, too\". Arthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" praised the film as \"above-average family entertainment, enhanced in great measure by zesty, but never show-off, direction by Robert Butler, in a debut swing to pix from telefilm\". Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Disney Productions latched on to a terrific premise for some sharp satire only to flatten it out by jamming it into its familiar 'wholesome' formula. Alas, the movie itself comes out looking like it had been made by a computer\".\nThe film holds a score of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on six reviews.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" on Blu-ray disc on September 9, 2014 as a Disney Movie Club exclusive.\nLegacy.\nTelevision films.\nThis film was remade as the television film \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" in 1995 starring Kirk Cameron as Dexter Riley.\nOther Disney Channel films carrying similar plot elements were the \"Not Quite Human\" film series, which aired in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The films were based on the series of novels with the same name.\nOther.\nThe animated title sequence, by future Academy Award-winning British visual effects artist Alan Maley, reproduced the look of contemporary computer graphics using stop motion photography of paper cutouts. It has been cited as an early example of \"computational kitsch\".\nThe 2000 episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes\", is a reference to the film but the episode isn't related to the film in any other way, according to M. Keith Booker in his book \"Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy\"."

In 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1960, the Cleveland World Pro had a women's draw, with Pauline Betz winning the first three of these, and defeating the reigning U.S. women's champion Doris Hart in the 1956 final. Althea Gibson defeated Pauline Betz in the 1960 women's final.\nHistory.\nAmerican's first prominent professional player, Vincent Richards, arranged what became the first U.S. Professionals by negotiating with Doc Kelton to have a tournament played at the Notlek Tennis Club, located at 119th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan, New York, on September 23–25, 1927. Richards, tour pro Howard Kinsey and teaching pros from the eastern U.S. comprised the field, with Richards defeating Kinsey in the final in straight sets, a victory which earned him $1,000 first-prize money.\nThe tournament was held annually at various locations, including the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York City; the South Shore Tennis Club in Chicago; in Rye, New York; at the Terrace Club in Brooklyn; the Chicago Town and Tennis Club in Chicago; at the L.A. Tennis Club in Los Angeles; at various clubs around Cleveland, Ohio and Cleveland Arena in Cleveland. In 1951, two U.S. Pro events were held, one at Cleveland won by Frank Kovacs and another at Forest Hills won by Pancho Segura. In 1954, the USPLTA authorized Kramer to hold the U.S. Pro Championships at the L.A. Tennis Club in California, Gonzales winning the event, and the Benrus Cup (emblematic of the U.S. Pro) was awarded to Gonzales. There are two U.S. Pro events listed here for both 1951 (Cleveland and Forest Hills) and for 1954 (Cleveland and L.A. Tennis Club). Gonzales won two U.S. Pro titles in 1954. Its final permanent home was the Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, where it was held from 1964 to 1999. It became part of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour shortly after the advent of open tennis in 1968. From 1970 to 1977, it was a prominent tournament of the Grand Prix Super Series. It then became a tennis event within the ATP Tour with reorganization of the top tier of pro tour tennis.\nThe tournament was later played on Har-Tru clay courts and was initially an important tune-up event for the US Open. But when this Grand Slam tournament moved to hardcourts in 1978, the U.S. Professionals did not follow suit, electing instead to hold its tournament during the US clay court season in early summer instead of during its hitherto pre-Open Era (late summer) time slot. Remaining a clay event into the 1990s, it was a non-ATP exhibition event from 1990 through 1995. During the last stint of the tournament, from 1997 to 1999, it was again an ATP event and was played on hardcourts.\nPancho Gonzales holds the record for most wins with nine, two of those wins in the multiple year of 1954.\nPast finals.\nSingles.\nNotes:\nDoubles.\nSource:"
