        "title": "Tennis technology",
        "text": "Since the sport's inception, the design and manufacture of tennis equipment has been affected by technological advances and regulations. As is common in major sports, regulations became more exacting over time, with improvements affecting the qualities of the tennis racket and the tennis ball.\nRackets.\nAs materials improved, becoming lighter and stronger, rackets were made larger, accordingly. Larger rackets have more surface area, making them easier for many players to return a ball. Sizes are:\nThe balance point and grip size of a racket changed as technology progressed. Depending on the player's style of play, choice is made between a head-heavy racket and a head-light racket. Head-heavy rackets provide more power on serves and ground strokes, while head-light rackets provide more control. Along with racket balance, the size of the grip on the racket can affect play style as well.\nMaterials.\nEarly rackets were made of wood, which was not as good as modern materials, since wood has inconsistencies, resulting in different feels when striking the ball. Wood rackets needed a brace to stop warping when not in use. Later designs used metals, with experimenting with metals such as steel, aluminum, magnesium and titanium.\nBillie Jean King won the first Grand Slam title ever in 1967 using a racket made out of steel. It was the first time in history that a racket other than wood had been used to win a Grand Slam. Steel racket prototypes had been around since 1922 but were first patented in 1957.\nIn 1968, Spalding launched an aluminium racquet, called \"The Smasher\". Aluminium is lighter and more flexible than steel, but stiffer – and therefore less accurate – than wood. Because of this, most of the top players still preferred to use wooden frames – and a decade later they were still in use.\n1980s graphite introduction.\nIn the early 1980s, \"graphite\" (carbon fibre) composites were introduced, and other materials were added to the composite, including ceramics, glass-fibre, boron, and titanium. The Dunlop Max200G used by John McEnroe from 1983 was an early graphite racket, along with the Prince original graphite. Composite rackets are the contemporary standard, the last wooden racquet appeared at Wimbledon in 1987. Later, people experimented with materials such as boron, ceramics, graphite, and composites. Each material had its own desirable qualities but ceramics and graphite were the best picks for being stiff as well as being good with vibration reduction.\nStrings.\nThe earliest strings were made from cow intestines (\"natural gut\"), a reliable string but expensive. With time and improved technology manufacturers have been trying to duplicate the natural gut feel with synthetic materials. Also, manufacturers are creating strings that are designed to produce more spin, power, and durability. It remains unclear whether the technological innovations in materials, product architecture, and size affected the performance of players, even if such innovations are controversial and even contested by sport-regulatory bodies. The prevailing standards are as much due to advancements in musical string technology as to the social construction of the racket by the tennis playing public and the manufacturers who furnish the sporting goods. Social construction refers to the framing or interpretation of the physical implement by the community of tennis players some of whom often challenged the putative benefits of certain strings or other aspects of the tennis rackets.\nBalls.\nOriginally the tennis ball consisted of rough cloth strips tightly bound together. Eventually the cloth strips became the core, wrapped in twine and covered by a finer cloth or felt hand-stitched around it. In 1972, at the request of Lamar Hunt to televise World Championship Tennis, the tennis ball was manufactured with the optic yellow felt. Now yellow tennis balls are mass-produced for high performance at minimal costs."

        "text": "The 1987 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 1987, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was the 73rd Rose Bowl Game. The Arizona State Sun Devils, champions of the Pacific-10 Conference, defeated the Michigan Wolverines, champions of the Big Ten Conference, 22–15.\nArizona State quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst was named the Player of the Game. In their ninth season in the Pac-10, this was the first appearance for Arizona State in the Rose Bowl.\nThis was the sixth consecutive Rose Bowl win for the Pac-10, with twelve wins in the last thirteen.\nTeams.\nArizona State Sun Devils.\nArizona State quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst looked uncomfortable in the first two games of the season, wins over Michigan State and SMU. He threw five interceptions in the third game of year against Washington State, which ended in a 21–21 tie. A 16–9 win for Arizona State over UCLA in Pasadena on October 4 later proved to be the deciding game in the race for the Pac-10 Conference title. The Sun Devils then defeated Oregon in Eugene and returned to Southern California to defeat USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, becoming the first Pac-10 team to beat both Los Angeles area conference members on their home turf.\nWith three straight wins at home over former WAC nemesis Utah, Washington, and Cal, combined with a UCLA loss to Stanford, Arizona State clinched the Pac-10 title and a Rose Bowl berth on November 8. The Sun Devils dropped their final game of the regular season to in-state rival Arizona, 34-17, in the annual battle for the Territorial Cup.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nThe Michigan Wolverines began the 1986 season ranked third in the nation. They opened their schedule with a close 24–23 win over Notre Dame in South Bend. Then they won their home opener, 31–12, over Oregon State and beat an up-and-coming Florida State squad ranked #20, 20-18. The Wolverines then handily defeated Wisconsin and Michigan State to begin Big Ten play. Michigan then faced #8 ranked Iowa. A #1 versus #2 matchup the previous season between the two schools, which the Wolverines lost, had decided the race for the Big Ten title and the 1986 Rose Bowl. Michigan won the 1986 showdown, 20–17, and then rolled over Illinois, Indiana, and Purdue to improve their record to 9–0 and ascend to #2 in the rankings.\nMichigan's next opponent, Minnesota, had not beaten the Wolverines since 1977 and came into Ann Arbor as a 25-point underdog. A Michigan touchdown tied the game at 17–17 with just two minutes to go, but Golden Gopher quarterback Rickey Foggie scrambled to put Chip Lohmiller in position to kick the winning field goal. Minnesota prevailed, 20–17, for their first win at Michigan since 1962.\nThe loss dropped the Wolverines to sixth as they prepared to face their archrival, seventh-ranked Ohio State, for a trip to the Rose Bowl. Jim Harbaugh guaranteed a Michigan victory. \"We don't care where we play the game,\" said the senior quarterback early in the week. \"I hate to say it, but we could play it in the parking lot. We could play the game at 12 noon or midnight. We're going to be jacked up.\" With Arizona State having already locked up a Rose Bowl berth, and the Fiesta Bowl and Citrus Bowl scrambling to host a #1 versus #2 showdown between Miami and Penn State, the Cotton Bowl struck an agreement to take the loser of the Michigan–Ohio State game. Michigan running back Jamie Morris led the Wolverines to a 26–24 victory on the strength of his record-setting 216 yards rushing, subsequently broken by Tim Biakabutuka's 313 yards against OSU in 1995. The Wolverines were Pasadena-bound."

He is married to Ruth Cooper.\nPlaying career.\nClub.\nCooper started his senior ice hockey career with the Durham Wasps during the 1984–85 season when he was still playing junior ice hockey with the Wasps' junior team, the Durham Hornets. Appearing for the Wasps 30 times that season, he scored just three goals. His career took off the following season when he appeared exclusively for the Wasps and scored 38 goals and 36 assists in all competitions and helped the Wasps to retain their British Hockey League (BHL) Premier Division title.\nCooper stayed with the Wasps for two more seasons — being named to the 1988 BHL all-star team along the way — before an ambitious Cardiff Devils in Division 1 of the BHL offered him enough money to play full-time and signed him and his brother for the 1988–89 season. Cooper helped Cardiff to win the promotion playoffs to the Premier Division as well gaining his second all-star team award. The following season, Cooper helped the Devils to win the league championship and the playoffs.\nBeing able to get professional wages in his home town, Cooper returned to the Durham Wasps for the 1990–91 season where he helped them to win a grand slam of the Norwich Union Trophy, the league championship and the playoffs.

        "text": "The Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844 was a tour consisting of the first international cricket match. The match took place between 24 and 26 September 1844 at the St George's Cricket Club's ground at what is now 30th Street and Broadway (then Bloomingdales) in Manhattan. The game was billed as 'United States of America \"versus\" the British Empire's Canadian Province’.\nCanada won by 23 runs in a low-scoring game. On the first day, there were from 5,000 to 20,000 spectators and an estimated $100,000 to $120,000 worth of bets were placed on the match. The prize money was $1,000 (). The United States team played a subsequent match in Canada in 1845; the teams' meetings later became the Auty Cup.\nBackground.\nThe origins of the match began four years earlier, when a team from the St George's Club turned up in Toronto, almost destitute after a long journey by stage coach through New York State and across Lake Ontario by steamer, where a Mr. Phillpotts had invited St George's to play the Toronto Cricket Club at home.\nHowever, when the 18 men of St George's arrived on 28 August 1840, the Canadians were not expecting them: it was then discovered that the Mr. Phillpotts who had arranged the match was not the Toronto club's Secretary, George A. Phillpotts, but an impostor.\nDespite the invitation being a hoax, a cricket match was hastily arranged, which was attended by a good number of spectators, a brass band and Sir George Arthur, the governor of Upper Canada. The New Yorker Club won by 10 wickets, and left on such good terms that they invited the Canadians down for what was to be the first cricket match between national teams rather than local club teams.\nMatch.\nThe US team was drawn from clubs in Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston, as well as a number in New York.\nLikewise, the Canadians tried to present a representative national team, rather than simply the Toronto CC team. Whether or not the Canadians managed to actually make it a cross-Canada national team is unclear, but letters written between the clubs indicate the Canadian team may have included players from the Guelph Cricket Club and Upper Canada College Club as well as the Toronto club. Advertisements and posters for the game found in libraries have the game as between the US and Canada, rather than two city teams.\nThe game was scheduled for two days, and after the first day, Canada had been bowled out for 82, with the USA being 61 for 9 in reply.\nOn the second day, bad weather prevented play, so the game was extended to a third day, when the USA were all out for 64, and Canada were bowled out for 63 in their second innings, setting the USA 82 runs to win. Canada bowled the US out for 58 to win the match by 23 runs.\nUS player George Wheatcroft arrived too late on the third day, and was replaced in the field by Alfred Marsh, who did not bat.\nLegacy.\nIn 1845, a return match was arranged at McGill University, Montreal, and the fixture, known as the Auty Cup, has been played sporadically ever since.\nThe cricket statistician Bill Frindall wrote in 2002, \"The USA has fielded many international teams. Their annual match against Canada has been staged since 1844, pre-dating the earliest encounters between England and Australia by 33 years.\""

        "text": "The 1942 Stanley Cup Finals was a best-of-seven series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings. After losing the first three games, the Maple Leafs won the next four to win the series 4–3, winning their fourth Stanley Cup. It was the first Stanley Cup Finals in history to go seven games.\nPaths to the Finals.\nToronto defeated the New York Rangers in a best-of-seven 4–2 to advance to the Finals. The Red Wings had to play two best-of three series; winning 2–1 against the Montreal Canadiens, and 2–0 against the Boston Bruins to advance to the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nThis was a series that saw a remarkable comeback. Toronto came back from a 3–0 series deficit to win the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Finals, commonly known as a \"reverse sweep.\" The feat has only been duplicated three times in the Stanley Cup playoffs since, but never again in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe first game was held in Toronto. Detroit's Don Grosso opened the scoring in the second minute before John McCreedy tied it for Toronto. Sid Abel put the Wings ahead, only to have Sweeney Schriner tie it to leave the teams tied after the first period. Grosso scored again at the 14:11 mark of the second and the Wings held off the Leafs from there to win the opening game 3-2.\nDetroit took the second game in Toronto by a score of 4–2. Don Grosso scored two goals again for the Red Wings. The Wings took the lead 2–0 after the first period on goals by Grosso and Mud Bruneteau. Schriner scored in the second for the Leafs to close the score to 2–1 after two periods. Grosso scored early in the third along with Gerry Brown to put the Wings ahead 4–1 before Wally Stanowski scored in the fifteenth minute for the Leafs. Detroit held off the Leafs from there to take the series lead 2–0.\nIn game three in Detroit, the Maple Leafs took an early 2–0 lead on goals by Lorne Carr, but the Wings evened the score before the end of the first period on goals by Gerry Brown and Joe Carveth. Late in the first period, Sid Abel had to leave the game with a possible fractured jaw. His replacement, Pat McReavy, scored the winning goal early in the second, and Syd Howe added another to put the Wings up 4–2 after two. Eddie Bush scored for the Wings in the third to push the final score to 5–2.\nIn the fourth game, held in Detroit, the Maple Leafs staved off elimination with a 4–3 victory. Toronto coach Hap Day pulled Gordie Drillon and Bucko McDonald, replacing them with Don Metz and Hank Goldup. There was no scoring in the first. Bruneteau and Abel scored to put the Wings ahead 2–0 before the second period was half over. The Leafs tied it up on goals by Bob Davidson and Carr to leave the teams even after two periods. Carl Liscombe scored in the fifth minute of the third to put the Wings ahead, but two minutes later Syl Apps tied it up. Nick Metz scored the winning goal for Toronto with seven minutes to play.\nThe game ended in a near-riot. In the final minute, Detroit's Eddie Wares drew a misconduct penalty and then a $50 fine for arguing and refusing to leave the ice. Referee Mel Harwood dropped the puck for the faceoff while Wares was still on the ice and promptly called a too-many-men penalty on Don Grosso. Grosso threw down his stick and gloves and was fined $25 by Harwood. At the end of the game Detroit coach Jack Adams then attacked Harwood, punching him in the face following an profanity-laced outburst. The fans booed the officiating, littering the ice with paper, peanuts, and even a woman's shoe. NHL president Frank Calder and referee Harwood were escorted out of the rink under police protection. Calder immediately suspended Adams indefinitely and imposed $100 fines on Grosso and Wares.\nThe teams returned to Toronto for the fifth game. Ebbie Goodfellow took over the coaching duties for the suspended Jack Adams. Leafs' coach Day had worked out Drillon and McDonald but chose to leave them out and his decision was vindicated. The game was a mismatch as the Leafs won 9–3 behind three goals and two assists from Don Metz. Nick Metz scored the first goal and Stanowski scored a second to put the Leafs ahead 2–0 after one period. In the second period, the Leafs scored five goals. Bob Goldham, followed by Schriner, Don Metz, Apps, and Don Metz again raised the score to 7–0 after two. In the third period, Howe put Detroit on the board but Don Metz and Apps scored before Alex Motter and Carl Liscombe scored for the Red Wings to finish the scoring.\nGame six presented a chance for Detroit to win the Cup on home ice. Although the team had lost the momentum of the series, the Detroit players promised it would be a different outcome from game five, especially the first period, where the Wings had drawn penalties leading to two power-play goals by the Leafs. The teams both showed a lot of discipline in the game and no penalties were called. The closest to an incident came in the third period when Jack Stewart of the Wings and Bingo Kampman of the Leafs collided and almost came to blows. At that time a fan threw a three-pound perch to the ice.\nThe first period was described as \"hard-hitting hockey\" and the teams ended the period scoreless. Just 14 seconds after the start of the second, Don Metz stole the puck near the Detroit goal and beat Johnny Mowers to put the Leafs ahead. Turk Broda held off the Red Wings for the rest of the game to record the series' only shutout. Goldham and Billy Taylor scored goals 32 seconds apart late in the third period to clinch the game for the Maple Leafs, who now were being considered the favourites to win the series in the seventh game.\nThe seventh and deciding game drew 16,218 fans, the largest crowd to see a hockey game in Canada at that time and it was again a close game. Detroit survived a two-man disadvantage in the first period and the teams finished the period scoreless. Detroit's Syd Howe opened the scoring in the second period on a pretty passing play between Abel, Jimmy Orlando, and Howe. The Wings were determined to protect the lead and led after two periods 1–0. Toronto got its chance in the third period to tie the score when Orlando drew a tripping penalty on Apps. Just as the penalty expired, Schriner scored for Toronto in a goalmouth scramble to tie the game. After the goal, Toronto picked up the pace, eventually out-shooting Detroit 16–7 in the third. Pete Langelle scored the series winner two minutes later in another goalmouth scramble. Schhriner scored the third goal for the Leafs at the 16:13 mark to close out the scoring and the unprecedented comeback win was complete.\nIt was the first time a crowd of over 16,000 attended a hockey game in Canada. 16,218 fans squeezed into Maple Leaf Gardens and remained for an hour after the game waiting for the Leafs to reappear from the dressing room after the game. Coach Day, who had played for the Leafs in their last win in 1932, deadpanned \"We won it the hard way.\" He was asked if he had any doubts during the series, and replied \"I had my doubts right up until that final bell rang.\" Rookie Gaye Stewart, who had joined the club for the fifth game of the final, became the youngest player to win the Stanley Cup as he was still 18 years of age. John McCreedy completed his triple championship with the win. He was a member of the Winnipeg Monarchs' 1937 Memorial Cup win and won an Allan Cup with the Kirkland Lake Blue Devils.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1942 Stanley Cup was presented to Maple Leafs captain Syl Apps by NHL President Frank Calder following the Maple Leafs 3–1 win over the Red Wings in game seven.\nThe following Maple Leafs players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs"

        "title": "South Carolina Gamecocks baseball",
        "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team represents the University of South Carolina in NCAA Division I college baseball. South Carolina has perennially been one of the best teams in college baseball since 1970, posting 34 NCAA tournament appearances, 11 College World Series berths, 6 CWS Finals appearances and 2 National Championships: 2010 and 2011. Carolina is one of six schools in NCAA history to win back-to-back titles. Since joining the Southeastern Conference in 1992, the team has competed in the Eastern division. South Carolina owns a stellar 32-20 record at the CWS, holds the NCAA record for consecutive wins (22) in the national tournament and the longest win streak ever at the CWS (12 in a row from 2010 to 2012) in which the Gamecocks played for national titles all three years.\nThe current head coach is Mark Kingston, with Chad Holbrook resigning on June 6, 2017. Holbrook took over for Ray Tanner, who was named athletics director at USC after the 2012 season. This follows a string of three consecutive appearances in the national championship series, including two consecutive national championships. During Tanner's stint as head coach, the Gamecocks also captured three SEC titles, one SEC tournament title, six division titles, six College World Series appearances, and 13 of their 15 straight NCAA tournaments (longest streak in the SEC at the time). Between 2010 and 2012 the Gamecocks set two NCAA records for postseason success: the most consecutive NCAA tournament wins (22) and the most consecutive wins in the College World Series (12). In 2013, Carolina set the record for consecutive home NCAA tournament wins, with 29. The team plays its home games at Founders Park, which opened on February 21, 2009. The Gamecocks made their 14th appearance in the Super Regional round of the NCAA D1 Tournament in 2023- good for 3rd most in the country. \nProgram history.\nSouth Carolina played its first intercollegiate game on May 2, 1895 against Wofford in Spartanburg after the faculty agreed to let the athletic teams travel outside of Columbia. After decades of lackluster performance on the diamond, Carolina's fortunes quickly changed with the hiring of former New York Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1970. Since then, the Gamecocks have been regular NCAA tournament participants, making 31 Regional and 11 College World Series appearances.\nCarolina owns a 32–20 all-time record at the College World Series and is 140–73 in NCAA tournament play. Carolina holds the NCAA tournament records for consecutive NCAA tournament wins (22), consecutive CWS wins (12), and consecutive home NCAA tournament wins (30). In 128 years of baseball, through 2023, Carolina has 2,748 wins, 1,663 losses, and 17 ties.\nBobby Richardson era (1970–1976).\nRichardson led the Gamecocks to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later. In 1975, South Carolina posted a 51–6–1 record, made the College World Series and played for the National Title against Texas (5–1 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221–92–1 record and three NCAA tournament appearances.\nJune Raines era (1977–1996).\nJune Raines took over the Gamecocks in 1977 and picked up where Richardson left off, leading the Gamecocks to a 43–12–1 record and its second National Title game appearance in three years (2–1 loss to Arizona State). Raines led the Gamecocks to three more College World Series appearances by his final season in 1996, and he finished his tenure as the program's all-time winningest coach with a 763–380–2 overall record. During the Raines' era, South Carolina made 11 NCAA tournament appearances and posted nine 40-win seasons. The 1980s saw the program's most successful run during Raines' tenure, as the Gamecocks made eight NCAA tournaments, including seven straight from 1980–1986.\nRay Tanner era (1997–2012).\nIn 1997, Ray Tanner was hired and quickly built upon the winning tradition that Richardson created and Raines had perpetuated. In 16 seasons as the Gamecocks' skipper, Tanner compiled a 738–316 (.700) record with six College World Series appearances including finishing as National runner-up in 2002 and 2012 while winning the 2010 and 2011 NCAA National Championships. Under Tanner, the Gamecocks have made 14 NCAA tournament appearances, advanced to the Super Regionals 10 times, and have posted fourteen 40-win and five 50-win seasons. In addition, the Gamecocks won the 2000, 2002 and 2011 SEC regular season championships, the 2004 SEC Tournament Championship, and six SEC East titles (1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2011, 2012). In 2010, Tanner and the Gamecocks won the NCAA Championship at the old Johnny \"The Blatt\" Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, becoming the first team to win six straight games in a College World Series and the third team to win the CWS after losing its first game of the series. In 2011, Coach Tanner led the Gamecocks to a share of the 2011 Regular Season SEC Championship before winning the 2011 NCAA National Championship at the new TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha. Under Coach Tanner's guidance, South Carolina set the NCAA record for consecutive NCAA tournament wins (22) and CWS wins (12) between 2010–2012, as the Gamecocks became just the sixth program to win back-to-back CWS titles. On July 13, 2012, Coach Tanner accepted the position of athletics director at USC, bringing his tenure as baseball head coach to a close.\nChad Holbrook era (2013–2017).\nChad Holbrook became head coach at the start of the 2013 season and began his career on February 15, 2013. South Carolina defeated Liberty 4–3 on a day honoring Tanner. Carolina reached the NCAA tournament in 2013, 2014, &amp; 2016, advancing to the Super Regionals during the 2013 and 2016 season. Holbrook resigned on June 6, 2017.\nMark Kingston era (2018–present).\nMark Kingston became head coach at the start of the 2018 season and began his career on February 16, 2018. In his first season, he led the Gamecocks to a Regional in which they won, going 3-0 in the Greenville (ECU) Regional.\n2000's: SEC dominance and return to Omaha.\nIn the 10 years from 2000–2009, South Carolina posted an impressive 468–201 overall record (179–120 SEC). The 468 overall wins ranked fourth in Division I College Baseball (first among SEC programs), and the 179 SEC victories led the conference for the decade. The Gamecocks made the NCAA tournament every season, advancing to seven Super Regionals and three College World Series (first CWS berths since 1985). In addition, South Carolina won 40 or more games each season and hit the 50-win mark on three occasions (2000, 2002, 2004). The highlight of the decade was an appearance in the 2002 National Championship game against Texas, who defeated the Gamecocks by a score of 12–6. The 2002 squad finished with a 57–18 mark, setting the record for most season victories in program history.\nSouth Carolina won eight SEC series to finish 21–9 in regular season conference play (2nd place), but posted an 0–2 mark in the SEC Tournament. Once the NCAA tournament began, however, the Gamecocks rode strong pitching and clutch hitting to win their Regional and Super Regional and earn a berth in the College World Series. After an opening game loss to Oklahoma, South Carolina reeled off four straight victories to reach the championship series against UCLA. The Gamecocks continued their hot streak, defeating the Bruins in consecutive games (7–1 and 2–1) to win the 2010 National Championship. South Carolina finished the season with a 54–16 overall record, which included an 11–1 mark in NCAA postseason play. South Carolina was the final team to win the CWS Championship in Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, and Gamecock center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. was named CWS Most Outstanding Player.\n2010 National Championship.\nSouth Carolina won eight SEC series to finish 21–9 in regular season conference play (2nd place), but posted an 0–2 mark in the SEC Tournament. Once the NCAA tournament began, however, the Gamecocks rode strong pitching and clutch hitting to win their Regional and Super Regional and earn a berth in the College World Series. After an opening game loss to Oklahoma, South Carolina reeled off four straight victories to reach the championship series against UCLA. Just as in 2002, the Gamecocks had to defeat arch rival Clemson twice (5-1 &amp; 4-3) to reach the tournament finals against heavily favored UCLA. The Gamecocks continued their hot streak, defeating the Bruins in consecutive games (7–1 and 2–1) to win the 2010 National Championship. South Carolina finished the season with a 54–16 overall record, which included an 11–1 mark in NCAA postseason play. South Carolina was the final team to win the CWS Championship in Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, and Gamecock center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. was named CWS Most Outstanding Player. This marked the University's first major athletic national championship.\n2011 National Championship.\nSouth Carolina finished the 2011 regular season 44–12 (22–8 SEC) and shared the SEC regular season championship with divisional rivals Florida and Vanderbilt, but posted a 1–2 mark in the SEC Tournament in Hoover, Alabama despite their #1 overall seeding. Once the NCAA tournament began, however, the Gamecocks rode strong pitching, clutch hitting and incredible defense while cruising through their Regional and Super Regional, without a loss, on their way to a second consecutive berth in the College World Series. South Carolina proceeded to defeat Texas A&amp;M 5–4 in their first game, then swept #1 national seed Virginia (7–1 and 3–2) in the next two, including a 13-inning win in the second matchup, to battle their way back to the CWS Championship Series versus SEC Eastern Division foe Florida. This marked the second time two teams from the SEC had participated in the Championship Series/Games. In Game 1 of the Championship Series, South Carolina lived up to their mantra as they battled to win their second straight extra inning game in the CWS, 2–1 over the Gators, in 11 innings. They had a much easier time with the favored Gators in Game 2, winning 5–2 to earn the 2011 CWS Championship and their second consecutive national title. The Gamecock defense turned an incredible nine double-plays in this CWS – no other participant turned more than three. South Carolina finished the season with a 55–14 overall record, setting a new NCAA record for consecutive post-season wins with 16, a new record for consecutive College World Series wins with 11, and became the just the sixth program in history to win back-to-back NCAA Division I Baseball Championships. Carolina became the first team to win the College World Series in the new TD Ameritrade Park, and Gamecock second baseman Scott Wingo was named CWS Most Outstanding Player.\nNotable players.\nGamecocks in Major League Baseball.\nAs of 2021, 59 former Gamecocks have seen action in the Major Leagues. Six players were active for more than 10 seasons: Brian Roberts (14), Steve Pearce (13), Dave Hollins (12), Mookie Wilson (12), Adam Everett (11), Justin Smoak (11).\nIn the 2018 World Series, former Gamecock Steve Pearce won the 2018 World Series Most Valuable Player Award as he led the Boston Red Sox to their 9th World Series title in Franchise history. Jackie Bradley Jr. won the 2018 ALCS MVP.\nDuring the 2021 season, there have been eleven active players on MLB rosters:"

        "title": "Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey team represents Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and is the oldest collegiate ice hockey team in the United States. The Bulldogs compete in the Ivy League and the ECAC Hockey League (ECACHL) and play their home games at Ingalls Rink, also called the Yale Whale. The current head coach is Keith Allain, who led the Bulldogs to an Ivy League championship in his first year as head coach (2006–2007 season). Allain is assisted by former QU/UND goaltender, Josh Siembida. On April 13, 2013, the Bulldogs shut out Quinnipiac 4–0 to win their first NCAA Division I Championship.\nTeam history.\nOrigins: Malcolm Greene Chace.\nFinancier Malcolm Greene Chace (Yale class of 1896) is credited with introducing ice hockey to the United States while a Yale student. Chace had been a tennis champion and avid player of ice polo, a game which predated hockey in the United States. In 1892, while competing in an international tennis tournament in Niagara Falls, New York, Chace was introduced to the game of ice hockey by members of Canada's Victoria Hockey Club. During the following Christmas break, Chace formed a team made up of Brown, Harvard, Cornell and Columbia students and played a ten-game schedule in Canada, with the goal of learning the Canadian game. After their tour, the students established hockey clubs at their respective schools.\nChace led the Yale team as captain in their game against Baltimore on February 14, 1896, winning 2–1. Over a century later in 1998, Yale established the position of Malcolm G. Chace Head Hockey Coach in his honor. A portrait of Chace hangs in The Schley Room at Ingalls Rink. The Malcolm G. Chace Award is given each year to the player who \"best exemplifies leadership and the traditions of the sport at Yale\".\nEarly history (1893–1963).\nThe Yale Men's Ice Hockey team is the oldest existing intercollegiate ice hockey program in the United States, the program traces its roots back to 1893. Yale played its first intercollegiate match on February 1, 1896, against Johns Hopkins, resulting in a 2–2 tie.\nIn the early years of the program, the team played under the direction of captains in a player-coach role and team managers. Despite not having an official head coach, the team proved successful in the early years of the program playing various amateur athletic clubs and a growing number of intercollegiate teams at various schools in the Northeast. Yale won its first intercollegiate championship in the fourth season of the program in 1899 when the Bulldogs went 6–0 through the season. Yale continued its early success winning the intercollegiate championship in each of the next three seasons. On February 22, 1904, the Bulldogs played their 100th game at the St. Nicholas Rink in New York, a 2–5 loss against rival Harvard. The team won its 100th game on January 8, 1913, with a 6–0 shutout at Columbia.\nFred Rocque became the program's first head coach in the 1916–17 season, during which the team finished with ten wins and four losses. The following two seasons from 1917 to 1919, the team only played three games due to the World War. Following the break, Talbot Hunter took over as head coach for the 1919–20 season. Hunter's Yale team began the season on a five-game trip to Canada, the first time an American university would make such a trip. During the rest of the 1919–20 season and through the 1920–21 season Yale played home games in Philadelphia due to poor ice conditions at the Bulldogs home rink. Clarence Wanamaker took over as head coach after serving as the coach of Dartmouth from 1915 to 1920. Wanamaker would become the first multi-year head coach in program history and led the team from 1921 to 1928. In his sixth season, the 1926–27 season, ice hockey was given major sport status by the university. He led the program to a record high 18-win season in 1922–23 and followed that season with a 14-win season, the first back to back double digit-win seasons in program history.\nThe Quadrangular League was created for the 1933–34 with Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth. The league is considered the predecessor to the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey. In 1936, the Council of Ivy Group Presidents agreed on the formal formation of the League, however the agreement did not go into effect until the 1955–56 season. Yale won the Hobey Baker Trophy, given to Quadrangular League champions in the 1934–35 season.\nIn 1938, the university hired former New York Rangers player, Murray Murdoch to take over the hockey program. Murdoch quickly turned the Bulldogs team around, after three consecutive losing seasons, he recorded back-to-back 10-win seasons followed by a 12-win and 14-win season. Seasons were shortened from 1942 to 1946 during World War II and following the war Army joined the Quadrangular League and it became known as the Pentagonal League in 1946–47. Army left the league after two season, but was replaced by Brown. In the 1951–52 season, the Bulldogs swept through the Pentagonal League with a 6–1–0 league record and finished the regular season 16–7–0. The team received a bid to the 1952 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament. It was the first Frozen Four appearance by the university. The four-team tournament, still in its early years, having first been played in 1948, was held at the Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Yale lost to the hometown Colorado College Tigers but won the consolation game 4–1 over St. Lawrence to place third in the tournament. Murdoch guided Yale to its 500th program win in the 1953–54 season on March 3, 1954, in a 10–7 win over Providence.\nIn 1961 Yale and the other members of the Pentagonal League joined various other schools in New England to form the 28-team ECAC Hockey. After two seasons a number of the smaller programs split leaving the ECAC with the Ivy League schools and a number of other Division I programs. Murray Murdoch ended his tenure as Yale head coach after 27 seasons in 1965. Murdoch finished with a record of 271–234–20, lead the Bulldogs to two Hobey Baker Trophy Quadrangular League Championships, and the program's first NCAA Frozen Four appearance.\nTaylor era (1976–2006).\nTim Taylor, a 1963 Harvard graduate and Crimson assistant coach from 1969 to 1976 under Cooney Weiland, took over the Yale program in 1976 after a number of losing seasons, including the 1974–75 season when the team finished 1–21–1 (.065). With Taylor behind the bench, the program turned around and within two seasons Taylor lead the Bulldogs to a 14-win season. In the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons, Yale reached back-to-back 20-win seasons for the first time in program history. That same season, on November 15, 1986, Yale beat rival Harvard 7–5 to win the 100th game of the Taylor era. With the win he became the second Yale coach to win at least 100 games.\nYale won its first ECAC Regular season Champion in the 1997–98 season. Despite losing in the ECAC playoffs to Harvard, Yale received an at-large bid to the 1998 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament. The Bulldogs lost in the opening round of the NCAA tournament 0–4 to Ohio State. The Bulldogs finished the season setting a new program best record of 23–9–3 (.700). With the success of the season coach Taylor was named the national coach of the year in 1997–98 by the American Hockey Coaches Association. In 2001–02 Yale got their revenge against Ohio State when the Bulldogs beat the Buckeyes 6–2 in Columbus, Ohio, to win the university's 2,000th game.\nYale made the 2006 ECAC playoffs and faced Union in the best-of-3 series first round series. After winning the first game 2–1 in overtime the second game of the series on March 4, 2006, was tied 2–2 at the end of regulation. 11th-seeded Yale eventually won 3–2 when David Meckler redirected a Zach Mayer shot 1:35 into the fifth overtime for a shorthanded goal, giving the a 3–2 victory over the 6th-seeded Union. The fifth overtime goal came at 1:10 a.m., six hours and 10 minutes after start of the game. The 141 minutes and 35 seconds set a new NCAA record for the longest played in NCAA men's hockey history. The win would become Taylor's last victory as Yale head coach after Yale's season ended with a 2-game sweep by Dartmouth in the second round of the ECAC playoffs.\nTim Taylor was let go at the conclusion of the 2005–06 season after 28 seasons as head coach of the team. During his program leading tenure Taylor recorded 342 wins, 433 losses 55 ties; becoming the first Yale coach to eclipse the 300 win mark. He coached more games than any other ECAC coach and guided Yale to 19 ECAC playoff appearances, the 1997 Cleary Cup- awarded to the ECAC Regular season Champion, and one NCAA tournament appearance. In addition, he coached all six of the school's Hobey Baker Award finalists 30 years at Yale. Taylor missed two seasons in 1984 and 1994 to coach United States Olympic Team.\nAllain era (2006–present).\nIn 2006 Keith Allain, a 1980 graduate of Yale, was named the school's eighth coach in program history and first new head coach in 30 years. Allain coached his first game as head coach on October 21, 2006, when Yale played McGill in an exhibition game. His first NCAA game and NCAA win came on October 27, 2006, against Holy Cross 2–1. After finishing his first season 11–17–3, Allain's Bulldogs rebounded the following season recording a 16 win season. Yale captured the Cleary Cup for ECAC Regular season Champions in the 2008–09 season. The Bulldogs followed the regular season by sweeping Brown in the ECAC Quarterfinal Round then getting a 4–3 win over St. Lawrence 4–3. In the ECAC Championship, Yale shut out Cornell 5–0 for the program's first ECAC Playoff Championship. The win sent the Bulldogs to the 2009 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament. After falling 1–4 to Vermont in the NCAA East Regional, Yale finished the season with a record of 24–8–2, the first 20-win season since the 1997–98 season.\nThe Bulldogs repeated as Cleary Cup Champions in the 2009–10 season and received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament after falling to Brown 2 games to 1 in a best-of-three quarterfinal round of the ECAC Tournament. The third-seeded Bulldogs faced the second-seeded North Dakota in the NCAA Northeast Regional held in Worcester, Massachusetts. After starting the third period with a three-goal lead, Yale held on during a Fighting Sioux comeback to win the game 3–2. The win was the first NCAA tournament win since 1952. In the second round of the tournament, Yale lost to Boston College in a high scoring game, 7–9.\nIn the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey rankings, the Bulldogs ranked number 1 in the poll in December 2010 for the first time in the history of the poll. Yale finished the regular season second in the ECAC but won the ECAC playoffs with a 6–0 win over Cornell in the finals. The Bulldogs advanced into their third consecutive NCAA tournament. Yale was seeded first in the 2011 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament and placed into the East Regional, held in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In the opening round the Bulldogs came close to an upset but defeated the fourth-seeded Air Force 2–1 in overtime. The win over Air Force sent the hometown Bulldogs to the East Regional Finals where they would take on three-seeded Minnesota–Duluth. The game would become the final game of Yale's season after Minnesota-Duluth defeated Yale 5–3 and eventually went on to win the NCAA Championship. Despite the loss, Yale finished the season 28–7–1, recording the best record in the history of the program.\nIn the 2012–2013 season, the Bulldogs won another Ivy League Championship. The team finished fourth in the 2013 ECAC tournament after losing to Union 0–5 in the semifinal and falling to Quinnipiac 0–3 in the third-place match. Despite their disappointing showing in the ECAC tournament, the Bulldogs qualified for the last at-large bid in the 2013 NCAA tournament thanks to Notre Dame's victory over Michigan in the CCHA Tournament final. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the 15th-seeded Bulldogs shocked 2nd-seeded Minnesota, winning 3–2 after forward Jesse Root scored 9 seconds into the overtime period, the fastest overtime goal in the history of the NCAA tournament. The next day, the Bulldogs defeated North Dakota 4–1, earning them their first berth in the Frozen Four in 61 years. In the Frozen Four semifinal, Yale defeated University of Massachusetts Lowell 3–2 on captain Andrew Miller's overtime goal. In the final, the Bulldogs defeated 1st-overall-seeded Quinnipiac 4–0 for their first NCAA Division I National Championship. Two weeks after winning their first championship, longtime Yale coach, Tim Taylor, died at the age of 71, he had been the coach for the Bulldogs prior to Keith Allain.\nThe 2013–2014 season was an off-year for the Bulldogs after finishing 3rd in the Ivy League and being eliminated in the quarterfinal round of the 2014 ECAC tournament in a 0–2 series with Quinnipiac. Yale looked to rebound in the 2014–15 season and successfully did by capturing their 12th Ivy League Championship. For the second year in a row the Bulldogs were eliminated in the quarterfinal round of the ECAC tournament in a 1–2 series with Harvard. The Bulldogs still received an at-large bid to the 2015 NCAA tournament thanks to Harvard's victory over Colgate in the ECAC Tournament final and Boston University's victory over University of Massachusetts Lowell in the Hockey East Tournament final. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the 14th-seeded Bulldogs faced off against 3rd-seeded Boston University, losing 2–3 after Terrier forward Danny O'Regan scored in the overtime period.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nHead coaching record.\nStarting in 1998, the head coach position has been known as the Malcolm G.

He was the referee during Game 6 of the 1972 Summit Series, played between Canada and the Soviet Union.\nDuring the same Series, Baader was embroiled in some controversy, because of the choice of officials for Game 8. The original referees chosen were the Swedish referee Ove Dahlberg and Czechoslovakian referee Rudolf Baťa. However, Dahlberg had fallen ill with a suspected case of food poisoning. The Soviet Union decided to switch the referees Josef Kompalla (also from Germany) and Franz Baader, on the eve of the game 8.\nAlan Eagleson, a key organizer from Canada of the Series had threatened to depart from Moscow, where the game was being played. He had reached an agreement with the Canadian team about the possible departure. However, an agreement was reached, with Kompalla and Baťa being the referees for Game 8.\nBaader is considered a rather infamous referee; he is considered having made many poor calls in Game 6. In fact, many sources consider Baader one of \"the pair they (Canadian team) hated most\", and a \"horrendous official\"."

The total purse was with a winner's share of $1.17 million.\nHistory of U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\nIt was only the second U.S. Open at Pinehurst, because of past concerns of high temperatures and its distance from a major populated area. At the first in 1999, Payne Stewart won his second U.S. Open (and third major) in one of the most remarkable U.S. Open victories ever. He trailed playing partner Phil Mickelson by one stroke as they played the 16th hole, where he made an amazing putt for par while Mickelson missed his from .

Baker played in 136 Major League games and had a .207 batting average with 51 hits, 38 runs, 22 runs batted in, and 11 doubles.\nBaker was the younger brother of Dave Baker who also played in the Major Leagues. In high school, Doug Baker played for Granada Hills and one of his teammates was future Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway.\nPro career.\nBaker was first selected by the Oakland Athletics in the ninth round of the 1981 MLB draft. He did not sign with Oakland, then later transferred from Los Angeles Valley Community college to Arizona State. In the June Draft of 1982, Baker was selected again, this time in the ninth round by the Detroit Tigers. Baker signed with the Tigers and was assigned to their minor league team in the Southern League, the Birmingham Barons. Playing third base for Birmingham that season, Baker played in 70 games, batted .225 and drove in 21 runs. The next season was Baker's first full season in pro baseball. The Tigers made a change, relieving Ed Brinkman of his duties and named Roy Majtyka as manager. Majtyka moved Baker from third to short and Baker played in 120 games and lifted his batting average to .241.\nOn July 2, 1984, Baker made his MLB debut, going hitless in three at bats against the Chicago White Sox. Baker spent most of the season as a back-up, playing third and second base as well as shortstop. Doug even got a taste of post season baseball in the big leagues, as he appeared in one game during the American league Championship, as a defensive replacement for Alan Trammell in Detroit's 8-1 win over the Kansas City Royals. It would be his only post season appearance as he did not play in the World Series.\nOver the course of the next few seasons, with Trammell and Lou Whitaker entrenched at Shortstop and Second base respectively, Baker bounced around from Triple-A to the majors. In February 1988, Baker was traded to the Minnesota Twins for journeyman minor leaguer Julius McDougal. Baker would appear in just three games for the Twins that season. After the season was over, he signed a contract with the Houston Astros but spent the entire season in the minors. At the age of thirty, and not thrilled about the prospect playing another season in the minors, Baker retired from baseball.\nNot long after he won a ring with the 1984 Tigers, Baker's World Series ring was stolen after which a replacement was made. The original ring was eventually located and returned to Baker who would later auction off the original, which sold on eBay for $12,000. However, that would not be the only ring Baker would earn in his baseball career as he also received two more as a scout with the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins."

Their home games are played on the Abessinio Court in the Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena on the school's Boca Raton, Florida campus. The Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times, in 2002 while a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference, 2023, and 2024. The Owls joined Conference USA (C-USA) in 2013 as part of the early-2010s NCAA conference realignment. After not winning a single NCAA Tournament game coming into 2023, the Owls qualified for their first Final Four in program history by defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 79–76. After the 2022–23 season, FAU left C-USA for the American Athletic Conference (The American).\nOverview and history.\nFlorida Atlantic University basketball began play in the 1988–89 season. The Owls competed as an NCAA Division II independent until the 1993–94 season, when they moved up to Division I and the Atlantic Sun Conference, now known as the ASUN Conference. After spending 11 seasons in the Atlantic Sun, the Owls moved to the Sun Belt Conference, with the rest of Florida Atlantic University's intercollegiate sports teams. The Owls moved to C-USA in July 2013, and then moved to The American in July 2023.\nBeginning: FAU gets basketball (1988–1993).\nFlorida Atlantic University played its first-ever intercollegiate basketball contest on November 18, 1988, against fellow local NCAA Division II school, Palm Beach Atlantic University. The Owls won the game 111–62. Even though the newly formed college squad hung 111 points in their first game, they would finish the inaugural season 9–19, which included a 12-game losing streak in the middle of the year. Head coach, Lonnie Williams, was known to be a \"program-builder\", but after one year, left FAU after its first season to become head coach at the University of California, Davis. Williams would only last one year at UC Davis, posting an 11–16 record.\nReplacing Williams was Penn State assistant coach, Tim Loomis. Loomis started his coaching career with a 21–7 record, and followed that up with back-to-back 15–13 seasons. The three consecutive winning seasons is a feat that no other Owls coach has ever matched, until Dusty May did it in his first three seasons. Along with the winning seasons, Loomis was able to schedule games against neighbor and powerhouse, University of Miami Hurricanes. Though Miami would beat the Owls soundly in the appearances, the ability to schedule games against them was seen as the Owls basketball program's growth. Loomis would lose the core of that inaugural team after the Owls' fourth season, and the Owls would suffer devastating 3–24 (1992–93) and 3–25 (1993–94) seasons the latter being their first official year as Division One. The members of these teams were true pioneers and super fundraisers for the athletic department as they hit the road to play teams like Florida State, Georgetown, and Iowa State while taking large paydays and suffering losses to higher ranked (#10 Georgetown) opponents. In fact, Loomis' team beat NC State on the road in 1993–94 to become the first Atlantic Sun team to ever beat an ACC team at the time.\nMove to Division I (1993–2005).\nThe 1993–94 season would mark the beginning of the Owls competition in the NCAA Division I. The Owls joined the Atlantic Sun Conference later, mostly due to the fact that the Owls baseball team was exceeding expectations so early in its development. In 1994–95, the team improved to 9–19 while in Loomis' last year. The team repeated that win total in 1995–96 under new coach Kevin Billerman but showed improvement by taking South Florida, Saint Louis, and Southern Illinois to close road losses determined by the last possession, while winning two conference games to end the season. Former Duke Blue Devil captain and leader, Kevin Billerman, was hired to further lead the Owls into Division I; his second season produced the most wins of any Division One FAU men's basketball coach up to that point. Due to NCAA's rule, the Owls were not eligible for the NCAA tournament for four years, with their first season of tournament eligibility coming in 1993–94. In Billerman's four seasons, the Owls had two 20+ loss seasons (his last two) and only one winning season (his second).\nFor the 1999–2000 season, FAU hired decorated UNLV All-American forward/center and NBA first-round draft pick Sidney Green. In his first season, Green's Owls went 2–28, with a 25-game losing streak in the middle of the season. In each of his first and second seasons, the Owls would win their opening round game in the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament, but would lose in the second round.\n2001–02 season: A-Sun champions.\nDuring the 2001–02 season, Green would lead the Owls to his only winning season, as FAU finished 19–12 and 13–7 in the Atlantic Sun. In the first-round of the 2002 Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament, FAU would again win their opening game, this time defeating Jacksonville University. The Owls would break their second-round losing tradition, beating Jacksonville State University. In the Atlantic Sun Conference Championship, the Owls faced Georgia State University and won 76–75, clinching their first conference championship and a bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nIn the 2002 NCAA tournament, the Owls were seeded as a 15-seed, and placed in the South Region, and were paired with 2-seed Alabama. Though the Owls hung tight throughout the game, heavily favored Alabama held on to win 86–78.\nCoaching carousel (2005–2018).\nGreen was fired after the 2004–05 season and the Owls landed former NCAA Coach of the Year and Tar Heel Matt Doherty. Doherty led the Owls to a 15–13 record and then left abruptly to become the head coach at Southern Methodist University.\nWith the rapid success of the football program, created from scratch just in 2001, the Florida Atlantic sports programs again moved up in level of competition. This time, the Owls would move to the Sun Belt Conference, and basketball played its first season of competition in the Sun Belt in the 2006–07 season. To replace Doherty, assistant coach and former Kansas Jayhawk star, Rex Walters, was elevated. In his first season, Walters' Owls were 16–15 and 10–8 in the Sun Belt. The 16–15 marked the first time FAU posted back-to-back winning seasons since the 1989–90 and 1990–91 seasons. The 10–8 conference record was only the fourth time the Owls had a winning record in conference play. Walters' sophomore season regressed a bit, as FAU finished 15–18. After the 2007–08 season completed, Rex Walters accepted the head coaching job at the University of San Francisco, and for the third time in four years, the Owls were searching for a new coach.\nFAU hired Mike Jarvis as their new coach. Jarvis had been the head coach at Boston University, George Washington University and, most recently, St. John's University. Between the three schools, Jarvis led his teams to nine total NCAA tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance with St. John's in 1999. Jarvis was fired from St. John's on December 19, 2003—the first Big East Conference coach to be fired during the season. It later emerged that school officials had fired Jarvis in part due to a series of embarrassing off-court incidents. Among these, a junior college transfer had been charged with assaulting a female student, and a senior guard had been kicked off the team after being caught smoking marijuana near St. John's campus in Queens. During the 2003–04 season, St. John's center Abe Keita claimed that a member of Jarvis's basketball staff had paid him nearly $300 a month for the past four seasons. As a result, St. John's placed itself on two years' probation, withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2004–05 season, and forfeited 43 wins including the 2002 NCAA Tournament and the 2003 NIT. Jarvis was faulted for not properly monitoring Keita's situation. After his ouster, Jarvis was criticized for ignoring New York City's rich pool of high school players, which particularly rankled fans used to seeing national powerhouses built primarily on New York City talent. At FAU, he looked to become the first coach in NCAA basketball history to win 100 games at four different schools. Following the 2014 season, Jarvis resigned after reports indicated that he was going to be fired. He finished with a 76–112 after six years in Boca Raton.\nOn April 7, 2014, the school hired Michael Curry, a former NBA player and coach of the Detroit Pistons. Curry's teams never finished with more than 12 wins overall or more than six wins in conference. They never finished higher than 11th in C-USA. Following the hiring of a new athletic director, Brian White, Curry was fired after four seasons at the school and a 39–84 record.\nDusty May Era and 2023 Final Four Run (since 2018).\nWhite, brother to then-Florida head coach Mike White, thanked Curry for his years at FAU, but saw no reason the Owls could not compete in C-USA. On March 22, 2018, the school hired Florida assistant coach Dusty May as head coach.\nThe FAU Owls began to experience much improved results and consistent success under May, as they finished that first season in 2018-19 with an above .500 record at 17-15 and an invite to the 2019 CIT, where they lost to the Charleston Southern Buccaneers in the first round, 68-66. The Owls followed that success with winning records in each of the first 5 seasons with Dusty May at the helm.\nThe 2022-23 FAU Owls, led by May, had their most successful season in program history, going 31-3 en-route to winning that season’s Conference USA Championship for both the regular season and the conference tournament. During that season, FAU was ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time in school history, as they at one point won 20 consecutive games. In March of 2023, the Owls made the NCAA Tournament for only the second time in program history and remarkably, made it to the Final Four in Houston after defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 79-76 in the Elite Eight at Madison Square Garden. The Owls then narrowly lost to the San Diego State Aztecs in that Final Four, 72-71, as San Diego State’s Lamont Butler hit a buzzer-beating jumpshot to help the Aztecs advance to the 2023 NCAA Tournament National Championship Game. The 2022-23 FAU Owls finished the season 35-4, the most wins of any program in Men’s Division I College Basketball that season.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times.

Teams representing 32 countries participated in several levels of competition, with an additional six national teams failing to advance from mid-season preliminary qualifying tournaments. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1994 competition.\nThe top Championship Group A tournament took place in Germany from 18 April to 2 May 1993, with games played in Munich and Dortmund. Twelve teams took part, with the first round being split into two groups of six, with the four best teams from each group advancing to the quarter-finals. Russia beat the reigning world champions Sweden to win the World Championships for the first time since entering competition after the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. The bronze medal was won by the Czech Republic, defeating Canada in their first major tournament as an independent country after their split with Slovakia at the beginning of the calendar year.\nWhile Latvia had last competed in 1939, this year marked the World Championship debut of three national teams. Kazakhstan, Slovenia, and Ukraine, played for the first time, in Group C. Belarus, Croatia, Estonia, and Lithuania all did not make it out of the autumn qualifiers and had to wait at least another year. Also waiting until the following year was Slovakia, who made their World Championship debut in Group C1 in 1994. The official mascot of this tournament was Bully the penguin.\nEleven of the twelve openings for the Lillehammer Olympics were established in Group A. Switzerland, by being relegated, was excluded, and the final nation had to qualify in a tournament the next fall. The top two teams from Group B, the Group C champion, the top Asian nation, and Slovakia all were given the opportunity to fill the final vacancy.\nWorld Championship Group A (Germany).\nConsolation round 11–12 place.\n\"Switzerland was relegated to the Group B.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Netherlands).\nPlayed in Eindhoven 25 March to 4 April. The British team, just promoted from Group C, won all their games. Their first game was won by either keen strategy, or controversy, depending on how you view it. With the score against tournament favorite Poland tied three all, the British coach, Alex Dampier, asked the referee to measure the opposing goalie's stick. It was found to be illegal, and Great Britain scored the winning goal on the ensuing powerplay.\n\"Great Britain was promoted to the Group A while Bulgaria was relegated to the Group C.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Slovenia).\nQualifying round.\nAll qualifiers were played from 6 to 8 November 1992.\nGroup 1 (Latvia).\nPlayed in Riga.

The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1993 competition.\nThe top Championship Group A tournament took place in Czechoslovakia from 28 April to 10 May 1992, with games played in Prague and Bratislava. This would be the last championship held in that nation before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia eight months later. Twelve teams took part, with the first round being split into two groups of six, with the four best teams from each group advancing to the quarter-finals. Sweden retained their title, beating Finland 5–2 in the final, and becoming world champions for the sixth time. This was Finland's first medal in a World Championship.\nThe Championship Group A pools were drawn the same as the 1992 Olympics in Albertville two months earlier, but yielded much different results. Switzerland was able to tie both Russia and Canada to earn a spot in the quarter-finals. Germany, after an opening loss to Finland, won four straight to also advance to the quarter-finals, where they faced Switzerland. The Swiss prevailed, making the top 4 for the first time since 1953, and moved on to meet a Swedish team that had shut-out the Russians. The Swedes led by three after the first and easily moved on to the gold medal game. There was nothing easy about the other semi-final, where the Finns had to come from behind to tie Czechoslovakia in the third period, then advanced to the finals with a shootout win. The Czechoslovaks, playing for the last time as that nation, beat the Swiss to settle for bronze, while Sweden, led by Mats Sundin, beat Finland for gold.\nNew entrants Greece, Israel, Luxembourg and Turkey iced teams in a secondary tier of Group C. South Africa appeared for the first time since 1966. In Group B, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia made their final World Championship appearance before the breakup of that nation.

Teams representing 25 countries participated in several levels of competition. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1992 competition.\nThe top Championship Group A tournament took place in Finland from 19 April to 4 May 1991, with games played in Turku, Helsinki and Tampere. Eight teams took part, with each team playing each other once. The four best teams then played each other once more. Sweden became world champions for the fifth time, and the Soviet Union won their 27th European title. In the European Championships, only matches between European teams in the first round were counted towards scoring.\nThere were three significant 'lasts' in this year's championships. This would be the last year that a separate European title would be awarded, which the Soviets captured in their last appearance before the dissolution of the Soviet Union seven months later. Their position in Group A would be inherited by Russia, while newly independent former Soviet member states Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine began play in 1993 in qualification tournaments for Group C. The tournament itself would change significantly after this year as well. This was the last time the top level was contested by eight teams; beginning in 1992 it would expand to twelve, requiring both Groups B and C to promote four nations each.\nThe final round of four teams was a very tight battle, except for the United States. Getting only a tie against the last place Germans, the Americans only advanced to the final round by narrowly defeating the host Finns. The USA were easily defeated by the three other teams in the final round, but were involved in a controversial finish. The Canadians, having tied both the Swedes and the Soviets, needed to win their game against the US by five goals, then hope that the Swedes and Soviets tied, ensuring Canada the gold. Winning 7–4 in the final minute, and despite playing short-handed, they scored the two goals they needed. American coach Tim Taylor, trailing 9–4, pulled his goalie in the final minute, later claiming that he was trying to score the necessary number of goals to win the bronze medal. It was the last of many questionable finishes over the years that hastened the IIHF to change the format of the tournament.\nThe Soviets and Swedes took a 1–1 tie into the third period of the last game, which would have given the gold medal to Canada had it held up. However, Mats Sundin scored at 9:37, and the Swedes held on to capture gold.\nWorld Championship Group A (Finland).\nConsolation round.\n\"No team was relegated because of the expansion to twelve teams.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Yugoslavia).\nPlayed in Ljubljana, Bled and Jesenice 28 March to 7 April.

The team was led by second-year head coach Gary Waters. In 2006–07, the Vikings finished 10–21 (3–13 in the Horizon League). Cleveland State had their first winning season since the 2000–2001 season when they finished 19–13 overall and 9–5 in conference play. It was the 77th season of Cleveland State basketball.\nPreseason.\nThe preseason Horizon League Coaches' Poll picked the Vikings to finish ninth. The Vikings bring in ten newcomers to this year's roster. J'Nathan Bullock was named to the preseason all-Horizon League 2nd team. Also for the first time since the 1986–1987 season the Vikings are guaranteed to play at least 32 games. At least 17 of those games will be on the road.\nRegular season.\nOn January 5, 2008, Cleveland State matched their win totals from last season (10–21 overall, 3–13 HL), and remain in first place in the Horizon League through 15 games for the first time since the 1999–2000 season. They are the last undefeated team in Horizon League play at 4–0. On January 12, 2008, Cleveland State won its 5th game in conference play. That is its best start in conference play since the 1992–93 season when they won their first 14 conference games. The Vikings were 1–26 in games against ranked opponents, with their only win coming on March 14, 1986, against No. 16 Indiana in the NCAA tournament under coach Kevin Mackey until their 56–52 win over No. 12 Butler on January 17, 2008. The 5,352 fans that attended the game marked the largest crowd in the Wolstein Center since the curtain was added four years ago on the west side to trim the capacity of the building to approximately 8,500. The last time CSU had a larger crowd in the Wolstein Center came on November 29, 2003, when 11,534 saw the Vikings drop an 82–76 decision to No. 9 North Carolina (No. 10 ESPN/USA Today; No. 9 AP). On January 21, 2008, Cleveland State received their first point in the AP Top 25 poll for the season, that had them T-43. The lone point came from Keith Sargeant of the Home News Tribune. On March 1, 2008, Cleveland State clinched the 2nd seed in the Horizon League tournament with a win over Youngstown State and a Wright State loss. With the 2nd seed they only need to win two games to make the NCAA Tournament. They will host the championship game with a win and a Butler loss in the tournament. Also with the win Cleveland State reached the 20-win mark for only the six time in Cleveland State history. On March 8, 2008, Cleveland State reached their first Horizon League championship game ever, and their first conference championship game appearance since 1987."

Prior to rebranding from Fenn College, they were known as the Fenn College Foxes. Cleveland State has been in Division I since 1972. They are a member of the Horizon League (1994–present) Cleveland State was formerly in the Mid-Continent Conference (1982–1994). Prior to 1982, Cleveland State was an independent program. The Vikings have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments, most recently in 2021. In 1986, Cleveland State advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16.\nHistory.\nThe 1985–86 season is arguably the most memorable in Vikings history, as they achieved the improbable in becoming the first ever 14th seeded team to make it to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Coach Kevin Mackey's squad, led by Ken 'Mouse' McFadden and Eric Mudd, upset Bobby Knight's 3rd seeded Indiana Hoosiers, by a final of 83-79. Following a 75-69 second round win against 6th seeded St.Joseph's, the Vikings would ultimately lose to Navy 71-70 on a clutch basket in the waning seconds by future Hall of Famer, David Robinson.

In the main career mode, there are three different types of gameplay available: Ride Challenge, Rival Race, and Video Shoot.\nMost of the game takes place in Ride Challenge, where the player is given objectives to complete before reaching the bottom of the slope, ranging from gaining a certain number of points through tricks to executing a certain trick. Rival race is racing another player down the slope. Video shoot tasks the player with earning a certain point value on only one huge jump.\nReception.\nMassive Snowboarding was praised by most critics. GameSpot gave Massive Snowboarding an Editors' Choice award, stating, \"Gameloft has struck a balance between the speedy and the spectacular, and the result is an excellent and highly addictive sports title.\" The reviewer from 1UP.com wrote, \"It's the most attractive, engaging mobile game I've ever played.\" IGN gave the game an \"outstanding\" grade, writing \"If I was Verizon, I'd make sure Massive Snowboarding was playing on all of my V CAST phones at retail locations -- it's the kind of game that could move a phone.\""

England comfortably won a third successive Grand Slam—the first time this had been achieved in the Women's Six Nations. However, after a good start against Wales it was not quite as easily won as in the previous year, with Italy, Scotland and Ireland all scoring tries against the champions, something that only France managed in 2007.\nWhile the England win was predictable it was Ireland that surprised many. Historically one of the weakest nations in the tournament, they only went down to narrow defeats to England, France, and Wales, while recording wins over both Italy and Scotland. The result was probably their best ever tournament performance.\nThe decline of Scottish women's rugby, on the other hand, continued. Though their performance against England showed hope for improvement, two successive defeats in two years to Ireland meant that Scotland ranked for the first time below the Irish, while defeat to Italy—the Italians' first ever Six Nations win—was the final blow in a disastrous campaign.\nFrance—on paper the second best side in the event—were distinctly unimpressive, going down to their largest home defeat to England before losing to Wales for the second time in three years, the result being only third place. Wales, on the other hand, recovered from an English drubbing in the first game to finish in a well-deserved runners-up position.\nFinally, the Italians surprised everyone with their Scottish win, following a campaign that had not appeared competitive in its first four games."

        "text": "Tom Ford (born 17 August 1983) is an English professional snooker player from Leicester. Ford has reached three ranking finals - the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic the 2023 German Masters and the 2023 International Championship - plus seven further ranking semi-finals.\nFord has compiled five maximum breaks in competitive play, and over 250 breaks.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nAs a junior, Ford played against Mark Selby frequently. He began his professional career by playing the Challenge Tour in 2001, at the time the second-level professional tour. His first quarter-final came at the 2005 Malta Cup where he beat Ken Doherty, but eventually lost to Stephen Hendry.\nIn the 2007 Grand Prix, he made a 147 against Steve Davis, after having just come out of hospital suffering from gastroenteritis, but still missed out on the last 16, eventually finishing 3rd in his group. He secured the high break and maximum prize, but this event was not televised. In the last 32 of the 2007 Northern Ireland Trophy he held Ronnie O'Sullivan to 4–4, before missing the final blue, allowing O'Sullivan to clinch the frame. Ford made his World Championship debut in 2010, after beating Judd Trump 10–3 in the final qualifying round. He played Mark Allen in the first round, where he lost 4–10.\n2010/2011.\nEarly in the season Ford won his first professional title, Event 3 of the Players Tour Championship, beating Jack Lisowski 4–0 in the final while working with sports mentor Matt Andrews. Ford failed to qualify for the main draws of both the Shanghai Masters and the World Open, but did beat Tony Drago and Gerard Greene to reach the Last 32 of the UK Championship. He was drawn against Mark Allen and lost 5–9. Ford did not qualify for the final stages of any other ranking event for the season after losing 8–10 to Liu Chuang in Round 4 of qualifying for the World Championship.\n2011/2012.\nThe first world ranking event of the season was the inaugural Australian Goldfields Open, where Ford reached the final stages by beating Gerard Greene. He then beat world number 15 Jamie Cope 5–3 before being whitewashed 0–5 by eventual winner Stuart Bingham in the last 16. He made it through to his third successive UK Championship main draw where he played former world champion Neil Robertson, but was comfortably beaten 1–6. Ford won his second PTC title at Event 11 in December by defeating Martin Gould 4–3. He finished twelfth in the Order of Merit to qualify for the 2012 Finals, where he lost to Mark Davis 1–4 in the last 24.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He then qualified for the wildcard round of the German Masters with a 5–0 whitewash of Anthony Hamilton and beat Irishman Philip Arnold 5–1 to reach the last 32, where he met Mark Allen. Ford held a 3–0 lead, but went on to lose the match 4–5. He qualified for the Welsh Open and beat Graeme Dott 4–2 in the opening round, before losing to Stephen Lee 1–4. Ford also reached the second round of the World Open, thanks to the withdrawal of Ronnie O'Sullivan, but exited the tournament in a final frame decider versus Mark King. He then lost to Lee again, this time in the first round of the China Open, before failing to qualify for the World Championship after being edged out 9–10 by Cao Yupeng. Ford finished the season ranked world number 26, meaning he had risen eight places during the year.\n2012/2013.\nFord qualified for six ranking events during the 2012–13 season. Out of those he lost in the first round in three and in the second round of both the Australian Goldfields Open and Welsh Open to Shaun Murphy 1–5 and Ken Doherty 3–4 respectively.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He couldn't qualify for the Players Tour Championship Finals through the Order of Merit as he finished 46th, but he did play in all three of the new Asian PTC's. His best result came in the Third Event, where he lost 3–4 in the semi-finals to Stuart Bingham. Ford finished sixth on the Asian Order of Merit, inside the top eight who qualified for the Finals. It was at the Finals that Ford had his best run in a ranking event of his career. He saw off Martin Gould 4–2, Jack Lisowski 4–3 and Marco Fu 4–1 to advance to the semi-finals. His nerves showed early on against Neil Robertson as he fell 0–3 down, but composed himself to level at 3–3. Ford had three chances to win the deciding frame, but left Robertson a chance when escaping a snooker to lose 3–4. Ford ended the season ranked world number 24.\n2013/2014.\nAt the 2013 Australian Goldfields Open Ford reached the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the third time in his career by beating Ryan Day and Barry Hawkins, before losing 3–5 to Robert Milkins.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won through to the second round of both the Indian Open and Welsh Open but was eliminated by Stephen Maguire and James Wattana respectively. Ford defeated James Cahill 10–6, Luca Brecel 10–1 and Matthew Stevens 10–8 to qualify for the World Championship for the second time. He rallied from 6–2 down in the first round against Judd Trump to level at 8–8, before losing two successive frames to exit the tournament.\n2014/2015.\nFord qualified for the Australian Goldfields Open for the fourth year in a row and lost 3–5 to John Higgins in the first round.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He had five defeats in a row after this until beating Barry Pinches 6–4 in the opening round of the UK Championship, his first win in the event after six prior losses. Ford was beaten 3–6 by Joel Walker in the second round. He had a resurgence of form at the Asian Tour event, the Xuzhou Open by knocking out five players to reach the semi-finals, where he lost the last two frames in a 3–4 defeat to Joe Perry. Ford entered the qualifying rounds of the World Championship needing wins to ensure his survival on the tour as he was close to ending the season outside the top 64 in the world rankings. He did so by seeing off Andrew Norman 10–2 and David Gilbert 10–8 to meet Matthew Selt in the final round, where he lost 8–10. Ford ended up 59th in the world rankings, a drop of 27 places during the year.\n2015/2016.\nFord began the 2015–16 season by reaching the third final carrying ranking points of his career after overcoming the likes of Joe Perry, Matthew Selt and Ben Woollaston at the Riga Open. Ford won the first frame against Barry Hawkins, but could not capture another to be beaten 1–4. At the UK Championship, he defeated Scott Donaldson 6–1 and then beat Mark Williams for the first time by recovering from 3–5 down to win 6–5. He followed that up by easing past Kyren Wilson 6–1, but accused his opponent Liang Wenbo of boring him off the table in the fourth round after it was Ford who lost 5–6 having been 5–3 up. Ford failed to build upon this during the rest of the season as he could not get beyond the second round of any ranking event. However, he was able to build on his world ranking to finish as the world number 43, an increase of 16 spots during the year.\n2016/2017.\nA 4–1 victory over Jamie Jones at the Paul Hunter Classic saw Ford reach the second ranking event semi-final of his career and he beat Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 4–2, closing the match with a 136 break.&lt;ref name=\"2016/17\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Ford's first ranking event final he was 2–2 with Mark Selby, before his fellow Leicester player knocked in two 50 plus breaks to defeat Ford 4–2. At the English Open he beat Rory McLeod, Marco Fu and Joe Swail all by 4–2 scorelines, before losing 1–4 to John Higgins. Ford qualified for the German Masters by ousting Judd Trump 5–1 and then made a 147 in a first round 5–2 win over Peter Ebdon. He saw off Mark King 5–2, but then lost 2–5 to Ali Carter in the quarter-finals. Ford qualified for his third World Championship courtesy of victories over Jamie Bodle, Chris Wakelin and Hossein Vafaei. From holding a narrow 2–1 advantage over Barry Hawkins in the first round, Ford was eliminated 3–10."

        "text": "The Greek national ice hockey team () is the national ice hockey team of Greece and as an associate member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) that competed in Division III of the IIHF World Championships. \nThe Greece National Ice hockey team has competed in 10 IIHF World Championship Division III (1992, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) 4 World Championship Qualifications (1993, 1996, 2008 and 2012) and 1 Olympic Qualification (1996) \nThe Greece National ice hockey Team's greatest result is the Silver Medal at the 2010 IIHF World Championship Division III that was held in Luxembourg, followed by the bronze medal at the 1992 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships Pool C held in South Africa.\nAt present time, Greece is unable to compete in IIHF tournaments because it cannot fulfill the minimum standard of having one operational \"Olympic size\" indoor rink in the country. The National Team last competed in the 2013 IIHF World Championship Division III that were held in South Africa and will only compete again officially when a regular ice rink opens and the Greek Ice Hockey Championship starts up again.\nHistory.\nIce hockey started in Greece in 1984 by players that returned to Greece from abroad. The first official Greek Championship was held in 1989 at the Peace and Friendship Stadium with five teams taking place. It was the first time that ice hockey games were held in an official-size rink in the country. In 1990, the first junior national team was formed and took part in the World Junior Championship Pool C, held in Yugoslavia. In 1991, the junior national team took part in the World Junior Championship, held in Italy. In 1992, the first ever men's national team was formed and took place in the World Championships Pool C2 held in South Africa. With only two weeks of serious training abroad and the support of the Greeks of South Africa, the men's national team finished ahead of three other new hockey nations, winning the Bronze medal, placing them 29th overall.\nDespite the great achievement, the start of the decline of the sport came in 1993. Economic help was discontinued by the Greek Undersecretary of State for Sports and all expenses to keep ice hockey alive were passed over to the players. Practices stopped and many players quit.\nSince May 2003, the last ice rink in Greece closed and the national team was left without an ice rink. In the next 4 years, players of the national team traveled at their own expense in the Czech Republic in order to train themselves. \nIce hockey was slowly dying until Dimitris Kalyvas (last captain of the Greece National Team) decided to start efforts to bring the National Team back to International competition. He focused his efforts with the Greek Government and specifically the Ministry of Sports in Greece, but also with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). After many months of efforts he convinced the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) that the National Team is still active and that development of the sport is continuing in the country despite not having an ice rink. He later received the support of the Hellenic Ice Sports Federation. After many emails, the IIHF decided to send 2 delegates to Athens to investigate. After a review by the IIHF in 2007 Greece retained its status within the IIHF and took part in a qualification tournament against Armenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo prior to the 2008 Division III championship in Luxembourg. They defeated both teams, beating Bosnia-Herzegovina 10 – 1 in their first International game after almost 10 years and Armenia 8 – 5 (although Armenia was forced to forfeit each game 5 – 0 for using non-eligible players). After the qualification that gave new life to Ice Hockey in Greece, they went on to take part in 6 consecutive World Championships Div.III. From 2008 until 2013, highlighted by a second-place finish (Silver Medal) in their group (third overall) in 2010.\nMany articles were written at the time of Dimitris' efforts to bring the National team back to International competition. The 2007 article written by Bill Meltzer and posted on the IIHF.com website titled: \"Greek hockey - against all odds: Efforts by leaders like Kalyvas bring the Greek national team back to IIHF competitions\" is a perfect example.\nDimitris went on to be the longest running Captain of the National team and one of the longest running Captains in international ice hockey history wearing the \"C\" on his jersey for 15 years. He is also the top scorer of Greek Ice Hockey history having scored 26 goals and 55 points helping the National team on and off the ice.\nUnfortunately, despite the efforts of the National team and Dimitris continuous efforts off the ice, the IIHF determined in 2013 that the team will not be able to participate in any World Championship programs until an Olympic sized ice rink is constructed in the country.\nIn December 2023, it was announced that Greece would ice a team at the 2024 IIHF Development Cup, a tournament for nations that can't participate in the IIHF World Championship, due to the lack of an Olympic sized ice rink. Greece will play against Liechtenstein, Ireland, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil &amp; Portugal.\nFuture Greece National Team.\nIn order for Greece to create a National team again that will participate in IIHF World Championships, the following need to occur:\n1) an Olympic-size rink needs to open in the country\n2) a Greek League of at least 4 Teams needs to get organized. \nIf players with Greek heritage who are living abroad want to play for the Greece National Team, then they need to follow the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) rules below.\nAccording to the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which is the governing body of Ice Hockey Worldwide:\nWhen a player has multiple citizenship (for example Greek-Canadian or Greek-American, etc.) and he/she has never represented any country in any IIHF championship or an Olympic competition or in qualifications to these competitions, then in order to play for the country of his/her choice he/she must:\na) Hold a passport of the country they chose to represent. In this case a Greek Passport.\nb) prove that he has participated at least two consecutive hockey seasons and 16 consecutive months (480 days) in the national competitions of his new country after his 10th birthday (In our case the Greek Ice Hockey League where games are played in Greece). Female players need to have participated on a consistent basis for at least one hockey season and have been member of the new national association for at least 8 consecutive months (240 days) during that period.\nc) Is a resident in the country that he/she wishes to represent (lives in Greece) during which period he/she has neither transferred to another country nor played ice hockey within any other country.\nAfter following the above a player would be eligible to play for the Official National Team of Greece. \nAll-times top Scorers of the National Team.\nMen's Hellenic National Team (including 2013 World Championship Div.III)\n2010 World Championship.\nThe Greece national ice hockey team competed in the 2010 IIHF World Championship Division III which was held in Luxembourg from April 14- April 17.

It came into existence on the adoption of its constitution on February 16, 2009, taking over the functions of the former European Amateur Boxing Association (EABA).\nThe president of the EUBC is Franco Falcinelli (former president of Italian Boxing Federation-). There are two vice-presidents and 16 executive committee members, all of whom are male, although the Confederation controls amateur boxing of both sexes.\nOn 29 October 2007, the executive committee of EABA removed former president Eduard Khusainov (Russia), a sworn enemy of AIBA president Wu Ching-kuo, from its association in an extraordinary EC meeting held in Chicago. The vote was 14 for and one against the removal of Khusainov after the Russia Boxing Federation notified the EABA and AIBA early in October of its decision to withdraw its support for him.\nOn March 4, 2022, in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IBA banned athletes from Russia and Belarus from competing in international competitions."

        "title": "Flanker (rugby union)",
        "text": "Flanker is a position in the sport of rugby union. Each team of 15 players includes two flankers, who play in the forwards, and are generally classified as either blindside or openside flankers, numbers 6 and 7 respectively. The name comes from their position in a scrum in which they 'flank' each set of forwards. They compete for the ball – most commonly in rucks and mauls. Flankers also assist in pushing in a scrum, but are expected to detach from the scrum as soon as the ball is out to get to the play before the opposition's forwards. Flankers also participate in line-outs, either being lifted to contest or win possession, or to lift other players. Flankers are usually the key participants in the tackling process. The flankers, especially the openside, are often the fastest forwards on the team but still relied upon for tackling.\nNaming.\nFlankers can be known by several different names. Historically, they were often called wing-forwards, although this name had a more specific meaning in New Zealand when they used a now-archaic scrum formation. This term is rarely used any more, but the terms \"breakaway\", \"flank\", and \"flank forward\" are sometimes used. Collectively, the flankers and the number eight can also be known as the back-row forwards – referring to their scrum positions – or as loose forwards because they are loosely bound to the scrum.\nRole.\nFlankers are the position where the player should have all-round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the players most commonly involved in winning the ball in open play, especially the openside flanker. Blindside flankers tend to be bigger, but not as fast as their partners on the openside.\nIn open play, flankers will often stand behind the backs, supporting them. If any ball is dropped by the backs, the flankers' job is to clear up messy ball and start a new phase of play. Because they are always close to the ball, they are often first to the breakdown.\nFlankers do less pushing in the scrum than the tight five, but need to be fast as their task is to break quickly and cover the opposing half-backs if the opponents win the scrum. At one time, flankers were allowed to break away from the scrum with the ball but this is no longer allowed and they must remain bound to the scrum until the ball is out. Flankers also have to defend at the back of the scrum if the opposition wins the ball and the opposing number 8 decides to pick and go (i.e. pick up the ball from the back of the scrum and drive forward with it).\nNew Zealand openside flanker Richie McCaw, who was nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year a record eight times from 2002 to 2012, described three key roles for the flanker:\nOpenside and blindside.\nThe two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position. Instead, the openside (occasionally known as the strong side, traditionally wearing number 7) flanker attaches to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the blind-side (occasionally known as weak side or closed side, traditionally number 6) flanker attaches themselves to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline.\nSince most of the back play is usually on the open side, where there is more space, it is usually the openside flanker's job to be the first to any breakdown of play and to get their hands on any loose ball (or to cause a breakdown by tackling the ball carrier or otherwise hurrying him into error). At a scrum where the ball has been won by the opposition, the openside flanker often has the best view of when the ball is out and is able to break away and close down the opposing ball-carrier, reducing the time available for a pass or kick. Openside flankers are often smaller and quicker than their blindside counterparts.\nThe blindside flanker has the job of stopping any move by the opponents on the blind (or 'narrow') side from a scrum. Blindside flankers are often responsible for cover defence from set pieces and may play a more physical role at the line-out, where they may well be used as a jumper. They can also be used for breaking their opposition line in open play using their speed and strength to break tackles.\nMost countries prefer a quicker openside flanker with the ability to get off the scrum quickly so that he can scavenge for the ball. In South Africa, however, it is preferred for the blindside flanker to be quicker as it is often their duty to carry the ball, meaning they prefer the person running with the ball being quicker rather than the person trying steal it.\nFlankers are not always assigned specific roles as opensides and blindsides. For example, Scotland flankers Finlay Calder and John Jeffrey played left and right, rather than open and blind. French teams tend not to make a distinction between the two roles, and their flankers also usually play left and right rather than open and blind: thus, Serge Betsen often wore the number 6 but would pack down on either the open or blind sides of the scrum, and will often harass the opposition fly-half in the manner of an openside; like Calder and Jeffrey for Scotland, Betsen and Olivier Magne formed an outstanding left-right partnership for France."

There were a total number of 45 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on 1 September 1991.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nFinal.\nAt first, Italy's Stefano Mei led this final, but after 300 metres, Bob Kennedy of the United States passed him. Despite Kennedy's slight surge, the first 400-metre split was sluggish at 1:07.02. Kenya's Yobes Ondieki passed Kennedy on the second home straight, and accelerated the pace radically. Quickly Morocco's Khalid Skah and Brahim Boutayeb, Ethiopia's Fita Bayisa, Germany's Dieter Baumann, and Portugal's Domingos Castro positioned themselves behind the surging Kenyan runner. To demonstrate the categorical reverse of the early pedestrian pace, Ondieki clocked 2:06.90 at 800 metres. In other words, the final's second lap had been sprinted in 59.88 seconds! Ondieki kept his speed throttle up through 1,000 metres in 2:36.83. His surge caused the United States' Doug Padilla to lose contact with the other runners already before 1,200 metres. Two laps later, Ondieki was about three seconds ahead of Boutayeb and Bayisa, with an unofficial split of 5:09.48 at 2,000 metres. Baumann and Domingos Castro formed the second chasing pair, after Skah had dropped from their pace. Further behind, Dionisio Castro of Portugal (Domingos's twin brother) and Britain's Gary Staines were fighting for seventh place. Despite slowing down slightly in the third kilometre, Ondieki widened his lead as he speeded past 3,000 metres in 7:46.08. During the fourth kilometre, the Kenyan's brutal early pace started to take its toll on his legs, but neither Bayisa nor Boutayeb was able to appreciably close in on him. By contrast, Finland's Risto Ulmala broke away from the rear group, and caught Skah and Dionisio Castro. Slightly behind this trio ran Britain's Rob Denmark, who also passed his badly exhausted team mate Staines. Before 3,800 metres, Bayisa speeded away from Boutayeb. At 4,000 metres, the gradually tiring Ondieki led in 10:29.07. After 4,250 metres, the Kenyan lapped Padilla. Ondieki's unofficial time at 4,600 metres was 12:09.07. At the start of the last lap, Bayisa was still over six seconds behind the Kenyan. By 4,800 metres (Ondieki's split was 12:41.90), the Ethiopian had only been able to narrow the gap to about five seconds. Although he sprinted the home straight visibly faster than the fading Ondieki, Bayisa still lost to the Kenyan World Champion by over two seconds. Boutayeb held on to the bronze medal, while Baumann sprinted narrowly past Domingos Castro, and Skah pulled away from Ulmala and Dionisio Castro.

        "text": "The UAAP Season 70 men's basketball tournament is the flagship tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball championships.\nThe University of Santo Tomas (UST) is the season's host. The games began on July 7 at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City with the resurgent De La Salle Green Archers defeating the UP Fighting Maroons in the first game. La Salle, which was suspended on the previous tournament, went on to win the championship, sweeping the UE Red Warriors 2–0 in the Finals series. UE on the other hand, had the distinction of sweeping the double round eliminations 14–0, capped by a win against La Salle in overtime on their last elimination round game. JVee Casio and Pocholo Villanueva were awarded co-finals most valuable player honors, for leading La Salle to their seventh men's UAAP championship.\nJervy Cruz of UST, with his double-double statistics, is the most valuable player. JR Cawaling of the FEU Tamaraws is the rookie of the year.\nPreseason events.\nNew coaches are Bogs Adornado for the Adamson Falcons (replacing Leo Austria who resigned to coach the Welcoat Dragons professional basketball team) and Glenn Capacio replacing Bert Flores as he became an FEU Tamaraws manager. De La Salle Green Archers coach Franz Pumaren, who had previously resigned after the PEPTCR scandal, was rehired by La Salle.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nPostseason teams.\nUE Red Warriors.\nAfter their heartbreaking semi-final loss against the UST Growling Tigers on 2006, the Warriors won several off-season tournaments, such as the Collegiate Champions League, where they beat the NCAA champions San Beda Red Lions.\nOn their first UAAP game, they beat the Tigers by a comfortable margin. UE then had to ward off NU in the endgame and survive Ateneo to remain unbeaten. In a game of unbeaten teams, the Warriors buried the Green Archers, as they broke the game wide open at the fourth quarter. UE then swept the first round with relatively easy wins against UP (31 points), FEU (29 points) and Adamson (25 points).\nOn their second round opener, the Warriors had to ward off the persistent Blue Eagles in the endgame to preserve their winning streak. UE then defeated UST, which had kept themselves in striking distance until the Red Warriors rallied in the fourth quarter. UE's closest win came against the Bulldogs which collapsed in the end game to lose by four points. UE then paraded with three more wins against Adamson, FEU and UP. UE has swept the eliminations by beating La Salle via overtime and advanced automatically to the Finals.\nDe La Salle Green Archers.\nReturning from suspension, La Salle had an easy opening day win against the UP Fighting Maroons. After another relatively easy win against Adamson, La Salle had a scare when FEU managed to hang on but were ultimately defeated. On their next game against UE, La Salle managed to fight tooth and nail but where overwhelmed by UE's accurate shooting in the second half as they were dealt with their first loss. La Salle was then defeated by Ateneo who rallied in overtime. La Salle then put the game in protest but was junked by the Technical Committee. On their next game, the Archers kept their 7-year winning streak against UST alive via another overtime game.\nAfter finishing the first round with a win against the Bulldogs, the Archers had the win on their grasp but the Tigers had a 13–0 run in the last two minutes to force overtime. The Tigers prevailed in overtime to stop their seven-year losing streak against La Salle. The Green Archers then had a four-game winning streak to assure themselves of a place in the Final Four. However, with a twice to beat advantage a win away, archrivals Ateneo snapped La Salle's winning streak via a defensive stand to deny La Salle the shot within regulation.\nSeeking to prevent a sweep, La Salle managed to keep away UE in their last elimination round game but UE mounted a furious comeback to force the game into overtime - La Salle actually had the opportunity to win the game but Rico Maierhoffer tapped the ball last when he stood unmolested under the basket. Clutch freethrows from Mark Borboran and disqualifications of La Salle's Maierhoffer and JV Casio due to fouling out kept La Salle from coming back and resulted to the first sweep of the men's tournament since 1993, when UST did it.\nThe game was marred when La Salle player Bryan Ilad punched Mark Fampulme at the back of the head after a hard foul of La Salle's Rico Maierhofer to Mark Borboran of UE during the first quarter. Ilad was ejected at the game and would be suspended for five games (details below). It was recommended by the UAAP board that Ilad would make a public apology to Fampulme, to UE and the UAAP Community.\nAteneo Blue Eagles.\nAteneo opened the season with an overtime win against Adamson, then a blowout win against neighbors UP. In the battle of undefeated teams, UE held on to win by three points to deal the Eagles with their first loss. After a last-possession win against NU, Ateneo had a controversial win against archrival La Salle, in which La Salle protested when two Atenean foreigners played at the same time. The UAAP Technical Committee junked La Salle's protest, since American Kirk Long didn't actually enter the playing court, hence did not affect the outcome of the game. However, Ateneo lost their next three games, against FEU including a game against last year's Finals opponent UST and UE in the start of the second-round.\nAteneo then rebounded with a five-game winning streak, including triumphs against FEU, Adamson, UST, where Kirk Long converted a walk-off buzzer beater, UP and archrivals La Salle where Chris Tiu converted a three-point shot in the dying seconds, and La Salle failed to convert a put-back within time limits.\nUST Growling Tigers.\nThe defending champions started the season with a 0–2 record, losing to UE and FEU. UST rebounded with wins against Adamson, UP and NU. Transferee Khasim Mirza made up for last year's Finals MVP Jojo Duncil's departure, with accurate three-point shooting. On a seven-year losing streak, La Salle had to win via overtime to break UST's streak. A win over last year's Finals opponent Ateneo assured the Tigers of an above-.500 record at the end of the first round.\nOn their rematch with the Green Archers, the Tigers forced overtime after coming up with a 13–0 run at the final two minutes of regulation. With a near-flawless game, Jervy Cruz led the team into victory, the first since 1999. With momentum on their side, the Tigers were humbled by a streaking UE Red Warriors, who staged their own rally at the fourth quarter to hold off any UST run. After a win against NU, the Tigers were beaten by Ateneo, thanks to Kirk Long's buzzer beater. Needing to win their last three games to assure of a Final Four berth, the Tigers made short work of doormats UP and Adamson, but were upended by FEU to force a deciding knockout game between the two to determine which team will advance to the playoffs.\nFourth seed playoff.\nWinning both of their elimination round games (81–66 at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium and 84–73 at the Araneta Coliseum), the Tamaraws forced the knockout game by winning their second round game. FEU started rather well, leading by 2 points at the end of the first period. UST on the other hand, pulled away, with inside plays of Jervy Cruz and defense against the Tamaraws.\nLeading by as much as 20 points, FEU managed to bring down to lead to 16 at the third quarter but the Tigers answered back, bringing it back to 20. On the fourth quarter, the Tams, thanks to three-point shooting by Paul Sanga, cut the lead into ten; they'd run out of time however as the Tigers advanced to the playoffs to assure of defending their title for a little longer.\nStepladder semifinals.\nSecond round.\nWith La Salle having the twice to beat advantage, Ateneo kept pace with La Salle, eventually ending the first quarter tied. However, Ateneo had a rally and led by as much as 4, La Salle care of JVee Casio scored five consecutive points in the final minute to nudge by a point. On the third quarter, La Salle had an 8–0 run to lead by as much as nine by forcing Ateneo several turnovers (Ateneo wound up with 24 turnovers at the end of the game). Ateneo eventually cut the deficit into five points at the end of the third.\nAteneo continued on their momentum, tying the score thanks to a Nonoy Baclao tip-in. However, La Salle countered with their own 5–0 run with 5 minutes to go; Ateneo caught up with another Baclao tip-in and a three-point field goal by Chris Tiu to cut the deficit into one point. With half a minute remaining, La Salle turned over the ball, Tiu drove hard to the basket and made the shot, giving the lead to Ateneo. With seven seconds left, Casio drove to the basket and kicked out the ball to Bader Malabes; Malabes missed the jump shot, then Rico Maierhofer missed the tip-in as time expired.\nLa Salle beat the Eagles in the sold out Araneta Coliseum for their fifth and last encounter for the year to advance to the Finals.\nFinals.\nLast championship matchup: 1990 season (UAAP Season 53)—La Salle 78–74 UE (La Salle had the twice-to-beat advantage)\nUE started out firing on all cylinders, leading as much as seven in the first few minutes of the ball game; however, De La Salle was able to recover and tie the game at 8 apiece, the only deadlock in the game. La Salle eventually took the lead and never looked back for the rest of the game en route to their seventh UAAP men's basketball championship (excluding the 2004 title).\nUE, rusty from a three-week layoff, started strong, having an 11–0 run to close the first quarter leading, 21–14. La Salle battled back to trail by two points at halftime. La Salle maintained the status quo at the third quarter.\nThe Archers tied the ballgame 58-all with four minutes left; La Salle then overtook the Warriors 63-60 at the last minute. UE's Mark Borboran scored a three-point field goal to tie once again the score, 63-all, with 34 seconds remaining. At ensuing La Salle offensive, Rico Maierhofer was fouled as he went up for an offensive rebound. Maierhofer converted one of his two free throws to put La Salle up by one, with 14.1 seconds left. Borboran then shot a three-pointer at the top of the key after a UE time-out but it bounced off the rim. Bader Malabes of La Salle rebounded the ball as time expired.\nAwards.\nThe awards were given before Game 2 at the Araneta Coliseum, except for the Finals MVP award which was given after Game 2."

The U.S. Open returned to Southern Hills for the first time since 1977. Retief Goosen won the first of his two U.S. Open titles in an 18-hole Monday playoff, two strokes ahead of runner-up Mark Brooks. The tournament was also notable for ending defending champion Tiger Woods' run of four consecutive major championship wins, the \"Tiger Slam;\" he finished seven strokes back in a tie for twelfth.

South Africa's Goosen completed an opening round of 66, four-under-par, to lead the way. Goosen resumed his unfinished round at three-under-par and raced to six-under, but bogeys at the 16th and 17th took the edge off his round. However, it was enough to earn him a one-stroke lead over three-time champion Hale Irwin and Canadian Mike Weir with tour journeyman J. L. Lewis one stroke further back. Irwin, age 56, won his last U.S. Open title in 1990; he capped his opening 67 (−3) with a birdie at the treacherous par-four 18th. Woods could only manage a first round of 74 (+4), eight shots off the lead. He bogeyed the ninth, before recording his first birdie of the round at the 15th. But even that could not spark a revival in his fortunes as he bogeyed the last.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 15, 2001\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, June 16, 2001\"\nThe delay created by Thursday's thunderstorms meant 33 players could not finish the second round on Friday, and had to play Saturday morning. The cut line was 146 (+6) with 79 players making the cut. Brooks fired a 64 (−6) Friday to grab a share of the lead. Goosen, who led after the first round was completed Friday morning, and Lewis joined Brooks at 136 (−4). Sergio García and Stewart Cink were tied for fourth at two-under par. Phil Mickelson and David Duval, players who briefly flirted with the lead during Woods' run at the Masters in April, were knotted at 139 (−1) after each posted 69 on Friday. Woods shot a 71 for 145 (+5), one stroke ahead of the cut.\nAmateurs: \"Molder (+6)\", Harris (+13), Quinney (+15).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 16, 2001\"\nCink finished with a three-under 67 and a share of the third-round lead with Goosen. One of three leaders at the start of the day, Goosen parred each of the last nine holes despite a number of wayward shots down the stretch. The 32-year-old South African managed a 69 to push the leading total to 205 (−5). Brooks, a co-leader of Goosen's after a tournament-low 64 on Friday, shot even-par 70 to join Rocco Mediate and García in third place at 206 (−4). Mickelson, who ended the day three under, was the first big name to make a charge in the third round. Woods shot a 69 for 214 (+4), nine strokes back in tie for 23rd.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 17, 2001\"\nGoosen missed a par putt at the 72nd hole to fall back into a tie with Brooks, forcing an 18-hole playoff on Monday. Brooks was in the clubhouse when Goosen charged his birdie putt past the cup. Goosen, after watching his playing partner and co-leader Cink miss a putt for bogey, pushed his short par putt by the right edge of the cup. He then sank a short bogey putt to finish regulation alongside Brooks at four-under-par 276. When Goosen and Cink dialed it up to go to five-under, Brooks responded by two-putting for birdie at the par-five 13th. The lead was his after Cink drove into a creek for bogey at 13 and Goosen suffered his first three-putt of the championship at the 14th. Goosen, who stoically battled to hold on to a piece of the top spot all week, knocked his approach at the 15th to the back fringe and rolled in a 12-footer to return to minus-five with Brooks. Brooks' approach to 18 landed left of the right-side pin placement. His first putt was too hard and sped past the hole, and his par try stopped on the right edge. The bogey gave Brooks an even-par 70 and dropped him to four-under. Back at 17, Cink replaced Brooks as co-leader after a brilliant wedge approach over the flag landed past the pin before spinning back to two feet for birdie.\nTwo players who had been expected to make a charge in the final round - Mickelson and García - blew their chances with poor displays. The most eye-catching performances of the day came from Vijay Singh and Tom Kite, who both stormed to 64 (−6) - the best rounds of the week - and Olin Browne, who sank a hole-in-one at the 11th. Woods, winner of the previous four major championships, failed to make a charge on Sunday and saw his run come to an end. He turned in his second straight 69 to finish seven strokes back, tied for 12th at 283 (+3), snapping streaks of eight straight top-10s in majors and 40 consecutive events under par.\nAmateurs: Molder (+8).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\n\"Monday, June 18, 2001\"\nIn the 18-hole playoff, Brooks birdied the third hole and Goosen the sixth to pull even at one-under par. Brooks bogeyed the seventh and again at the ninth, while Goosen birdied it to go three strokes up at the turn. Brooks bogeyed #10 while Goosen birdied to take a five-shot lead with eight holes to be played. They halved the next six holes, all pars except bogeys at #12, and Goosen maintained his five-stroke lead with just two holes remaining.\nA two-shot swing in Brooks' favor at the 17th cut the lead to three, but Brooks, who struggled off the tee all day, sent his final drive into the right-hand rough. He chose a fairway wood for his approach and did well to run his ball into the bunker short and left of the final green. Goosen found the 18th fairway with his drive, then hit a five-iron that landed short of the green and rolled back down the slope. Taking no chances with his tight uphill lie, Goosen used a putter to knock his ball onto the putting surface, leaving for his par. Brooks blasted out of the trap to three feet and converted for par for a two-over 72. Goosen cautiously left his par putt short, then rolled in the clinching putt for an even-par 70 and became just the sixth foreign-born winner of the U.S. Open in the last 70 years. Goosen became the third South African to win the title, joining Gary Player and Ernie Els as champions of the USGA's premier event.\nQuotes.\n\"It's amazing and I don't want to consider what it would have felt like if I had lost but I played solid and my putter was warm in places – except yesterday.\" – Retief Goosen\n\"It's been a long week, it feels like a year out here.\" – Retief Goosen\n\"When I got up this morning, I was more comfortable than I was Sunday morning. I knew I had a 50 percent chance of winning.\" – Retief Goosen\n\"I got punished severely in the rough today and that was kind of the difference,\" – Mark Brooks after his playoff loss.\n\"I started hitting the ball a lot better a few weeks ago, and just the putter wasn't working. And putting a new putter in the bag last week, it just helped.\" – Retief Goosen\n\"To be honest with you I played as hard as I could, I tried on every shot, and there's no regrets.\" – Tiger Woods after failing to win his fifth straight major championship\n\"I don't think people really understand how difficult it is on you to keep putting yourself there and the stress it puts on you coming down the back nine on Sunday with a chance to win. More times than not it wears you out.\"\" – Tiger Woods\n\"It's certainly not the finish I would have liked, but out of playing (36) majors now, and not winning any, I'm tired of beating myself up time after time,\" – Phil Mickelson.\n\"It was really tough to dig in and concentrate on that second putt because I really didn't think it was really all that important,\" – Stewart Cink after missing a two-foot putt which ultimately would have put him in the playoff with Goosen and Brooks (since Goosen missed his own two-foot putt seconds later)."

The Test series against Australia in 1969–70 was to be their last for 22 years.\nFor a description of South African cricket in the years of isolation, see: International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981.\nNelson Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison in Paarl on 11 February 1990.

For information about the unofficial tours, see: International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981 and South African rebel tours. South Africa resumed official international cricket in 1991 when the team made a short tour of India. It then played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. All of the matches played during the rebel tours had been granted first-class status, but this was subsequently and controversially withdrawn by the ICC in 1993. In August 2007, the ICC was reviewing the status of all matches played in South Africa between 1961 and 1991, including those played during the rebel tours, with a view to restoring first-class status to some matches."

        "text": "This article describes the history of South African cricket from the end of the Second World War in 1945 to the start of South Africa's cricket isolation in 1970.\nInternational feeling against South Africa's apartheid policy became stronger and more vociferous as the post-war era developed. Until the mid-1960s, however, the South Africa national cricket team continued to play regularly and without undue difficulty against Australia, England and New Zealand.\nBut matters came to a head in 1968 when the South African government refused to allow a tour by England whose team included Basil D'Oliveira. Although the Australians visited South Africa in 1969–70, the end was nigh for apartheid in sport and South Africa was banned from Test cricket for 22 years. This happened just at a time when the South African team was arguably the strongest in world cricket.\nIn 1970, after South Africa's tour of England was cancelled, a Rest of the World team toured instead. It was captained by Gary Sobers and included other non-white players from the West Indies, India and Pakistan. It also included four of the greatest South African players (Eddie Barlow, Graeme Pollock, Mike Procter and Barry Richards) who clearly had no problems about sharing a dressing room with other cricketers whose skin was a different colour to their own.\nInternational tours of South Africa from 1945-46 to 1969-70.\nCommonwealth XI, 1959-60.\nA Commonwealth XI cricket team toured South Africa in October 1959, playing three first-class matches.

        "title": "Foxhill motocross circuit",
        "text": "Foxhill motocross circuit is a well-known motocross circuit situated near to the small village of Foxhill, around six miles south east of Swindon, Wiltshire, England.\nEstablished in the late 1980s, the circuit is highly regarded by motocross enthusiasts in the UK. Set in a valley, much of the circuit winds up and down the steep banks of the valley, with a number of large man-made jumps. The circuit is predominantly hard, chalky soil.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAfter staging a number of national-level events in the early 1990s, the circuit was soon selected to stage Grand Prix events, regularly staging the British Motocross Grand Prix for the 125cc and 250cc classes.\nGrand Prix Days.\nThe circuit made history in 1995, when the first ever 'double-header' Grand Prix event was staged, with the 125cc and 250cc Grand Prix classes both being held on the same day. This proved a huge success with riders, organisers and fans, with the 'double-header' format now a standard feature of Grand Prix motocross. The day was especially notable for home fans as British rider Paul Malin took a popular home victory in the 125cc class.\nBelgian star Stefan Everts was a huge fan of the Foxhill circuit, as he took three Grand Prix wins at Foxhill in the 1990s, in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Everts, along with many riders, enjoyed the unique atmosphere at the circuit. With the circuit set in a valley, crowds of over 20,000 fans would perch on the hillsides, creating an exciting atmosphere more akin to a football stadium than a motorsports venue. Everts even claimed that as excited fans cheered and sounded air horns as the riders dropped into the valley on the opening lap, it was impossible to hear the engine on his bike!\nGrand Prix events were (and still are) often televised live on Eurosport, and at the start of each Grand Prix race a piece of music sampling the opening chords of Hells Bells by AC/DC was played on the TV and also at the circuit on powerful speaker systems. Such was the way that the music added to the occasion, Hells Bells is often seen by UK motocross fans as the de facto theme tune to the circuit.\nWatershed and Decline.\n1998 was to be watershed year in the history of Foxhill, as the circuit staged a Grand Prix event in May, along with the Motocross des Nations in September. The Grand Prix saw Everts de-throned as the 'King of Foxhill', when French rival Sebastien Tortelli snatched victory in the 250cc class.\nHowever, Everts was to reclaim his 'crown' at the Des Nations event in September. Torrential rain over the weekend turned the circuit into a mudbath, with conditions so bad that many of the world's leading riders, including a young Ricky Carmichael, were struggling like junior riders in the severe mud. So bad were the conditions that in the second race of the day, two-thirds of the elite riders got stuck on one of Foxhill's steep hills, dubbed by the media as 'Heartbreak Hill'. None of this was to bother Everts, who was a class apart as he took two race wins, helping the Belgian team onto victory.\nWhilst the Everts masterclass was to go down in motocross folklore, the real talking point was the terrible weather conditions. So bad were the conditions that it was reported that only the prestige and importance of the event meant that it went ahead. The mud caused problems with both riding teams and spectators becoming hopelessly stuck in the muddy fields after the event.\nAfter the Motocross Des Nations event, Foxhill was seemingly cursed by poor weather 1999 saw the Grand Prix once again return to Foxhill, with the circuit completely renovated and rebuilt. Saturday evening saw a severe thunderstorm, which once again turned Sunday's event into a mudbath. Such were the poor conditions that the eventual winner in the 250cc class was Dutchman Remy van Rees, a rider who previously had rarely broken into the world's top 15 prior to the event. Van Rees won by sheer consistency, as most of the world's elite struggled in the conditions.\n2000 saw another first, as Foxhill was to stage a 'triple-header' with 125cc, 250cc and 500cc Grand Prix events all taking place on the same weekend, with the opening 125cc race on the Saturday. However, for the third year in a row, torrential rain ruined the event. Only the opening 125cc race took place, before Sunday's racing was cancelled due to safety fears. This was the final Grand Prix event to ever take place at Foxhill. With the circuit waterlogged for three years in a row, the circuit's poor infrastructure was a source of irritation to the Grand Prix promoters (at the time) 'Action Group', who were keen to raise the profile of Grand Prix motocross by moving to circuits with improved infrastructure. Thus the 2000 British Grand Prix was the final Grand Prix to be staged at Foxhill.\nNew Millennium.\nAfter 2000, the British Grand Prix was not staged until 2004. After three years of major events ruined by heavy rain, the Foxhill circuit was dilapidated and worn out. However, it would soon gain a new lease of life as an amateur circuit. Since 2000, a wide range of amateur events, including youth, adult and historic races have been staged at the circuit. Organising bodies have invested in the circuit, and in recent years the circuit and infrastructure have been totally renovated."

Liu sped around the outside of the field in the first 125 metres to reach the front, but Olympic champion Hassiba Boulmerka had no interest in letting her take the pace, instead aggressively holding Liu to the outside. Boxed at the back of the pack for the first 400 meters, Lü Yi then ran around the far outside of the pack to join Liu's shoulder on the outside. Just before 800 meters, Yan worked her way through traffic to get behind Lü, temporarily boxing in Sonia O'Sullivan. Crossing the start line for the second time, Liu accelerated into the lead with Lü in tow. Boulmerka continued to fight, holding off Lü with the field stringing out behind them. Over the next lap, it became a four-woman breakaway as O'Sullivan was the only other able to hold onto the pace. Liu continued to increase the gap to Boulmerka, opening up 10 metres down the backstretch as Lü sprinted past Boulmerka into second. O'Sullivan followed Lü then sprinted past her on the final curve. Liu was gone, pulling away to a 15-metre win. O'Sullivan maintained her position as Lü faded. Boulmerka was unable to make any headway against O'Sullivan and had to settle for bronze.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

Langthorne in command. Between 4 February and 7 April 1863, \"Cricket\" served on guard duty at Memphis, Tennessee, during which time she seized a quantity of cotton on \"Delta\" and \"Forest Queen\" on 15 March and landed it at Cairo. Reassigned to the White River Station between Memphis and the Arkansas River, \"Cricket\" patrolled the Mississippi River to prevent the crossing of Confederate troops and supplies and to keep the banks free from hidden batteries and guerrillas. She engaged a battery above Argyle Landing on 2 May and another near Greenville, Mississippi, on 4 May.\nIn August 1863 she joined and in an expedition up the White River. \"Cricket\" continued into the Little Red River and on 14 August captured the last two Confederate army transports in the area, \"Kaskaskia\" and \"Thomas Sugg\", returning to the Mississippi River under frequent musket fire from Southern troops ashore. In November and December 1863 \"Cricket\" convoyed troop transports on the Tennessee River and cleared the river banks of guerrillas, as she supported Union Army movements. She then joined the naval forces on the Red River Station, and participated in an expedition up the Black and Ouachita Rivers in Louisiana from 29 February to 5 March 1864, supporting the Army.\nServing as flagship for Admiral David D. Porter, \"Cricket\" and her squadron ascended the river as far as Springfield Landing, Louisiana, when news of a Confederate victory at the Battle of Pleasant Hill, called them back to their station. Hampered by falling water and the difficulty of making sharp turns while going downstream with the current, the squadron was attacked again and again by Confederate troops as it returned to the Mississippi River. On 26 April \"Cricket\" fought off capture when a boarding attempt was made suddenly by 1,200 soldiers as she ran past a battery of 18 artillery pieces. She was struck 38 times and lost 12 killed and 19 wounded out of crew of fifty officers and men-1/3 of the crew were African Americans. She brought Admiral Porter safely to and sailed to Mound City for repairs. Out of commission from 31 May to 13 August 1864 when repairs were completed, \"Cricket\" returned to duty on the White River Station until the end of hostilities. She was decommissioned 30 June 1865 and sold 17 August 1865 at Mound City, Illinois."

        "text": "Scott Johnson (born 19 August 1962 in Sydney), is an Australian rugby union coach, who was the interim head coach for Scotland in 2013 and early 2014 before serving as a Director of Rugby for Scotland between 2014 and 2019 before returning to Australia in the same role between 2019 and 2021.\nPlaying career.\nPlaying as a fly-half or a centre, Johnson played for Parramatta Two Blues and Eastwood, and was captain of both the New South Wales Waratahs and Australian Under 21s. Playing initially at fly half and then at centre, he played senior rugby for New South Wales Waratahs. In the 1980s Johnson also played for French club Toulon in the French championship.\nCoaching career.\nJohnson started his coaching career with Penrith in the Sydney First Grade competition, and was named Club Coach of the Year in 1999. Johnson then worked as an assistant coach at New South Wales Waratahs in 2001, as well as an assistant for the Australia A team who defeated the British and Irish Lions in Gosford.\nFollowing an invitation from Graham Henry, Johnson left Australia to work with the then struggling Wales in the Six Nations Championship as Skills Coach. Working briefly under Henry and then for two years under Steve Hansen, Johnson was an integral member of the Welsh coaching staff during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He remained with Wales when Hansen left in 2004 and was involved with Wales for their 2005 Grand Slam. Following the resignation of Mike Ruddock in 2006, Johnson took over as head coach on a temporary basis, ending his career with Wales in Cardiff after three games: a 31–5 defeat to Ireland in Dublin, an 18–18 draw against Italy in Cardiff, before going down to eventual Champions France 21–16.\nIn light of family pressures, he accepted an approach from new Wallabies head coach John Connolly to become Australia's attack coach in preparation for the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nFollowing a disastrous campaign and the reorganisation of the coaching staff, Johnson was released from this role following the 2007 World Cup and the signing of Robbie Deans as the new head coach of Australia. Johnson was linked with a move to the Cardiff Blues as skills coach, but decided not to accept this offer. Johnson's decision to say no to the Blues led to speculation linking him with the ambitious Ospreys. On 20 March 2008, the BBC reported that Johnson has accepted the head coaching position for the US Eagles national team.\nIn January 2009, Johnson was linked with a move to coach the Ospreys. On 29 January, he was confirmed as the Ospreys' new director of coaching. He joined the team after he served a three-month notice period required by his USA contract.\nIt was announced in December 2011 that Johnson would leave his post with the Ospreys at the end of his three-year contract. In June 2012, he joined Scottish coach Andy Robinson as his assistant coach through the 2012 Scottish tour of Oceania and the 2012 Autumn internationals. Head Coach Andy Robinson resigned his position after their 21–15 defeat to Tonga, which ended in the result of Scott Johnson being announced as head coach for Scotland. On 3 May 2013, Johnson was announced as Director of Rugby for Scotland Rugby, a post which had been vacant since Sir Ian McGeechan resigned in 2005, and would oversee all rugby in Scotland. However, he remained interim head coach for Scotland until a suitable head coach was found for the national side. Under Scott Johnson's leadership, Scotland won two Six Nations games against Italy (one at home and one away), plus a win against Ireland.\nOn 15 March 2014, Johnson took charge of his final game (Wales V Scotland) making way for Vern Cotter's arrival as head coach."

It follows a group of students at an elite international school in Prague who break into an indoor water park where they are stalked by a masked murderer.\nPlot.\nCatherine is waiting for her boyfriend to arrive at her home, where she is cooking dinner. She discovers her boyfriend's car in her driveway, and inside finds him with his throat slit. A killer wearing a skull mask breaks into the home and murders her, throwing her body in a swimming pool.\nShortly after, a group of international students from an elite Prague school are graduating; among them are the American Sarah; the Scottish Mike; the English Frank; Kim, an Australian; Carmen, from Germany; Diego, from Argentina; and others. To celebrate, Sarah's boyfriend Greg plans to break into an indoor swimming complex with the help of Martin, an American former student and employee of the water park, giving the friends free access to pools and water slides. On finals day, Kim is upset over failing her tests. She and Mike, her boyfriend, go swimming at a lake, and she tells him she feels like an outcast among him and his wealthy peers; she decides not to attend the party. Later, Kim is accosted in the woods by the masked killer, and stabbed to death with a machete.\nLate that night, the group arrive at the water park and are let inside by Martin, where they begin drinking and swimming in the pools. Svenja and Carter go to an isolated pool to ride a water slide. While Carter waits for her at the bottom, he is stabbed to death. As Svenja descends the waterslide, the killer drives a machete through the bottom of the slide; she attempts to stop but is unable to, and the machete slices through her groin. Shortly after, Carmen and Chris discover their bodies floating in the small pool. Carmen and Chris locate the remainder of the group, but they find they are unable to leave the building as the entryways have been locked. Meanwhile, Martin and Mel find an empty weight room to have sex. When Martin goes to retrieve a condom, Mel is attacked by the killer chased into a locker room where she is killed.\nAware that a killer is loose, Sarah, Mike, Carmen, and Chris intercept Martin en route back to the weight room. In a panic, they rush to save Mel, but find her corpse in a bathroom stall. The group are unable to locate Greg, Frank, or Diego, and Martin finds that the lock picks and spare keys to the building have been removed; the phones have also been disconnected. Martin recalls an air duct leading out of the building, and proposes the group exit that way. He goes ahead to dismantle a vent grate, after which Sarah, Mike, and Carmen follow; Chris stays behind, as they are unable to turn around and lift him from inside the duct. As they crawl through the duct, the killer begins driving his machete through the bottom of it, killing Mike and Martin.\nSarah and Carmen escape through a separate duct and find themselves in the basement, where they are confronted by the killer, who chases them through the building. They momentarily hide in a security monitor room and ponder who the killer is; Carmen believes it is Greg. Meanwhile, Diego and Greg find Chris, terrified. Greg decides to enter the air duct to find a way out, and Diego waits with Chris. Greg finds Sarah and Carmen in a room overlooking the pool. Convinced he is the killer, Carmen knocks him unconscious, and she and Sarah lock him inside. Carmen attempts to swim into a filter chamber to exit the building. She injures her leg in the process, but is able to access the exterior of the building. Outside, she finds a security guard's corpse with a gun lying next to it, but before she can retrieve it, she is stabbed by the killer and thrown back into the filter chamber.\nInside, Sarah is confronted by Frank, who reveals himself to be the killer, motivated out of spite and jealousy over his failed romantic advances on each of the women. Sarah manages to douse him with vodka and light him on fire, but he leaps into the pool. Greg breaks free of the room overlooking the pool, jumping into the pool below, and the men begin to fight. Sarah enters the water and manages to stab Frank with a broken bottle. He rises from the water while Greg and Sarah attempt to flee, but is shot to death by Carmen, who survived the earlier attack.\nReception.\n, \"Swimming Pool\" holds a 36% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eleven reviews with an average rating of 5.15/10. Film critic Jim Harper wrote: \"With the basic material so derivative and stereotyped, \"The Pool\" wasn't going to be a classic, but might have lifted itself above the average. Sadly it's also stuck with some atrocious performances and a dumb script.\""

The Twenty20 matches have had men's Twenty20 International (T20I) status since 2019, as the International Cricket Council granted T20I status to all of its members from the start of the year. On 31 May 2019, there was also a one-off women's Twenty20 International fixture between the two women's teams. It was the first T20I match for both the teams.\nHistory.\nGuernsey and Jersey had played inter-insular games between clubs in the 1930s. After the war, there had been two annual games which appeared to be made up of players from different clubs to make an island team. In 1949 the press reported that GICC (Guernsey Island Cricket Club) would meet JICC (Jersey Island Cricket Club). It would appear that the games were played all day, irrespective that the second team had passed the score of the first. In 1950, GICC scoring 129, followed by JICC achieving 196 for 4.\nIn 1951 the media began calling the teams Guernsey and Jersey rather than GICC and JICC. The Elizabeth College magazine for 1951 reported V G Collenette as the captain of the first Guernsey v Jersey match in 1950. The 1952 match did not take place as Jersey did not turn up in Guernsey, having \"forgotten to select a team\", according to the \"Guernsey Press\" reporter. The same problem occurred in 1956. Caps for the inter island match were first awarded by GCA (Guernsey Cricket Association) in 1960, but backdated to 1957. GCA claimed the first match was in 1957.\nJersey claimed an outright win in 1960, followed by three successive wins for Guernsey. Several draws took place in the 1960s and 70s, leading to the match being switched to a pure limited overs format rather than a timed game. Between 1992 and 2001, Jersey won ten matches in a row.\nIn 2018, the format switched to a series of Twenty20 matches, but the traditional 50-over match returned from 2019 in addition to the Twenty20 series.\nThere were no inter-insular matches in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMen's One-Day results (Inter-Insular Trophy).\nMatches summary (as of 2023).\nSource: Guernsey Cricket\nMen's Twenty20 International series results (Inter-Insular Cup).\nMatches summary.\nSource: Guernsey Cricket *Jersey won a Super over following the tied match."

His progress was marked by World Junior Champion Haile Gebrselassie. The field strung out behind them, one by one dropping off the back. With nine laps to go, the last to drop off was Richard Chelimo, then it was just the two. Tanui was unable to shake the youngster. Coming into the bell, Gebrselassie moved closer to Tanui and accidentally stepping on his heel. Tanui's shoe flew off. With just one shoe, an angered Tanui sprinted out to a quick 5-meter lead, expanding to a 10-meter lead with 200 to go. Through the final turn, Gebrselassie began to gain. As they onto the final straight, Tanui went wide, straining to sprint to the finish. Gebrselassie accepted the opening, sprinting past Tanui on the inside and on to a 5-meter victory.\nThis was the changing of the guard as Gebrselassie would go on to win the next three world championships and two Olympics.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;"

There were a total number of 42 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Monday 1993-08-16.\nFinal.\nThis 5,000-metre final was run at a consistently fast pace from the start, which quickly broke up the 15-man field. The Kenyans and Ethiopians used team tactics and successive surges in order to try to exhaust each other. Kenya's Michael Chesire led at a suicidal pace in 2:31.76 at 1,000 metres. Ismael Kirui passed the tiring Chesire around 1,700 metres. At 2,000 metres, Kirui was leading in 5:11.27. The only non-African runner who was still in contention was Rob Denmark of Britain. Soon after 2,000 metres, however, for example Denmark started to lose contact with the leading group, as Kirui surged away from his opponents. By 2,400 metres (his unofficial split time was 6:11.48), the teenage Kenyan champion had already stretched his lead over the chasing group to 40 metres! Kirui continued his mercilessly quick pace as he passed 3,000 metres in a wide lead in 7:45.62. Only several African runners, including Skah and the three Ethiopians, Haile Gebrselassie, Fita Bayisa, and Worku Bikila, were able to remain in the chasing group. Shortly after 3,000 metres, the chasing group was reduced to four runners: Skah and the Ethiopians. They took turns passing each other, but none of them was able to break away from the other chasers at this point, nor to reduce Kirui's stunning lead to any noticeable extent. Despite slowing down slightly, the young Kenyan led at 4,000 metres in 10:26.85 - with the chasing group still around 35 to 40 metres behind him. At 4,600 metres, Kirui led in 12:03.16. At last the Ethiopians had been able to reduce his lead to between three and four seconds. Their relentless surges finally caused Skah to drop from the chasing group on the final lap's back straight. Also Bikila started to fall behind his team mates Bayisa and Gebrselassie. This Ethiopian duo was still about 20 metres from Kirui at 4,800 metres. By 4,900 metres, they had been able to reduce the Kenyan's lead to 15 metres. On the home straight, Gebrselassie finally broke away from Bayisa, and with a middle-distance runner's speed he began to close in on Kirui. However, the Kenyan teenager was able to defeat the young Ethiopian, because the latter runner began his final sprint too late.

There were a total number of 42 participating athletes, with two qualifying heats and the final being held on 21 August 1993.\nThe race was conducted in almost 30 °C temperatures, but the Chinese team took the race out at a pace only seen once before, during Ingrid Kristiansen's world record race 5 years earlier. Zhong Huandi took the pace for her 20 year old country mate Wang Junxia, while the others struggled to keep up. 15 year old Sally Barsosio stayed close to the pace, but her inexperience and erratic movements disrupted the flow for several runners near her. At one point during the race she was shown a yellow card by an umpire to essentially tell her to get out of the way. After getting spiked too many times from Barsosio's back kick, Elana Meyer walked off the track. The fast pace eventually slowed mid-race, then in frustration, Wang took off, separating from the chase pack of Zhong, Barsosio and Tegla Loroupe. Wang began dropping her lap times progressively 72, 71, 70, 69, 68. She capped it off with a 61 final lap for a championship record 30:49.30. Half a lap back, Barsosio had edged ahead of with Loroupe unable to maintain the pace and fading, then Zhong launched into a sprint the loping Barsosio could not match, pulling away to a three second gap for silver. After the race, Barsosio was disqualified, only to be reinstated on appeal. A little over two weeks later, Wang demolished the world record, running 29:31.78, part of a record smashing National Games of China when three major women's distance records were set. Wang's 10,000 record lasted until the 2016 Olympics when it was smashed by Ethiopian Almaz Ayana. Her 3000 metres record from 1993 has never been beaten. 4th place in that 1993 Chinese race was still the #4 time in history until 2019. In 2016, a letter written by Wang in 1995 was published where she is said to have admitted to herself and her Liaoning teammates doping. Zhong trained with a different group in Yunnan. Four years later Barsosio won this race as a 19 year old.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2004 Masters was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament held in February 2004. It was the 30th staging of the Masters tournament, one of three Triple Crown events on the Snooker Tour, the eighth of fifteen World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) events in the 2003/2004 season, and was held at the Wembley Conference Centre in London, United Kingdom from 1 to 8 February 2004. The tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC.\nPaul Hunter won the tournament, defeating 1995 winner and world number three Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–9, claiming the third Masters title of his career in four years. Hunter joined Cliff Thorburn, Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis as the fourth player to win the Masters three or more times. In the semi-finals, Hunter defeated John Higgins 6–3 and O'Sullivan beat Jimmy White 6–4. O'Sullivan compiled a 138 break, the highest of the tournament, in the second frame of his semi-final match against White.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nThe Masters was first held in 1975 at the West Centre Hotel with the sport's top ten ranking players invited to participate. It moved to the New London Theatre the following year, before it resided at the Wembley Conference Centre in 1979 where all editions of the tournament had been held going into the 2004 tournament. It is part of snooker's Triple Crown events alongside the World Snooker Championship and the UK Championship, but does not have official ranking status. The tournament was sponsored by Benson &amp; Hedges until 2003 when the company was required to end its association with the Masters due to restrictions on tobacco advertising in the United Kingdom. Thus, the tournament went without sponsorship in 2004.\nThe 2004 tournament was the eighth of fifteen World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) events in the 2003/2004 season, following the Welsh Open and preceding the third Challenge Tour event. Held in January, the Welsh Open was won by Ronnie O'Sullivan, who defeated Steve Davis by nine to eight (9–8) in the final. The defending Masters champion was Mark Williams, who defeated Stephen Hendry 10–4 in the previous year's final. The tournament had a prize fund of £400,000, and was broadcast on television by the BBC. For the 2004 tournament, a new trophy commissioned by the WPBSA and designed by crystal manufacturer Waterford Crystal was awarded to the Masters champion for the first time.\nFormat and wild-card matches.\nMark Williams, the defending Masters champion and 2003 World Snooker Champion, was the number 1 seed. Places were allocated to the top 16 players in the world rankings. Players seeded 15 and 16 played in the wild-card round against Neil Robertson (the winner of the qualifying event in the Welsh town of Prestatyn during December 2003), and Ding Junhui, who was the wild-card selection. All matches were played to the best of 11 frames, up until the final which was played to a maximum of 19 frames.\nFor the wild-card round, Robertson was drawn against world number 15 Jimmy White, the 1984 Masters champion. White won the match 6–2 by compiling six half-centuries and a match-best break of 83. World number 16 Joe Perry was assigned as Ding's opponent, the youngest player in the history of the Masters at age 16. Ding compiled breaks of 58 and 108, and Perry took frame four before the mid-session interval. A further break of 118 in the sixth frame, along with Perry potting the cue ball, enabled Ding to claim the final two frames and win the match 6–3.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the competition, in which sixteen players took part, was played between 1 and 4 February 2004. In the first match, defending champion Mark Williams won against fellow Welshman and world number nine Matthew Stevens, 6–5. Stevens compiled breaks of 105 and 92, to take a 3–1 lead, but Williamsn went ahead 5–3 after winning four frames in a row. However, Stevens claimed the next two frames after fluking a red ball and potting the coloured balls, to force a final frame decider. Stevens was leading 48–0 in points when he missed a blue ball shot to the middle pocket, allowing Williams to win the match. Two-time Masters champion Paul Hunter faced David Gray in his first round match. The first frame was restarted after 17 minutes due to inactivity on the table; Hunter clinched the frame on a black ball after Gray incurred 10 penalty points while leading 66–1. Hunter extended his lead with a break of 51, but Gray responded with a 70 break. Hunter led 3–1 at the mid-session interval, but Gray reduced Hunter's advantage again, this time with a break of 67. Hunter won two of the next three frames to take the score to 5–3, and a break of 74 in the ninth frame gave him a 6–3 win, setting up a quarter-final encounter with Williams.\nWorld number three and 1995 Masters champion, Ronnie O'Sullivan, took a 6–0 whitewash over 1994 winner Alan McManus . During a match that lasted 1 hour and 50 minutes, McManus' highest break was just 44. O'Sullivan equalled that in the second frame and compiled a 75 break in the fourth. He took advantage of McManus missing two opportunities to pot the blue ball, claiming match victory and giving McManus his first Masters whitewash in his 13th appearance. John Higgins, world number four and 1999 Masters champion, defeated fellow Scotsman Graeme Dott 6–4. Playing with a new cue (having intentionally destroyed his old one at a motorway service station), Dott took the first frame with a clearance of 34. Higgins then compiled breaks of 70, 63, and 100, to lead 3–1 at the mid-session interval. However, Dott managed to level the scoreline after the next two frames, thanks to a poor positional shot from Higgins on a final blue ball, and they shared the next two frames bringing the score to 4–4. Higgins took the ninth frame, winning a safety battle over the pink, and he clinched frame 10 to advance to the quarter-finals. Higgins' victory continued Dott's streak of failing to win any matches at the Wembley Conference Centre.\nKen Doherty compiled breaks of 89 and 81 to hold a 3–1 advantage over his opponent Steve Davis at the mid-session interval of their first round match. Davis denied Doherty an early victory in frame seven when he potted the last four coloured balls to snatch the frame; he also took the next frame to reduce his deficit to 3–5. However, a 33 break from Doherty ended the match 6–3 in his favour, after more than 3 and a half hours of play. Afterwards, Davis complained about cold air entering the venue, which dampened the cloth and caused the chalk to stick to the cue ball. Stephen Lee took the first frame of his match against Ding Junhui, who won the next three frames—with the help of an 84 break—for a 3–1 lead at the interval. Following Lee's fifth frame win, Ding compiled breaks of 81, 83, and 89, to go 5–2 ahead, but Lee responded to claim frame eight on a re-spotted black ball, before taking the ninth with a clearance of 54. Lee also took the tenth frame to force a final frame decider; he then made a break of 85 in the last frame to claim a 6–5 victory, booking his place in the quarter-finals.\nJimmy White defeated six-time Masters champion Stephen Hendry 6–4, in a match disrupted by noise from an over-enthusiastic partisan crowd that referee Colin Brinded had attempted to control. White won the first frame with a 54 break, but a fluke on a red ball in the second gave Hendry the impetus to win the next two frames with breaks of 97 and 75. White took the fourth frame to equalise the scoreline, until Hendry made his 632nd career century break (102) to win the fifth. White then made a clearance of 40, after Hendry missed a shot on the pink ball to a middle pocket in frame six, and White took the lead. A 36 clearance and a 51 break won him the match, his first against Hendry at the Wembley Conference Centre in seven attempts. After the match, White apologised to Hendry for the crowd's disrespectful behaviour; a female spectator had been ejected and escorted out of the arena by security after she ignored repeated warnings over disrupting the match. White also voiced a complaint about the playing conditions, and the WPBSA conducted a meticulous investigation of the table's mechanics on 4 February, to correct any imperfections prior to the start of the quarter-finals.\nIn the last of the first round matches, Quinten Hann responded to an early century break from his opponent Peter Ebdon to take a 2–1 lead, but a playing error, in which Hann potted the cue ball from a screwback on the pink ball, allowed Ebdon to level the scoreline with a break of 55. They shared the next two frames, but Hann conceded the seventh after missing the final red ball, despite trailing by only 21 points in the frame. Edbon forged ahead, claiming the next two frames to win the match 6–3. At the post-match press conference, Hann put the decline in his performance down to hunger, which had lowered his concentration after the mid-session interval, \"This wasn't the first time it's happened. I enjoy playing Peter but the game did drag on. I got some chocolate at the end but it was too little too late.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place on 5 and 6 February 2004. Hunter took an early lead of 3–1 in the first quarter-final, but Williams then won four of the next five frames, with breaks of 66, 77, 52 and 101, to move 5–4 ahead. Williams looked set to win the match in frame ten with a 51–12 lead, but a strong ricochet off the top right-hand corner pocket sent the cue ball down the table and Hunter made a 65 clearance to force a final frame decider. Hunter built a 63–16 lead, and despite a missed long-range red ball that provided Williams with a failed opportunity to pot a long-range yellow in the bottom right-hand pocket, won the match for his third career victory over Williams. Higgins won the 34-minute opening frame of his quarter-final match against Lee, who then compiled a half-century break of 51 in the second frame, before ending the next with a black ball shot on a 36 run. The match levelled at 4–4 and Higgins won the next two frames (with a 71 break in the ninth) to end it 6–4 and advance to the semi-finals. Higgins criticised the table conditions afterwards: \"The table was atrocious. We played with a light white, and the cushions were bouncing all over the place. Neither of us played well, but the conditions didn't help.\"\nO'Sullivan defeated Doherty 6–3 in the third quarter-final. Doherty began well by winning the first frame but O'Sullivan went unchallenged in the next three frames to score 260 points, including breaks of 43, 87 and 75, to lead 3–1 going into the mid-session interval. They shared frames five and six; Doherty won frame seven after O'Sullivan was snookered on the final red, and O'Sullivan took the next frame on the pink ball. Although Doherty scored a break of 61 in the ninth frame, he could not sustain his form and O'Sullivan claimed victory on the black ball from a 38 clearance. The last quarter-final saw Ebdon compete against White, in front of a calmer crowd. White made century breaks of 118 and 101 in the first and fifth frames, followed by another by Ebdon in the sixth, and the score went level at 3–3. Ebdon won the next frame to briefly take the lead, but White won frames eight and nine, and with Ebdon unable to respond, White won the match 6–4 with a break of 45 in the tenth frame. He entered the semi-finals of the Masters at the Wembley Conference Centre for the tenth time in his career.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were played on 7 February 2004. Hunter opened proceedings with a break of 96 in the first frame of his semi-final match against Higgins, but his lead was short-lived as Higgins responded by compiling a 110 break in the second frame and winning frames three and four to enter the mid-session interval 3–1 ahead. Higgins took the fifth frame on the blue ball and Hunter won the sixth with a break of 68. Higgins clinched the 27-minute-long seventh frame on a re-spotted black ball, but his chances of victory were over when Hunter claimed the next two frames to win the match 6–3, following a safety shot exchange on the final pink ball. Higgins again voiced criticism of the table's playing conditions after the match, \"It was torture out there. We were playing with a light white, and the cushions were an absolute joke. I just couldn't get hold of the cue ball, and we shouldn't have to play on that. The table was a disgrace. Top players are not used to it. I've asked for something to be done. It's a sad day for snooker when no one listens to the players.\" Cloth manufacturer Milliken &amp; Company concluded that the table conditions were \"perfect as they could be\" for the cloth.\nO'Sullivan faced White in the second semi-final match later that evening. White won the opening frame and O'Sullivan produced the tournament's highest break (a 138 clearance) in the second frame to level the score. He then took frame three after an early foul from White on a black ball, but the two players were equal at the mid-session interval, after which play became disjointed and the two remained tied after the eighth frame. A break of 56 from O'Sullivan, and a shot from his opponent that left a red ball over a corner pocket, allowed him to win 6–4 and set up an encounter with Hunter in the final. Following the semi-final, O'Sullivan stated his belief that he was benefiting from a different approach and attitude, \"There is no point in being attacking and being careless at the same time and I was enjoying the struggle out there. It was a psychological battle I was having with myself. It was a chance for me to see how deep I could go and deal with things and be at one with myself.\" White admitted his past mental and physical effort during the Masters wore him out, \"I am sad because I didn't feel right at all and if I had been playing anywhere near the way I have, I might have won.\"\nFinal.\nThe best-of-19 frames final match took place over two sessions on 8 February 2004. Hunter defeated O'Sullivan to lift his third Masters title in four years (having previously won the 2001 and 2002 tournaments). In doing so, he joined Cliff Thorburn and Stephen Hendry as one of only three players to win the Masters tournament three or more times. The victory earned Hunter £100,000, while O'Sullivan received £50,000 and an extra £10,000 for compiling the tournament's highest break (138). The correspondent for \"The Scotsman\" noted that the match was hailed as \"one of the highest-quality matches witnessed in snooker\", and Brian Burside of \"The Independent\" recorded that Hunter had \"scored the most remarkable win in the history of the Masters\". The match was broadcast on BBC Two, with an average television audience of 3.4 million, up by 900,000 over the 2003 final, with a peak audience of 5 million viewers.\nO'Sullivan took advantage of Hunter's aggressive playing style to win the first two frames with breaks of 56 and 80; Hunter responded with a 117 break to clinch the third. O'Sullivan then moved ahead 6–1 within 42 minutes, with further breaks of 86, 87, 84, and 79, while Hunter potted a solitary ball during this period. However, Hunter concluded the 100-minute afternoon session with a 127 break to go 2–6 behind. In the first frame of the evening session, O'Sullivan overcame playing errors to take the ninth frame with a late break of 34. Hunter clinched the next four frames to take the score to 7–6 with breaks of 102 and 82 and executing successful long-range pots. O'Sullivan missed pottable red balls on scores of 28–0 and 59–16 but Hunter also faltered and O'Sullivan won the 14th frame. In the 15th, O'Sullivan missed a red ball shot along the top cushion and Hunter made a 109 break to again reduce the deficit to one frame. O'Sullivan restored his two-frame advantage in the next frame but Hunter compiled his fifth match century in the 17th, with a 110 clearance and a small clearance of 58; the 31-minute 18th frame took the match to a final frame decider. Hunter won the match and the tournament following a protracted safety exchange.\nAfter his victory, Hunter praised O'Sullivan's performance in the first session and said of his own achievement: \"I played really well all day. Even though I was 6–2 behind [after the first session] I'd made two centuries and I knew I was playing well. I was 6–2 down a few years ago against Fergal and I just stuck in there and that is what I did again and it went my way.\" O'Sullivan was philosophical about his defeat and said he was pleased for Hunter and his family, adding: \"I was a little disappointed, but it is only a game of snooker. Someone has to win and someone has to lose and this time it was my turn to lose.\"\nResults.\nWild-card round.\nNumbers given in brackets after players names show the 15th and 16th seeds in the competition.

Freddie Williams was the leader from the gun, but just before the break Ruto rushed to the lead and it appeared the strategy was in effect.

William Tanui moved forward early and was the next back through the turn followed by Curtis Robb. Along the backstretch. Williams began a run at Ruto, around Robb followed by Giuseppe D'Urso, Tanui was falling through the field with Billy Konchellah in dead last place, it looked like the Kenyan team strategy was going to blow up. Coming off the final turn, Williams looked like he had set Ruto up and was going to sprint by, but instead Williams could make no forward progress, his body delaying D'Urso and Ruto again had a 2-meter lead. D'Urso chased Ruto down the straightaway but couldn't make any progress. Everybody else in the field sliding further away except Konchellah, still last off the turn but the field tightening, Konchellah moved out to lane 3 to avoid traffic and sprinted past the crowd, chasing D'Urso to the line but not quite getting there in time.

        "title": "2014 FIFA World Cup bids",
        "text": "This article concerns the process for determining the host nation of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which concluded on 30 October 2007 with the confirmation of Brazil as the hosts.\nBackground.\nOn 7 March 2003, the world football body FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since Argentina hosted the 1978 FIFA World Cup, in line with its policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup amongst different confederations. On 3 June 2003, CONMEBOL announced that Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia wanted to host the 2014 World Cup finals. By 17 March 2004, the CONMEBOL associations had voted unanimously to adopt Brazil as their sole candidate.\nBrazil formally declared its candidacy in December 2006, and Colombia did so as well a few days later. The Argentina bid never materialized. On 11 April 2007, Colombia officially withdrew its bid, making Brazil the only official candidate to host the event in 2014.\nBrazil bid.\nBrazil, who eventually won the hosting rights for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, were the only remaining official candidate after Colombia withdrew its bid on 11 April 2007. The Brazilian bid was officially launched on 13 December 2006 by Ricardo Teixeira, then president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, who signed the letter of candidacy in Tokyo in the presence of CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz and CONMEBOL general secretary Eduardo De Luca.\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter stated on 4 July 2006 that the 2014 World Cup would probably be held in the country, though he acknowledged in earlier comments that the country did not have any stadiums ready for the Cup at the moment. On 28 September, he met with the Brazilian President Lula, and was quoted as saying he wants the country to prove its capabilities before making a decision. \"But the ball is on Brazil's court now,\" he said. In September 2006, Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva confirmed Blatter's opinion, declaring: \"We don't have any stadium which is in a condition to host World Cup games. We’re going to have to build at least 12 new stadiums in this country.\"\nPotential host cities are already preparing for the tournament. CBF and government officials have toured many cities and stadiums in the latest months, and 18 states have applied to host World Cup matches. However, the actual number of host cities is expected to be much lower, as FIFA stipulates a minimum of eight and a maximum of ten.\nOn 31 July 2007, Brazil's bid became official, when the Brazilian Football Confederation president, Ricardo Teixeira, delivered personally to FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, a document containing Brazil's hosting stadiums and other required information concerning plans in improvements for general infrastructure and about finances, though more details about this document are unknown.\nEarly in that day, a list of stadiums selected was published by Brazilian media. At least 21 cities were considered initially, but only 18 cities were pre selected as able to host international football matches. Among the 18 finalist cities, four stadiums were under construction or would be built if the right to host is won. The three cities not accepted were Campinas (São Paulo), João Pessoa (Paraíba) and Teresina (Piauí). On 17 August 2007, in a meeting between CBF officials and representatives from the 18 cities, Ricardo Teixeira confirmed the names of five host cities, and left the 13 other to fight for the remaining spots. The list below includes the cities selected by the Brazilian Football Confederation to receive the World Cup (the five confirmed cities are mentioned first):\nThis list would eventually be narrowed down to meet FIFA's requirement that no more than one host city feature two host stadiums. It may also include new stadiums to be built in the next years.\nBrazil hosted the 1950 World Cup and has hosted the Copa América four times (1919, 1922, 1949, 1989 and later 2019).\nOther bids.\nColombia.\nColombia formally declared its candidacy on 18 December 2006, and withdrew it on 11 April 2007.\nThe president of Colombia, Álvaro Uribe, had initially announced on 15 July 2006 that Colombia would submit a bid. During his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, Uribe said: \"By seeing how things were done to organise these Games, I think Colombia is capable of hosting a football World Cup. I'm sure we will achieve it and will do it very well.\" Vice President Francisco Santos Calderón was in charge of the project.\nColombia had been set to be the host of the 1986 World Cup, but withdrew to the benefit of Mexico because of economic issues, disagreements with FIFA, and concerns about the unstable situation in Colombia at the time. Colombia has hosted the Copa América once (2001). However, on 27 February 2007, FIFA president Sepp Blatter appeared to discard any Colombian chances of hosting the event, saying, \"Colombia's bid is more of a public relations presentation of the country to say that we are alive not only in other headlines but also in football.\"\nAustralia.\nIn June 2006, South Australian premier Mike Rann put forward a proposal for Australia to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was backed by then Prime Minister John Howard, who said that Australia has proven it can host world sporting events. Football Federation Australia President, Frank Lowy who has also expressed considerable interest in the proposal and is amid negotiations to formally put forward Australia's hosting proposal. Australia hosted the OFC Nations Cup twice (1998, and 2004), and four way co hosted once (1996). Australia attempted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but lost out to Qatar.\nJordan/Iraq.\nIn October 2004, the football federations of Jordan/Iraq mulled a bid to host the World Cup. \"The situation at the moment would make any bid ludicrous,\" Prince Faisal al-Hussein of Jordan was quoted as saying in his interview to \"The Times\" and \"The Guardian\". \"What will things be like in five years' time?. It could be a very prosperous nation. If the conditions are right, people will take it seriously.\"&lt;ref name=\"Jordan/Iraq\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nUnited States.\nIn June 2002, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) announced it expressed interest to offer a bid for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Robert Contiguglia was confident that the United States can put together a very strong bid. The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup. The United States also attempted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but lost out to Qatar. It eventually won rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with Mexico and Canada."

        "text": "Pwllheli Sailing Club is a yacht club in Pwllheli, Wales, founded in 1958. Over the years its clubhouse has moved several times, and it has also become an organiser of national and international yachting and dinghy sailing events.\nAfter a year's development Pwllheli Sailing Club has a new events centre (as of July 2015). The £8.5 million investment came from the European Union to help develop the area, and the academy has been a host to multiple events since its opening.\nLocation.\nThe club is located on the western side of the harbour near to the Glanydon Beach, and is within walking distance of the town. The club has dinghy storage compounds adjacent to the beach, and boats launch from the beach.\nHarbour.\nThe club overlooks the harbour and marina.\nPrincipal officers.\nOfficers serve a two-year terms; the Vice Commodore becomes the Commodore and the Rear Commodore becomes the Vice Commodore.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1958 in temporary premises to the east of Carreg yr Imbill (Gimlet Rock). In the early days membership was shared with the Gimlet Rock Club, a social club which allowed members to drink alcohol on Sundays, which was not allowed in public houses at that time. As membership split from the Gimlet Rock Club it migrated into an extension to the GRC building, and had the use of dormitory rooms on the first floor, where the \"Bridge\" to manage races was also located.\nThe early membership had several Folkboats and Stellas, and races were hotly contested, with owners sailing to and from the South Caernarvonshire Yacht Club in Abersoch to compete in each other's races.\nThe club acquired two GP14s, \"Frisky\" and \"Heidi\", for members to borrow, and located them in the roughly-surfaced dinghy park to the east, between the clubhouse and the derelict \"Old Jetty\", where there were twin slipways into the harbour. There was a dinghy racing programme from the early days of the club, but this was hampered by the need to borrow \"Jumbo\", the boatyard workboat owned by Partington Marine, to act as safety boat. A seaward slipway was also installed from the dinghy park around 1970, though weather conditions meant this was rarely usable, both because it was very narrow, and because it was fringed by granite chunks from the old Gimlet Rock Quarry.\nIn the early 1970s Les Caddick, one of the earliest members, donated a small Dell Quay Dory and outboard, making the club self-sufficient for its safety boat. Though the major membership was for cruising and racing yachts, with many racing in the Irish Sea Offshore Racing Association's annual series, the dinghy side started to increase. There was an annual Long Distance Dinghy Race to Abersoch and back, for example, and the Merlin Rocket national championships were hosted – the first such dinghy championship at Pwllheli.\nA strong relationship with New Quay Yacht Club created the annual passage race both from and to New Quay in Ceredigion, Mid Wales.\nFounding members.\n\"Founding members are taken from the original Articles of Association\"\nAn early, if not a founding, member was Alfred Walter (Bill) Maley of the Maley &amp; Taunton engineering company of Wednesfield\nClubhouse locations.\nIn 1986 the club received funding from the Sports Lottery and the European Regional Development Fund to develop a Sailing and Events Centre.\nEvents.\nPwllheli Sailing Club is a host to national and international sailing events.\nSee the PlasHeli Events Calendar\nRacing.\nThe club hosts racing for local and visiting boats all year round. The races generally start from the bridge on the treatment plant building opposite the lifeboat station and take place around buoys in Cardigan Bay within a couple of miles of the start.\nThe club has a committee boat used to start and finish special regattas and a number of offshore races."

In 1922 this became the Rugby Football League.\nThe Rugby League Heritage Centre was opened at the George Hotel on 30 August 2005 by former players Billy Boston, Neil Fox and Mick Sullivan. The centre featured displays of memorabilia, including rare jerseys, medals, caps, programmes and photographs owned by Mike Stephenson.\nIn 2013, the hotel was sold. The sporting charity, Rugby League Cares, was given £97,200 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to secure the collection. The collection was put on tour and in storage until a new location could be arranged.\nIn 2016, plans were announced for a new National Rugby League Museum, based in nearby Bradford, to succeed the Heritage Centre, however these plans never reached fruition, Odsal Stadium redevelopment plans shelved."

He tied for the lead with Shigeki Maruyama, who bogeyed the 18th hole and shot 68. Ernie Els had four consecutive birdies in a round of 67. Jeff Maggert was in solo third at five-under-par with a 67, while Fred Funk and Retief Goosen both shot 66 to tie for fourth. Ángel Cabrera had a crazy day after a 66 to shoot a 71. Corey Pavin, the previous champion at Shinnecock in 1995, tied with Vijay Singh at four strokes back. Tiger Woods shot 69 for 141 (+1), tied for 18th. World Number 4 Davis Love III missed the cut, as did David Duval.\nJay Haas (E) and amateur Bill Haas (+5) were the second father and son to make the cut in the same U.S. Open; it was first accomplished 46 years earlier in 1948 by Joe Kirkwood Sr. and Joe Kirkwood Jr.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 19, 2004\"\nRetief Goosen battled his way into a two-shot lead on Saturday as Shinnecock Hills presented its stiffest test of the week. He held his nerve in challenging conditions to card a one-under 69 for 205 (−5), and was one of only three to break par. Second round leader Phil Mickelson bogeyed the last two holes for a share of second place with two-time champion Ernie Els. Fred Funk and Shigeki Maruyama both had crazy days, finishing poorly for a tie for fourth. Jeff Maggert's 74 dropped him into a tie for sixth with Tim Clark, who had 66, the best of the day; Tiger Woods eagled the 18th for 73 and Vijay Singh stumbled with \nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 20, 2004\"\nRetief Goosen held his nerve and won his second U.S. Open, edging out Phil Mickelson by two shots with a closing 71 (+1) on Sunday to finish at four-under 276. Conditions were brutal on the final day when the average final-round score was 78.7 and no one was Mickelson, urged on by raucous New York galleries on a windswept sunny afternoon, completed a matching 71 for his third runner-up spot in the last six U.S. Opens. Goosen led by two going into the final day, but was overtaken by Mickelson in the closing stretch, with back-to-back birdies on 15 and 16. But Mickelson, bidding to become the sixth player to win the first two majors of the year, immediately fell back with a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, three-putting from . In the final pair with compatriot Ernie Els, Goosen restored his two-shot advantage with a birdie putt on 16 and parred the final two holes to seal \nIn a nearly unprecedented action, the USGA watered a few of the greens during play including the 7th green when players were not able to prevent the ball from rolling off. As a result, the leaders faced much easier playing conditions than the rest of the field and the final 5 groups had a scoring average of 75.9, compared to the field's 78.7, including 3 of the 5 lowest rounds of the day.\nJeff Maggert (72) finished third at one-over 281, while 2003 Masters champion Mike Weir (74) and Shigeki Maruyama (76) were three shots further back at 284 in a tie for fourth. World number two Els, joint second overnight with Mickelson, produced four double-bogeys on his way to an 80 (+10), his worst score in a U.S. Open, and tied for ninth at 287. Top-ranked Tiger Woods, who began nine shots off the battled to a 76 and a share of 17th place. A mix of five bogeys, a double-bogey and a birdie at the last left him at 290 (+10) as he narrowly avoided his worst round at a His career high of 77 came as an amateur in 1996, in the third round at Oakland Hills. Robert Allenby had the low round of the day at even-par 70; three birdies and three bogeys lifted him into a tie for seventh with Steve Flesch at six-over 286; Fred Funk (77) was alone in sixth on 285.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "Ian Smith (rugby union, born 1903)",
        "text": "Ian Scott Smith (31 October 1903 – 18 September 1972) was a rugby union wing who played 32 Tests for Scotland and two Tests for the British Isles. Born in Melbourne, Australia, and brought up in New Zealand, Smith moved to England and was educated at Winchester College, before studying at Oxford University and later Edinburgh University. At Oxford he took up rugby and was eventually selected for Scotland, for whom he was eligible because of his Scottish parents. He toured with the British Isles (now known as the British and Irish Lions) to South Africa in 1924, and played all four matches in Scotland's first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1925. He represented Scotland until 1933 when he captained them in their Triple Crown winning season. His 24 international tries, all scored in the Five Nations or Home Nations, was an international record until 1987 and a record for the Five/Six Nations until 2011. This record stood for 88 years until 2021, when it was broken by Stuart Hogg.\nBiography.\nSmith was born in Melbourne in Australia in 1903, but was brought up in New Zealand. He was educated at Winchester College, where they did not play rugby, and then went to Oxford University. It was at Oxford that he was persuaded to play rugby by GPS Macpherson. Up until then he had only played association football. Macpherson captained Oxford when Smith played in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1923 – Smith scored two tries in Oxford's victory.\nSmith had Scottish parents and ancestors from the Borders region, and so was eligible to play for Scotland. He was first capped for Scotland when he faced Wales on 2 February 1924, and he scored three tries on Test debut; a 35–10 victory. He played in Scotland's remaining 1924 Five Nations matches – against Ireland and a Calcutta Cup match against England – although he was unable to score again. In 1924 he was invited to play for the Barbarians for their annual encounter with East Midlands for the Mobbs Memorial Match. Smith scored one of five tries for the Barbarians during the game to win 15–3. He played in a total of six matches for the Barbarians, including five games during the club's 1923 and 1924 Easter tours.\nIn the second half of 1924 he was selected to tour South Africa with the British Isles. It was on this tour that the British Isles were first given the \"Lions\" nickname. Smith played in the first two Tests of the tour, both of them lost. He also played four non-Test matches during the tour, including one against Rhodesia where he scored two tries. Rowe Harding, an opponent with Wales and a team-mate with the 1924 Lions, reckoned Smith to be the \"greatest wing of all time\".\nIn 1925 Smith played in all four of Scotland's Five Nations matches. The first was against France at Inverleith, where Smith scored four tries, and helped them to win 25–4. He then played against Wales at Swansea and scored another four tries; Scotland again won, this time 24–14. Their third game of the Championship was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, and although Smith was unable to score this time, Scotland still won 14–8. Scotland's last match of the Championship was against England at Murrayfield Stadium. This was the first match ever played at Murrayfield, and was watched by over 70,000 spectators. Although Smith did not score himself, he was involved in a crucial Scottish try: the ball was passed through several hands before Smith passed to Johnnie Wallace who scored in the right-hand corner. English supporters claimed Smith had put his foot into touch, but the Welsh referee disagreed and awarded the try. Eventually Scotland triumphed 14–11 to go undefeated and claim their first ever Five Nations Grand Slam. Smith's eight tries for a single Championship equalled the record set by Cyril Lowe in 1914 and remains an individual record as of 2014.\nSmith continued to play for Scotland throughout the 1920s. He played all four Scotland matches in the 1926 Five Nations, and scored two tries against England at Twickenham; his only tries of the Championship. He played three matches in 1927, this times scoring four tries, two against France and two against England. In both 1926 and 1927 Scotland shared the Five Nations Championship with Ireland. Smith did not play in 1928, but returned in 1929, when Scotland won the Five Nations again. He played all four matches, and scored three tries, two against England.\nIn 1930 Smith played three Five Nations' matches, missing the England game, and did not score any tries. He did play all four matches in 1931, and scored his only tries of the Championship in the game against England. This was the fourth time he scored two tries in a match against England. In January 1932 Smith played for Scotland against South Africa, which was won 6–3 by South Africa. By 1932 France had been ejected from the Championship due to allegations of professionalism, and the four Home Nations returned to only playing one another for the International Championship. Smith played all three matches in 1932, but scored only once, against England.\nIn 1933, Smith captained Scotland for the Home Nations Championship. Because of his background of playing association football, teammate James Henderson said of Smith:\nSmith played in all three matches during the Championship, and scored one try when they played Wales in February. They played Ireland last after the planned match had been cancelled because of a blizzard. They won the match 8–6 and secured the Championship and the Triple Crown. It was Smith's last match for Scotland.\nSmith studied accounting at the University of Edinburgh, and served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps during the Second World War. Following the war he practised law, before retiring to Kelso in the Scottish Borders. In 2013 Smith was included in the second group of inductees into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame.\nRugby writer Richard Bath wrote of him:\nStatistics and character.\nSmith played a total of 32 Tests for Scotland, and scored 24 tries, which still gives him a share of second place in the Scottish try record with Tony Stanger. Smith's record for international tries was not beaten until 1987 when it was overtaken by Australian David Campese. Remarkably, Smith's first 17 tries were scored in only 14 Test matches. His 24 career tries in the Five Nations – now Six Nations – remained a record until first equalled and then surpassed by Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll in 2011. Smith spent much of his playing career playing in the backline with GPS Macpherson; 21 of Smith's 24 Scotland tries were scored outside the three-quarter Macpherson. When Smith scored four tries against France in 1925, Macpherson contributed to all those scores.\nAuthor Richard Bath wrote:"

        "text": "The 1994 State of Origin series saw the 13th year that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Mark Coyne's completion of a miraculous team effort by Queensland to snatch victory in the dying seconds of Game I has become a featured moment in Origin folklore. In Game II a crowd of 87,000 flocked to the MCG setting a new Australian rugby league crowd record. In Game III New South Wales won their first ever Lang Park decider, spoiling Mal Meninga's farewell Origin match.\nGame I.\nFor 75 minutes New South Wales were the better side and led 12-4 as a trickle of spectators began to make an early exit to beat the traffic. Those that left missed one of the greatest rugby league miracles of all time. With five minutes to go Willie Carne scored for Queensland reaching over his head to take a pass from centre Mark Coyne. Maroons captain Mal Meninga kicked the conversion but the Blues defence rallied from the kick-off and they kept the Queenslanders pinned in their own quarter as the clock ticked down.\nWith 60 seconds remaining and trailing 12-10 Queensland launched one last attacking wave from deep inside their own half. Halfback Allan Langer initiated the play, firing a long ball to Kevin Walters. The five-eighth passed to Willie Carne, whose overhead pass released Steve Renouf. The Test centre raced up-field as suddenly the tension rose.\nThe Maroons threw a rapid-fire series of chain passes spanning the breadth of the SFS. The Blues' defence gathered in numbers but as each Queensland player met a tackler he would find another man at his outside shoulder. Renouf, Michael Hancock, Darren Smith, Langer and Mal Meninga all handled and suddenly Mark Coyne was accepting a pass metres out as Brad Fittler and Ricky Stuart tried in vain to bring Coyne down only to see him slide to the line, reach out and score.\nTelevision commentator Ray Warren famously exclaimed, \"That's not a try—that's a miracle!\" Fittler buried his head in the turf, Stuart in frustration kicked the corner post sky-high and the New South Wales crowd were plunged into deathly silence with 32 seconds left on the clock and the game gone.\nGame II.\nThe Blues headed to the Melbourne Cricket Ground full of confidence but with a game plan dictated by coach Phil Gould to play it tight and close despite the massive crowd of novice Melburnian rugby league followers hoping to see a flowing spectacle. The MCG attendance of 87,161 was, at that time, the highest ever for a rugby league match in Australia.\nBen Elias laid on the first try, confusing Queensland with some sleight of hand and picking up prop Glenn Lazarus on the burst. With two goals from their fullback Tim Brasher, New South Wales led 8-0 at half-time due to their steely defence and mistake-free football. The Blues wrapped up the match when centre Paul \"Mary\" McGregor accepted a reverse pass from Stuart and strolled through to clinch a 14-0 win.\nGame III.\nNew South Wales arrived at Lang Park for game III having never won a decider there to claim a series. The Queensland crowd's sentiment was focussed on farewelling their hero Mal Meninga in his last Origin and record 38th appearance in a Queensland jumper.\nNew South Wales built an early lead with tries to the Canberra trio of Bradley Clyde, Laurie Daley and Brett Mullins who along with half-back Ricky Stuart were out to spoil the occasion for their club captain and friend Meninga. Queensland's nervousness supplied two vital intercepts to allow the tries. The first was taken by hooker Ben Elias off Langer and quickly given to Clyde who scored. The second came when Steve Renouf threw a diabolical pass towards winger Willie Carne. Mullins, then one of the fastest men in the game swooped on the ball and raced 40 metres to score. Daley chipped in with his own gilt-edged contribution, a try in which he sidestepped and swerved his way past five would-be tacklers from 15 metres out.\nA try to Queensland forward Andrew Gee cut the lead back to 18-6 at the break. With serious injuries suffered by Jason Smith and Willie Carne there was to be no trademark Queensland revival. Smith suffered a broken jaw following a head clash with Ian Roberts and Carne was carried from the field on a stretcher. Elias kicked a field-goal in the second-half give New South Wales a comfortable buffer even after Steve Renouf's try made the score 19-12 after 55 minutes. In what would be his own final Origin match after 19 career appearances Elias booted the second of three field goals two minutes from full-time, ensuring at least his farewell rather than Mal Meninga's, would be a victor's.\nIt was a courageous series effort by New South Wales who for the first time in their Origin history came back from a Game I loss to clinch the series and for the first time ever claimed three successive series victories."

        "text": "The Georgetown Hoyas women's lacrosse team competes in the Big East Conference, an NCAA Division I conference. The first team was formed in 1977.\nCurrent team.\nThe current head coach is Ricky Fried, who took over after Kim Simons retired following the 2004 season. Previously, Fried held the positions of assistant coach from 2002 to 2003 and associate head coach from 2003 to 2004, both under Simons.\nThe current assistant coaches are Erin Wellner-Hellmold and Michi Ellers. Hellmold played for Fried at Johns Hopkins University. Ellers played under Simons, with Fried as assistant coach, at Georgetown from 2002 to 2004.\nHistory.\nThe Georgetown Women's Lacrosse team advanced to two National Championship games in 2001 and 2002. The team appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA tournaments from 1998 to 2006 and advanced to 3 NCAA Final Four games in 2001, 2002, and 2004. The team had an undefeated record in the Big East from 2001 to 2006, earning them 6 consecutive Conference Championships. In 2007, the women's lacrosse team was defeated by Syracuse University in the first ever Big East women's lacrosse tournament. However, the Hoyas had previously been crowned the Big East Regular-Season Champions.\n2006 season.\nIn 2006, the Georgetown Women's lacrosse team continued to be a household name on the national scene. The team started the 2006 season ranked number 10/12 in National Polls and climbed all the way to earn the number 3 seed in their ninth straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Key regular season wins over Princeton, North Carolina, Maryland and Notre Dame continued to give the Hoyas a strong reputation as the women's game grows across the country. The Hoyas posted a 14-4 overall record, won its sixth straight Big East Conference Championship and made its eighth consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament Quarterfinals. The Hoyas defense ranked second in the nation allowing just 7.0 goals per game. During the 2006 season, the team posted a 4–1 record in a program-high five overtime games. Additionally, the squad had a 5–2 record in games decided by one goal.\nNew to the coaching staff in 2006, was assistant coach Michi Ellers, a former Georgetown player from 2000 to 2004.

Georgetown finished the 2005 season with a 13-5 overall record and a perfect 5–0 mark in the Big East. The team earned its fifth consecutive Big East Championship, continuing its undefeated record in the conference. This was Ricky Fried's first year as head coach of the team and Bowen Holden's first year as associate head coach. This was Erin Wellner's first year as assistant coach. The team was led by Captains Lauryn Bernier, Allison Chambers and Sarah Oliphant.\n2004 season.\nThe Hoyas continued to be undefeated Big East with a spotless 6-0 conference record in 2004.

        "title": "1959 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 1959 First 500 Mile NASCAR International Sweepstakes at Daytona (now known as the 1959 Inaugural Daytona 500) was the second race of the 1959 NASCAR Grand National Series season. It was held on February 22, 1959, in front of 41,921 spectators. It was the first race held at the 2.5-mile (4.0 kilometer) Daytona International Speedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that was one of the first superspeedways to hold NASCAR races. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd. The speedway is currently owned and operated by the International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nRace report.\nQualifying.\nCotton Owens had the fastest qualifying lap, at . The race had one qualifying race for Convertibles and one for the hardtop Grand National cars. Bob Welborn, winner of the Grand National qualifying race earlier in the week, started on the pole position. Shorty Rollins won the Convertible qualifying race and started second. Twenty of the 59 cars in the Daytona 500 were convertibles.\nRace.\nThere were no caution periods in the race; making it one of the few \"perfect games\" in NASCAR history, though it would occur in three of the first four Daytona 500s, as the Daytona 500 also went caution-free in both 1961 and 1962. This would be repeated ten years later with the 1969 running of the Motor Trend 500. Welborn led the early laps in the race but his race ended after 75 laps (of 200) with engine problems. Other leaders in the first 22 laps of the race were \"Tiger\" Tom Pistone and Joe Weatherly. Fireball Roberts took over the lead on lap 23, leading the next 20 laps before dropping out on lap 57 due to a broken fuel pump. When Roberts went to the pits on lap 43, Johnny Beauchamp, running in second place, became the leader. On lap 50, Pistone took over first place and Jack Smith moved into second; Beauchamp was third and Lee Petty was fifth. From lap 43 to 148 the race leaders were Pistone, Smith, and Beauchamp. Although Smith and Pistone led most of these laps, Beauchamp led a few times, for example records show he led on lap 110. There is print information about the details of the race, including the leaders of the race in five-lap intervals. Pistone and Jack Smith both had dropped out of contention by lap 149 and Beauchamp took over first place. . Richard Petty also had to retire from the race with an engine problem and earned $100 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for his 57th-place performance.\nLee Petty battled with Beauchamp during the final 30 laps of the race, and they were the only two drivers to finish on the lead lap. Petty took the lead with 3 laps left and led at the start of the final lap. Petty and Beauchamp drove side by side across the finish line at the end final lap for a photo finish. Beauchamp was declared the unofficial winner by NASCAR officials, and he drove to victory lane. Petty protested the results, saying \"I had Beauchamp by a good two feet. In my own mind, I know I won.\" Beauchamp replied \"I had him by two feet. I glanced over to Lee Petty's car as I crossed the finish line and I could see his headlight slightly back of my car. It was so close I didn't know how they would call it, but I thought I won.\" Early leader Fireball Roberts, who was standing by the finish line, said: \"There's no doubt about it, Petty won.\" It took NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. three days to decide the winner the following Wednesday. In the end, with the help of photographs and newsreel footage, Petty was officially declared the winner.\nThe controversial finish helped the sport. The delayed results to determine the official winner kept NASCAR and the Daytona 500 on the front page of newspapers.\nOfficial results.\nThe race lasted 3:41:22, with an average speed of 135.521 mph (218.10 km/h)."

        "text": "William Yale Giles (born September 7, 1934) is the honorary National League (NL) President, and chairman emeritus and former part-owner of Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Philadelphia Phillies.\nEarly career.\nGiles is the son of Baseball Hall of Fame executive Warren C. Giles, who was the general manager and president of the Cincinnati Reds (1937–1951) before becoming president of the National League (1951–1969). His mother Jane Mabel Skinner was the granddaughter of architect Merton Yale Cady, and a member of the family of John Deere, founder of John Deere Co., and of Linus Yale Sr. of the Yale Lock Company. \nBill Giles was born in Rochester, New York, during his father's term as president of Rochester Red Wings of the International League. His baseball career began in the Cincinnati organization during the 1950s, and he was among a group of Reds' executives (including former Cincinnati general manager Gabe Paul and MLB executive Tal Smith) who helped to found the Houston Astros when they debuted as the \"Colt .45s\" in 1962. \n\"Sporting News\"' \"1962 Official Baseball Guide and Record Book,\" published in the Colt .45s' maiden season, lists Giles as the club's traveling secretary and publicity director. Subsequently, he became promotions director, and focused on that role after the renamed team moved into the Astrodome in 1965.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nGiles started with the Phillies as the vice president of business operations in 1969. He worked his way up in the organization, with stops as executive vice president and president, before becoming the chairman in 1997. He was succeeded as chairman by David Montgomery and became chairman emeritus in 2015.\nGiles was also part of the ownership group that bought the Phillies from the Carpenter family in 1981, heirs of the Du Pont family fortune. The group was composed of Giles, Claire S. Betz, Tri-Play Associates (Alexander K. Buck, J. Mahlon Buck Jr. and William C. Buck), and Double Play Inc. (John S. Middleton). Mahlon Buck died in 2011. Claire S. Betz died in 2014. The group reportedly purchased the team for $30 million. In 2023, the team was valued at 2.8 billion dollars.\nAround 2012 or 2013, Giles sold his last shares of the Phillies. He owned at one point about 20% of the team.\nNational League honorary president.\nGiles is also honorary president of the National League—the same job his father held on an official full-time basis. One of the honorary president's tasks is to present the Warren C. Giles Trophy, named after his father, to the National League Championship Series winner.\nOther duties of the honorary league president include representing the league at the All-Star Game and the postseason.\nHonors and awards.\nIn 2001, a new tournament for the Division II baseball teams in the Philadelphia area, the Bill Giles Invitational, was named in his honor.\nPersonal.\nHis wife, Nancy, died on April 12, 2020."

        "text": "Fred Harrison Cook III (born April 15, 1952) is a former American football player. He played defensive end for the Baltimore Colts from 1974 through 1980.\nHigh School and college.\nCook played high school football for Our Lady of Victory in Mississippi, and to date is the only player from that school to make it to the pro level. Cook played college football for Southern Mississippi. Upon entering the university, Cook was one of the first African-Americans to play for the football program. After playing well on the freshman team, Cook was promoted to the varsity football team. He was a starter as a sophomore, ending the season with 68 tackles and 18 quarterback sacks, both school records. Graduation took apart the front line, as Cook was the lone returning starter for the 1972 season. The team only managed three wins, but Cook was still a dominant force, recording 19 sacks and 122 tackles. In 1974, his senior season, his tackles diminished, but he still lead the team in quarterback sacks. Cook was third-team All-American and played in both the senior bowl and Blue-Gray games.\nPro career.\nCook was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the second round of the 1972 National Football League draft. The Colts had fallen on hard times. In 1974, under head coach Howard Schnellenberger the team was terrible, going 2-12, only getting wins versus the New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons. In 1975, the Colts had a new head coach in Ted Marchibroda and improved to 10–4. Cook started all 14 games, just as he did as a rookie the previous season. Cook picked off a Steve Grogan pass for his first career interception in the Colts 34–21 over the New England Patriots. Cook also scored the only touchdown of his career when he returned a fumble recovery for a score in another game that season. The Colts qualified for the playoffs three times during Cook's career, but they lost in each appearance. One of those was the \"Ghost To The Post\" game in which Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler hit tight end Dave Casper for the winning touchdown in the final minutes of the game. Oakland won 37–31.\nCook was a full-time starter in each of his seasons with the Colts, playing in 104 games for the franchise. On July 19, 1981, the Colts traded Cook, who was pending to be a free agent, to the Washington Redskins for a few draft picks. However, Cook was dealing injuries and never played for Washington.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2009, Southern Mississippi inducted Cook into their legends club. The club consist of former players, many of whom went on to careers in the NFL. Brett Favre, Ray Guy, Reggie Collier, and Sammy Winder are among the players in the club. When Hurricane Katrina struck Mississippi, Cook's elementary school was completely destroyed, and he himself lost two cars. He also lost the son of a friend to suicide not long after the storm. Though the losses left him battling depression, Cook vowed to not let it get him down. Not long after the storm, he returned to Baltimore for an alumni reunion."

        "text": "Ninety-three Major League Baseball All-Star Games have been played since the inaugural one in 1933. The American League (AL) leads the series with a record, and a 383–377 run advantage. The NL has the longest winning streak of 11 games from 1972 to 1982; the AL held a 13-game unbeaten streak from 1997 to 2009 (including a tie in 2002). The AL previously dominated from 1933 to 1949, winning 12 of the first 16. The NL dominated from 1950 to 1987, going 33–8–1, including a stretch from 1963 to 1982 when they won 19 of 20. Since 1988, the AL has dominated, going 27–7–1. In 2018, the AL took their first lead in the series since 1963.\nThe \"home team\" has traditionally been the league in which the host franchise plays its games; however, the AL was designated the home team for the 2016 All-Star Game, despite it being played in Petco Park, home of the National League's San Diego Padres. This decision was made following the announcement of Miami as host for the 2017 All-Star Game, which was the third consecutive year in which the game is hosted in an NL ballpark. The criteria for choosing the venue are subjective; for the most part, cities with new parks and cities who have not hosted the game in a long time—or ever—tend to get the nod. In the first two decades of the game there were two pairs of teams that shared ballparks, located in Philadelphia and St. Louis. This led to some shorter-than-usual gaps between the use of those venues: The Cardinals hosted the game in 1940, and the Browns in 1948. The Athletics hosted the game in 1943, and the Phillies in 1952.\nA second game was played for four seasons, from 1959 through 1962. The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award was introduced in and the first recipient was Maury Wills of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 2008 game featured the longest All-Star Game by time: 4 hours 50 minutes, and tied for innings at 15 with the 1967 game.\nFuture MLB All-Star Games.\nThe following future games have had their date and location announced by Major League Baseball."

The Broncos defense was in the bottom half of yards allowed, ranked 23rd, but were 5th in the league in sacks in 2011.\nOakland Raiders.\nOn January 24, 2012, Oakland Raiders' general manager Reggie McKenzie hired Allen as the team's 18th head coach. He was the first Raiders defense-oriented head coach since John Madden's retirement after the 1978 season, because the team's longtime former owner Al Davis (until his death during the 2011 season) preferred offensive-minded head coaches.\nIn his first season as head coach, the Raiders struggled as they finished the 2012 season with a record of 4–12. That offseason, the Raiders were facing salary cap problems and had traded away most of their draft picks prior to Allen's arrival, which did not allow him to establish his system with the right players. In the middle of the 2013 season, Allen decided to bench quarterback Terrelle Pryor (who was injured) for undrafted rookie Matt McGloin, in hopes of salvaging the rest of the season. Later, Pryor continued to be benched although he was healthy enough to return.\nOn September 29, 2014, following a 38–14 loss to the Miami Dolphins and beginning the 2014 NFL season with 4 straight losses, Allen was fired.\nNew Orleans Saints (second stint).\nThe Saints rehired Allen as senior defensive assistant on January 20, 2015. After Rob Ryan was fired later in the season, on November 16, Allen was promoted to defensive coordinator. On November 29, Allen's first game as defensive coordinator, the Saints were defeated by the Houston Texans 24–6. His defense gave up 362 yards while recording one sack and one interception in the loss.\nIn 2021, Allen briefly stepped in for Sean Payton as head coach of the Saints after Payton tested positive for COVID-19. Allen served as head coach during the Saints' Week 15 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where the Saints defeated the Buccaneers on \"Sunday Night Football\", 9–0.\nFollowing Sean Payton's retirement on January 25, Allen was promoted to head coach of the New Orleans Saints on February 8, 2022. On December 10, the NFL fined Allen $100,000 for defensive end Cameron Jordan faking an injury in the Week 13 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nPersonal life.\nHis father Grady Allen was also a standout linebacker for the Aggies and later in the NFL for the Falcons. Dennis and his wife, Alisson, have a son, Garrison, and a daughter, Layla."

        "title": "Wood (golf)",
        "text": "A wood is a type of club used in the sport of golf. Woods have longer shafts and larger, rounder heads than other club types, and are used to hit the ball longer distances than other types.\nWoods are so called because, traditionally, they had a club head that was made from hardwood, generally persimmon, but modern clubs have heads made from metal, for example titanium, or composite materials, such as carbon fiber. Some golf enthusiasts refer to these as \"metals\" or \"metal woods\" but this change in terminology is not strictly necessary, because while the material has changed, the style and intended use has not. The change to stronger materials has allowed the design of the modern woods to incorporate significantly larger heads than in the past. Because of the increase in club head size, in 2004, the USGA created a new stipulation for the size of the club head. The legal maximum volume displacement of any clubhead (by the rules of golf) is \nWoods are numbered in ascending order starting with the driver, or 1-wood, which has the lowest loft (usually between 9 and 13 degrees), and continuing with progressively higher lofts and numbers. Most modern woods are sold as individual clubs allowing the player to customize their club set, but matched sets of woods, especially as part of a complete club set, are readily available. Odd-numbered lofts are most common in players' bags, though 2- and 4-woods are available in many model lines. The number of the club is mainly a reference for the player to easily identify the clubs; the actual loft angle of a particular number varies between manufacturers, and there is often some overlap of lofts (one 3-wood might be higher-lofted than a 4-wood of a different brand or model). Other identifiers have been utilized such as \"strong\" and \"plus\" to differentiate various lofts within a line of clubs.\nWoods generally fall into two classes, drivers and fairway woods, with a traditional set of clubs including a driver and one or two fairway woods (usually numbered 3 and 5). Many modern sets tend to include hybrid clubs, which combine some of the characteristics of a wood and an iron, to replace the 5 wood and low-lofted irons.\nDuring the 2010's, golf club producers popularized the idea of woods and hybrids that can be adjusted by the player to provide different settings, such as lofts.\nDrivers.\nThe 1-wood, or \"driver\", is the lowest-lofted, longest, and often lightest club in a player's bag, and is meant to launch the ball the longest distance of any club. Originally, the driver was only slightly larger than any other wood and was designed to be used from the tee or the fairway, but with the advent of hollow metal clubhead construction, the driver has become highly specialized for use off the tee by incorporating an oversized head and a deep striking face to maximize the \"sweet spot\" that gives the best results. It is possible to hit a modern driver off the fairway turf, but it requires a high degree of skill and a certain amount of luck regarding the lie of the ball. Certain 2-woods are available with a similar deep-faced design but a higher loft, which can be used in situations when a player needs slightly less distance than their average drive, or must make a driver-distance shot from the fairway or rough. However, 2-woods of any kind are uncommon, as a player in these situations will more often opt for the 3-wood, and save the space in the bag for a less specialised club like a wedge or hybrid.\nThe driver has become the most expensive single club of the modern clubset, largely due to the high emphasis placed on a player's drive distance; a longer drive gets the ball closer to the green in fewer strokes allowing for better chances of a birdie or eagle. While drivers are available cheaply, these are mainly marketed at junior players; drivers marketed to adult amateur players are an order of magnitude more expensive, with custom-made clubs for high-end players and touring professionals costing one or two additional orders of magnitude (in the case of prototype or preproduction clubs supplied by a sponsor club-maker). As a comparison, the upper end of the retail drivers is comparable to the price of an entire matched set of irons, and the next most expensive single clubs, the putter and the fairway woods.\nDriver customization.\nWith such high emphasis on drive distance and accuracy by players wanting to \"play like the pros\", a large amount of customization is available in drivers in order to provide the club configuration that best matches the player's specific swing mechanics. Club-makers generally provide for selection and/or customization of five things: the shaft flex, which determines how energy is stored and released during the player's swing; the loft angle, which is a determinant of launch angle and backspin; the offset, which determines the angle the clubface will have to the ball at impact; the clubhead mass, which can \"fine-tune\" the clubhead behaviour for a player's swing tempo; and the centre of mass, which is also a factor in launch angle and backspin.\nThese customizations are typically grouped in certain common configurations. A player with a correct swing of average strength (clubhead speeds about 85–100 mph at impact) will generally want a driver with a regular-flex shaft, 10.5° loft, a low offset (0–2°) towards a closed face (angled toward the player), and a low centre of gravity. This has generally been shown to provide the best overall distance and flight behaviour from an average swing, and drivers with this configuration are widely available. Drivers with a low closed offset or no offset are often called \"game improvement\" drivers or simply \"regular\" drivers. Ladies and seniors typically have slower swing speeds (60–85 mph), and so to maximise distance, it is important to increase \"hang time\" so that the lower horizontal velocity at launch can carry the ball farther. These players generally benefit from a more flexible shaft and a higher loft angle; this combination \"times\" the release of stored energy in the shaft to the slower swing, and the increased loft will launch the ball higher and increase backspin to improve flight time. The standard women's driver has a 13° loft and \"Lady\"-flex shaft, while senior men's drivers average 11° and have an \"intermediate\"- or \"senior\"-flex shaft.\nPlayers with problems slicing their drive shots (for a right-hander, a slice starts straight and curves to the right) may benefit from an additional closed offset of 3–4°, which will help square the clubface to the ball during the swing. This is typically referred to as a \"max game improvement\" driver, sometimes as a \"draw driver\" because a player with a correct swing using such a driver will draw their shots (for a right-hander, a \"draw\" starts straight but curves left).\nA player with a stronger-than-average swing (&gt;100 mph at impact) will typically want a stiff-flex shaft and a lower loft, around 9.5°, which will respond better to the faster swing tempo and will launch the ball lower so the energy is spent sending the ball outward instead of keeping it in the air. The same player might also benefit from a \"Tour driver\", which has a 1–2° offset to \"open\" the clubface (angle it away from the player), and a higher, further-rearward centre of mass. These changes can correct certain problems with a strong swing, such as torquing in the clubhead \"closing\" it at impact causing draws, and the normally low and forward centre of gravity causing excessive backspin which can make drives \"balloon\"; the shot will start low but curve upwards in flight, then \"stall\" and drop onto the turf, reducing total distance. Most stiff driver shafts are marked usually X-Stiff or even more. These are commonly professional-level stiffnesses due to the rarity of amateur players capable of hitting swing speeds over 110 mph, although these also occur sometimes.\nThe furthest shooting drivers of all are long-drive-clubs, which may have a 48-inch shaft. This is the maximum legal shaft length in golf. Maximum length shafts are unpopular even in professional golf, due to the shot inconsistency and smaller error margin they provide.\nFairway woods.\nHigher-number woods are generally known as \"fairway woods\" and, as their name suggests, are designed for shots from off the turf of the fairway that still require long distance, such as the second shot of a par-5 or a long par-4 hole. They have two important features: a higher loft to lift the ball out of the turf and over low obstacles like hills, and a shallower face height which allows a player to hit a ball from the ground using the exact center of the club, providing greater distance for such shots. These two design features enable players to hit fairway woods off the ground with greater ease than modern deep-faced drivers. Fairway woods are also useful off the tee depending on the hole; players may for instance wish to play their tee shot short (known as \"laying up\") due to a dogleg or a hazard in range of their driver, and will opt instead for their 3-wood. Fairway woods are typically made with a slightly shorter and stiffer shaft, a smaller clubhead and more loft than a driver or 2-wood.\nWhile the most common modern clubset includes only one fairway wood, the 3-wood, woods are typically available from major brands in lofts up to a 9-wood. A 4-wood is sometimes seen instead of a 3-wood (to fine-tune range differences between a player's driver and fairway wood), while a 5-wood is a common addition to the 3-wood for players who prefer fairway woods to long irons for play through the green. 7-woods are rarer in men's clubs but more common in ladies' and seniors' sets, again as a substitute for lower-lofted irons which are difficult to hit well and whose low launch angle can be risky on a hilly or undulating fairway. Some custom clubmakers offer woods in lofts up to 55° (a \"25-wood\" equivalent to a sand wedge); these can be used to replace the entire standard set of irons with woods, for players who prefer the swing mechanics and behavior of woods to that of irons and wedges.\nDesign.\nThe head of a wood is roughly spherical in shape with a slightly bulging clubface and a generally flattened sole that slides over the ground without digging in during the swing. Traditional \"wood\" clubheads were made of wood, hence the name; beech wood or ash were common prior to the twentieth century, and later persimmon or maple became preferable. Modern club heads are usually hollow steel, titanium or composite materials, and are sometimes called \"metalwoods\" or more recently \"fairway metals\". Pinseeker Golf Corp. innovated the first stainless steel metalwood called the Bombshell in 1976. The design was somewhat untraditional and did not have the promotional success needed for profitable long term marketing - it was discontinued 3 years later. In 1979 Taylor Made produced a traditionally shaped stainless steel wood head called \"Pittsburgh Persimmon\" which achieved market acceptance by the mid-1980s. Oversized heads made from aluminum appeared in the mid-1980s but were slow to catch on since their introduction was via independent component manufacturers and not the larger endorsement based club manufacturers. Very large size drivers (300-500cc) arrived with titanium metallurgy which meant reasonable 'headweights' could be achieved with very large thin shelled but strong structures. By the mid-2000s, titanium heads could be made to 1000 cc (Golfsmith Inc made in the mid-2000s). Around this time the USGA decided to limit the size of driver heads to since the rule requiring heads to be of a traditional shape was being unduly stretched. However, during this period the club-making business needed some financial help, so the USGA relaxed the \"traditional shape\" rule while enforcing the new 460cc limit, and new head shapes appeared, such as \"torpedo\" and square/rectangular shapes, to attract the buying public to potentially game improving designs particularly regarding better mishit outcomes.\nThe typical loft for woods ranges from 7.5 to 31 degrees. Driver lofts generally center around 10.5° but the desired loft is very dependent upon the player's swing speed (low swing speeds need higher lofts); men's lofts vary between 8 and 11 degrees while women's drivers are between 10 and 13 degrees, and seniors' lofts trend toward the upper range by gender. The average 3-wood has a 13-16 degree loft (typically 15°) and the average 5-wood has an 18-21 degree loft. Higher lofts than that overlap with irons in distance, but many players prefer high-number woods to low-number irons wherever they can be used as the wood is easier to hit than a \"long iron\". The loft of any given club number varies between manufacturers, model lines, and the target player.\nThe shaft length in woods varies from about , with the current standard length for the driver being , formerly . Graphite shafts are usually preferred for woods due to their light weight, which enables users to generate higher clubhead speeds and thus greater distance. The maximum legal length of a shaft by USGA and R&amp;A rules is , though some woods used in long drive contests have been made with shaft lengths up to long.\nThe face of woods is slightly bulged to counteract the gear effect when the ball hits the face off center. The gear effect causes the ball to spin from hits that are away from the center of the face. The spin contributes a tendency for the ball to have a curved flight path away from the target. The slight bulge of the wood club face tends to counteract the gear effect by slightly changing the direction of the ball to make the flight path of the ball end up closer to the target.\nConstruction.\nShaft.\nThe shaft is the true engine of the wood. Widely overlooked, the proper shaft increases distance and accuracy, while a poor shaft can lead to inconsistent shots, slices, and reduced distance.\nThe oldest shafts for all golf clubs were made of Hickory wood. The shaft was whippy and light, but inconsistent in flex from club to club and quite fragile. Beginning in the 1920s, steel shafts started making an appearance, though the USGA and R&amp;A did not allow their use in sanctioned tournaments until 1929. These shafts traded the lightness and flex of the wood shaft for vastly increased durability and consistency, and were the only type of shaft in general use on any club until the early 1990s. The modern \"graphite\" shaft (technically a carbon-fiber composite material) currently in use today combines advantages of the two older types of shafts; it is lighter and more flexible than either steel or Hickory, while having similar durability as steel, at the cost of slightly reduced shot consistency due to increased torque (though this has vastly improved on recent generations of shafts). Graphite shafts gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s; although the carbon-fiber composite technology had been available since the early 1970s, it was very expensive to produce and nearly impossible to mass-market. Advances in producing, forming and curing composite materials have made carbon fiber much cheaper, and now virtually all new woods, regardless of price, have graphite shafts.\nShaft flex has a very pronounced effect on the power and accuracy of a wood. Every wood is somewhere in between the two extremes of flex, from the extra whippy, to the extra stiff. Whippy shafts are used by those who have low swing speeds and stiff by those who have faster swing speeds. The flex of a shaft allows it to store energy from a player's downswing, and release it as the head makes contact for increased club speed at impact. A shaft that is too stiff cannot be flexed by the golfer during their downswing, which reduces club speed at impact. A shaft that is too whippy will retain some of its stored flex at contact, wasting energy.\nShaft torque is also a concern. Flex and torque are generally related; the more a club can flex, the more it can also twist around its axis (though this is not always the case). A shaft that can torque easily is less forgiving of off-center shots as it will allow the head to twist, causing pulls and pushes. Low-torque shafts resist twisting for more forgiving behavior, but tend to be stiffer and require more power for proper distance. The latest generation of driver shafts combine a flexible shaft with a stiff tip, giving the golfer the required flex to \"whip\" into the ball while reducing clubhead twisting.\nHead.\nWooden heads predominated until the late 1980s. They had evolved to include a metal sole and a metal or plastic faceplate. These wooden headed clubs were dense and heavy, and were generally much smaller than today's clubheads. Their smaller surface area also made consistent contact more difficult, as the sweet spot of these clubs was considerably smaller than today's models.\nGary Adams, founder of TaylorMade Golf, is considered the father of the modern metal wood. Adams began to market his club in the late 1970s, but it was nearly a decade until metal woods became more popular with most golfers. Callaway Golf is also largely responsible for the current design of metal woods; the original Big Bertha driver introduced players to the \"oversize\" driver with a larger and deeper clubhead (at the time it was in volume), giving maximum club face and a deeper center of gravity. Callaway Golf continued to expand the size of the clubhead to increase these effects, resulting in the Bigger Bertha, the Great Big Bertha, and others in the line. The current incarnation of the Big Bertha driver is , which is the maximum allowable clubhead volume according to USGA rules, though larger clubheads exist for long-drive contests and informal games.\nToday, many metal wood clubfaces (and most driver clubfaces) are constructed out of titanium. Titanium has a higher strength to weight ratio than steel and has better corrosion resistance, so it is an ideal metal for golf club construction. Manufacturers can also make clubheads with greater volume, which increases the hitting area, and thinner faces, which reduces the weight.\nHosel.\nTraditional woods had a very thick hosel, often wrapped with thin cord, which provided a very secure joint between shaft and head at the cost of a higher center of gravity. Modern metalwoods have largely done away with the hosel altogether, instead anchoring the shaft within the clubhead. This allows as much mass as possible to be contained in the clubhead, lowering the center of gravity."

        "title": "Iron (golf)",
        "text": "An iron is a type of club used in the sport of golf to propel the ball towards the hole. Irons typically have shorter shafts and smaller clubheads than woods, the head is made of solid iron or steel, and the head's primary feature is a large, flat, angled face, usually scored with grooves. Irons are used in a wide variety of situations, typically from the teeing ground on shorter holes, from the fairway or rough as the player approaches the green, and to extract the ball from hazards, such as bunkers or even shallow water hazards.\nIrons are the most common type of club; a standard set of 14 golf clubs will usually contain between 7 and 11 irons, including wedges. Irons are customarily differentiated by a number from 1 to 10 (most commonly 3 to 9) that indicates the relative angle of loft on the clubface, although a set of irons will also vary in clubhead size, shaft length, and hence lie angle as the loft (and number) increase. Irons with higher loft than the numbered irons are called wedges, which are typically marked with a letter indicating their name, and are used for a variety of \"utility\" shots requiring short distances or high launch angles.\nPrior to about 1940, irons were given names rather than numbers. Some of these names, e.g. \"mashie\", \"niblick\", are found in literature of the early twentieth century. Although these clubs and their names are considered obsolete, occasionally a modern club manufacturer will give a new iron the old name.\nDesign and manufacture.\nHistorically all irons were forged from a flat piece of metal, which produced a thin clubhead that resembled a blade. Modern investment casting processes enabled manufacturers to easily mass-produce clubs with consistent properties. This manufacturing process was first used by Ping, and also made it possible to take weight out of the back of the clubhead and distribute it around the perimeter. These perimeter weighted, or cavity back, irons made it much easier to achieve consistent results even when striking the ball outside the \"sweet spot\", when compared with traditional bladed, or \"muscle back\", irons.\nIn 1933, Willie Ogg – who was serving as an advisory staff member for Wilson Staff – created a patented design for distributing weight away from the heel of the club head, moving it towards the \"sweet spot\" of the blade. This design feature was used in the Wilson \"Ogg-mented\" irons, the forerunner of perimeter-weighted or cavity back irons.\nAlthough most irons are now produced by investment casting, many high end iron sets are still produced by forging, as the resulting clubhead is easier to adjust by bending to adapt the set to a player's specific needs. The resulting club is also generally thought to have an improved \"feel\" due to the softer consistency of the forged metal as opposed to cast.\nManufacturers sometimes try to combine the characteristics of both muscle and cavity backed irons, which has resulted in terminology such as \"cut-muscle\", or \"split-cavity\" to describe these designs.\nThere are also many hybrid clubs, so-called because they combine some of the characteristics of irons and woods, that closely resemble standard irons. Many sets of clubs, especially those marketed for beginners, now include hybrids to replace the more traditional 3 and 4 irons.\nMuscle back.\nA muscle back is the more traditional design and consists of a solid metal head, typically made of forged iron. The design of the club typically distributes the metal more evenly around the clubhead (though most designs still place more weight along the sole of the club), which makes the center of mass of the club higher and the moment of inertia (the clubhead's resistance to rotation) lower as compared to newer cavity-backed designs. As such, these clubs are said to have a smaller \"sweet spot\", requiring greater skill and a more consistent swing to make accurate, straight shots. Novice golfers with less consistent swing fundamentals can easily mis-hit these clubs, causing shots to launch or curve off of the intended line of play (such as \"pushing\", \"pulling\", \"slicing\" or \"hooking\").\nCavity back.\nCavity back, or perimeter weighted, irons are usually made by investment casting, which creates a harder metal allowing thinner surfaces while retaining durability, and also allows for more precise placement of metal than forging techniques. Cavity backs are so called because of the cavity created in the rear of the clubhead due to the removal of metal from the center of the clubhead's back, which is then redistributed, most of it very low and towards the toe and heel of the clubhead. This has the general effect of lowering the clubhead's center of mass, placing it underneath that of the ball allowing for a higher launch angle for a given loft. The perimeter weighting also increases the moment of inertia, making the clubhead more resistant to twisting on impact with the ball. The end result is a clubhead with a larger \"sweet spot\" that is more forgiving of slight mis-hits.\nComparison and preference.\nModern clubs generally borrow from both \"muscle-back\" and \"cavity-back\" design features, and fall into a gradient.\nClub sets with more extreme perimeter weighting, giving the clubhead a very wide sole, are typically known as \"game improvement irons\", because they allow novice and casual amateur players to get the ball up in the air more consistently, and make straighter and more accurate shots despite their less consistent ball-striking skill. This generally improves their final score as compared to a round played with harder-to-hit muscle-back designs causing more errant shots and thus more penalty strokes.\nHowever, these same forgiving characteristics can make game improvement irons harder for a skilled golfer to use well. The tendency of the clubs to correct mis-hits will frustrate a golfer's attempts to intentionally hit a curved shot (a \"fade\" or \"draw\"), for instance to avoid an obstacle lying along a straight flight path, or to counter a rightward or leftward slope to the fairway that would make a straight shot roll into the rough. This lack of ability to \"work the ball\" can frustrate a more skilled golfer attempting to place the ball more accurately on the fairway than a novice would normally be concerned with (the novice's primary concern being simply to keep the ball on the fairway in the first place). The increased clubhead mass and lower center of mass can also be incompatible with a more skilled player's stronger swing; the higher mass reduces clubhead speed, while the higher launch angle causes more backspin and wastes the golfer's energy sending the ball up into the air instead of out over the fairway.\nClubs intended for skilled amateurs and professionals, while still incorporating some perimeter-weighting characteristics, generally have less extreme weight distribution, instead placing more weight closer to the center and higher, and reducing overall clubhead mass slightly. This allows the golfer to \"work the ball\" while still giving some advantage based on the lower center of mass as compared to older designs. The slightly reduced mass of some sets also increases clubhead speed allowing for more variation in swing strength and thus carry distance than would be possible with the heavier mass of most game improvement irons.\nComponents.\nClubhead.\nInvestment casting, while allowing for a greater range of design options, produces a very stiff and inflexible head that can be difficult to adjust for a player's desired lie and loft. Forged irons, while they allow for easier and a greater range of adjustments, are limited in the designs that may be achieved.\nThe shaft length of an iron decreases as the iron's number increases; therefore the iron number is inversely proportionate to its length. This reduced length means that a clubhead of the same mass traveling at the same angular velocity (degrees per second, as swung by a golfer) has lower momentum because the clubhead's speed is slower. To combat this, higher-numbered iron clubheads are heavier than lower-numbered iron heads; there is generally a increase in mass between one clubhead and the next higher number.\nDue to the average golfer's desire to hit the ball farther, the loft on modern irons is much less than that on irons from even the late 20th century. For example, a modern 9-iron has comparable loft to a 7-iron from the 1990s. Manufacturers have been able to reduce loft without compromising usability, by moving weight into the sole of the clubhead, thereby lowering the center of gravity and enabling the ball to be launched on a higher trajectory for a given loft than a design with a higher center of mass. Tour professionals now use these same de-lofted clubs, and so the gap in skill and thus in distance between a professional and casual golfer remains.\nOver the years, groove technology has changed the playability of irons. For the past 80 years, little has changed about grooves. However, a new rule by the USGA and the R&amp;A has changed the way that grooves are to be made starting in 2010. In general, the deeper the groove, the more grass can be dispersed behind the ball at impact. This allows control over the amount of spin, which is crucial to flight characteristics of the shot as well as how well received the ball is on the green. The less that is between the ball and the club at impact, the more spin that will be produced which, while decreasing launch trajectory, allows the ball to stop quicker upon hitting the green due to the spin limiting the balls rolling speed at impact. Better players benefit the most from deep, sharp grooves as the more clubhead speed is generated, the more spin the player is able to introduce. By forcing manufacturers to lessen the depth and cut on the grooves, the new rules will penalize shots from longer grass slightly more and put a premium on hitting the fairway.\nHosel.\nFor irons, the hosel, an undefined part of the iron, is very noticeable, forming a barrel shape on the inside face of the club and the \"heel\" of the sole of the club. Many modern irons have a more offset hosel, integrated into the clubhead at a lower point and further from the hitting area of the club. This, combined with the perimeter weighting of modern irons, gives a club with the lowest possible center of gravity and the highest possible usable club face.\nA stroke in which the ball comes directly off the hosel is known as a \"shank\", and the ball will usually veer off almost at right angles to the intended target line.\nShaft.\nThe shaft is the true engine of the iron. A shaft that is perfectly suited to the individual golfer increases distance and improves accuracy, while a poorly suited shaft can lead to inconsistent, wayward shots and reduced distance.\nAlthough graphite shafts, made from composite materials such as carbon fiber, are now standard in woods, especially drivers, shafts for irons are still most often made from steel, which has lower torque than graphite, allowing less clubhead twisting, which gives better accuracy. Graphite shafts are not uncommon for numbered irons however, as the increased distance conferred by the shaft is advantageous to many players, especially shorter hitters such as ladies and seniors. Wedges virtually always have steel shafts as the accuracy and consistency is of primary importance.\nIn a standard set of irons, the higher the number of the iron, the shorter its shaft will be; this allows the player a more controlled and consistent swing with the shorter clubs. The resulting reduction in clubhead velocity is overcome by an increase in clubhead mass. In some sets, every iron has the same length shaft, which enables exactly the same swing to be used for each club; Bryson DeChambeau is one of very few professional tournament golfers to use such a set.\nGrip.\nThe grip covers the top of the shaft enabling the golfer to hold the club comfortably. Modern grips are generally made from rubber, sometimes inlaid with cord, but some players still prefer a traditional leather wrap. Even though materials advances have resulted in more durable, longer-lasting soft grips, they still require frequent replacement as they wear, dry out or harden.\nBy the rules of golf, all iron grips must have a circular cross-section. They may taper from thick to thin along their length (and virtually all do), but are not allowed to have any waisting (a thinner section of the grip surrounded by thicker sections above and below it) or bulges (thicker sections of the grip surrounded by thinner sections). Minor variations in surface texture (such as the natural variation of a \"wrap\"-style grip) are not counted unless significant.\nTypes of irons.\nNumbered irons.\nMost irons in a player's bag are labelled with a number indicating their loft; the higher the number, the higher the loft. A matched set of irons will have a regular, progressive increase in loft through the irons, which may differ from set to set due to other design considerations that can affect launch angle and distance. Irons have been seen ranging in number from 0 through 12, but the most common number range in the modern iron set is 3 to 9.\nDriving iron.\nThe 1 iron, or driving iron, is the lowest lofted and longest iron (14 or 16 degrees of loft), although Wilson did make a 0 iron for John Daly. Often called a butter knife because of how it looks, the 1 iron has the least surface area on its face and so is commonly regarded as the most difficult club in the bag to hit. The driving iron is virtually obsolete as its nominal range easily falls into that of the easier-to-hit fairway woods, although some sets still include one and it can be purchased separately as a custom club. Lee Trevino is famously quoted, after he had been struck by lightning at the 1975 Western Open, that if he were out on the course and it began to storm again he would take out his 1 iron and point it to the sky, \"because even God can't hit a 1 iron.\"\nLong irons.\nThe irons from 2 to 4 are typically called the \"long irons\"; they have the lowest lofts and the longest shafts, and are designed to hit the ball long distances (180-260 yards) with low launch angles. They are typically used from the fairway or rough, but are also useful in trouble spots such as when \"punching out\" from underneath a stand of trees.\nLong irons are traditionally regarded as the most difficult to hit, because their low loft gives them a very small striking face and \"sweet spot\" compared to higher-lofted irons. As such, they are less commonly seen in players' bags, usually replaced with higher-lofted fairway woods like the 5 and 7, or with hybrid clubs that have similar overall performance but are easier to hit. The 2-iron, like the driving iron, is virtually never seen in modern sets, due to both its difficulty and to a \"de-lofting\" of modern cavity-backed irons which increases the average distance of shorter irons. If the long irons are used, they are often seen with graphite shafts to add additional clubhead speed to the average golfer's swing by storing energy from the downswing and releasing it at impact. Hybrid clubs that replace these irons also often have graphite shafts for the same reason.\nThe 5-iron sits on the cusp between \"long\" and \"mid\" irons, and can be thought of as belonging to either class depending on the set and the player's preference; it is used more often and replaced with a hybrid less often than the 2-4, but is still commonly replaced with a hybrid club, especially in ladies' sets.\nMid irons.\nThe irons from 5 to 7 are typically called the \"mid irons\", and are generally used from the fairway and rough for longer approach shots, between 130-210 yards depending on the club, player and course. They are also used on hillier fairways to avoid hitting a low rise, which is a risk with long irons. These irons are commonly needed for the second shot of a long par-4 or the second or third shot of a par-5, and whenever the player must \"lay up\" their tee or second shot to avoid a hazard in range of their woods or long irons. Mid irons are common \"bump and run\" clubs in close-in situations where the player does not wish to hit a more lofted chip shot, but needs more rolling distance than a pitch or bump-and-run with a short iron would produce.\nThese irons are typically easier to hit well than the long irons, owing to their higher loft which gives the clubs more surface area. These clubs are more often found as true irons in players' bags, meaning they are less often replaced with hybrid clubs or other \"iron replacements\". These irons often have graphite shafts in newer sets, even when shorter irons have steel; the graphite will give better distance for the average golfer at the cost of some loss of consistency due to shaft torquing.\nShort irons.\nThe 8 and 9 irons are commonly called the \"short irons\". They have the highest-mass clubheads and the shortest shafts of the numbered irons, and are used for shots requiring high loft or moderate to short distance (typically between 130 and 150 yards with a full swing). Shots that must carry over tall or nearby obstacles such as a stand of trees, or approach shots from inside 140 yards of the pin, are common short iron situations. The short irons also make good \"bump and run\" clubs; used with a putting motion from the fringe around the green, the ball will carry in the air a few yards over the thick grass that would hamper a putt, then land softly on the green where it will then roll for a distance like a putt.\nThe short irons are traditionally regarded as the easiest to hit; however they are typically used in situations requiring very high accuracy, and so it becomes critical to minimize any effect of mis-hits. Short irons are often constructed using steel shafts, even if lower-lofted irons in the set have graphite; the steel minimizes clubhead torquing, increasing the consistency and thus accuracy of shots made at the cost of reduced flex which reduces distance (a secondary concern in most situations where these irons are used).\nThe pitching wedge is on the cusp between the short irons and the wedges, and has behaviors and uses falling into either class. Most matched iron sets include a pitching wedge, and it follows the normal loft progression of the iron set. In some sets, such as older sets produced by MacGregor Golf, it is labelled the 10-iron (MacGregor has since adopted the \"P\" terminology common to other manufacturers). In other sets such as Callaway Golf's \"Big Bertha\" line, the set includes a 10-iron in addition to a pitching wedge (simply labelled \"W\"), and the wedge's loft is increased from a nominal 45-48° to 50°, as a means to \"close the gap\" in lofts between a modern pitching wedge and a modern sand wedge.\nWedges.\nWedges are a subclass of irons with higher loft than numbered irons, used for a variety of specialized \"utility\" shots that require short distance (typically less than 130 yards), high launch angle, or high backspin to reduce roll distance. The first wedge to have that name was the sand wedge, invented by Gene Sarazen in 1931, which features a wide sole that is angled complementary to the striking face to help prevent the clubhead digging into soft turf such as sand. This wide sole was added to other high-lofted irons to add mass to the clubhead (compensating for the shorter shafts) and gives wedges their name, alluding to the clubs' appearances in profile.\nWedges are used for approach shots to the putting green, getting the ball out of tough situations, and to escape from hazards. They are designed to produce a high, short trajectory with a high degree of spin, all of which cuts down on the distance the ball will roll after landing. Most golfers will generally have at least two wedges, traditionally a pitching wedge and a sand wedge, with a lob wedge or a gap wedge commonly being added to provide additional options. Wedges are usually identified by a letter denoting their function (P, G, S, L, etc. sometimes with a \"W\" appended), or depending on the manufacturer, with a number denoting their loft angle (52°, 56°, 60°) and \"bounce angle\" (0-12°).\nThe use of lettered symbols on wedges (especially those not sold as part of a matching set) are becoming less common. Most wedges sold individually today are instead labelled with some combination of their loft angle in degrees, their bounce angle either in degrees or in a \"low-medium-high\" marking system, and an indication of the \"sole grind\", variations of which make the club more suitable for different types of shots. This system allows more flexibility in club selection and use, as one player might consider a club of a particular angle for a different basic job than the majority of players would. For instance, a player might regard both a 50° and a 54° wedge in their bag as gap wedges, and so choose clubs with lower bounce angles, then add a 58° wedge with more bounce to use out of most sandy lies. Another golfer might instead want the 54° wedge as their sand wedge and choose one with higher bounce, then use the 58° as a \"lob wedge\" and choose a low bounce angle to allow it to be used from a variety of ground conditions near the green. A third golfer, playing with a highly de-lofted pitching wedge like 44°, might even carry five wedges, for instance 48°, 52°, 56° and 60° angled wedges in addition to the pitching wedge.\nGiven the choices available to the modern golfer, and further de-lofting of pitching wedges (and all other irons) in the newest iron sets, it is almost unheard of anymore for a player to have only a pitching wedge and sand wedge. Gap wedges are ubiquitous in the modern club set, and sets of four total wedges are becoming more and more common. This usually comes at the cost of having to remove other clubs, often the long irons, from the bag in order to meet the 14-club limit; with a driver and two fairway irons or hybrids, for a player to have four wedges, they must start their numbered irons at the four-iron instead of the three. This in turn requires more attention paid to the selection of fairway woods or hybrids to produce more evenly-distributed average distances between the driver and the long to mid irons.\nSpecifications.\nThe following table provides a guide to the typical specifications of modern cavity-back irons. This is a guide only, there are no standards and specifications vary by manufacturer and custom-fitting option specifications.\nThe following table provides a guide to the typical specifications of muscle-back (blade) irons and early cavity irons through to the mid-1980s.\nLie Angle.\nThe lie angle of an iron is often adjusted to fit a golfer's swing so that the head of the club is in the right position at impact. Most club manufacturers offer customized lie angles between 2° flat and 2° upright. If an iron lie is too upright it can cause a shot to miss to the left for a right handed golfer (or right for a left handed golfer) and if the lie angle is too flat, it can cause a shot to miss to the right for a right handed golfer (or left for a left handed golfer)."

New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were unable to arrange fixtures as in previous seasons. Club cricket matches were played in most of the colonies.\nIn 1877–78, South Australia in its inaugural first-class match defeated Tasmania by an innings and 13 runs at the Adelaide Oval, this being the initial first-class match at that famous venue. New South Wales defeated Victoria twice. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, NSW won by an innings and 6 runs. Then, in the initial first-class match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, NSW won by 1 wicket.\nThe colonies continued to arrange matches against each other on an \"ad hoc\" basis through the 1880s.

        "text": "Robert Leslie Shaw (born October 15, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a center in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of Tennessee.\nEarly years.\nShaw attended Joseph Wheeler High School and played varsity football for three years, receiving All-American, state football lineman of the year and All-state honors in his senior season of 1975. He also practiced basketball and swimming.\nHe went on to play college football at Tennessee University, where he was a three-year starter at center, and earned second-team All-SEC honors in 1977 and 1978. Future Dallas Cowboys special teams coach Joe Avezzano, was his offensive coordinator.\nAs a senior, he was named one of the co-captains and received the team's Mickey O’Brien award. He also started in the East–West Shrine Game and the Senior Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nShaw was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (27th overall) of the 1979 NFL draft. This was only the second time the Cowboys used a first round pick on an offensive lineman. The first time was in the 1966 NFL draft when the team selected John Niland.\nAs a rookie in 1980, he started the season as a backup to John Fitzgerald at center and played mainly on special teams. After Fitzgerald injured his knee in the first half against the Washington Redskins, Shaw finished the game and played well enough to be named the starter for the next game against the Houston Oilers in Thanksgiving, while Fitzgerald recovered. He went on to become the starting center for the last five regular season games and three contests in the playoffs where he excelled.\nTwo games into his third season in 1981, he sprained his right knee against the Saint Louis Cardinals. He returned after sitting out three weeks, only to injure the same knee in the sixth game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers. He prepared and trained for a come back over 20 months, but was never able to pass the team's physical and subsequently retired.\nShaw was expected to anchor the Cowboys offensive line for 1980s, but his ongoing injuries and their effects brought an end to his promising career. He played in just 33 games over a 3-year career with the Cowboys. After Shaw's injury, Tom Rafferty was moved from guard and was named the starting center.\nPersonal life.\nAfter the end of his football career, he went back to college and earned a degree in architectural design and management. He became a vice president, working directly under Bob Breunig in the SBC development company. In the late-1980s and early 1990s, he became President of Memphis Real Estate and Columbus Realty Holdings. Along with business partner Roger Staubach, his company helped begin the transformation of a blighted area west of the North Central Expressway and north of the Woodall-Rogers Freeway into what is now known as Uptown Dallas. The first apartment community, positioned between State and Thomas streets, would be the first of many developed using a tax increment financing program with the City of Dallas. Shaw was named to the Dallas Business Journal's \"Top 40 Under 40\". His real estate development prowess has continued, and - in 2014 - it was announced that Shaw and Staubach would work with restaurateur Phil Romano to develop an apartment community in Trinity Groves, a project expected to cost in excess of $100 million. In 2017, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced that the Shaw/Staubach team would enter into a joint venture to build a 17-story luxury high rise at The Star in Frisco, a mere walking distance from the Dallas Cowboys' world headquarters."

        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 3.000 metres Steeplechase event at the 1991 IAAF World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. There were a total number of 37 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Saturday August 31, 1991.\nSummary.\nDefending champion Francesco Panetta took the early lead, shadowed by Tom Hanlon. The ever dangerous Kenyan team scattered toward the rear of the pack, but quickly moved forward as a group to join the train behind Hanlon. The first action happened on the third lap when Hagen Melzer and Graeme Fell, found themselves lying on the track after Fell fell over a barrier. Later in the lap, the Kenyans tired of training Hanlon and moved directly behind Panetta. Finally, the fourth time over the water jump, the entire Kenyan team passed Panetta. Over th next lap, Panetta began to fall back, leaving a 5-man break on the front, with Abdelaziz Sahere and Azzedine Brahmi tagging on behind the Kenyans. Behind the group, Panetta, Brian Diemer and Angelo Carosi were chasing trying to bridge the gap. Of the Kenyans, the order was consistently World 1500m Junior Champion Moses Kiptanui leading Patrick Sang, with Olympic champion Julius Kariuki. On the penultimate lap, the Kenyans appeared to slow, enough for the breakaway group to catch the back temporarily, before the Kenyans again accelerated away. During the acceleration, Kariuki upset the patter by moving up to Kiptanui's shoulder. By the bell, only Brahmi was able to hold on to the back of Sang, the trailing Kenyan as Kariuki spent the next half lap challenging Kiptanui for the lead. Down the backstretch, Brahmi passed Sang before the water jump, but after the water it was again the three Kenyans on the front. As they hit the final straight, Kiptanui held a 2-metre lead over Sang, while Kariuki took the turn wide enough to allow Brahmi to fall in behind Sang, with Kariuki effectively conceding a Kenyan sweep and the bronze medal to him with 80 metres to go. Down the stretch, Sang accelerated enough for Kiptanui to sense his presence, then Kiptanui sped up to take a decisive victory.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 4 × 400 metres event at the 1991 IAAF World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. There were a total number of sixteen participating nations, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Sunday September 1, 1991. The final was won by Great Britain in what was, at the time, the fourth fastest time in history (behind the USA team's 1988 World Record, and two other US times). Going into the meeting, the USA 4 × 400 m team hadn't lost at a major championships in over 7 years. Britain, by contrast, hadn't won a gold medal in the event since the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\nThe British team made a tactical change, switching their top runner Roger Black, expected to be the anchor leg runner, to the first leg. The move paid off. Black ran a 44.6 first leg, catching Andrew Valmon before the handoff. giving Derek Redmond the edge to beat Quincy Watts to the break. Both Watts and Redmond would become famous the following year, Watts for winning the Olympic gold medal in the 400 metres and Redmond for his determination, finishing his semi-final race in that same event with a torn hamstring, assisted by his father. Watts ran a 44.1 leg to catch Redmond, but it could have been faster because Watts had to pass Redmond on the outside of the turn due to the British team's superior position. Danny Everett was not able to put any distance on John Regis, even having to fend off a challenge on the final straightaway, so going into the final leg, the USA held only a small lead. Kriss Akabusi, running the anchor leg paced off of the individual 400m Champion, Antonio Pettigrew, then dramatically overtook him on the home straight to win. The USA team were so shocked by the result, that even on the medal podium, they were still in disbelief at the result. Indeed, television footage immediately after the race, showed Pettigrew stood, hands on hips, shaking his head at the outcome of the race. The result was the only time out of 8 major championships over a 12-year span that the US team failed to win gold.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotes.\nIn 2002 this race came 42nd in the TV programme 100 Greatest Sporting Moments by Channel 4 of the UK."

        "text": "The 2008 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2007–08 season, and the culmination of the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings and the Eastern Conference champion Pittsburgh Penguins. This was Detroit's 23rd appearance in the Finals, and its first since winning the Cup in 2002. This was Pittsburgh's third appearance in the Finals, and its first since winning consecutive Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The Red Wings defeated the Penguins four games to two to earn the Stanley Cup. Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.\nThis was Detroit's 11th Stanley Cup title and was also the first Cup Finals between two United States-based NHL teams since 2003.\nIn the United States, Versus televised games one and two, and NBC broadcast the rest of the series. It was broadcast in Canada on CBC in English and on RDS in French. In the United Kingdom, all games were aired live on Five, and on the cable sports channel NASN. The series was also broadcast by NHL Radio via Westwood One.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Detroit Red Wings entered the Finals after winning the Presidents' Trophy as the team that had the best record during the regular season. Led by forwards Henrik Zetterberg, Pavel Datsyuk, and Johan Franzen, Detroit scored 55 goals in the first three rounds of the playoffs. With struggling goaltender Dominik Hasek being replaced mid-series by Chris Osgood, the Red Wings defeated their division rival Nashville Predators in the Western Conference quarterfinals, in six games. The team swept the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference semifinals, in which Franzen scored nine goals – tying with the entire Avalanche squad, who also scored nine goals in the series. The Red Wings then defeated the Dallas Stars in six games to win their fifth Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in franchise history.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the championship series after winning the Atlantic Division and earning the second-best regular season record in the Eastern Conference. The team was led by Sidney Crosby; missing 29 games throughout the regular season because of an ankle injury, the captain returned to lead the first three rounds of the playoffs in assists, and to tie for the lead in points heading into the Stanley Cup Finals. Goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury recorded three shutouts throughout the playoffs, to lead the league in that category. Evgeni Malkin and Marian Hossa each recorded nine goals and ten assists throughout the playoffs. The Penguins swept the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, a reversal of the series of the previous season when Ottawa beat Pittsburgh 4–1. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Penguins defeated division rival the New York Rangers, in five games. The team won the Prince of Wales Trophy by defeating another division rival, their in-state rivals, and another fierce rival of the Rangers, the Philadelphia Flyers, also in five games.\nGame summaries.\nThe 2008 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time that the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins met in postseason play, and the first time since the 1909 World Series that professional sports teams from Detroit and Pittsburgh met in a postseason series or game. The Red Wings and Penguins did not play each other during the 2007–08 regular season.\nGame one.\nPittsburgh's Gary Roberts and Detroit's Chris Chelios were both healthy scratches for game one. Prior to the game, a ceremonial faceoff featuring former Pittsburgh captain and current team chairman Mario Lemieux and former Detroit captain and team vice president at the time Steve Yzerman. Each dropped a puck to their current captains Sidney Crosby and Nicklas Lidstrom, respectively.\nAt 15:20 into the first period, a goal scored by Lidstrom was waved off after Tomas Holmstrom was called for goaltender interference. The remainder of the first period went scoreless, as Pittsburgh failed to capitalize on four consecutive power plays. At 13:01 into the second period, Mikael Samuelsson gave the Red Wings the unassisted game-winning goal, on a wrap-around. Just over two minutes into the third period, Samuelsson added his second unassisted goal of the game. At 17:18 into the third period, Dan Cleary scored shorthanded to give the Red Wings a 3–0 lead. Henrik Zetterberg scored on the power-play with 13 seconds remaining. Chris Osgood recorded his second shutout of the playoffs, to give the Red Wings a 4–0 victory in game one. The Red Wings outshot the Penguins 36–19.\nGame two.\nIn preparation for game two, head coach Michel Therrien revised Pittsburgh's lines; the revision included Gary Roberts who did not play in game one. Johan Franzen, the leading goal-scorer in the playoffs, returned to the line-up for Detroit.\nDetroit's Brad Stuart scored the first goal of the game 6:55 into the first period, on a slap shot, with an assist from Valtteri Filppula. Tomas Holmstrom added a goal at 11:18 into the first period, to put Detroit up 2–0. Pittsburgh struggled throughout the period, failing to get a shot on goal for the game's first twelve minutes. Detroit outshot the Penguins 11–6 in the second period, but both teams failed to score. At 8:48 into the third period, Valtteri Filppula scored his first goal of the series, beating goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with a wrist-shot. Chris Osgood recorded his second consecutive shutout, stopping all 22 shots faced.\nGame three.\nGame three was held in Pittsburgh, where going into the matchup the Penguins had won sixteen consecutive home games. Pittsburgh continued to shuffle their lineup by replacing defenceman Kris Letang with veteran Darryl Sydor, but going back to the top line combinations from game one. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby scored the team's first goal of the series late in the first period, with an assist from Marian Hossa. The Penguins went up 2-0 after Crosby scored a second time, his second coming on the power-play, just 2:34 into the second period. Johan Franzen pulled the Red Wings within one, when he scored on the power-play at 14:48 of the second period. Adam Hall scored his second goal of the post season, when the Penguins winger scored at 7:18 of the third period, putting his team up 3–1. Mikael Samuelsson scored a second goal for the Red Wings, with assists from Brad Stuart and Valtteri Filppula. However, Pittsburgh's 3–2 lead held, giving the team their first victory of the series. Despite winning the game, Pittsburgh was outshot by the Red Wings for the third consecutive game by at least 10 shots.\nGame four.\nEntering Game Four, Petr Sykora said the game was a must-win for the Penguins, \"For us, basically, [game four] is a do-or-die game\". Jiri Hudler's game-winning goal at 2:26 of the third period broke a 1–1 tie, and the Red Wings killed off a Penguins 1:26 5-on-3 advantage midway through the final period to help preserve the victory, thanks in large part to a terrific defensive play by Henrik Zetterberg on Sidney Crosby, preventing what would have been a tap-in goal when he tied up Crosby's stick at the front of the net. Pittsburgh scored first on Marian Hossa's power play goal 2:51 into the game before Nicklas Lidstrom tied the game at 7:06 of the first period.\nGame five.\nPittsburgh's Marian Hossa scored the first goal of the game at 8:37 into the first period. Teammate Adam Hall added his second goal of the series at 14:41 of the first period, giving the Penguins a 2–0 lead. Detroit then scored three consecutive goals—by Darren Helm, Pavel Datsyuk, and Brian Rafalski—to gain the lead. After Pittsburgh pulled its goalie with less than one minute remaining in regulation, Maxime Talbot scored with 34.3 seconds remaining to tie the game and force overtime. The goal marked only the second time in NHL history that a team avoided elimination in the Finals by scoring in the last minute of the third period. The first two overtime periods were scoreless, and the game went into the third overtime with Detroit killing two consecutive penalties, and Pittsburgh killing one. At the 9:21 mark, Pittsburgh's Petr Sykora scored the game-winning goal on another power-play, forcing the series back to Pittsburgh for game six. The goal was assisted by defenceman Sergei Gonchar, who was playing his first shift in forty minutes as a result of an injury, and Evgeni Malkin, who got his first point of the Finals. Pittsburgh became the first team in modern NHL history to have three overtime power-plays in the Finals. Goaltenders Marc-Andre Fleury and Chris Osgood stopped 55 and 28 shots, respectively. The triple overtime game was the fifth-longest in Stanley Cup Finals history.\nGame six.\nPittsburgh's Ryan Malone was scheduled to have X-rays on June 3, after being hit in the face with the puck in game five, but was expected to play.\nThe Red Wings took a 2–0 lead in the second period in game six en route to a 3–2 victory to clinch the Stanley Cup. Brian Rafalski scored a power play goal at 5:03 in the first period before Valtteri Filppula extended the lead with a goal at 8:07 in the second. The Penguins had an opportunity to get their first goal later in the first period, with a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:33, but could not convert. Pittsburgh finally cut the lead at 15:26 of the second period with Evgeni Malkin's power play goal. However, a third period shot by Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg squeezed through the legs of Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, who, after noticing he was not covering the puck, fell backwards and accidentally knocked the puck across the goal line for the Red Wings' third goal. Marian Hossa scored a power play goal (in addition to the Penguins pulling Fleury for an extra attacker and the Red Wings' Andreas Lilja having lost his stick as a result of Malone knocking it out of his hands) at 18:33 of the third period to cut the lead to 3–2, but the Penguins, despite a shot by Sidney Crosby and shot off rebound by Hossa in the final seconds, could not tie the game before time ran out. Lidstrom became the first European-born Stanley Cup captain.\nThe Wings' victory also saw the Triple Gold Club, made up of individuals who have won the Stanley Cup plus gold medals at the Olympics and World Championships, gain three new members. Niklas Kronwall, Mikael Samuelsson, and Zetterberg had previously won the other two components with the Sweden national team in 2006 at that year's Olympics and World Championships. Lidstrom, already a member of the club, got a fourth Stanley Cup in his resumé.\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, Versus aired games one and two while NBC televised the remainder of the series. Game one of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals had a 1.8 rating, drawing 2.3 million viewers. The rating was a 157% increase over the previous Playoff Finals opener, and a 100% rise from two years previous. Game two had a 1.9 rating, drawing 2.5 million viewers. It was the highest-rated and most-watched cable telecast of the Finals in six years in the United States. The rating was the highest for an NHL game on Versus and the second highest rating for a Versus broadcast ever only to Lance Armstrong's seventh straight Tour de France victory in 2005 (2.1). Game three drew a 2.8 rating, representing an 87% increase over the previous year's game three. In Detroit, game three drew higher ratings (18.2) than game five of the 2008 NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Detroit Pistons and the Boston Celtics (15.9). Game four earned a 2.3 rating, up 21% over the previous year's game four. Game five drew a 4.3 rating, representing a 79% increase from the previous year's game five. It drew the highest ratings for a game five since 2002.\nGame six had a 4.4 rating, the best performance in a game six since 2000. It was a 100% increase over game six of 2006 and was the highest rated game for NBC since they reacquired the NHL broadcasting rights in 2004.\nOn the CBC in Canada, this was the last Stanley Cup Finals that Bob Cole served as the play-by-play announcer for, as Jim Hughson took over the following year.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2008 Stanley Cup was presented to Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Red Wings 3–2 win over the Penguins in game six.\nThe following Red Wings players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2007–08 Detroit Red Wings"

        "text": "The 2008 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2008 NRL season. It was played between the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and the Melbourne Storm on Sunday, 5 October at ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\nThe 2008 Grand Final was the first Grand Final played in daylight since the introduction of the night Grand Final in 2001. The two teams had previously played in the 2007 NRL Grand Final, with Melbourne winning 34-8. Manly reversed this result in 2008, winning 40-0; the largest Grand Final winning margin in the history of the game, and the first Grand Final since 1978 where the losing team did not score a point.\nLead-up.\nMelbourne and Manly were also the teams which contested the 2007 NRL Grand Final, with Melbourne winning the game 34-8. During the 2008 regular season, the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and the Melbourne Storm met twice: Round 5 and Round 22. The Round 5 result in Melbourne went the Storm's way with a 26–4 victory. The Round 22 game was a closer contest, with Melbourne winning again, 16–10 at Manly's Brookvale Oval. Manly went into the 2008 grand final not having beaten the Storm since Round 11, 2007.\nMelbourne Storm.\nDuring the regular season, the Melbourne Storm won 17 of their 24 games, winning their third consecutive minor premiership on points differential from Manly and Cronulla. This was later stripped due to salary cap cheating.\nIn the qualifying final, Melbourne played the New Zealand Warriors. Melbourne lost this game 18-15 after a Warriors try from Michael Witt two minutes from full-time; becoming the first minor premier side since the introduction of the McIntyre finals structure in 1999 to lose to the eighth-placed team.\nThe loss against New Zealand saw Melbourne matched up against the Brisbane Broncos in the semi-final; the team the Storm lost against in the 2006 grand final. They narrowly won the game 16-14 after scoring a try 45 seconds before full-time, after a Broncos' handling mistake.\nMelbourne captain Cameron Smith was controversially suspended for a grapple tackle during the Broncos game; the two-week suspension causing him to miss the rest of the finals season. Despite this suspension, Melbourne defeated the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 28-0 in the preliminary final, and entered their third consecutive grand final.\nManly Warringah Sea Eagles.\nManly also won 17 of their 24 games but lost the minor premiership to Melbourne on points differential, Melbourne having a 302 points difference compared to Manly's 290. Halfback Matt Orford was presented with the Dally M Award for his performance during the regular season, while fullback Brett Stewart was the league's top tryscorer with 19 tries.\nIn the first finals round, Manly defeated the St. George Illawarra Dragons 38-6. Manly then faced New Zealand in the preliminary final, beating them 32-6 to advance to their second grand final in a row, and their 17th overall (excluding the 1978 grand final replay).\nMatch details.\nAfter the Australian National Anthem was performed by Anthony Warlow Melbourne kicked off.\nFirst half.\n The grand final's first quarter was played end to end with each side able to hold the other's attacking opportunities out. In the twenty-fourth minute Manly hooker Matt Ballin at close-range ran from dummy-half and crashed over the try-line. After the video referee ruled the grounding successful, Matt Orford's conversion attempt hit the upright and missed so the score remained 4 - 0 with fifteen minutes of the first half remaining. Nine minutes later, Manly-Warringah were again on the attack and from ten metres out, moved the ball through the hands to the left wing where Michael Robertson dived over in the corner. The video referee was again called upon to examine the try, which was ruled to have been successfully scored just as Robertson's feet were being dragged onto the sideline by a defender. Orford's difficult kick went wide, so Manly's lead remained at 8-0 with under five minutes of the half remaining which were played out with no further points scored.\nSecond half.\nIn the forty-seventh minute, The Manly side were within twenty metres of Melbourne's try-line when Matt Orford at first receiver put a grubber kick into the left corner which bounced up perfectly for Michael Robertson racing through on the wing to grab and dive over for his second try. Kicking duty was handed to Steve Matai who coolly converted Robertson's try from next to the sideline, bringing his side's lead to 14 - 0. Three minutes later, and from a similar attacking position, Manly-Warringah kept the ball alive, a pass from Brett Stewart fifteen metres out arriving at the feet of Steve Matai who, with only one defender before him, picked it up and passed to Michael Robertson to dive over again in the same corner. Matai's second sideline conversion attempt missed, so Manly were leading 18 - 0. In the fifty-seventh minute Manly-Warringah were again down in Melbourne's half and on the last tackle decided to run the ball, which was kept alive and passed through seven sets of hands before going to a charging Brent Kite who stretched out of the tackle and slammed the ball down under the posts. Matai kicked the easy conversion and it was Manly 24, Melbourne 0. Ten minutes later the Manly side got another try when, from within Melbourne's ten-metre line, they moved the ball out to David Williams on the right wing to dive over in the corner. The conversion attempt by Matai went wide so Manly were leading 28-0. In the seventy-second minute the Manly side ran the ball down toward the left corner with Robertson passing back in to Steve Menzies, who was playing in his 349th and final NRL match to crash over for a try, his 180th. Jamie Lyon took over the goal kicking and converted Menzies' try to give Manly a 34 - 0 lead. However, the finale was to come at the seventy-five-minute mark when from their forty-metre line, Manly second rower Glenn Hall burst into open space, passing back inside for Brett Stewart who was running through in support. Stewart was chased down just short of the try-line by Storm halfback Cooper Cronk, but he managed to flick the ball back without looking into the arms of Steven Bell to also get a try in his last game at the club. Jamie Lyon's simple conversion put the final score at 40 -0.\nIt was at the time the fourth-biggest loss in the Melbourne club's history.\nThe Manly Warringah Sea Eagles defeated the Melbourne Storm 40-0, scoring eight tries, four of which were converted. This is the highest Rugby League Grand Final margin in Australian history, eclipsing the 1975 NSWRFL season's Grand Final where Eastern Suburbs defeated St. George, 38–0 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It is also the first time that a team has been kept scoreless in a Grand Final since the 1978 NSWRL Grand Final Replay, where Cronulla lost to Manly 16–0. Manly forward Brent Kite was named man-of-the-match and received the Clive Churchill Medal.\nThe 2008 Grand Final was the last match for Super League-bound Steve Menzies of Manly. Playing in this match brought his career games played to 349, equalling the current record from Terry Lamb.\nStatistics.\nTimeline.\n23rd Minute: Manly 4–0 (Ballin try)&lt;br&gt;\n33rd Minute: Manly 8–0 (Robertson try)&lt;br&gt;\n47th Minute: Manly 14–0 (Robertson try; Matai goal)&lt;br&gt;\n51st Minute: Manly 18–0 (Robertson try)&lt;br&gt;\n58th Minute: Manly 24–0 (Kite try; Matai goal)&lt;br&gt;\n67th Minute: Manly 28–0 (Williams try)&lt;br&gt;\n72nd Minute: Manly 34–0 (Menzies try; Lyon goal)&lt;br&gt;\n75th Minute: Manly 40–0 (Bell try; Lyon goal)"

        "title": "Uniform number (Major League Baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, the uniform number is a number worn on the uniform of each player and coach. Numbers are used for the purpose of easily identifying each person on the field as no two people from the same team can wear the same number. Although designed for identification purposes only, numbers have become the source of superstition, emotional attachment, and honor (in the form of a number retirement). In Major League Baseball, player and manager numbers are always located on the back of the jersey. A smaller number is often found on the front of the jersey, while umpires wear their numbers on the uniform shirt sleeve.\nAccording to common tradition, single-digit numbers are worn by position players but rarely by pitchers, and numbers 60 and higher are rarely worn at all. Higher numbers are worn during spring training by players whose eventual place on the team is uncertain; they are also sometimes worn during the regular season by players recently called up from the minor leagues. However, such players usually change to a more traditional number once it becomes clear that they will stay with the team. These traditions are not enforced by any rule, and exceptions are common. Examples of star players wearing numbers higher than 60 include Carlton Fisk (72), Kenley Jansen (74), and Aaron Judge (99). In 2018, Blake Snell became the first pitcher wearing a single-digit number (4) to appear in the All-Star Game and the first to win the Cy Young Award.\nHistory.\nThe idea of assigning numbers to players was first proposed as a means of allowing spectators to more easily identify each player on the field. The practice of numbering competitors in other sports was already decades old when, in 1894, an unnamed individual suggested to James Hart, president of the Chicago Colts, that his players should wear uniform numbers. On December 29, 1894, the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" wrote of the National League club: \"Every one who has attended a ball game knows how puzzled one occasionally gets in endeavoring to recognize some player or trying to locate a man who is on the team, but whose position has been changed from that signified on the score-card. The plan suggested to Mr. Hart is very simple. It is for every man on the team to have a separate number, which he shall keep throughout the season...On the score-cards, the names of the players, with their numbers, shall be printed; and in this way the spectator can readily identify any player on the field.\" However, there is no record of the Colts implementing the suggestion.\nIn 1906, the team, which had since been renamed the Chicago Cubs, devised a uniform numbering system in which, rather than sewing numbers onto jerseys, each player's number would be printed next to their name on the game's scorecard. Within this system, which was also adopted by other teams over the next few years, stadium scoreboards would display the team's lineups in numerical form. In order to determine the players corresponding to the numbers on the scoreboard, fans in attendance would have to buy the scorecard. Teams frequently changed player numbers in order to render previous scorecards unusable. By 1911, the system was employed by both Chicago teams, the Cubs and the White Sox, as well as the Boston Braves, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Washington Nationals.\nThe earliest official record of numbers being physically placed onto uniforms is from 1907, when the Reading Red Roses of the Atlantic League numbered player jerseys in an effort to help fans identify them. While it is unknown if the team ever took the field with numbers, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum cites the Red Roses as the first team verified to have numbered their players. The earliest photographic evidence of a baseball uniform number dates back to 1909. In an issue of the \"Chicago Daily News\", star pitcher José Méndez, then playing for the Cuban Stars, a traveling Negro league baseball team of the early 1900s, is seen wearing the number 12 on his left sleeve.\nThe first time that a Major League team wore numbers was on June 26, 1916. Inspired by the usage of numbers in football and hockey, the Cleveland Indians added large numbers to their left sleeves for a game on their home field. This experiment was tried for a few weeks, then again the next season, before being abandoned. In 1923, the St. Louis Cardinals adopted uniform numbers on their sleeves. However, as then-manager Branch Rickey recalled, the now-easily identifiable players were \"subjected to field criticism from the stands and especially from opposing players,\" so the numbers were removed. Other clubs to experiment with uniform numbers on their sleeves in 1923 include the Indianapolis ABCs of the Negro National League and the San Antonio Bears of the Texas League.\nIn 1929, both the Indians and the New York Yankees were planning to start the season with uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. Both teams were scheduled to begin their seasons on April 16, however, a rainout forced the Yankees to postpone their season opener. The Indians played their game as scheduled, in the process becoming the first major league team to wear uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. The practice of adding uniform numbers to home and road jerseys became universal in the American and National Leagues in 1937, when the Philadelphia Athletics became the last team to do so.\nNumbers in other places on the uniform.\nIn 1951, the Springfield Cubs of the International League pioneered the concept of placing numbers on the front of the jersey. A year later, the Brooklyn Dodgers incorporated the idea as well. They had previously intended to wear numbers on the front of the jersey if they made an appearance in the 1951 World Series. However, a walk-off home run by Bobby Thomson in the last game of a tiebreaker series against the New York Giants cost the Dodgers the pennant and a subsequent World Series appearance.\nToday, numbers on the front are common at all levels of play. In 1940, the Memphis Red Sox of the Negro American League wore numbers on their pants. The idea was also incorporated by the Houston Astros from 1975 to 1978, placing the number on their left hip. The Chicago White Sox also wore left hip numbers from 1982 to 1989.\nUntil 2022, the Philadelphia Phillies were the only Major League team to wear a number on the sleeve of their jerseys; they have since removed the sleeve numbers in anticipation of an upcoming sponsor patch. The White Sox did so from 1971 to 1975, and the St. Louis Cardinals did in 1979 and 1980.\nRules.\nThe official rules of baseball state that uniforms must be identical for all members of a team. The only mention of uniform number is that it must be on the back and a minimum of six inches tall. Each player must have their own unique number, but there is no rule requiring coaches to have unique numbers. For example, in 2015, Alan Trammell (who wore number 3 for his lengthy career as a Detroit Tigers player and manager) returned to coach first base and wore 3 again, despite the number belonging to Ian Kinsler at the time, marking a rare instance of a coach sharing a number with a player.\nDeviations from the rules.\nIn their first career games, Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis and Chicago White Sox pitcher Joe Horlen did not have jersey numbers. Both of these players were just called up to the big league team while it was on the road and the only uniform available had no number.\nOn September 27, 1999, Detroit Tigers center fielder Gabe Kapler took the field donning a numberless uniform. That day, the Tigers played their last game at historic Tiger Stadium and, in honor of great Tigers of the past, members of the starting lineup wore the uniform numbers of corresponding members of an All-Time Detroit Tigers team voted on by the fans. Since Kapler played center field, he was to wear Ty Cobb's uniform number, but since Cobb played before numbers were used, Kapler's back was blank.\nFor the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park on April 20, 2012, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees wore 1912-style uniforms which had no numbers.\nOn Jackie Robinson Day, teams across MLB all wear uniform number 42 to honor him. [See \"Retired numbers,\" below.] The MLB has taken this tribute so far that, on that day only, all 30 team websites' active rosters say that every player on the team is number 42.\nOn August 21, 2012, the Boston Red Sox played their first home game since the death of Johnny Pesky, and all players wore his retired number 6 jersey during the game.\nOn September 26, 2016, the Miami Marlins played their first home game since the death of Jose Fernandez, and all players wore his number 16 jersey during the game.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Angels played their first home game since the death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs, and all players wore his number 45 jersey during the game. After the game, a combined no-hitter, the players removed their Skaggs jerseys and laid them around the mound to honor his memory.\nOn September 9, 2020, all players and field coaches of the Pittsburgh Pirates wore Roberto Clemente's number 21 in his honor. A number of Puerto Rican MLB players, as well as Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Brent Suter, also wore number 21 in honor of Clemente. Beginning in September 2021, Latin American players and Roberto Clemente Award winners were given the option to wear number 21 during Roberto Clemente Day.\nNumber assignments.\nThe original baseball numbers were based on the lineup. The starting players would be numbered 1-8, based on their spot in the order. The backup catcher would be number 9, and the pitchers would wear 10-14 (but not 13, as it is considered unlucky). Notable examples of this system are teammates Babe Ruth (he was number 3 and batted third for the Yankees) and Lou Gehrig (number 4, batted fourth).\nExperiments with numbers by position.\nSeveral teams experimented with numbering-by-position during the 1930s. In , the Cincinnati Reds, under general manager Warren Giles, introduced what would be the longest-lasting convention, in which pitchers customarily wore numbers between 30 and 49; outfielders between 20 and 29; infielders between 10 and 19; and catchers, coaches and managers in the single digits—with the manager often sporting number 1. (An exception briefly occurred in the early 1950s, when Cincinnati's coaches and managers were assigned numbers in the 50s.)\nThe New York Giants adopted this system in 1947, and when Giles became chief executive of the National League in 1952, many other NL clubs began to follow suit. Two American League teams, the first edition of the expansion Los Angeles Angels and the Cleveland Indians beginning in 1963, also adopted the numbering scheme.\nIn his memoir, \"Ball Four\", pitcher Jim Bouton tells how he asked his new NL team, the Houston Astros, for his traditional number 56, but was assigned 44 instead because of the numbering custom. Bouton wrote: \"I asked if there was any chance I could get 56. [The equipment manager] said he didn't think so, that all our pitchers have numbers in the 30s and 40s. He said I'd have to talk to [general manager Spec] Richardson or manager Harry Walker if I wanted to change the rule. I said I was sure they wouldn't want to be bothered with something so small, and he said, 'Oh, you'd be surprised.' Oh no I wouldn't.\"\nHowever, the number-by-position convention was never a formal rule, although one was proposed by Giles at the 1958 Winter Meetings. Moreover, a few National League clubs — notably the Dodgers — consistently resisted the idea. The custom was slowly abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s. (In fact, in 1970, the Astros assigned Bouton his traditional number 56.)\nNumbering conventions.\nDespite today's MLB teams no longer assigning numbers solely by a predefined systems, some trends regarding player numbers include the following:\nPlayers in the modern game have been moving away from traditional numbering conventions. Number choices are increasingly varied. Paul Lukas noted that the increasing use of higher numbers in baseball could be traced to the iconic status of certain high numbers in hockey, most notably Wayne Gretzky's 99 and Mario Lemieux's 66. , nearly four times as many players had worn 99 in the 21st century (15) than in all of the 20th century (4), and nearly as many players had worn 0 in the 21st century (10) as in the 20th (11). Every two-digit number has been worn during a regular-season MLB game, with number 89 the last to be used—it was first worn during 2020, by Miguel Yajure of the Yankees.\nAttachments and oddities.\nIf a player who grows superstitious about or emotionally attached to a certain number changes teams, he will occasionally bargain for the right to wear the number if it is already in use on his new team. In 1993, when Rickey Henderson joined the Toronto Blue Jays, he paid Turner Ward $25,000 for the number 24, which he wore at various points throughout his career. Upon joining the Atlanta Braves prior to the 1999 season, Brian Jordan gave third base coach Fredi González a Harley Davidson motorcycle in exchange for number 33, while Juan Pierre bought a motorcycle for manager Grady Little in exchange for the number 9 on the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2007. In a less lucrative transaction, when Mitch Williams joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 1991, he bought number 28 from John Kruk for $10 and two cases of beer.\nSome players who are unable to acquire the number they had on their previous team will obtain a similar number. For example, Roger Clemens wore number 21 for over 15 years while pitching for the University of Texas, the Boston Red Sox, and the Blue Jays. When he joined the New York Yankees prior to the 1999 season, Clemens asked long-time Yankee outfielder Paul O'Neill to surrender the number. O'Neill refused, so Clemens chose number 12, the reverse of 21, then settled on number 22, which he wore for the remainder of his career. After a stint with the Houston Astros, Clemens resigned with the Yankees for the 2007 season, prompting Robinson Canó to change numbers from 22 to 24 in anticipation of the signing.\nPitcher Joe Beimel wore number 97 throughout his career because his first child was born in 1997. During the 2006 season, while playing for the Red Sox, J. T. Snow wore number 84 to honor his father Jack, a former National Football League wide receiver who had died earlier in the year.\nFor some players, an oddity or coincidence has provided an opportunity to express something about themselves with their number. In 1951, while playing for the minor-league Fargo-Moorhead Twins, Johnny Neves wore the number 7 backwards on his jersey because \"Neves\" is \"seven\" spelled backwards. Bill Voiselle, who had grown up in Ninety Six, South Carolina, wore number 96 from 1947 to 1950 to honor his hometown. Carlos May, who was born on May 17, wore number 17, meaning that his jersey read both his name and number and his birthday (\"May 17\"). Eddie Gaedel, a little person who made one plate appearance for the St. Louis Browns as a publicity stunt in 1951, wore the number ⅛.\nRetired numbers.\nPlayers, managers, coaches, or other figures with notable contributions to a given team will sometimes have their uniform number retired such that the number is never reissued by that team. Only the individual with the retired number can wear that number upon a potential return to that team. Generally, such retirements are reserved for those individuals whose performance and impact were notable not just to a single team, but to Major League Baseball as a whole.\nThe first MLB number retired was Lou Gehrig's #4 by the New York Yankees. A retirement ceremony was held in his honor at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. As of January 2023, MLB has seen at least one number retirement in each season since 1982. #20 has been retired by 11 teams, more than any other number (excluding Jackie Robinson's #42, which has been retired by all teams). The lowest number not retired by any team is 38, while the highest player uniform number to be retired is Carlton Fisk's #72, which he wore with the Chicago White Sox. Two numbers higher than 72 have been retired. The St. Louis Cardinals retired #85 in honor of their then-owner August Busch Jr. in 1984, with that number chosen to signify his age at the time of its retirement. The Cleveland Guardians (then Indians) retired #455 in 2001 to honor their fans and commemorate the then-MLB record home sellout streak of 455 games.\nTen players and two managers have had their numbers retired with two teams. Ralph Kiner had his number retired for his contributions as a player for the Pittsburgh Pirates and as a broadcaster for the New York Mets. Frank Robinson's #20 is retired by three teams: the Orioles and Reds for his contributions as a player and the Guardians for his contributions as a player and manager. Nolan Ryan had two different numbers (#30 and #34) retired among three teams: the Angels, Rangers, and Astros. The other individuals to have multiple numbers retired are Sparky Anderson (#10 with the Reds and #11 with the Tigers), Wade Boggs (#12 with the Rays and #26 with the Red Sox), Carlton Fisk (#27 with the Red Sox and #72 with the White Sox), Roy Halladay (#32 with the Blue Jays and #34 with the Phillies), and Reggie Jackson (#9 with the Athletics and #44 with the Yankees).\nThe Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team (22 numbers honoring 23 of their former players, plus #42 for Jackie Robinson, who did not play for the team), including all non-zero single digit numbers. The Miami Marlins are the only team with no retired numbers as of January 2023, however, the team has retired and unretired the #5. It was initially retired in 1993 in honor of Carl Barger, who had died in December 1992. Barger was the president of the then-expansion franchise and thus never wore a number for the team. The number, initially chosen because it had been worn by Joe DiMaggio, Barger's favorite player, was returned to circulation in 2012 when the Marlins moved into their current stadium. Instead of a retired number, a plaque honoring Barger was placed at the new stadium. The #5 was also unretired by the Cincinnati Reds, who initially retired it to honor Willard Hershberger, an active player who committed suicide in 1940, but placed it back into circulation at the end of the season. The number was later permanently retired by the team to honor the contributions of Johnny Bench.\nThe only other cases of retired numbers being returned to circulation by an MLB franchise occurred when the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. At the time, the Expos had retired three numbers to honor four former players. All were returned to circulation by the Nationals. In 2021, after Roberto Alomar was banned from baseball following an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that he would be removed from their Level of Excellence and that his retired number banner would be taken down. However, as of January 2023, the #12 has not been reissued by the team.\nJackie Robinson and number 42.\nIn 1997, for the first and thus far only time, a number was retired throughout Major League Baseball. The #42 cannot be issued by any team, having been retired in honor of Jackie Robinson. Those wearing the number upon its league-wide retirement, such as Mo Vaughn of the Boston Red Sox and Butch Huskey of the New York Mets, were allowed to keep it under a grandfather clause. The last person to wear #42 was Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, who retired following the 2013 season.\nHowever, the #42 would be worn by several players other than Rivera in 2007, which marked the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first MLB appearance (an event that broke the sport's 20th-century color line). Before the season, then-Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. asked Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig for permission to wear #42 on April 15, the anniversary date of Robinson's historic game, which was formally named Jackie Robinson Day by MLB in 2004. Both gave their approval, and Selig later allowed any player to wear #42 on Jackie Robinson Day. In response, over 200 players elected to do so, including six teams that opted for all of their players to participate. Since 2009, all players and coaches on all teams, as well as all umpires, have worn #42 on Jackie Robinson Day.\nUmpires.\nIn 1970, National League umpires first wore identifying numbers on the right sleeve of their shirt or coat. The numbers were assigned in alphabetical order and remained this way through 1978, meaning umpires could, and often did, wear a different number from year to year. In 1979, NL umpires chose numbers based upon seniority, and that system remained through 1999, the last season of separate umpiring staffs for the National and American Leagues.\nAmerican League umpires did not wear identifying numbers until 1980. Unlike the NL, there were no set rules for number assignments.\nWhen the AL and NL umpiring staffs merged in 2000, the senior umpire who wore a given number could keep that number, while the junior umpire had to select a new number.\nSince 2020, MLB has allowed three-digit numbers on umpires, but the procedure applies to reserve umpires (call-up umpires when regular umpires are on vacation)."

        "title": "Hybrid (golf)",
        "text": "A hybrid is a type of club used in the sport of golf with a design borrowing from both irons and woods while differing from both. The name \"hybrid\" comes from genetics to denote a mixture of two different species with desirable characteristics of both, and the term here has been generalized, combining the familiar swing mechanics of an iron with the more forgiving nature and better distance of a wood.\nFor many players, long irons (numbers 1-4) are difficult to hit well even with modern clubfaces, due to the low trajectory and very small face of the low-loft clubhead. Players tend to avoid these clubs in favor of fairway woods which have a larger \"sweet spot\" to hit with, but such woods, having longer shafts, have a different swing mechanic that is sometimes difficult to master. The long shaft of a fairway wood also requires much room to swing, making it unsuitable for tighter lies such as \"punching\" out from underneath trees. In addition, the fairway wood clubface is designed to skim over instead of cutting into turf, which makes it undesirable for shots from the rough. The answer to this dilemma for many players is to replace the 1-4 irons with hybrids.\nDesign.\nA hybrid generally features a head very similar to a fairway wood; hollow steel or titanium with a shallow, slightly convex face. A hybrid head is usually marginally shallower and does not extend backwards from the face as far as a comparable fairway wood. The head must have an iron-like lie angle, and therefore also has a flatter sole than a fairway wood. The face incorporates the \"trampoline\" effect common to most modern woods, in which the clubface deforms slightly, then returns to its previous shape, increasing the impulse applied to the ball at launch. The hybrid's lie, length and weight is comparable to an iron.\nBeing a new class of club, there is no generally accepted principle governing design. So while a \"true\" hybrid is as described above, many manufacturers cut production costs by marketing irons as hybrids by adding one or more features to make it look like a hybrid. Some have a club face that looks very similar to an iron, but instead of the cavity-back or muscle-back design these clubs have a slightly bulging back to appear more wood-like in shape. These \"iron replacements\" swing and perform almost exactly like irons, except the difference in the added weight which slows clubhead speed but increases force applied at a given club speed, allowing a swing to cut through turf or sand with more momentum remaining at contact. These clubs are preferred by players with slower swing speeds. Other club manufacturers produce \"true\" hybrids as previously described. The first equipment manufacturer to produce a full set of these true hybrids, in both left and right hand, was Thomas Golf. Hybrids are now also available in traditional (teardrop) and square head shapes.\nBehavior.\nThough generally similar to a wood of the same loft in performance, with slightly less carry distance (distance traveled before first impact) but similar launch trajectory, and generally similar to an iron in swing mechanics, hybrids have some behaviors different from either. Because the wood-like head design creates enormous impulse on the ball, the loft of a hybrid head is generally higher than either the wood or iron of the same number, so that the distance carried by the ball is similar to the comparable iron number.\nThis does two things; first, the angle of launch is increased so that the ball carries higher than the comparable iron. Second, the increased loft coupled with the tighter impulse also imparts increased backspin on the ball. This increased backspin is different from both the iron and the wood of the same number, and creates a flight path similar to a higher-loft iron but at a lower angle of launch; the backspinning ball will lift itself in the air along its flight line, \"stall\" when the lift generated by the spin coupled with the ball's momentum can no longer keep it in the air, and drop relatively sharply onto the turf. The sharp drop coupled with the continuing backspin creates \"bite\"; the ball's forward momentum will be arrested sharply at its point of impact and carry only a few yards thereafter.\nOnce this behavior is known to the player, it can be used to great effect. For instance, a player may be faced with a hole incorporating a hazard just in front of the green. A driver, low-loft fairway wood or long iron shot will roll significantly, and depending on the distance carried in the air the ball will either roll into the hazard with a resulting penalty, or roll past the green, which on many courses is difficult to recover from and may incorporate other hazards. Normally a player might hit a mid-iron shot designed to \"lay up\" in front of the hazard and then hit an \"approach\" shot with a wedge or short iron to carry over the hazard and onto the green. However, a hybrid with sufficient distance would allow the player to hit a shot that carries the full distance to the green in the air, but then \"sticks\" on the green relatively close to its impact point, allowing the player to make one stroke instead of two to get on the green.\nUse.\nA hybrid with a wood-like clubhead is often used for long shots from difficult rough and for nearly any shot where the golfer would normally use a long iron but feels uncomfortable doing so. They also are direct replacements for fairway woods in most situations, but a fairway wood will have greater club speed and more roll for better distance. Because hybrids can assist in getting the player out of tricky situations such as tight lies, TaylorMade Golf chose to market their hybrid clubs as \"Rescue\" clubs. The most common hybrid lofts are 3-iron and 4-iron equivalents (the 1- and 2-iron are usually omitted from the bag completely), though 5-iron equivalents are also seen in ladies' and seniors' sets. Hybrids generally replace rather than supplement long irons, but as a player is free to carry any set of 14 clubs that they wish, it is not unheard of for a player to carry both a 3-hybrid and a 3-iron, with the hybrid instead replacing the fairway wood; the higher-mass iron clubhead would be preferable to the hybrid for use in tall grass or soft lies.\nShots from deep within trees and in very high grass can still be difficult with a \"wood-faced\" hybrid, however, as the higher angle of flight can make \"punching\" out through low-hanging branches difficult, and the wider sole of the hybrid, similar to a wood, will still skim rather than cut into tall grass (similar to a wood but to a lesser degree). Here, the \"iron replacement\" form of hybrid is preferable as the trajectory and cut-through are similar to (sometimes even better than) a traditional long iron's while maintaining much of the power of a \"wood-faced\" hybrid.\nWhen a ball is lying near the green, a player can use a hybrid to perform a short \"bump and run\". By assuming the player's typical putting stance and grip, a ball can be \"bumped\" in the air over the taller rough onto the green, where it will then \"run\" (roll) like a putt. Other clubs, especially mid- and high-lofted irons, can make a similar stroke and are more commonly used.\nPopularity.\nIn 2007 the Darrell Survey Company reported that over 30% of consumer golfers were using at least one hybrid club, up from a little over 7% in 2004. They also found 65% of professional golfers on the PGA Tour, and 80% on the Champions Tour now use at least one hybrid club, with many carrying more than one in their bags."

        "title": "1969 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 1969 Major League Baseball season was contested from April 7 to October 16, 1969. It included the third Major League Baseball expansion of the decade, with the Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Pilots each beginning play this season. The season was also celebrated as the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, honoring the first professional touring baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869.\nThis year saw the adoption of rule changes to counteract the dominance of pitching in recent seasons. The mound was lowered and the strike zone adjusted. This was also the first season of the \"Divisional Era\". With each league expanding from 10 teams to 12 teams, both leagues were divided into two six-team divisions. Teams continued to play 162-game schedules, in place since 1962, by now playing the other five teams in their own division 18 times each (90 games) and playing the six teams in their league's other division 12 times each (72 games). The winners of each division would advance to the postseason and face each other in a League Championship Series, then a best-of-five series, to determine the pennant winners that would face each other in the World Series.\nThe Baltimore Orioles won the AL East with an MLB-best 109–53 record, and then defeated the AL West champion Minnesota Twins in three games in the first American League Championship Series. The New York Mets won the NL East with an NL-best 100–62 record, and then defeated the NL West champion Atlanta Braves in three games in the first National League Championship Series. The \"Miracle Mets\", having joined the league in 1962, were the first expansion team to win a pennant.\nThe upstart Mets went on to upset the heavily favored Orioles in the World Series, four games to one, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in World Series history.\nNew commissioner.\nBowie Kuhn was named the 5th commissioner of baseball at the start of the season replacing previous commissioner William Eckert. Eckert was forced out by the owners in December 1968 mainly because of his refusal to cancel games in the wake of the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King and for his refusal to help the owners during a player strike they anticipated was around the corner. Kuhn was named interim commissioner during that time, and became the official commissioner by the start of the season. Kuhn remains the youngest ever commissioner of baseball, being only 42 when he took office.\nRules changes.\nIn an effort to counteract a trend of low-scoring games and pitching ruling overall, Major League Baseball adopted two measures during the Baseball Winter Meetings held in December 1968. The strike zone was reduced to the area over home plate between the armpits and the top of the knees of a batter. Also, the height of the pitching mound was reduced from 15 inches to 10 inches, and it was recommended that the slope be gradual and uniform in every park.\nA save became an official MLB statistic to reward relief pitchers who preserve a lead while finishing a game.\nExpansion.\nMLB called for a four-team expansion to take place in 1971 at the 1967 Winter Meetings, the first expansion since 1962. However, there was a complication: influential U.S. Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri was irate over the American League's approval of Kansas City Athletics owner Charles O. Finley's arrangement to move his team to Oakland, California, for the 1968 season. This happened even though Finley had just signed a deal to play at Municipal Stadium at AL president Joe Cronin's behest, and Jackson County, Missouri, had just issued public bonds to build a stadium, the future Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium), which would be completed in 1973.\nSymington drew up legislation to remove baseball's anti-trust exemption, and threatened to pursue its passage if Kansas City did not get a new team. The leagues agreed and moved expansion up to 1969, with the AL putting one of its new franchises in Kansas City. Ewing Kauffman won the bidding for that franchise, naming it the Kansas City Royals, after the local American Royal livestock show. The other AL team was awarded to Seattle. A consortium led by Dewey Soriano and William Daley won the bidding for the Seattle franchise, and named it the Seattle Pilots, a salute to the harbor pilots of the Puget Sound maritime industry and to the city's place in the aviation industry.\nIn the NL, one franchise was awarded to San Diego, California; the other to Montreal, Quebec, resulting in the first MLB franchise outside the United States. C. Arnholdt Smith, former owner of the AAA Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres, won the bidding for the San Diego franchise, and the new San Diego MLB team inherited the \"Padres\" moniker. Charles Bronfman, owner of Seagram, won the bidding for the Montreal franchise, naming them the Expos, in honor of the World's Fair that year. This was the last NL expansion until the 1993 season, and the last expansion for MLB overall until 1977.\nDivision play.\nAs part of the 1969 expansion, each league was to be split into two divisions of six teams each, with each league holding a best-of-five League Championship Series to decide the pennant. The AL was divided purely along geographic lines, but when it came to assign divisions in the NL, the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals insisted on being placed in the same division with the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, on the basis that a schedule with more games with eastern teams would create a more lucrative schedule. Thus, Atlanta and Cincinnati were placed in the NL West. This alignment also addressed concerns that putting the league's three strongest clubs at the time—St. Louis, San Francisco, and the Cubs—in the west would result in divisional inequity.\nThe Padres and Expos each finished with 110 losses and at the bottom of their respective divisions. The Royals did better, finishing 69–93 and in fourth in the AL West, ahead of the Chicago White Sox. Even though the Pilots managed to avoid losing 100 games (they finished 64–98, last in the AL West), financial trouble would lead to a battle for team control, ending with bankruptcy and the sale of the team to Bud Selig and its move to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1970 season. The legal fallout of the battle would lead eventually to another round of expansion for the AL in the 1977 season, with Seattle getting a new team called the Mariners.\nLogo.\nA special silhouetted batter logo, still in use by the league today, was created by Jerry Dior to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the league. It has served as inspiration for logos for other sports leagues in the United States—most notably the National Basketball Association, which used the silhouette of Jerry West to create their current logo, unveiled after the 1968–69 season.\nSpring training boycott.\nAfter the 1968 season, the Major League Baseball Players' Association and the owners had concluded the first collective bargaining agreement in major league history. However, one point remained unresolved: the owners refused to increase their contribution to the players' pension plan commensurately with revenues from television broadcasts, which were increasing as more and more fans watched games that way. With the two sides at an impasse, at the beginning of the year the union called on players to refuse to sign contracts until the issue was resolved. Many did, including stars like Brooks Robinson.\nThe owners did not change their position, so the players' union called for members to boycott spring training the following month if the issue had not been resolved by then. After the union rejected the owners' offer of a higher yet still fixed contribution on February 17, the day before spring training was to begin, 400 players refused to report. The owners expected the situation to resolve itself soon in their favor, since they usually lost money on training camps while the players were foregoing their pay in the meantime.\nThe players remained united, and few changed their minds about the boycott as it progressed. After the first week only 11 of those who initially boycotted had reported; at the time many had off-season jobs which they continued to work at, and those who did report were in many cases not certain of their futures with their teams. Meanwhile, the owners were being pressured by the television broadcasters, who would also lose money without games to broadcast, or if teams played games with largely unknown rookies—one NBC executive said his company \"would not pay major league prices for minor league games\".\nAfter that first week, new commissioner Bowie Kuhn leaned on the owners to reach an agreement as well, and they soon sat down with the players again. By February 25 they had acceded to most of the players' demands: a higher contribution of approximately $5.45 million annually, an earlier age at which players could begin drawing pensions, a wider range of benefits and less playing time required for eligibility. By the end of the month, all players had reported to spring training.\nRegular season recap.\nThe pennant races in the American League lacked drama. In the east, the Baltimore Orioles won 109 games and won the division by a whopping 19 games over the defending world champion Detroit Tigers. The surprise team was the \"new\" Washington Senators. Under new manager Ted Williams, they went 86–76; it was their first winning season since joining the league in 1961. The Western Division race was a little closer, but the Minnesota Twins led most of the season and were never really threatened in winning the division by 9 games over the Oakland Athletics (who were the only other west team to finish over .500).\nThe National League, on the other hand, was very dramatic. The Chicago Cubs won 35 of their first 50 games, and on August 16, they led the New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals by 9 games. But the Mets proceeded to win 37 of their last 48 games while the Cubs went 20–28 in the same time period and the Mets won the division by 8 games.\nIn the West, with 3 weeks to play in the season, 5 teams were all within 2 games of each other. The Houston Astros were the first to drop out of the race, losing 8 of 10. With two weeks to play, the San Francisco Giants led the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves by ½ game while the Cincinnati Reds were 2 games back. The Dodgers then lost 8 in a row and 10 of 11 to fall to 4th place. The Braves then went on a 10-game winning streak, ultimately clinching the division over the Giants on the next to last day of the season with a 3–2 win over the Reds. For the Giants, it was the 5th year in a row they would finish in 2nd place.\nAwards.\nBaseball Hall of Fame\nAmerican League\nNational League\nGold Glove Award\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nTelevision coverage.\nNBC was the exclusive national TV broadcaster of MLB, airing the weekend \"Game of the Week\", the All-Star Game, both League Championship Series, and the World Series."

        "text": "Hill climbing is a cycling event, as well as a basic skill of the sport. As events a hill climb may either be an individual time trial (which forbids cooperation, drafting, or team tactics) or make up part of a regular road race. A hill climb usually represents an event which gains altitude continuously, usually terminating at a summit. Occasionally featured in major professional races, such as the Tour de France, they are usually referred to as mountain time trials, and are not necessarily from the bottom to the top of a hill, as they can simply be a time trial over hilly terrain. \nHill climbing is one of the key skills required to make cycling more enjoyable. One of the best ways to learn this skill is through practice. There are several ways to practice, solo using intervals or group rides that focus on hill climbs. Being able to tackle hills efficiently can be a \"Race Winner\" for anyone. Because downhills can be decided in seconds, uphills takes minutes, and being a good climber makes it possible to drop several riders behind.\nGreat Britain.\nIn Great Britain there is an end of season tradition of cycling clubs promoting hillclimb time trials in October, for small cash prizes. The hills tend to be relatively short, usually taking between three and five minutes to complete, and the races attract many spectators, including locals not otherwise interested in cycling, who come to watch the pain in the faces of the competitors. Competitors regularly strive to save grams on their equipment, going as far as to drill holes in their bike.\nUSA.\nUS hill climbs include the Mt. Evans Hill Climb and the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb. There has been an increase in bicycling across the major US cities, especially among men aged between 20 and 64, while rates of cycling by women and children lag. The introduction of bike elevators in the US will help cyclists navigate hillier parts of the city, thus increasing cycling rates."

Purcell Explains that the coaches knew who he was as he was considered the best back the two All-star colleges games, while then 1st team all American Fred \"Buzz\" Borries only made it on as a reserve. He describe the situation in 1934 as \"[would have been] politically impossible for even Jim Thorpe to get any All-America voter attention\". Purcell gives the example that only one All-American started in the Chicago all-star game. He implies that the reasons for this were due Buzz Borriess playing for Navy and that two other great running backs also for consideration were from Shepherd's home town, splitting the vote among the local writers. Even Grantland Rice was quoted as saying that Shepherd was a better back then Buzz Borries and should have been on the all American team."

        "text": "Sega Superstars Tennis is a sports video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. It is the second title in the \"Sega All-Stars\" series, preceded by \"Sega Superstars\" (2004), and crosses over characters, locations, and soundtracks from several Sega franchises, including \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", \"Space Channel 5\", and \"Super Monkey Ball\". \nThe game was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Wii, followed by releases for Mac OS X and multiple mobile versions. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics, with reviewers praising the game's Sega-theming and variety of content but criticizing the core gameplay.\nThe game was followed up by two racing game entries, \"Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing\" (2010) and \"Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed\" (2012).\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay in \"Sega Superstars Tennis\" is similar to Sega's \"Virtua Tennis\" series, with characters able to perform techniques such as lob shots and drop shots. Characters each have different statistics and proficiency in specific areas, such as power or control. Each character also has their own unique \"Superstar State\", a special ability that can be activated once an accompanying meter is filled. The effects of a Superstar State vary depending on the character; for example, Sonic transforms to Super Sonic and causes the ball to zig-zag when hit, while Gilius summons thunderbolts that can temporarily stun opponents. The game features 10 courts themed after various Sega games, such as Green Hill Zone from \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and Shibuya Downtown from \"Jet Set Radio\".\n\"Sega Superstars Tennis\" features several gameplay modes. Superstars mode allows the player to complete various missions themed around a specific Sega games, which take the form of exhibition matches, tournaments and minigame score challenges; completing these missions will unlock new areas based on other games with additional sets of missions to complete. Players will unlock new additional characters, courts, and music for use in gameplay as they progress through Superstars. Match mode offers standard tennis gameplay in singles or doubles matches for up to four players locally, while Tournament mode allows a single player to compete in a series of five sequential matches against random computer opponents. There are also several playable minigames that feature alternate gameplay styles inspired by other Sega games, including \"Space Harrier\", \"Puyo Pop Fever\", \"ChuChu Rocket!\", and \"Virtua Cop\". The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions also support online multiplayer.\nThe Wii version features support for three different control schemes: the Wii Remote with Nunchuk, the Wii Remote sideways, and the Classic Controller. The Nintendo DS version of the game can be played with the standard control pad or the touch screen.\nPlayable characters.\n\"Sega Superstars Tennis\" features 16 playable characters originating from eight different Sega franchises. Eight characters are available from the start, while the remaining eight must be unlocked through Superstars mode. The game marks the first 3D appearances of both Alex Kidd (\"Alex Kidd\") and Gilius Thunderhead (\"Golden Axe\") in a video game, and marks Alex Kidd's first playable appearance in eighteen years following the 1990 release of \"Alex Kidd in Shinobi World\".\nReception.\n\"Sega Superstars Tennis\" received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nThough it was praised for its multiplayer and enjoyable gameplay, the lack of graphical detail and online support was criticized. Eurogamer praised the Xbox 360 version for its fan service. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" reviewed the Wii version, saying that it had great gameplay and fun minigames and was enjoyable in multiplayer. However, the game just missed out on a Gold Award (which is given to games that score 90% or higher in their reviews) due to the lack to Nintendo Wi-Fi support and blasted Sega for the omission due to Wi-Fi being supported on the Xbox and PS3, commenting that as Nintendo Wi-Fi had already proven its capabilities with other games, it appeared that Sega simply couldn't be bothered to include it. \"IGN\" called the Wii version \"a tennis game that should have been better than it is.\" They criticized the lack of detail in the graphics, the muffled sound effects, simplistic gameplay, and the lack of an online mode, which is present in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions."

Freshman Tajuan Porter, who was not heavily recruited, along with senior and leader Aaron Brooks helped lead the Ducks to a successful season. They began their season by completing their non-conference schedule at a perfect 12–0, including a come-from-behind win at Rice and an important east-coast win at then ranked #19 Georgetown. The Ducks suffered their first loss of the season against USC but were able to bounce back and defeat then ranked #1 UCLA marking the second time in school history the Ducks had defeated a #1 Bruins team. Towards the end of the season Oregon suffered a streak in which they lost 6 of 8 games, the skid dropped the Ducks from #7 to #23 in the AP Poll. However the Ducks managed to bounce back, winning 9 games in a row, including a sweep of the Pac-10 Championship Tournament – in dominating fashion – first round wins over Miami University (Ohio), Winthrop University, and a Sweet Sixteen victory over UNLV. Their final game of the season was a 77–85 loss to eventual NCAA men's basketball tournament champions, Florida.\nPre-season.\nJune 28 – Aaron Brooks was selected in the 2007 NBA draft as the 26th selection overall during the 1st round by the Houston Rockets.\nJuly – Guard Tajuan Porter played on the United States' U19 team in the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championship.

Bowling has been a public official and community activist in her hometown of Tullahoma, Tennessee.\nPolitical positions and actions.\nMarriage license gender restrictions.\nAs a member of the Tennessee State Senate, Bowling sponsored a bill restricting the issuance of Tennessee marriage licenses to only marriages between a man and a woman, citing the Supreme Court's \"Lemon Test.\"\nBowling's bill argued that state marriage licenses should be issued only to secular marriages, which are licenses between a man and a woman.\nAlthough Bowling got her bill passed through committee and the Senate floor, the bill never made it out of subcommittee in the Tennessee House of Representatives and was withdrawn.\nEarly voting.\nIn 2021, Bowling spoke against early voting in Tennessee, saying she believed early voting created “mischief.” She sponsored a bill reflecting her opinion but withdrew it quickly when she could find no member of the Tennessee House of Representatives willing to sponsor the bill in the house.\nRemoval of controversial Forrest bust.\nIn March 2021, the Tennessee State Historical Commission voted to remove the bust of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Tennessee State Capitol and relocate it to the Tennessee State Museum. A controversial figure in the state's history, Forrest was a slave trader and one of the first leaders of the Ku Klux Klan.\nLess than two weeks following the vote to remove Forrest's bust from the state capitol, Bowling was one of two state legislators who, instead of removing the bust of Forrest, wanted to vote to remove all 29 members of the Tennessee State Historical Commission.\nThe two legislators’ bills would replace all 29 members with 12 new members.\nBowling said she thought removing the bust was tantamount to the cancel culture movement, saying such cancel narratives that are “based only on fact” are a “dangerous precedent.”\nCOVID-19.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Bowling expressed unverified claims about COVID-19 vaccines. In legislative hearings, Bowling said the vaccines could lead to genetic modification, a theory deemed “misinformation” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBowling opposed allowing COVID-19 vaccination for minors above the age of 14 and criticized the public health official who supported it by citing Tennessee law.\nIn July 2021, Dr. Michelle Fiscus, the medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization programs at the Tennessee Department of Health, was terminated after she sent a letter to medical providers who administer vaccines regarding vaccinating minors. In her letter, Fiscus explained the state's “Mature Minor Doctrine,” a legal mechanism based on \"Cardwell v. Bechtol\", 724 S.W.2d. 739 (Tenn. 1987), that stated physicians may treat minors between the ages of 14 and 18 without parental consent, unless the physician believes the minor is too immature to make his or her own health-care decisions.\nDuring a Senate hearing on Fiscus' firing, an angry Bowling argued that the state was misinterpreting its legal authority. She proposed legislation barring government mandates of COVID-19 vaccines and allowing religious exemptions. The legislation was signed into law by Republican Governor Bill Lee, effective May 25, 2021, despite the vocal and aggressive opposition of several organizations for physicians, first responders and other health-care providers.\nFurry litter boxes.\nBowling claimed that her rural district were providing litter boxes in schools to children that identify as cats. This claim was not substantiated by basically anyone."

        "text": "The 2007-08 Rugby Pro D2 was a French rugby union club competition. The season ran alongside the 2007-08 Top 14 competition, which is the highest club competition. Both competitions were operated by the Ligue nationale de rugby (LNR).\nAt the end of the previous season, Auch were champions and thus automatically promoted to Top 14. They were eventually followed by Dax who beat La Rochelle in the final providing the second promotion place. Colomiers were relegated to Fédérale 1; Limoges finished in a relegation spot, but were reprieved when Gaillac were denied a professional license for the 2007-08 season due to serious financial problems. Aurillac and Blagnac earned promotion from Fédérale 1.\nThe new season showed a bright future for two particular clubs who signed several quality players in the transfer market in hopes of promotion at the end of the season. Some notables include George Gregan, Victor Matfield, Andrew Mehrtens and Anton Oliver who all signed with Toulon. The team also signed former All Black and Toulon player Tana Umaga as their Manager Sportif. Meanwhile, Sireli Bobo, Carlo Festuccia and Argentine captain Agustín Pichot moved to Racing Métro. Pichot's move wasn't a long distance one since he was simply switching from one Parisian team to the other.\nToulon jumped to an early lead on the ladder and never looked back, ultimately clinching the title and automatic promotion with two rounds to spare. Mont-de-Marsan won the promotion playoffs, defeating Racing Métro in the final, to secure the second promotion place. At the other end of the table, Limoges and Blagnac finished in the relegation places. Unlike the previous season, when Limoges were spared relegation due to the financial woes of Gaillac, all of the clubs above the bottom two places passed their required postseason financial audits, ensuring that both of the bottom two teams would go down.\nThis season, LNR trialled a modification to the bonus point system in both the Top 14 and Pro D2. The system being used this season was:\nThis system was explicitly intended to prevent a losing team from earning two bonus points, as is possible under the standard system.\nPromotion playoffs.\nAll times CET."

He played amateur rugby league for Drighlington before joining Leeds Rhinos academy as a teenager. He was named Senior Academy Player of the Year in 2003, with the team winning their Grand Final.\nSmith represented England at U17 and U18 level.\nRugby League.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nSmith broke into the Leeds first team in 2005 but still captained the Senior Academy team to Grand Final success in 2006 against Hull. Smith made his début for the Leeds Rhinos first team on 28 March 2005 against Wakefield Trinity. He went on to make 10 appearances in his first season, scoring an impressive 8 tries.\nSmith further established himself as a first team player in 2006, making 21 appearances and scoring 9 tries.\nIn 2007 Smith made 21 appearances and scored 8 tries. Most notably the Leeds fourth of five tries in the 33-6 Grand Final victory over St Helens.\nHe played in 2008 World Club Challenge on 29 February at Elland Road in which Leeds beat Melbourne Storm 11–4.\nThe 2008 season was arguably Smith's best to date, making 25 appearances and scoring a joint career best 13 tries. Leeds again defeated St Helens to win the Grand Final, 24–16. Smith had to deputise at full-back after Brent Webb was ruled out after suffering a recurrence of a back injury sustained earlier in the season. Smith scored Leeds' opening try, making it the second year in a row he had scored in the Grand Final. He was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy (Man of the Match).\nIn 2009 Smith switched from his usual wing position to centre. This did not affect his try scoring record though as he again scored 13 tries, but in just 24 appearances. On 23 June 2009 Smith signed a two-year contract to join Rugby Union side the London Wasps after the Super League season had ended.\nLeeds won the Grand Final for a record third season in a row &amp; Smith marked, what should have been, his final game for the club with 2 tries in the 18–10 victory over St Helens at Old Trafford. This meant Smith had scored in three consecutive Grand Finals.\nReturn to Leeds.\nSmith was given the number 28 jersey. Smith effectively made his second début for Leeds on 1 April 2010 against Bradford, scoring 2 tries in a 20–20 draw.\nHe played in the 2010 Challenge Cup Final defeat by the Warrington Wolves at Wembley Stadium.\nSmith went on to make a further 22 appearances in 2010, scoring a further 8 tries.\nIn 2011 he visited and participated in the Wheelchair rugby league at Morley Leisure Centre.\nDuring the 2011 and 2012 seasons, Smith's game time was limited due to injury and the emergence of a number of young outside backs at Leeds.\nWakefield Trinity Wildcats.\nAs a result of limited gametime at Leeds he was allowed to join the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats mid-season in 2012 of which coach Richard Agar was very pleased.\nReturn to Wakefield.\nSmith returned to rugby league with Wakefield at the end of the 2015 Super League season, and played a key role in the club retaining their Super League status. Despite this, he once again left the club at the end of the 2015 season.\nHull FC.\nSmith earned himself a trial at Super League club Hull F.C. after impressing coach Lee Radford while training with the club.\nLeigh Centurions.\nSmith played for the Leigh Centurions during the 2016 season.\nBradford Bulls.\nSmith moved to the Bradford Bulls from the 2017 season. After a mixed 2017 he was named club captain under new coach John Kear for the 2018 season.\nInternational.\nHe was selected in 2006, along with six of his Leeds teammates, to represent England in the Federation Shield tournament. He scored a try in the opening match against France &amp; then scored a last minute try in England's second game against Tonga. He also came off the bench in the third game against Samoa. He then played in the final as England completed their unbeaten tournament with a 32–14 win, again over Tonga.\nSmith was selected for the England squad to compete in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup tournament in Australia. Group A's opening match against Papua New Guinea he played on the wing and scored three tries in England's victory. He then only made one further appearance as England endured a disappointing tournament, crashing out in the semi-finals without winning another match.\nSmith was selected for England again in 2009, for the Four Nations tournament. He scored a try in the victory over France and in the defeat by Australia but then missed out as England went on to lose in the final against Australia.\nRugby Union.\nLondon Wasps.\nSmith made just one appearance for the London Wasps, in a 9–3 victory against the Newcastle Falcons in the LV Cup on 7 February 2010, before his contract was mutually terminated. It is understood that Smith missing his home, family &amp; friends were the reason behind the termination. After what was one of the shortest code switches in history, Smith signed a three and a half-year deal with former club Leeds.\nNewcastle Falcons.\nOn 10 February 2014 he was drafted by Newcastle Falcons and in March of the same year played against Leicester Tigers."

A native of Havana, he was listed as tall and ; he batted and threw right-handed.\nRodríguez' professional career extended for 18 seasons, 1945 through 1962, but he would appear in only eight major league games during those brief, late-1950s trials, when he was already in his mid-30s. Apart from the wartime 1945 campaign, his first 11 seasons in Organized Baseball all were spent in the lowest levels of the minor leagues of the day: Classes B, C and D. Finally, in 1956, he rose to the Double-A and Triple-A levels.\nIn 1958, he was acquired by the Cubs and appeared in seven early-season games as a relief pitcher. He was credited with a save in his April 18 debut, hurling 1 innings of one-hit, scoreless ball against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field. He earned a second save nine days later when he preserved a 5–4 Cubs' triumph against the San Francisco Giants at Seals Stadium. At that point, Rodríguez' earned run average was a respectable 3.18, but he was hit hard in his next three outings, and by the time he was demoted to the minors after May 18, his ERA was a poor 7.36 in 7 innings pitched. Obtained by the Phillies during the 1958–1959 offseason, he received only a one-game audition in June, when he allowed three earned runs in two innings pitched in middle relief against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field on May 27. He then returned to the minor leagues for the next 3 seasons.\nIn his eight MLB games, Rodríguez allowed 12 hits (including three home runs) and five bases on balls in his career 9 innings pitched, with six strikeouts. Along with his two career saves, he compiled an ERA of 8.68. Fernando \"Freddy\" Rodríguez died in Miami, Florida, on June 11, 2009."

Over the span of his career, Hayden played for Villanova, the Penn Quakers, University of Maryland, Maryland Athletic Club and finally the Philadelphia Athletics of the 1902 National Football League. His football career continued in 1903 with the Franklin Athletic Club. In 1905, he was in the line-up for the Massillon Tigers of the \"Ohio League\". A year later he jumped to the rival Canton Bulldogs after being offered more money to play there by former Franklin teammate, Blondy Wallace. In 1906, he took part in the two football games between Canton and Massillon that were centered on the Canton Bulldogs–Massillon Tigers betting scandal. During the first game of that series against Massillon, Jack ran the team faultlessly and dropkicked a 35-yard field goal in the first half to put the Bulldogs in front 4–0 (field goals were worth 4 points at the time) and was one of the heroes of the game. However, in the team's second game against Massillon, six punts sailed over his head while playing the safety position.\nHayden died in Havertown, Pennsylvania, at age 61."

        "text": "David Nicholson (19 March 1939 – 27 August 2006) was a British National Hunt jockey and trainer. He was British jump racing Champion Trainer in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons.\nFamily and early life.\nNicholson was born at Epsom in 1939. His father Frenchie Nicholson, was also a successful jockey and National Hunt trainer. Nicholson's mother, Diana, was the great-granddaughter of William Holman, who trained three Grand National winners. He went to Haileybury College but was mainly educated for a horse racing career in his father's stable. As a young lad Nicholson was nicknamed 'The Duke' by other stable staff because of his manner and his inability to carry out menial work at the stable due to asthma and allergies. The nickname remained with him throughout his life\nHorse racing career.\nNicholson began as a flat racing jockey from the age of 12 but switched to National Hunt racing where his 6-foot height was better suited to the heavier weights carried by National Hunt jockeys. As a jockey he rode 583 winners over jumps between 1955 and 1974 and came third in the jockeys' championship in the 1964–65 season. His biggest win came in the Whitbread Gold Cup on Mill House in 1967. He rode the winner of the Welsh Grand National three years in succession from 1959 to 1961, and won four Cheltenham Festival races as a jockey.\nNicholson began training racehorses in 1968 while still a jockey. He was initially based at Condicote and had his first success when Arctic Coral won at Warwick in January 1969. He moved to a new stable, Jackdaws Castle, in 1992 after the failure of his business at Condicote. He continued to train there until his retirement in November 1999.\nAs a trainer he was one of the leading trainers in National Hunt racing during the 1980s and 1990s. He won the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Charter Party in 1988, the King George VI Chase with Barton Bank in 1993 and the Queen Mother Champion Chase with Viking Flagship in 1994 and 1995. He retired in 1999.\nIn 2008 an extra race was added to the Cheltenham Festival named the David Nicholson Mares' Hurdle in honour of Nicholson."

        "text": "Monday Night Miracle is a term used to describe the National Hockey League playoff game between the Calgary Flames and the St. Louis Blues that occurred on May 12, 1986. The Blues overcame a three-goal deficit with 12:00 remaining in the third period, and eventually won the game in overtime on a Doug Wickenheiser goal.\nBefore the Game.\nThe St. Louis Blues finished the 1985–86 NHL season in third place in the Norris Division with 37–34–9 record for 83 points. In the playoffs, the Blues defeated the Minnesota North Stars in the Norris Division semifinals, then pulled out a 4–3 series win against the Toronto Maple Leafs to earn the Norris Division title and advanced to the Campbell Conference finals.\nThe Calgary Flames finished the 1985–86 NHL season in second place in the Smythe Division with a 40–31–9 record for 89 points. In the playoffs, the Flames defeated the Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division semifinals, then pulled out a 4–3 series upset against the heavily-favored and provincial rival, the Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division final to end the Oilers' hopes of winning a third consecutive championship.\nAs a result, the Blues and Flames met in the Campbell Conference finals in an unlikely series. At stake was a berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. The teams split the first four games of the series, with the Flames winning game five at home on May 10 to push St. Louis to the brink of elimination. This set the stage for game six two days later on the Blues' home ice in the St. Louis Arena.\nMonday Night Miracle.\nKen Wilson had the announcing duties for the local St. Louis and ESPN television broadcast of the game (the Blues regular television broadcaster, Dan Kelly, was calling the series on CTV in Canada), and he watched Calgary build a 4–1 lead. St. Louis scored their second goal of the game with about 15 seconds remaining in a 5-on-3 powerplay goal by Doug Wickenheiser, only to have that momentum temporarily stifled as Joe Mullen answered by scoring Calgary's fifth goal of the game. The Blues subsequently found themselves trailing 5–2 at home with 12 minutes remaining in the third period. The Blues began their rally when Brian Sutter scored off a deflection off Calgary goalie Mike Vernon, and the 5–3 score carried down to eight minutes remaining in the game. Greg Paslawski was the next Blues player to score, making the score 5–4. Amid an electric atmosphere and impending sense of upset, broadcaster Wilson commented on the Blues:\nUnfortunately for the Blues, the clock dipped under two minutes remaining in the game as they still searched for the game-tying goal. With only 1:17 remaining in the game, the Blues shot the puck behind Calgary's net from the neutral zone. As Calgary defenseman Jamie Macoun brought the puck from behind the net, he didn't notice that Paslawski was right behind him. Stealing the puck at the side of the net, Paslawski flung a quick shot from a terrible angle that caught goalie Mike Vernon off guard. The puck went in the net, and with near-pandemonium in the Arena, the Blues burned the remaining time on the clock to force overtime.\nOvertime.\nOvertime quickly became another heart-racing experience in itself, as players like Calgary's Al MacInnis and the Blues' Doug Wickenheiser took shots at the net. Calgary then came within inches of winning when Joe Mullen took a slapshot from just inside the blue line that hit off the goalpost. A short time after that near-miss, and with future Blues franchise player Brett Hull watching from the press box as a member of the Calgary Flames, announcer Wilson called what many consider the greatest moment in St. Louis Blues history:\nThe goal came after 7:30 had already passed in the overtime period. It is considered to be one of the most memorable victories in Blues history.\nAftermath.\nWickenheiser's overtime goal set off the crowd at the Arena, a mass of cheering and celebration that continued well after both teams had left the ice. St. Louis couldn't rest on their laurels though, as they still faced an uphill battle by having to play Game 7 on Calgary's home ice, the Olympic Saddledome, two days later. St. Louis made things interesting, but lost game seven by the score of 2–1. Wickenheiser died from multiple forms of cancer at the age of 37 on January 12, 1999.\nOn March 7, 1988, both teams made a notable trade in which Rick Wamsley and Rob Ramage went to the Flames while Brett Hull and Steve Bozek went to the Blues. On September 6, 1988, the Blues traded Doug Gilmour, Mark Hunter, Bozek, and Michael Dark were sent to Calgary in exchange for Mike Bullard, Craig Coxe, and Tim Corkery. Bozek was later traded to the Vancouver Canucks the same day. This trade was beneficial to both teams as Gilmour, M. Hunter, Ramage, and Wamsley were on the team when Calgary won the 1989 Stanley Cup while Hull became the Blue's all-time goal scorer with 594 goals, including playoffs and single-season goal scorer with 86."

        "text": "The Monday Night Miracle was an NFL Monday night game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins played at Giants Stadium on October 23, 2000. The Jets scored 30 points in the fourth quarter, twice tying the score, and sending the game into overtime, where they defeated the Dolphins, 40–37.\nBackground.\nLike their 1994 showdown at Giants Stadium which was made famous by Dan Marino's \"fake spike\", this game was for first place in the AFC East as the Jets were 4-1 and the Dolphins were 5-0. But unlike the 1994 game which featured the Jets failing to hold a double-digit (18) lead in the second half, it was the Dolphins who failed to hold the lead.\nThe game is notable for having the second largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history and the largest comeback in Jets history. It was also voted the greatest game televised on ABC's \"Monday Night Football\", along with being #5 on NFL Top Ten's \"Top Ten Comebacks\".\nAt the end of the third quarter with the score 30–7 in Miami's favor, Jets broadcaster Howard David announced, \"And with a whole quarter to go, this game is over.\"\nJets comeback.\nThe Jets proceeded to stage a furious rally in the fourth quarter, scoring 23 unanswered points to tie the game at 30. They scored three touchdowns and a field goal, but a two-point conversion attempt to Curtis Martin was stopped. On the Dolphins' first play from scrimmage after the game was tied, they took the lead on a long touchdown pass by Jay Fiedler to Leslie Shepherd. However, the Jets still managed to drive downfield and tie the game. One of the key plays was a 4th down catch at the Dolphins 2-yard line by Richie Anderson as he caught the ball despite a head-on hit by Zach Thomas and Dolphins defensive back Jerry Wilson. Improbably, the tying touchdown was caught by offensive tackle John \"Jumbo\" Elliott, playing as a tackle-eligible. After Elliott caught the touchdown pass, Dennis Miller remarked how opposing defenses, \"couldn't keep him down forever.\" In the overtime Fiedler was intercepted by Marcus Coleman but Coleman was hit by Thurman Thomas and fumbled the ball back to the Dolphins. Several plays later, Coleman intercepted Fiedler again and this time held on. An eventual Vinny Testaverde pass to Wayne Chrebet put the Jets in field goal range, and a pass that was nearly intercepted by Jerry Wilson hit the ground first, nullifying the turnover. Jets kicker John Hall then won the game with a field goal with 8:13 remaining in the extra session.\nActor Arnold Schwarzenegger, while visiting the ABC broadcast booth, said after halftime, \nThe Monday night game for the Jets was in between Games 2 and 3 of the All New York (Yankees vs. Mets) 2000 World Series. The series overshadowed the game. In fact, the crowd broke out into \"Let's Go Yankees\" chants countered by \"Let's Go Mets\" chants during the third quarter."

The Maple Leafs won the series four games to three, despite leading 3–0 in a situation similar to 1942.\nPaths to the Finals.\nToronto beat the defending champion Montreal Canadiens in six games to advance to the Finals. Detroit defeated the Boston Bruins in seven games to reach the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup Finals in NHL history where both teams started rookie goaltenders. Harry Lumley, who had become the youngest goaltender to play in the league the previous year, was in the Wings' net, while Frank McCool substituted for regular Maple Leafs netminder Turk Broda, who was in Europe with the Canadian army at the time.\nIn the first three games, which were low-scoring goaltenders' duels, McCool did not allow the Wings a single goal, the first time one team shut out the other for the first three games in Stanley Cup Finals history. In addition, Toronto now stood one win away from sweeping Detroit, as the Red Wings' Mud Bruneteau noted after game three. The last time the two teams had met in the Finals, in , Toronto had beaten Detroit—after going down three games to none, becoming the first professional sports team in North America to win a playoff round in such a fashion. Fittingly enough, the Red Wings did the coming back this time, as their offense finally caught fire.\nIn game four, the Maple Leafs had a chance to win the Cup on Maple Leaf Gardens ice, but the Red Wings got on the board for the first time in the series when Flash Hollett opened the scoring 8:35 into the game, ending McCool's shutout streak at 193:09 (dating back to the semifinals against Montreal). Four other Detroit players, including rookie Ted Lindsay (who scored what transpired to be the game-winner at 3:20 of the third period), scored to overcome Ted Kennedy's hat trick.\nGames five and six were Lumley's time to shine, shutting out the Leafs, including an overtime shutout in the sixth game, and extending the Finals. The series returned to Detroit for a seventh game, the Wings hoping to avenge their \"choking\" against the Leafs in 1942.\nGame seven.\nToronto coach Hap Day almost had to eat his words of a few years back when he said of the Leafs' 1942 comeback from being down 3–0 in games, \"There will never be another experience like this.\" Babe Pratt, however, scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory that saved the Maple Leafs from being the victim of a great comeback win by the Red Wings. Lumley left the ice almost immediately after the end of the game, but a Detroit Olympia crowd chant of \"We want Lumley!\" brought him back. Lumley would go on to a Hockey Hall of Fame career. and McCool played just 22 more games in the NHL, as Broda returned to the Leafs in January 1946.\nThis was the first time in the history of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals that the home team lost. Of the next fifteen finals that went the full seven games (as of the end of the 2022 series), this only happened four more times: , , , and .\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1945 Stanley Cup was presented to Maple Leafs captain Bob Davidson by NHL President Red Dutton following the Maple Leafs 2–1 win over the Red Wings in game seven.\nThe following Maple Leafs players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1944–45 Toronto Maple Leafs"

        "text": "Inside baseball is a strategy in baseball that centers on tactics that keep the ball in the infield.\nIt was developed by the 19th-century Baltimore Orioles and promoted by John McGraw. In his book, \"My Thirty Years In Baseball\", McGraw credits the development of the \"inside baseball\" to manager Ned Hanlon. In the 1890s, this type of play was referred to as \"Oriole baseball\" or \"Baltimore baseball\".\nDescription.\nInside baseball is an offensive strategy that focuses on teamwork and good execution. It usually centers on tactics that keep the ball in the infield: walks, base hits, bunts, and stolen bases. One such play, where the batter deliberately strikes the pitched ball downward onto the infield surface with sufficient force such that the ball rebounds skyward, allowing the batter to reach first base safely before the opposing team can field the ball, remains known as a Baltimore chop. \nAnother term in use in the 1890s for this style was \"scientific baseball\", referring to calculated one-run game strategies based on intelligent, cooperative actions of the players. An article in \"The New York Times\" published in 1911 described \"scientific baseball\":Scientific baseball of to-day – \"inside ball\" they call it – consists in making the opposing team think you are going to make a play one way, then shift suddenly and do it in another.\nMcGraw in his book writes: \"So-called inside baseball is mostly bunk. It is merely working out of definite plans that the public does not observe\".\nThis strategy did not rely on big hits and home runs and became the primary offensive strategy during the dead-ball era. \nThe equivalent modern term is \"small ball\".\nCritics also note that the reputation of the Orioles for the \"inside baseball\" grew only in retrospect. At the time, the Orioles were more famous for deliberately playing dirty."

        "text": "The Brisbane Irish Rugby Football Club is an Australian rugby union club, based in Brisbane, \nQueensland. The club currently competes in the Queensland Suburban competition. Brisbane Irish won a prominent trade mark dispute with multi national company McDonald's over the use of the sponsorship logo \"McBrat\" in 2005. The club was established in 1996 and is now one of the largest suburban rugby clubs in Brisbane. \nHistory.\nBrisbane Irish Rugby Football Club originated as the Terrace Old Boys formed in 1994. A meeting of the team's players at Dooley's Irish Pub gave birth to the Brisbane Irish Rugby Football Club in 1996. The club operated out of Gregory Terrace's Tennyson playing fields until 1999 when the club moved for one season to Kenmore.\nIn 2000 the Brisbane Irish did not compete and in 2001, thanks largely to Paul Quaglia, Tom Nicol and Brendan Yantsch, the club re-formed and operated out of Purtell Park at Bardon in partnership with the West (Brisbane) Junior Rugby League Club. In 2007 the Brisbane Irish relocated to their current home ground Memorial Park, Enoggera in partnership with the Everton Park Rugby Union Sporting Association.\nIn 2003 the Irish expanded the club with 1st and 2nd Grade teams competing in the Queensland Suburban Division II competition. In 2005 the Irish 1st Grade team qualified for the club's first ever Grand Final and were runners up. In 2006 the club qualified both 1st and 2nd grade teams in the finals with the 2nds playing in the Grand Final and were also runners up.\nIn 2007 the club expanded again and fielded three senior teams in the first division Barber and Pegg Caps as well as the Scotney Cup, which it won in 2008. The Irish then went through a period of consolidation but produced a strong season in 2013, despite some key injuries, to reach the semi-final stage of the Barber Cup. The club competed in both the Barber and Pegg Cups in 2014.\nHome of the \"McBrats\".\nThe Brisbane Irish Rugby Football Club shot to national and international prominence when multinational company McDonald's filed a trademark dispute in March 2005 with the Australian Trademarks office over the club's use of \"McBrat\" on their playing shorts. McBrat, the sponsorship logo of former player and club sponsor Malcom McBratney, became the centre of a well publicised dispute as McDonald's claimed the prefix \"Mc\" as a trademark of the burger giant.\nThe story resonated throughout the world as the Brisbane Irish gained national and international coverage in their David v Goliath battle. Media agencies in Australia, New Zealand, England, Canada, France, Belgium and South Africa all reported in both television and print media the plight of the Brisbane Irish. In August 2006 the Australia Trademarks Office delivered its decision in favour of the Brisbane Irish and sponsor Malcom McBratney enabling the continued use of McBrat on the club's playing shorts.\nThe Brisbane Irish has since become one of Brisbane's leading Irish ex-pat organisations whose presence at \"Irish\" events and comment on Irish related news is often sought after. The McBrats have become one of the prominent Irish identities in Brisbane with national and international appeal and is one of the most recognisable clubs in Queensland Rugby. The Brisbane Irish play an annual rugby match against Sydney Irish, usually held on the Gold Coast."

        "text": "In baseball, an ace is a starting pitcher considered the best pitcher on a team's starting rotation. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, a team's ace typically starts on Opening Day. In addition, aces are usually preferred to start crucial playoff games, sometimes on three days' rest.\nThe term may be a derivation of the nickname of Asa Brainard (real first name: \"Asahel\"), a 19th-century star pitcher, who was sometimes referred to as \"Ace\".\nIn the early days of baseball, the term \"ace\" was used to refer to a run.\nModern baseball analysts and fans have started using the term \"ace\" to refer to the elite pitchers in the game, not necessarily to the best starting pitcher on each team. For example, the April 27, 1981, \"Sports Illustrated\" cover was captioned \"The Amazing A's and Their Five Aces\" to describe the starting rotation of the 1981 Oakland Athletics."

The Maple Leafs won the series four games to two. This was the first all-Canadian Finals since , when the since-folded Montreal Maroons defeated the Maple Leafs.\nPaths to the Finals.\nMontreal defeated the Boston Bruins 4–1 to advance to the Finals. Toronto defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4–1 to advance to the Finals.\nThe Montreal Canadiens finished first in the league with 78 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs finished second with 72 points. This was the fifth playoff series between these two teams with each team winning two of the previous series. Their most recent series came in the 1945 semifinals which Toronto won in six games. In the regular season series, there were five wins for Montreal, three wins for Toronto and four ties.\nGame summaries.\nTed Kennedy was the leader with three goals including the Cup winner. Toronto had several new players in its lineup, including Howie Meeker, Bill Barilko and Bill Ezinicki, as Toronto sported the youngest NHL team to win the Cup to that time.\nThe series continued a competition that had gone on all season, with Montreal and Toronto finishing 1–2. Montreal coach Dick Irvin was mad at the beginning of the series, recalling a season-ending injury to Montreal forward Elmer Lach from a body check by Don Metz. Montreal started out strong in the series, defeating the Leafs 6–0 in the opener. Canadiens goaltender Bill Durnan reportedly asked \"How did those guys get in the league?\", although he denied saying those words later.\nThe second game was a rough game, with Maurice Richard knocking out Vic Lynn and Bill Ezinicki with high-sticks to the head. Richard earned himself over 20 minutes in penalties and a game misconduct and a suspension for game three. The Leafs took advantage of the power plays and defeated Montreal 4–0. Richard would earn himself a further $250 fine imposed by president Clarence Campbell.\nGames three and four were played in Toronto, and Toronto won both to take a 3–1 series lead. Returning to the Forum for game five, Montreal won the game to extend the series. In the sixth game, Turk Broda showed outstanding goaltending, holding off Ken Reardon on a late breakaway, and the Leafs won 2–1 to win the Stanley Cup.\nAfter the sixth game ended, the Cup was not presented to the Leafs. Clarence Campbell declined to present the Cup immediately, concerned over the spectre of fan violence.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1947 Stanley Cup was presented to Maple Leafs captain Syl Apps by NHL President Clarence Campbell following the Maple Leafs 2–1 win over the Canadiens in game six.\nThe following Maple Leafs players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1946–47 Toronto Maple Leafs"

        "text": "Robert W. \"Bud\" Moore (born October 16, 1939) is an American former college football player and coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Kansas from 1975 to 1978, compiling a record of 18–26–1. In his first season in 1975, Moore was named Big Eight Coach of the Year and was runner-up to Woody Hayes of Ohio State as the Football Writers Association of America National Coach of the Year. Moore led his team to a 23–3 upset over eventual national champion Oklahoma, breaking the Sooners' 37-game unbeaten streak and handing coach Barry Switzer his first loss.\nPlaying career.\nMoore is a native Birmingham, Alabama, where he attended West End High School. He played football at the University of Alabama under Bear Bryant from 1958–1960.\nCoaching career.\nMoore's first coaching job out of college was as an assistant at Gadsden High School in Gadsden, Alabamain 1961. He left that job in 1962 to join Charlie Bradshaw's staff at the University of Kentucky as offensive line coach. He departed Kentucky after the 1964 season to become offensive coordinator at Texas A&amp;M University under new head coach Gene Stallings. Moore left Texas A&amp;M in early 1971 to become offensive line coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under Bill Dooley. Moore replaced Jimmy Vickers, who departed to take the same job at the University of Georgia. Moore returned to Alabama in 1972 to coach the offensive backfield under Bryant, and was named offensive coordinator for the 1974 season. Following the 1974 season, he was hired as the head coach at the University of Kansas, succeeding Don Fambrough.\nThe Jayhawks switched to the wishbone formation when Moore came to Lawrence. Kansas' wishbone was piloted by quarterback Nolan Cromwell, who was named 1975 Big Eight Offensive Player of the Year and later went on to an 11-year Pro Bowl career as a defensive back with the Los Angeles Rams. In 1976, the Jayhawks started 4-0 and were ranked 8th in the AP poll (the last time they would be ranked in 17 years), but after QB Cromwell suffered a season-ending knee injury against Oklahoma, KU finished 6–5. Moore was the first KU coach with back-to-back winning seasons since Jack Mitchell in 1961-62, but this success was followed by 4–6–1 in 1977 and then 1–10 in 1978. In spite of dominating rivals Missouri and Kansas State, these struggles, failure to improve facilities, plus lagging attendance, led to Moore's firing as head coach after four seasons.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Moore entered private business. In 1994, he was honored on National Philanthropy Day by the West Florida chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals. He has been active in bird dog field trials and showing Tennessee Walking Horses, having raised and owned multiple national champions in both venues. He received the Paul W. Bryant Alumni-Athlete Award in 1995. The award is given to a former University of Alabama athlete in recognition of character, contribution to society, professional achievement, and service to fellow man. Moore is a member of the University of Kansas Athletics Hall of Fame, and in 2019 was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame."

This result meant that they finished the tournament in fifth place for the second time in history (1954 was the previous instance). The coach was Telê Santana and captain Sócrates.  \nQualifying.\nFebruary 8, 1981, Caracas, Venezuela - 0 - 1 \nFebruary 22, 1981, La Paz, Bolivia - 1 - 2 \nMarch 22, 1981, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 3 - 1 \nMarch 29, 1981, Goiânia, Brazil - 5 - 0 \nBrazil qualified.\nThe Cup.\nFirst Group Round.\nAll eyes were on Brazil in Group 6. In Zico, Sócrates, Falcão, Éder and others, the rejuvenated \"auriverde\" boasted an offensive firepower that promised a return to the glory days of 1970. The \"tri-campeão\" lived up to all expectations in the First Group round, beating an unexpectedly strong Soviet side 2–1 in a very entertaining first match thanks to a 20-metre Éder goal two minutes from time, then Scotland and New Zealand, scoring four goals each time.\nSecond Group Round.\nIt was in Group C, a true \"Group of Death\" with Brazil, Argentina and Italy, that World Cup history was made. In the opener, the \"Azzurri\" prevailed 2–1 over Diego Maradona's side in an ill-tempered game in which Italy defenders Gaetano Scirea and Claudio Gentile proved to be able to stop the Argentinian attack.\nArgentina now needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but they were no match. Although the Brazilians had the better of the play, Maradona's Argentina side continued pushing for an equaliser and had a clear penalty denied by the referee . After that, Brazil scored twice, and Maradona was sent off after he kicked a rival in a moment of unsportsmanship.\nThe third-day match between Brazil and Italy would be a game to remember. Twice Italy went in the lead through Paolo Rossi's goals, and twice Brazil came back. At 2-2, Brazil would have gone through on goal difference, but on 74 minutes, a poor clearance from an Italy corner kick went back to the Brazil six-yard line where Rossi and Francesco Graziani were waiting. Both world-class strikers reflexively aimed at the same shot, Rossi connecting and sending Italy to the semifinals in one of the all-time great games of World Cup history. "

The Missouri Valley League folded after 1905, and the Oilers became a charter member of the South Central League.\nUnder managers Frank Smith and Bill Rupp, the Oilers finished the 1906 season with a 45–42 record. The League folded, and the Oilers played in the Oklahoma–Arkansas–Kansas League in 1907. They finished with a 37–60 record, under Hall of Fame manager Jake Beckley. The Oklahoma–Arkansas–Kansas League saw two teams leave, so in 1908 the Oilers played in the Oklahoma–Kansas League, which was just the aforementioned Oklahoma–Arkansas–Kansas League minus a couple teams. They finished with the second best record in the league – 69–55 under managers Harry B. \"Deacon\" White and Stu McBirney. The league folded after only one year of existence as well.\nThe Tulsa Oilers did not organize in 1909. However, in 1910, they played in the Western Association. On July 22, the Tulsa Oilers team disbanded.\nFrom 1911 to 1913, the Tulsa Oilers were not involved in organized baseball. However, in 1914 they rejoined the Western Association, leading the league with a 74–49 record under manager Howard Price. Even after such an impressive season, the Oilers disbanded again, and baseball would not be played under that name until 1919. (Until 1917 Tulsa had a team in the Western Association called the Tulsa Producers.)\nWestern League.\nIn 1919, the Oilers joined the Western League, where they played from 1919 until 1929, and in 1932. Their performance during those years can be seen in the following chart.\nFrom 1922 to 1924, Oilers star Lyman Lamb hit 68, 71 and 100 doubles, respectively – the latter of which is a minor league record.\nIn 1930, McNulty Park was declared unsuitable by the city. The team opted to move Topeka, Kansas for a spell while plans for a replacement were drawn up. In 1930 and 1931, they were known as the Topeka Senators. They returned to Tulsa in 1932, temporarily playing at Fairgrounds Park.\nAlthough 1932 was the Oilers' final season in the Western League, it was also the first season in which they were actually affiliated with a Major League team – the Pittsburgh Pirates. That affiliation lasted that year only, however. The 1932 Oilers were recognized as number 83 on Minor League Baseball's list of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.\nTexas League.\nFrom 1933 to 1942, the Oilers played in the Texas League. In 1936, they won the league championship and the Dixie Series, a postseason interleague championship between the winners of the Southern Association and the Texas League. From 1940 to 1942, they were affiliated with the Chicago Cubs. The Texas League was shut down from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II, but when it started up again in 1946, the Oilers again played in the league until 1965. In 1946 and 1947, they were affiliated with the Cubs, but in 1948 they became affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds. They stayed affiliated with the Reds until 1954. In 1955, they were a Cleveland Indians affiliate; in 1956, they were again a Cubs affiliate. From 1957 to 1958, they were a Philadelphia Phillies affiliate. For the rest of their existence, they were a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate.\nIn their second year in the Texas League, the Oilers got a new home, Texas League Park. However, it was not well maintained over the years; its dilapidated condition was obvious as early as the 1950s. In 1961, the team was nearly moved to Albuquerque partly due to the stadium's poor state of repair, but A. Ray Smith bought out the previous owner and heavily renovated the park, renaming it Oiler Park. The following shows the Oilers' performance during their years in the Texas League:\nAAA years.\nIn 1966, the Oilers moved up to AAA baseball as part of the Pacific Coast League. In their first year, they won the Eastern Division, then lost the championship series to the Seattle Angels, 4 games to 3. The following year, future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn took over as manager; he would ultimately become the winningest manager in Oilers history. After a poor 1967 season, in 1968 the Oilers had one of their best seasons ever, winning the Eastern Division, then winning the PCL championship series 4 games to 1 over the Spokane Indians. Oiler outfielder Jim Hicks was named MVP of the PCL.\nDuring their final eight years of existence, the Oilers were members of the American Association. They won the league championship twice. In 1973, the Oilers led the West Division, then won the league playoff 4 games to 3 over the Iowa Oaks. The Oilers went on to play in the 1973 Junior World Series, where they lost 4 games to 1 to the Pawtucket Red Sox. The Oilers repeated as league champions in 1974, again winning the West Division and then beating the Indianapolis Indians 4 games to 3. (There was no Junior World Series that year.) The following chart lists their performance during their final eight years of existence:\nThrough their many years of existence, the Oilers had had many big names both play for and manage the team. Jake Beckley, Gus Weyhing, Deacon White, Gus Mancuso, Marty McManus, Whitey Kurowski, Warren Spahn and Ken Boyer all managed for the team at one point or another. Steve Carlton, Mike Torrez, Ted Simmons, Nelson Briles, Jerry Reuss, Keith Hernandez, Bob Forsch, Dal Maxvill and Mike Easler all played for the team.\nBy the end of the 1976 season, the Oilers were again faced with the deteriorating condition of Oiler Park. Smith had poured significant resources into keeping the park at something approaching Triple-A standards. However, it was obvious that the park was nearing the end of its useful life. When Smith was unable to get commitments for a new park, or at least further public or private funding for badly-needed upgrades to Oiler Park, he moved the team to New Orleans after the 1976 season. For one year they were the New Orleans Pelicans, then moved on to Springfield, Illinois, and in 1982 to Louisville, Kentucky, where the team set minor league attendance records and is now called the Louisville Bats.\nTulsa was not without baseball for long, however; shortly after the Oilers announced they were leaving town, the Lafayette Drillers of the Texas League moved to Tulsa as the Tulsa Drillers. The Drillers have been a mainstay of the Texas League ever since; they played at Oiler Park from 1977 to 1980 until Robert B. Sutton Stadium, later Tulsa County Stadium and then Drillers Stadium, opened in 1981. They now play at ONEOK Field."

        "text": "The Auckland rugby league team is the team which traditionally represents all of the clubs which play in the Auckland Rugby League competition. As well as a senior men's team there are also Auckland representative teams throughout the various age groups such as under 15s, under 17s, under 19s and under 21s.\nUnder the new zone scheme introduced in 2010 the Auckland team represents the North Shore, East Auckland and West Auckland, while South Auckland is represented by the Counties Manukau rugby league team. The zone team is named the Akarana Falcons.\nHistory.\nAuckland played its first game on 24 August 1908 when they took on Wellington at Victoria Park, Auckland in the first provincial game of rugby league in New Zealand. The Auckland Rugby League had not yet been formed so the side was not an official one as such.\nAuckland had played against several touring teams over the years, though once the Auckland Warriors started playing in the 1995 ARL Premiership it diluted the standard of the representative side, and they have not played against full international sides in recent years. Auckland beat Australia, England and France in the space of 21 days in 1977. A feat which the Warriors commemorated by wearing replica strips in their clash with Australian club Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in round 24 of the 2007 NRL season on 26 August 2007. The Warriors won 36–14 in front of a packed Mount Smart Stadium.\nCurrent Auckland teams.\nThe Akarana Falcons participate in the Albert Baskerville Trophy. This team represents the Hibiscus Coast Raiders, Richmond Bulldogs, Mt Wellington Warriors, Ponsonby Ponies, Glenora Bears, Ellerslie Eagles, Mt Albert Lions, Te Atatu Roosters, Bay Roskill Vikings, Northcote Tigers, Marist Saints, East Coast Bays Barracudas, Pt Chevalier Pirates, Waitemata Seagulls, Glenfield Greyhounds, New Lynn Stags and the Waiheke Rams.\nColours.\nAuckland representative sides traditionally wear a blue jersey with a white double 'V', in the same style of the New Zealand national rugby league team jersey but with blue instead of black, this is still the jersey worn by the Auckland Vulcans NSW Cup team.\nRecord versus overseas touring teams.\n1910 Auckland v Great Britain.\nThe team for the match was: (fullback) Alf Chorley; (three-quarters) L Nolan, George Smith, Albert Asher; (five-eights) Alfred Jackson, Ronald MacDonald; (halfback) Len Farrant; (forwards) Fred Jackson (captain), Charles Dunning, Jim Griffin, Alex Stanaway, Harry Fricker, and George Seagar. The emergency players named were (backs) Sid Riley, Arthur Carlaw; (forwards) Joe Bennett, Jim Rukutai, and Bob Mitchell.\n1912 Auckland v New South Wales.\nAuckland won their first victory over an ‘international’ side when they defeated New South Wales by 10 points to 3. The game was marred by several acts of violence with the visiting side said to be at fault repeatedly. Near the end of the match Sid Deane was sent off for punching Billy Curran.\n1912 Auckland v New South Wales.\nNew South Wales reversed their earlier loss with a comprehensive win over a disappointing Auckland effort. Charles Dunning and Bob Mitchell who had both been named to play originally were forced to withdraw due to illness and were replaced by Harry Fricker and Jim Griffin.\n1922 Auckland v Australian Universities.\nThe Australian University team was made up of players from Sydney University and Brisbane University.\n1922 Auckland v New South Wales.\nAuckland played the touring New South Wales team in front of 20,000 spectators at the Auckland Domain but was heavily defeated with Australian legend Frank Burge running in 5 tries.\n1922 Auckland Province v New South Wales.\nA few days after the match with New South Wales an Auckland provincial team took on the touring side. The Auckland team was largely made up of Auckland club players but also included Bill Te Whata who had played in Australia for the New Zealand Māori side, and a handful of others from the Waikato including former Auckland player Tim Peckham. They lost a tight match by 21 points to 20. Frank Burge was ordered off for disputing Wilson's try late in the match.\n1924 Auckland v Australian Universities.\nFrank Delgrosso had to come on the replace George Davidson after he collided badly with teammate Clarrie Polson when they were both going after the ball. Polson received a bad cut over his eye and he also later had to retire and was replaced by Billy Ghent.\n1924 Auckland v England.\nThere is film footage of the match taken by Tarr Film and archived on the New Zealand Archive of Film, television and Sound Ngā Taonga website. In scoring on halftime Ben Davidson was knocked out. At the start of the second half Auckland attempted to replace him with Lou Brown who ran out on to the field. However the England captain when seeing this objected as replacements were forbidden in the second half of rugby league matches at this time. Auckland were forced to play with 12 players for a time until Davidson recovered well enough to return to the field.\n1928 Auckland Province v England.\nThe entire Auckland Provincial team were Auckland club players aside from Joe Menzies.\n1935 Auckland v Australia (Australian tour match).\nAustralian legend Dave Brown who was renowned for his point scoring feats and was referred to as \"the Bradman of league\" scored 10 of Australia's 16 points. This was the first match Australia had played in New Zealand since their 1919 tour.\n1936 Auckland v England.\nThe Auckland team had been selected by Bert Avery and coached by Bert Cooke. Auckland competed well against a very strong England team before going down 22–16. Walter Cuthbert donated a trophy (a cap) for the best Auckland player which was selected by an Mr. R.F. Anderton, the touring teams co-manager as being Steve Watene. It was presented to him at the Auckland annual prize giving in November.\n1946\n1949\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1960\n1961\n1962\n1965\n1969\n1971\n1974\n1975\n1977\n1980\n1981\n1985\n1988\n1989\n1990\nOther matches.\n1949, Auckland Colts 16 Australia 30 (Carlaw Park)\n1984, Auckland 16 Great Britain 14 (Carlaw Park)\nAuckland representative record by year and decade.\nThis does not include matches by Auckland Province which typically had players from the Waikato region in the early decades as it was a sub-union of Auckland. It also does not include matches by or between Auckland Pākehā and Auckland Māori.\nAuckland Māori v Auckland Pākehā.\nIn 1936 the first ever match was played between Auckland Pākehā and Auckland Māori. It became an annual fixture thanks largely to the efforts of the Manukau club which successfully recruited brilliant Māori footballers from around the Auckland region and much of the North Island. Some of those players included Jack Hemi, Angus Gault, Frank Pickrang, Jack Brodrick, Tom Chase, Jack Broughton, Tame Kawe, Pita Ririnui, George Nepia, Jim Murray, Aubrey Thompson, George Shilton and many others."

        "text": "Scott M. Gordon (born February 6, 1963) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former professional goaltender. He is currently an assistant coach for the San Jose Sharks. He previously served as the head coach of the NHL's New York Islanders from 2008 to 2010 and the head coach of the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers in the 2018–19, and, as well as the head coach of the Providence Bruins and Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League (AHL) between 2002 and 2021.

The Bruins had a 55–18–3–4 record, earning 117 points. Providence quickly swept the Manchester Monarchs in the first round of the playoffs, but the Bruins were upset by the Portland Pirates in the Atlantic Division Finals. After the season, Gordon won the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award as Coach of the Year in the AHL.\nOn August 12, 2008, Gordon left the Bruins to become the head coach of the New York Islanders in the NHL.\nNew York Islanders (2008–2011).\nGordon made his NHL head coaching debut on October 10, 2008, as the Islanders lost to the New Jersey Devils, 2–1.

The Islanders struggled throughout the season, finishing 26–47–9, earning 61 points and last place in the Atlantic Division, missing the playoffs.\nIn 2009–10, the Islanders improved to a 34–37–11 record, getting 79 points, but missed the playoffs once again.\nThe Islanders once again struggled at the start of the 2010–11, as the club had a record of 4–10–3 in their first 17 games to quickly fall out of the playoff picture. On November 15, 2010, the Islanders fired Gordon, replacing him with Jack Capuano.

He often played in a front row partnership with Staff Jones and Graham Price at Pontypool RFC and was part of the 1983 Pontypool side to win the Schweppes Cup. Although he toured with a Welsh XV to Canada in 1980, the game did not grant the Welsh players any caps.\nJones learnt his rugby under the tutelage of Laurie Daniel who was a former Welsh international who played for Pontypool and Newport. He later turned to coaching and in the 1996/97 season became the first full-time coach of Newport.\nIn 1999, Jones became head coach at Pontypool and revitalised the club, signing experienced players such as Byron Hayward, Mark Jones and Kuli Faletau. Steve coached Pontypool to second place in the Welsh Division 1 in season 2001/2.

        "text": "George Donald Young ( – ) was an American football defensive end who played eight seasons in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and in the National Football League (NFL) with the Cleveland Browns. He later was an umpire officiating in the American Football League (AFL) for its entire existence, from 1960 through 1969. He officiated in the first AFL championship in 1960 and the first Super Bowl after the 1966 season.\nYoung grew up in a poor family outside of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He was a star athlete in high school, playing on his football team and winning a state heavyweight title in wrestling as a senior. Young attended the University of Georgia and was on the Bulldogs football team in 1941 and 1942, when the school won the Rose Bowl. He then spent three years in the military during World War II and played service football as he trained in the U.S. Navy. He played in 1944 for Paul Brown, then the head football coach at a Naval facility outside Chicago. After the war, Brown became head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the AAFC and signed Young. He played on the defensive line for the Browns until his retirement in 1953, a span during which the team won five league championships. After his playing career, Young worked as an executive at a utility in Illinois and officiated in the AFL. He died of a brain tumor in 1969.\nEarly life and college career.\nYoung grew up poor in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Wilkes-Barre. His mother died when he was 10 years old, and dinner often consisted of canned beans or soup. Despite a bad diet, Young grew to six feet, three inches and more than 200 pounds. He played three years as an end on his Forty Fort High School football team and was also a wrestler, winning the state heavyweight title as a senior.\nThe head of a soft drink bottling company in Wilkes-Barre helped Young get into the University of Georgia, where he played football on the varsity team starting as a freshman. He was on a Georgia Bulldogs football team that won the Rose Bowl after the 1942 season.\nSoon after the game, Young entered the U.S. military as America's involvement in World War II intensified. He was sent as a Navy cadet to Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago and played on a service football team there coached by Paul Brown in 1944. The following year, he was transferred to Fleet City, a complex of Naval bases in California, and played on a Fleet City Bluejackets team that won the service national championship.\nAt Fleet City, doctors discovered Young had a large growth of calcium on his right thigh bone. They wanted to operate and thought it would grow larger, but told Young he would lose significant use of his leg after surgery. He elected not to have the operation and hope for the best. The deposit grew to 9 1/2 inches before it stopped; it did not affect his ability to run.\nCleveland Browns.\nAfter the war, Paul Brown became the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, a professional team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference. He invited Young to try out for the squad. Young barely made the team and played sparingly in the Browns' first season in 1946, when the team won the first AAFC championship.\nYoung almost failed make the roster again in 1947, but thereafter became a stalwart on the Browns' defensive line as a defensive end whose job it was to disrupt opponents' running and passing attacks. The Browns won the following three AAFC championships, helped by a staunch defense and a high-scoring offense featuring quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. Young continued his academic studies during the offseason – his career at Georgia was cut short by the war – and received a degree from Baldwin–Wallace College in 1949.\nThe AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Young continued to play for the Browns as the team won the 1950 NFL championship and advanced to the championship but lost in each of the ensuing three years. Young announced his retirement after the 1953 season, when he shared playing time with rookie Doug Atkins at left defensive end.\nLater life and officiating career.\nYoung worked during the off-season in his last two years with the Browns at the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois in its personnel department. He took a full-time job with the utilities company after leaving football and settled in Waukegan, Illinois. \"I liked the work from what I saw of it the last couple of years and I've decided to devote full time to it now\", he said.\nYoung came back to professional football in 1960, when he was hired as an official in the new American Football League (AFL). He continued his regular job as an area manager for the utility in Illinois while officiating games part-time. He served as the umpire in the AFL's first championship between the Houston Oilers and the Los Angeles Chargers. In 1966, he was the umpire in Super Bowl I, the first inter-league title game between the champions of the AFL and NFL.\nYoung died suddenly in 1969 of a brain tumor at 45. He was an AFL official for the league's entire existence; the AFL and NFL formally merged starting in the 1970 season. He was survived by his wife, Norma Young, and daughters Sally and Diane."

        "text": "Hiram Edwin Tuttle (December 22, 1882 in Dexter, Maine – November 11, 1956 in Fort Riley, Kansas) was an American equestrian who competed in dressage at the 1932 Summer Olympics and in the 1936 Summer Olympics. He is the only American dressage rider to win an individual medal at an Olympic Games. Tuttle was a lawyer in Boston prior to being a US Army quartermaster officer from 1930 to 1944. He owned and trained his own horses, unusual in a time when the majority of Olympic competitors rode Army-owned horses, and is buried near three of them at the cemetery in Fort Riley.\nBiography.\nTuttle originally trained and practiced as a lawyer in Boston, but in 1917 joined the US Army as a commissioned officer. Between 1930 and his retirement as a colonel in 1944, he held a post in Fort Riley, Kansas, at the Cavalry School. Tuttle's equestrian skills were largely self-taught, and he became the top dressage rider in the US before the majority of the country even knew such a sport existed. Army historian Louis DiMarco says, \"Tuttle did so much with so little and was so little appreciated. He was the only officer to focus strictly on dressage. Everybody else in the Army world...who did dressage learned what to do and how to do it from him.\"\nTuttle owned and trained his own horses, partially so that the horses could focus strictly on dressage and not be used for other sports or cavalry exercises; this was unusual for the times. He was set apart from many of the Olympic riders of the time by being older, not a West Point graduate, a quartermaster officer, and riding in dressage when few other officers appreciated the formality and discipline of the sport. He trained many of the military dressage riders who followed in his footsteps, including Major Robert Borg who competed in dressage at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Games. After his retirement, Tuttle continued to ride and train, and never sold his Olympic mounts. He is buried along with three of his horses (Vast, Si Murray and Olympic) at the Fort Riley cemetery.\nIn 2002, Tuttle was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame in \"recognition of his seminal contributions as a Cavalry officer to the development of dressage in the U.S.\"\nCompetition.\nIn 1932 the Americans participated in the team dressage competition for the first time since 1920. Tuttle competed in his first Olympic Games at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. At this event, he took bronze in the individual dressage, becoming the first American dressage rider in Olympic history to win an individual medal. This distinction is one that he holds as of 2012. It is also the only Olympics where Americans won individual medals in all three equestrian events (dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing). The American team, which included Tuttle, also won a bronze. His horse in these events, named Olympic, had been purchased for $1. In 1936, Tuttle returned to Olympic competition in at the Berlin Games. However, he only placed 27th individually out of 29 riders, with the American team taking 9th out of nine teams entered. Two horses used by the Americans, Si Murray and Olympic, were trained by Tuttle. Tuttle stated in a post-Games report that a German coach had told him that a winning dressage team needed \"European-bred horses, European competition experience and political clout in the host country; and that, having none of these, the Americans likely wouldn't fare well\"; based on the American's performance, Tuttle concluded the coach was correct."

They combine their offensive and defensive skills to avoid or block shots in order immediately to place well-timed punches on opponents who have lost their guard.\nBoxers who fight against counter punchers must constantly feint and conceal their offensive punches to prevent anticipation for the counterpunch.

There were a total number of 43 participating athletes, with two qualifying groups and the final held on Friday August 30, 1991.\nAnalysis.\nThis was perhaps the greatest long jump competition ever, as both of the top two athletes achieved distances beyond the then world record which had stood for almost 23 years (though one was over the wind-legal limit of 2.0 m/s). Both made the best wind-legal jumps of their careers in this competition; the still best and still third best wind-legal jumps in history; and the best two long jumps not aided by altitude.\nCarl Lewis' record at the time was: two-time Olympic gold medalist, two-time world champion (in the era when it was also still a once-every-four-year event) and, having been undefeated in ten years, he was deservedly considered the best long jumper in the world. Lewis had set the world record in the 100 metres sprint five days earlier. Lewis was in the lead through four rounds: his first round jump of 8.68 set a new championship record, then his third round jump set his then personal record, albeit wind assisted at 8.83w.\nMike Powell's fourth round jump looked like it was in the range of Lewis, but was ruled a foul. The closeness of the call upset Powell: he went down to his knees at the board trying to see the microscopic indentation into the plasticine indicating it was a foul. Lewis' fourth round jump was wind-aided, but, at 8.91w m, it was the longest ever competition long jump in history, beating the existing wind-legal world record set by Bob Beamon at altitude at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Powell's wind-legal fifth round jump topped both, setting the world record at . But the competition was not over. Moments later, Lewis answered with his lifetime wind-legal personal record of (into a slight head-wind: -0.2 m/s). Both athletes still had one jump remaining. Powell fouled, and Lewis made his second best wind-legal jump of .\nThus the competition included three of the five best wind-legal long-jumps ever; two of them by Carl Lewis, plus a wind-aided jump by Lewis beyond the then world record (a record he had been chasing for ten years), yet Lewis still finished in second place. Since this competition, no athlete, including Powell and Lewis, has 'legally' jumped within 20 cm of Powell's world record (though some had in the previous decade or so).\nCoverage.\nThis momentous event achieved another unique occurrence. It was the only time American network television, in this case NBC, devoted over 20 minutes to a single field event competition. See the video in four parts, primarily narrated by Dwight Stones: Part 1 the introduction, Part 2, \nPart 3, Part 4.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Championship records were as follows.\nQualifying round.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The New Caledonia cricket team is the team that represents the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in international cricket matches. They are not currently a member of the International Cricket Council, though they have taken part in various regional tournaments such as the Pacifica Cup and the cricket tournaments of the South Pacific Games.\nThey have had virtually no success at all, as they have lost every single match they have played, twice conceding 500 runs to Papua New Guinea.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to New Caledonia by English missionaries. It is currently mostly played by women.\nIn April 2024, it was reported by France 24 that Prebagarane Balane, the chairman of Association France Cricket, had signed a memorandum of understanding with New Caledonia's sports minister Mickaël Forrest, which would oblige the local cricket committee to register all 3,000 of its players with France Cricket. The MOU grants France Cricket \"the right to call up players in New Caledonia for the French national team, but not if they play the non-standard form of the game\"\nPacifica Cup.\nThe Pacifica Cup took place twice, in 2001 and 2002. The 2001 tournament was hosted in Auckland, New Zealand. New Caledonia's tournament started badly with a 360 run defeat by Fiji, in which three Fijian batsmen retired after scoring centuries in their innings of 433/5. In their next match against Vanuatu, they restricted their opponents to 284/7 from their 50 overs, but still lost heavily when they were bowled out for 115 to lose by 169 runs. The first round concluded with a 309 run defeat by Tonga when they were bowled out for just 25.\nThe play-off stages didn't go much better for the New Caledonians, starting with a 231 run loss to the Cook Islands. They came up against Vanuatu in the seventh place play-off, and batted first, scoring 97. Their opponents reached this target inside 12 overs thanks to a quick-fire innings of 66 from Richard Tatwin to win by six wickets.\nThe 2002 Pacifica Cup took place in Apia, Samoa. New Caledonia started with a match against Vanuatu, which they lost by seven wickets. Their second match against the tournament hosts Samoa was lost by seven wickets when no New Caledonia batsman reached double figures.\nAnother comprehensive defeat, this time losing by 278 runs to Tonga continued their tournament, which concluded with a 314 run defeat by the Cook Islands, which saw Cook Islands bowler Dunu Eliaba take nine wickets in the New Caledonia innings, which he finished off with a hat-trick. New Caledonia thus finished seventh in the tournament.\nSouth Pacific Games.\nThe cricket tournament of the 2003 South Pacific Games in Fiji started with New Caledonia taking on Samoa. As was becoming the case by this time, they lost, this time by 147 runs. The following match saw yet another comprehensive defeat as New Caledonia lost to the Cook Islands by 254 runs. Their third tournament match, against Fiji went much the same way, losing by ten wickets.\nVanuatu beat New Caledonia by 108 runs in their next tournament match, before a match against Papua New Guinea saw history made as Papua New Guinea scored the first total over 500 in international one-day cricket, winning the match by 468 runs. New Caledonia thus finished last in the tournament.\nNew Caledonia returned to international cricket competition in 2007 when they took part in the cricket tournament of the 2007 South Pacific Games in Samoa. They started with a heavy defeat, losing to Fiji by 383 runs. Their second match continued their losing streak as Tonga beat them by nine wickets.\nAfter a rest day, New Caledonia took on Papua New Guinea, who beat their own record for the highest score in an international cricket match by scoring 572/7 in 49 overs. They then bowled out New Caledonia for 62 to win by 510 runs. Both the Papua New Guinean score and the winning margin are records for international cricket. The tournament concluded for New Caledonia with a nine wicket defeat by Samoa, with New Caledonia again finishing last."

        "title": "Poloc Cricket Club",
        "text": "Poloc Cricket Club was a cricket club based at Pollok Country Park in south Glasgow, Scotland.\nThe club's Shawholm ground encompassed the cricket oval, three all-weather tennis courts, and used to have the world's only six-hole golf course approved by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The clubhouse also hosted pool, table tennis, darts and poker tournaments in the winter months.\nPoloc Cricket Club's two principal senior cricket teams played under the names \"Poloc\" and \"Shawholm\". Poloc played in the Cricket Scotland organised Cricket Scotland League, administered by the Western District Cricket Union (\"WDCU\"), whilst Shawholm played in WDCU's West Cricket Scotland Reserve League. Another XI - the Poloc Panthers - played in the WDCU Evening League, whilst a tapeball team, the Poloc Pythons, competed in the Cricket Scotland organised Tapeball League.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1878, Poloc Cricket Club spent its first season on the site of the old Pollokshaws Race Course and in 1880 moved to its current location at Shawholm.\nA pavilion was acquired by the club from the now-defunct Pollokshields Athletic Club, also located on Pollok Estates, and the building was moved to Shawholm on rollers. In the same year, the main avenue from Pollokshaws Road to Pollok House was opened, running past the north side of the ground in what is now Pollok Park. This avenue still provides the approach to Shawholm with the River Cart to the left.\nThe club's winter golf section was formed in 1889, with bowls, putting and archery being added in the years following.\nFull tenancy of the current site was granted to the club in 1888 by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet who continued to be involved in Poloc's affairs until his death in 1956.\nIn 1908 the Pollokshaws Working Lads Club decided to form a football team from amongst their ranks. Sir John Stirling Maxwell also allotted that club an area of land on the estate, rent-free. The footballers, to show their appreciation, took the name of Pollok Juniors FC, (later Pollok F.C.) and Sir John became their first Honorary President. The ground allocated became known as Haggs Park and was adjacent to Poloc Cricket Club; in fact, the different spellings of the two names \"Pollok\" and \"Poloc\" were adopted at this time, deliberately, to avoid confusion.\nMembership at Poloc reached a peak of 600 in the late 1940s.\nScotland's first televised cricket match also took place at Shawholm on 7 May 1955 when West of Scotland Cricket Club were Poloc's visitors. Poloc batted first making 110 for 9. In reply, West made 120 for 6.\nIn March 2023, Poloc Cricket Club announced their lease of Shawholm was to be terminated after 143 years, and Cricket Scotland offered their support in trying to find a resolution.\nAfter talks were unsuccessful, members voted for the dissolution of Poloc Cricket Club, taking effect from Friday 31 March 2023.\nJunior cricket.\nPoloc ran junior cricket teams at four age-group levels: under 10, 11, 12 and 16 and competed in West District Junior Cricket Union (\"WDJCU\") as well as Cricket Scotland-organised competitions. Under 10 and 11 players predominantly competed in \"Kwik cricket\" competitions. The club's junior sides won the WDCJU Under 11, 13 and 15 leagues in 2007, and were beaten finalists in the Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy. 2008 saw the Under 18s league champions, the Under 15s unbeaten and the Poloc Academy Strathclyde League winners, whilst 2009 saw a league championship for the Under 13Bs, another Frank Smith Trophy Final appearance and the Under 15s winning the Scottish Cup. 2010 brought the Under 18 league trophy to the club, and appearances at both the Under 18 Scottish Cup, and Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy, Finals Days. Success at junior level continued, with season 2015 seeing another Frank Smith Trophy win, the Under 11 league title and a win in the Under 12 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament, and 2016 bringing another Under 18 league championship. The Under 19 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament title was secured for the first time since the late 1980s in 2017.\nThe Community Coaching Initiative.\nPoloc Cricket Club provided cricket coaching in its local community under the auspices of the \"Community Coaching Initiative\" since 2002. Working predominantly in the Glasgow City Council area coaching was provided to local Primary and Secondary Schools.\nIn addition, the club, under the umbrella of the Initiative and in partnership with the WDJCU, regularly hosted \"Kwik cricket\" festivals.\nIn addition to the work in local schools, the club's Community Coaching Initiative also worked with other community groups in providing sports coaching in and around the club's locality.\nThe Initiative was granted charitable status in early 2007 and was registered with the OSCR under number SC037774. The registered body itself is CCI Glasgow Limited, a private company limited by guarantee and registered in Scotland under number SC315322.\nThe work in its community was recognised by the Sports Council of Glasgow at its 2011 Awards Night when the club was voted the Accredited Club of the Year. The club was also awarded the highest Clubmark accreditation by Glasgow Life in 2011, one of only two Glasgow sports clubs to be awarded the \"Stay Active\" accreditation level.\nGolf.\nPoloc Cricket Club also played host to the UK's only R&amp;A-recognised six-hole golf course.\nFounded in 1889, the Golf Section took over in the autumn and winter months. The course – \"Wee Poloc\" – was a unique challenge, with medals and other club competitions every fortnight throughout the winter golf season.\nTennis.\nPoloc Cricket Club has three all-weather tennis courts, adjacent to the clubhouse building.\nClub honours.\nSenior\nScottish Cup, winners: 1984;\nScottish Cup, runners-up: 1985, 1994;\nScottish Plate, winners: 2005;\nSCU Trophy, winners: 2000;\nSCU Trophy, runners-up: 1999;\nSNCL, South Division, winners: 2004;\nSNCL, Division Two, runners-up: 2000;\nWDCU Championship, winners: 1928, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1964, 1981, 1983, 1985;\nRowan Cup, winners: 1926, 1957, 1981, 1983, 2004, 2007, 2015;\nRowan Cup, runners-up: 1976;\nWest League Cup, winners: 2015;\nWest League Cup, runners-up: 2006;\nWDCU 2nd division, winners: 1914, 1928, 1950, 1964, 1969, 1971, 1981, 1983;\nWDCU CSL Western First Division Reserve League winners: 2012, 2013, 2014;\nWDCU 3rd division, winners: 1952;\nGlasgow Cup, winners: 2003;\nGreenwood Trophy, runners-up: 2013;\nSunday League 2nd division, winners: 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014;\nSunday League 3rd division - East, winners: 2014;\nEvening League 2nd division, winners: 2014, 2019;\nEvening League 3rd division, winners: 2015, 2016;\nEvening League 3rd division - South, winners: 2013;\nGlasgow &amp; District Cricket League, winners: 1931;\nJohn Haig Trophy Scottish Division, winners: 1982;\nECB Cockspur Cup Scottish Region, winners: 2007.\nJunior\nScottish Cup (under 15), winners: 2009;\nWDJCU Junior League (under 18), winners: 1972, 1977, 1982, 2008, 2010, 2016;\nWDJCU Minors League (under 15), winners: 1973, 1974, 1979, 2007;\nWDJCU \"B\" League (under 15B), winners: 2007, 2008;\nWDJCU Mini-Minors League (under 12/13), winners: 1984, 2005, 2007;\nWDJCU \"B\" League (under 13B), winners: 2009, 2013;\nWDJCU Mini-Mini-Minors League (under 11), winners: 2007, 2015 (joint);\nFrank Smith Trophy (under 16/17/18), winners: 1975, 1984, 2012, 2014;\nFrank Smith Trophy (under 16/17/18), runners-up: 2004, 2007, 2009;\nWDJCU Indoor Competition (under 19), winners: 1988, 2017;\nWDJCU Indoor Competition (under 12), winners: 2015"

        "title": "South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball",
        "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball team represents the University of South Carolina and competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Under current head coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks have been one of the top programs in the country, winning the NCAA Championship in 2017, 2022, and 2024. The program also enjoyed success under head coach Nancy Wilson during the 1980s in the Metro Conference, when it won five regular season conference championships and three conference tournament championships.\nHistory.\nThe Gamecocks first competed at an intercollegiate level in women's basketball in 1923, when they were called the Pullets (a young domestic hen, a play off \"Gamecocks,\" which is a rooster).\nThe modern era of South Carolina women's basketball began when the Carolina Chicks took to the court in January 1974 under the guidance of Pam Backhaus. The inaugural team compiled a record of 15–7 and were the South Carolina AIAW champions. In 1977, with Pam Parsons as the head coach the women's basketball team, they changed their nickname to the Lady Gamecocks and made postseason trips every year during her four-year tenure.\nDuring its eight seasons in the Metro Conference (now Conference USA after the 1995 reunification), the Lady Gamecocks won the regular season championship five times and the conference tournament three times.\nWhen South Carolina joined the SEC, success was hard to come by during their first decade in one of the strongest conferences in women's basketball. They initially struggled to compete under head coaches Nancy Wilson and Susan Walvius. Walvius' teams in 2001–02 and 2002–03 broke through to finish 25–7 and 23–8, respectively, earning trips to the NCAA tournament and reaching the Elite Eight in 2002.\nWalvius resigned after the 2007–08 season. On May 7, 2008, Dawn Staley was named the new head coach of the team now known as simply the \"Gamecocks\".\nUnder coach Staley, the Gamecocks improved or equaled their win total every season during her first seven years leading the program, culminating in a 34–3 record in 2014–15. That year they won the SEC regular season championship, the SEC Tournament championship and the NCAA East Region Championship. The season ended in the NCAA Final Four with a last second one-point loss to Notre Dame in the national semifinals.\nThe following year, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play, only to be stymied in the Sweet 16 by Syracuse. In 2016–17, the Gamecocks garnered their third straight sweep of the SEC regular season and tournament titles en route to their second Final Four. They defeated conference rival Mississippi State in the national championship game to win their first-ever national title.\nIn the 2018 SEC tournament, the Gamecocks defeated Mississippi State to win the SEC tournament, South Carolina is the only team to win the SEC tournament for four straight years. Their season came to an end when they were defeated by Connecticut in the Elite Eight.\nIn 2020, South Carolina finished 32–1 (16–0), led by the #1 ranked recruiting class and senior leadership of point guard Tyasha Harris. The Gamecocks defeated 14 ranked teams including their first-ever victory over UConn, and won both the SEC regular season and tournament titles. South Carolina won their final 26 games of the season and spent the final nine weeks as the AP #1 ranked team. Dawn Staley was named national coach of the year, and Aliyah Boston was named national freshman of the year, and SEC defensive player of the year. When the COVID-19 pandemic ended the season prematurely on March 12, South Carolina was ranked at the top of the AP and coaches' polls. Due to the unprecedented abrupt ending to the season following the SEC Championship win, Staley said they should be claim the mythical national championship, with the program making a claim through the size and location of the banner highlighting finishing #1 in the polls on December 31, 2020, at the 2020–21 conference season opener. As of the 2022–23 season, that banner size is identical to the two official championship banners, and located between the official championship banners. In 2021, the team reached the Final Four, losing to Stanford by a point.\nOn April 3, 2022, the Gamecocks won their 2nd national title with a 64–49 win over UConn, finishing the season 35–2 and being ranked #1 in both major polls for the entire season. Aliyah Boston won Player of the Year, and Dawn Staley was named Naismith Award winner as the best coach in the nation for 2022.\nOn February 18, 2024, South Carolina set a record for winning 43 straight SEC victories.\nYear-by-year results.\nConference tournament winners noted with # Source\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Tournament Seeding History.\nThe following lists where the Gamecocks have been seeded in the NCAA tournament.\nConference Tournament Championships.\nSouth Carolina has played in the Southeastern Conference since the 1997–98 season. The Gamecocks have won 8 out of the last 10 tournament titles, all under Head Coach, Dawn Staley.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Gamecocks made two appearances in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 6–3. \nAttendance.\nOver the years, the Gamecocks have played in three different venues. At first games were played at the Blatt P.E. Center. Later games moved to the Carolina Coliseum, which saw the first sell out for a women's basketball game on January 17, 2002. That day, 12,168 fans turned out to see the South Carolina Gamecocks take on the Tennessee Lady Vols.\nOn November 22, 2002, the Gamecocks opened the newly constructed Colonial Life Arena (then known as Carolina Center; the arena's deal with Unum was signed a year later) with a $1 admission night, leading to a crowd 17,712 saw the Gamecocks defeat the arch-rival Clemson Lady Tigers. The first sell out with 18,000 in attendance occurred on February 8, 2016, against the University of Connecticut Huskies in a match up of the two top ranked teams in the country.\nCrowds of over 16,000 at Colonial Life Arena for Women's Basketball games:\nSouth Carolina has led the nation in attendance every season since 2014–15, with the exception of 2020 which was limited due to COVID.

Teams representing 36 countries participated in several levels of competition, while three other teams competed in an exhibition tournament to gain experience before joining on an official basis in the 1998 competition. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1998 competition.\nThe top Championship Group tournament took place in Finland from 26 April to 14 May 1997, with matches played in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku. Twelve teams took part, with the first round being split into two teams of six, and the six best teams going to a further group stage.

In addition, the remaining three best teams would win the opportunity to play in a qualifying tournament against the last place team from Group A, where the top two would be included in the Group A tournament.\n\"Belarus, as winner, was promoted to Group A. Switzerland, as host, was also promoted to Group A. Kazakhstan, Austria, and Poland were all promoted to the Qualifying tournament for Group A, along with Norway. No one was relegated.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Estonia).\nPlayed 22–28 March in Tallinn and Kohtla-Järve. Along with the expansion of Group A, a provision was made to allow the best \"Far East\" team to qualify directly. Beginning in 1999 there would be a tournament to decide who that would be.

        "text": "The 1996 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships was the 60th such event sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Teams representing 36 countries participated in several levels of competition, with Slovakia making their first appearance in the top Champions Group A, in their fourth tournament since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the formation of the separate Czech Republic and Slovakia men's national ice hockey teams. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1997 competition.\nThe top Championship Group A tournament took place in Austria from 21 April to 5 May 1996, with all games played in Vienna. Twelve teams took part, with the first round split into two groups of six, with the first four from each group advancing to the quarter-finals. The Czech Republic beat Canada in the final to become World Champions for the first time. The final game was tied at two apiece before Martin Procházka scored with nineteen seconds left, followed by an empty net goal to seal the victory. In the bronze medal game, Brian Rolston scored at 4:48 of overtime to win the first medal in 34 years for team USA. The unfortunate Russians, competing in their fifth tournament since being created after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, did not lose a game in regulation time in the entire tournament, but finished fourth.\nWorld Championship Group A (Austria).\nConsolation round 11–12 place.\n\"Austria was relegated to Group B.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Netherlands).\nPlayed 10–20 April in Eindhoven.

The final game had high drama for the host crowd, the Japanese and Danish teams among them. If the Netherlands were to lose to Poland, they would finish last and be relegated, a tie and Japan would be last, a win and Denmark would be last.

        "text": "The 2008 World Series of Poker was the 39th annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). Held in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, the series began on May 30, 2008, and featured 55 poker championships in several variants. All events but the $10,000 World Championship No Limit Texas hold 'em Main Event, the most prestigious of the WSOP events, ended by July 15th. As has been the WSOP custom since 1976, each of the event winners received a championship bracelet in addition to that event's prize money, which (after the casino's rake) ranged from $87,929 to $9,119,517.\nHighlights of the 2008 series include the selection of Erick Lindgren, who won a bracelet and made three final tables, as recipient of the \"Player of the Year Award\". Nikolay Evdakov led all players with a record 10 money finishes, and Phil Hellmuth set a WSOP record of 41 career final tables. The Main Event, which began with 6,844 participants (a level exceeded only by the number of participants at the 2006 event), was suspended once the event was down to the 9 players needed for the final table; the Main Event was resumed on November 9, and concluded with the heads-up final between Peter Eastgate and Ivan Demidov the next day. This year was the first in which the Main Event was suspended in this fashion, a change introduced at ESPN's request to allow the TV network to do a same-day Main Event broadcast. \nIn a stunning statistical improbability, Justin Phillips knocked out Motoyuki Mabuchi in the Main Event. Phillips held a Royal Flush, while Mabuchi held quad aces. One of the broadcasters, Lon McEachern, mentioned on air that the chances of such a showdown occurring were 1:2.7 billion. Ray Romano had just sat down at the table when this hand played itself out.\n2008 records.\nNikolay Evdakov set a WSOP record for most cashes at a single World Series with 10. The previous record of 8 was held by 5 players: Chris Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth, Humberto Brenes, Michael Binger, and Chad Brown. Evdakov's achievement also represents the most cashes by a player at one WSOP without reaching a single final table. Hellmuth, who made two final tables, established a new WSOP career record of 41 final tables, two more than T. J. Cloutier. Scotty Nguyen became the first player to hold both a Main Event and a $50,000 H.O.R.S.E World Championship bracelet.\nSeveral nationals were the first from their country to win bracelets. Brazilian Alexandre Gomes won Event 48 to become the first South American player to win a WSOP bracelet since Ecuadorian-born Carlos Mortensen won the 2001 Main Event. Rob Hollink won Event 30, becoming the first Dutch WSOP bracelet winner, and Davidi Kitai won Event 38, becoming the first Belgian player to win a bracelet.\nThe 2008 Main Event final table took 15 hours and 28 minutes to play, beating the previous record of 14 hours and 2 minutes in 2005.\nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 World Championship No Limit Texas Hold 'em Main Event began on July 3 with the first of four starting days. After reaching the final table of nine players on July 14, the final table was delayed until November 9. This change in schedule was made to allow ESPN to broadcast the final table on November 11, shortly after it was played. All final table players were paid ninth place prize money ($900,670) in July, with the remaining prize pool distributed in November. Instead of the Amazon Room, aka \"the Poker Room,\" where all of the events were held, the final table would be held in the Penn and Teller Theatre. On November 9, players played down from nine to two and the winner was decided the next night. The final table consisted of 274 hands in total.\nAfter a large decrease in Main Event participants in 2007 (6358) compared to 2006 (8773), the number increased slightly in 2008 (6844) but was still far from the 2006 number. As in 2007, the payout structure is flatter than in 2006 and before, with the lowest payouts at $21,230 (more than double the buy-in), as compared to $10,616 in 2006.\nThe \"last woman standing\" in the 2008 Main Event was Tiffany Michelle, who finished in 17th place. Celebrities best known from television, music, and professional sports, among other areas, also participated, with two placing in the money. The list includes:\nFinal table.\nAt the age of 22, Peter Eastgate became the youngest Main Event winner, surpassing Phil Hellmuth who was 24 when he won in 1989 and became the first European to capture the title since Carlos Mortensen won in 2001. His winning hand was a 5 high straight known as a \"wheel\", made from his hole cards ' and 3 of the community cards which were ', while his opponent Ivan Demidov lost with for two pair.\nOther notable high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\nPerformance of past champions.\nTwenty past WSOP Main Event champions, representing 22 bracelets, participated in the 2008 Main Event. Two champions from the late 1980s finished in the money: Johnny Chan placed 329th for $32,166, and Phil Hellmuth finished 45th for $154,400."

        "title": "Scrum (rugby union)",
        "text": "In rugby union a scrum is a means of restarting play after a minor infringement. It involves up to eight players from each team, known as the pack or forward pack, binding together in three rows and interlocking with the three opposing teams front row. At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession. Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse, and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly. A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward, or passed forward, or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul. Because of the physical nature of scrums, injuries can occur, especially in the front row.\nOverview.\nTo prepare for a scrum, each team's eight forwards (referred to as the \"pack\" or \"forward pack\") bind together in three rows — the front row, second row and back row. The front row is composed of the two \"props\" and the \"hooker\". To the left is the \"loosehead\" prop with the hooker in the middle, and the \"tighthead\" prop on the right (jersey numbers one, two and three). The \"tighthead\" prop, number three, earns that name as his head and shoulders sits between the hooker and the loosehead prop of the opposing side, meaning he sits in a \"tighter\" scrum position. The loosehead prop, by contrast, has one shoulder open to the outside of the scrum, and so is in a \"looser\" scrum position. The three bind together tightly and there is no gap between the hooker and either prop. According to the laws of the game; \"When a player binds on a team-mate that player must use the whole arm from hand to shoulder to grasp the team-mate’s body at or below the level of the armpit.\" Failing to bind properly results in a penalty, and the opposition team being awarded a free kick.\nThe two \"second row\" forwards (jersey numbers four and five) bind together and directly behind the front row with each putting their heads between the props and the hooker. They are more commonly referred to as \"locks\" as they \"lock\" the scrum. Lastly the back row is made up of the two \"flankers\" and the number eight. The flankers bind on each side of the scrum — next to a lock and behind a prop. Generally the number seven flanker is referred to as the \"openside\" flanker, and with the number six flanker as the \"blindside\" flanker. \"Openside\" and \"blindside\" refer to the wide and narrow side of the pitch respectively, as scrums usually occur closer to one of the touchlines than the other. The openside flanker's job is to get to the next ruck or maul as quickly as possible, so they will usually bind on that side. The number 8 binds behind the two locks, with his/her head between them.\nTo form a scrum the two forward packs approach to within an arms length of each other. The referee gives the command \"crouch\" and the opposing front rows then crouch so that their backs are parallel to the ground and their head and shoulders are no lower than their hips; this crouching posture also allows them to isometrically preload their muscles enabling them to perform their subsequent drive more powerfully. The referee then calls \"bind\" and \"using their outside arm each prop binds onto the point of the opposing prop’s outside shoulder.\" This command is to ensure that the two front rows are not too far apart. Finally the referee then says \"set\" (this is not a command, but rather permission to the front rows to engage) and the two front rows come together. When this happens both front rows thrust forward with the tighthead props' heads going between the opposing hooker and loosehead prop. The props then bind by gripping the back or side of the opposing prop's jersey.\nThe scrum-half from the team that has possession (referred to as having \"the feed\" or \"put in\") then throws the ball in the gap formed between the two front rows, from\nthe side where the hooker of his team is closest.\n This gap is called the \"tunnel\". With the ball in the tunnel the two hookers (and sometimes the props) compete for possession by trying to hook the ball backwards with their feet, while the entire pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards. The side that wins possession usually transfers the ball to the back of the scrum — which is done with their feet. Once at the back it is picked up either by the number 8, or by the scrum-half. From here the ball is in play and the player with possession will either run, pass or kick the ball. On other occasions the forwards will hold the ball in the scrum by controlling it with their feet and try to gain ground by pushing the opposition backwards.\nInfringements.\nThere are a large number of rules regarding the specifics of what can and cannot be done during a scrum. This is mainly for safety reasons, because if a scrum is not conducted properly there is a greater chance of injury. Many of the rules regard behaviour of the front row. Front rowers must engage square on, rather than \"bore\" in on an angle. The tight-head prop doing this limits the movement of the opposing hooker. As well, a loose-head prop pushing into the opposition tight-head prop's chest causing their body to pop out of the scrum. Both infringements are punished with penalties. Front-rowers are also banned from twisting their bodies, pulling opponents, or doing anything that might collapse the scrum. They must not push an opponent in the air. Finally, the back row must remain bound until the ball has left the scrum. For flankers, this means keeping one arm, up to the shoulder, in contact with the scrum. The no. 8 must have both hands touching the scrum until the scrum has ended.\nOther rules regard the scrum-halves and how they throw in the ball. The scrum must be stable, stationary and parallel to the goal-lines when they \"feed\" the ball; otherwise a free kick is awarded to the non-offending team. If the scrum is acceptable then the scrum-half must \"feed\" the ball into the scrum without delay. The referee will often warn a team and if the warning is not heeded the opposition is awarded a free kick. The ball must be fed into the middle of the tunnel with its major axis parallel to the ground and touchline. The ball must be thrown in quickly and in a single movement — this means that a feed cannot be faked. Once the ball has left the hands of the scrum-half the scrum has begun.\nPlayers.\nThe front row are usually the stockiest members of the scrum. Hookers are normally smaller than props so they may manoeuvre their lower bodies within the tight confines of the front row and tunnel. Props and locks both need to be strong, but the positions differ in their main criteria for selection. Since props are more directly involved in wrestling for position and channelling the drive forward, strength and weight are of prime importance for them. Strength is also important for locks, since they also push; however, height is more important for them than it is for front-row players. Locks are virtually always the tallest players on the team; they are used as the primary contestants for possession in another phase of the game, the line-out. Flankers and the number 8 do less of the pushing in the scrum, and need more speed, because their task is to quickly tackle or cover the opposing half-backs if the opposition wins the scrum. Approximately 40% of the power of the scrum is produced in the front row itself. In most professional teams the forward pack weighs at least 800 kg (1764 lbs).\nAwarding.\nA scrum is awarded in a number of situations. The most common is if the ball has been knocked on (knocked forward) or passed forward. The two other major times when a scrum is called for is when someone is accidentally offside; or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of it being retrieved. The scrum feed goes to the team that did not offend, except in the case of the ball being trapped in a ruck or maul. In this situation the feed is awarded to the team that was \"going forward\" — that is, the team that had the forward momentum at the ruck. If the ball is \"held up\" at a maul, the scrum is awarded to the team not in possession when the maul started.\nIf a penalty is awarded for a more serious offence, the team to which it is awarded may elect to have a scrum rather than take a penalty kick or free kick. This usually happens when the attacking team is close to the opposition's goal-line, and wants to occupy all the opposition's forwards in one area to give the backs more space. They may also think they can force the scrum over the goal-line and score a \"pushover\" try.\nA pushover try can occur the instant the ball touches the goal line. This is because a scrum is defined in the Laws of the Game to only exist within the field of play and not within the in-goal. Hence as soon as the ball reaches the line, the scrum ceases to exist and any player can ground the ball without risking a penalty for \"handling in the scrum\".\nPushover tries are rare, however, because scrums are awarded a minimum of five metres (16.4 ft) from either goal-line, and either touchline. This means for a pushover try to occur, the scrum must be forced several metres in one direction without collapsing.\nSafety.\nScrums are one of the most dangerous phases in rugby, since a collapse or improper engage can lead to a front row player damaging or even breaking their neck. For this reason, only trained players may play in the front row to help avoid injuries. If a team is without sufficient specialist front row players, for example because of injury or sin-binning, all scrums may be \"uncontested scrums\". In this situation, the packs engage, but do not push, and the team that still puts the ball into the scrum must win it without effort. Teams use a Scrum machine to train players.\nRecently, a leading consultant surgeon in the UK has called for the ban of contested scrums, asserting they are too dangerous. There is very significant support for contested scrums however — former England hooker Brian Moore argued that \"You would change the whole nature of the game and it would no longer be a game for all shapes and sizes as it is, uniquely, today.\"\nHistory.\nLike many aspects of rugby union, the scrum has evolved since the sport's invention. Many of the rules regarding the scrum have been changed. These changes have not always had the desired long-term effect, as many have been changed quite frequently.\nOriginally there was no distinction between an awarded or scrum and a \"loose\" scrum (today known as a ruck). The side awarded the scrum had one player put the ball on the ground and let go of it; there was no requirement of a tunnel. The onside line was dictated by the ball; so players were required to remain behind it. A scrum would most commonly be awarded when a stalemate occurred between the player with the ball, who would declare \"held\", and opposition holding him, who would call \"Have it down\". The early rules did not draw a clear distinction between players in or out of a scrum, and did not require players in the scrum to bind. The early rules of rugby, even after re-codification as \"Laws of the Rugby Union\", said the object of players in the scrum was to kick the ball towards their opponents' goal line. This provision remained in the laws for approximately 20 years after practice had changed in the late 19th century.\nFor a long time players did not have specific positions within a scrum. They adopted the \"first up, first down\" down method, with the first players to a scrum packing down in the front row and the rest of the forwards filling the remaining positions. Although the 1905 All Blacks are often credited with introducing specialised scrum positions, the 1888-1889 New Zealand Native football team had in fact practised this. As well, Thomas Ellison, one of the Natives, invented the 2-3-2 scrum formation. This seven man scrum was very popular in New Zealand until being outlawed in 1932. The extra man available because he was not in the scrum was called a \"wing forward\" and his job was to feed the ball into the scrum. Wing forwards were frequently accused of obstructing the opposing scrum-half, and this contributed to the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board (IRB) and now as World Rugby (WR), outlawing a two-man front row.\nUntil the second half of the 20th century there were many configurations of scrum; including 3-2-3, 3-4-1 and 3-3-2.\nThe 1906 Springboks became \"the first national team to utilize the 3-4-1 formation\". South Africans credit Springbok Fairy Heatlie for developing the 3-4-1 formation in 1901 at the Villagers Rugby Club in Cape Town, fellow Villager Paddy Carolin for applying it on the 1906 South African tour of Britain, and Stellenbosch coach \"Oubaas Mark\" Markötter for perfecting it afterwards. Under Markötter's instigation, and that of his protégé Danie Craven, South Africa had by 1949 perfected the 3-4-1 scrum formation. The hooker bound very loosely, and could swing his body so that he could get his feet to the ball as soon as it was fed into the scrum. The two locks would not push on the hooker, but their props, to make this easier. This made it very difficult for the opposition to get anywhere near the ball before it was hooked to the back of the scrum. It was at this time the terms loosehead and tighthead entered rugby terminology. Ever since the team feeding the ball has had a significant advantage, and won their own ball much more frequently.\nIn the 1960s rule changes were introduced to try and limit the effect the loose forwards were having on back play. There was no obligation to bind to a scrum for flankers at this time. The offside line was dictated by the position of the ball even when it was in the scrum, and so when it emerged at the back of the scrum the scrum-half would often find the opposition flankers and scrum-half arriving with it. The new offside line became the hindmost foot of the scrum. Only the opposition scrum-half could move forward of that point, and all flankers had to stay bound unless they remained behind the hindmost foot of the scrum. Another rule change introduced allowed the number 8 or the rear-most bound forward to detach from a scrum with the ball, previously it could only be retrieved by the scrum-half.\nThe scrum in the professional era.\nAround 1996, the All Blacks came up with a strategy where their pack would push at the same time the hooker would strike for the ball. This not only meant they got the hooked ball, but also the opposition had to retreat to stay onside.\nEventually, other teams found out what the All Blacks were doing and copied them. Referees stopped enforcing the straight feed into the scrum, and as a result scrum-halves started feeding the ball further on their side of the scrum.\nOpposing hookers gave up trying to hook for the ball and instead focused on adding power to the pack's drive. This turned the scrum from a hooking and pushing contest into one of power pushing, which led to a rise in collapsed scrums.\nIn 2007 the scrum law was amended to a four-step, \"crouch\", \"touch\", \"pause\", \"engage\" process in an attempt to control scrum engagement. Prior to this, there was no obligation for each prop to touch the opposing prop's shoulder, and the distance between the two front rows was often larger. The new rule fixed the distance between the front rows and as a result cut the force of impact from the engagement. The reason for the rule change was to reduce the number of serious neck injuries to front rowers.\nThe IRB made further changes to the laws in 2009 in an attempt to eliminate uncontested scrums. Beginning in the 2007–08 season, the IRB sanctioned a trial of the following new rules in France:\nIn the last season before the trial (2006–07), 145 matches in the country's three top divisions (Top 14, Pro D2, and Fédérale 1) ended with uncontested scrums. In 2007–08, only two matches out of 994 in the same divisions finished with uncontested scrums.\nIn July 2009, the IRB authorised all of its member unions to adopt these changes in competitions that they completely control, and also allowed these changes in transnational club and provincial competitions (such as the Magners League and Super 14) with the permission of all unions involved.\nMore recent scrum law changes.\nIn March 2013, former England hooker Brian Moore wrote a scathing article on the BBC website about the state of scrums, in which he outlined his concerns that the rule changes had made things worse instead of better.\nStarting with the 2012–13 rugby season, the IRB issued trial law amendments, one of which affected the call sequence. The referee continued to start with \"crouch\" and \"touch,\" but then issued the command \"set,\" which replaced \"engage\" as the indication that the packs may push forward. \"Pause\" was removed in order to speed up the scrum and to minimize resets due to collapsed scrums.\nAs of the 2013–14 rugby season, the calls were changed to crouch, bind and set. This change required the props to bind before the pack is allowed to push, reducing the impact between the two packs when they engage. The IRB stated that this change was expected to reduce the impact \"by up to 25 per cent in elite competition.\" In addition to changes in how the scrum is set, the IRB asked referees to renew their focus on the existing law, particularly preventing pushes before the ball is in and ensuring that the ball is fed in straight.\nMore recently, World Rugby announced that starting in 2017–18, it would conduct a worldwide trial of changes to the scrum law as part of a larger trial of law changes. These changes will be used for at least a year before WR decides on whether to make them permanent."

        "title": "Bianchi (cycling team)",
        "text": "Bianchi was an Italian professional cycling team that was sponsored by and cycled on Bianchi Bicycles. A Bianchi cycling team existed in 1899 which implies that Bianchi was sponsoring professional cycling at a very early stage in the sport. It appears that the team existed from 1899 to 1900, then from 1905 to 1966, then from 1973 until 1984. It existed again in 1993 and for the last time in 2003, as . In addition Bianchi has been a co-sponsor of many cycling teams.\nHistory.\nIn 1899 Giovanni Tommaselli won the first international cycling victory for Bianchi at the world championship of track racing: the \"Grand Prix of Paris\". During the existence of the Bianchi team in Italy in 1919–1920, Bianchi was also a co-sponsor of a French team that was called Peugeot–Bianchi–Pirelli which according to a historical cycling website, the team rode on Peugeot bikes. It is possible that this team rode on Bianchi bikes in Italy.\nThe team had many famous cyclists on the team over the course of its existence. In 1945, Fausto Coppi joined the team and would stay with the team until 1956 and 1958. It has been said that the team of the mid-1940s was built around Coppi.\nDuring this time the Tour de France was disputed by national teams and Coppi won the Tour in 1949 and 1952. Coppi won the Giro d'Italia for the team in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953. Coppi became the first cyclist in history to achieve the Giro-Tour double. For which it was suggested at the time that he was the greatest cyclist ever seen. During this time, the directeur sportifs were Giovanni Tragella and Franco Aguggini.\nIn the seventies, Bianchi returned as main sponsor to the peloton in the Bianchi–Campagnolo team that contained the 1972 and 1973 world champions Marino Basso and Felice Gimondi. This team was the continuation of the Salvarani team that Gimondi had started his career with and which, in 1972, was directed by 1965 Giro d'Italia champion and 1968 World Champion Vittorio Adorni who had retired from professional racing just two years previously. Adorni directed the Bianchi–Campagnolo team with Giancarlo Ferretti in 1973. Ferretti took over as the main directeur sportif of the team the following year. This team also included the four-time winner of the Vuelta a Colombia Martin Emilio Rodriguez who won stages in the Giro d'Italia.\nFinally Team Bianchi was main sponsor when German Jan Ullrich challenged American Lance Armstrong in the Centenary edition of the Tour de France.\nAfter the cycling season of 2003 ended, Bianchi became co-sponsor of the Alessio–Bianchi team and again they were a co-sponsor of the Liquigas-Bianchi team for the 2005 season. In 2005 Bianchi also became the co-sponsor of the Norwegian cycling team Team Maxbo Bianchi, a continental cycling team, with whom they co-sponsored until the end of the 2010 season. In October 2011, it was announced that Bianchi would be the bike sponsor of the Vancansoleil-DCM team on a two-year contract from 2012 Since 2014, Bianchi is the supplier of .\nBianchi became involved in sponsorship in Mountain biking in the early nineties. Bruno Zanchi won the first World Championship for Bianchi in 1991 in the downhill speciality. Two years later, Dario Acquaroli became World Champion in cross country for Bianchi. From 2000 to 2006, the Bianchi MTB (Bianchi-Motorex and Bianchi-Agos) team dominated the sport with José Antonio Hermida and multiple World Champion Julien Absalon. In 2007 the team was renamed Gewiss–Bianchi."

        "title": "2007 Rugby World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2007 Rugby World Cup final was a rugby union match, played on Saturday, 20 October 2007 at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, Paris, to determine the winner of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. South Africa beat England 15–6. Having also won the 1995 tournament, South Africa became the second country to win two World Cups, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999.\nEngland and South Africa, who won their semi-finals against France and Argentina respectively, had met during the pool stage of the competition, when South Africa won 36–0. South Africa began the final undefeated in the competition. The final was refereed by Irish referee Alain Rolland.\nThe match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. Each team had one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second, as wing Mark Cueto had a try disallowed in the 42nd minute after he was ruled to have put a foot in touch during a tackle by Danie Rossouw before grounding the ball. Television match official Stuart Dickinson stood by his decision, though he encountered a language barrier with the French broadcaster preventing his access to frame-by-frame pictures.\nPath to the final.\nBoth England and South Africa were placed in Pool A along with Samoa, Tonga and the United States. England's first match was against the United States, whom they beat 28–10. South Africa opened their campaign with a 59–7 victory over Samoa in which they scored seven tries, four of them by Bryan Habana. The two teams then met in their second match of the tournament. For the first time in their World Cup history, England were kept pointless as South Africa scored three tries to win 36–0. South Africa then rested several of their top players for their match against Tonga. Tonga came close to an upset but South Africa held on to win 30–25, guaranteeing the Springboks top position in the pool. England then played Samoa, winning 44–22, before facing Tonga in a match effectively serving as a qualification play-off; whoever won the game would finish second in the pool behind South Africa. England eventually won 36–20, scoring four tries in the process.\nEngland played Australia, who had finished top of Pool B, in their quarter-final. The match was a repeat of the 2003 World Cup final, with England coming out on top again, beating the Wallabies 12–10. All of England's points were scored by Jonny Wilkinson penalties. South Africa faced Fiji, who had defeated Wales to finish as runners-up behind Australia in Pool B. South Africa scored five tries to two and won 37–20. England played hosts France in their semi-final. Despite having less possession and territory England won 14–9. South Africa faced Argentina and scored four tries to one to win 37–13.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nThe match was kicked off by England's Jonny Wilkinson, whose kick was collected by Schalk Burger, before the ball was kicked into touch by Butch James, giving England the first line-out throw of the game. However, South Africa stole the ball to win the first line-out of the match. In the sixth minute, Mathew Tait attempted to run the ball from inside England's 22-metre line, only to be tackled and penalised for not releasing the ball in the ruck. South Africa's Percy Montgomery successfully converted the penalty to give the Springboks a 3–0 lead.\nAn up-and-under kick from England resulted in South African wing JP Pietersen dropping the ball. England regained possession and passed the ball out to winger Paul Sackey, before South Africa were penalised for killing the ball. Wilkinson stepped up to convert the penalty and level the scores at 3–3 after ten minutes. After a lot of kicking from both sides, Butch James was tripped by England flanker Lewis Moody as the South African fly-half was chasing a kick. Montgomery kicked the resulting penalty, to put the South Africans 6–3 up after 15 minutes. Two minutes later, England positioned themselves for an attempted drop-goal, but Wilkinson's attempt was left wanting as it drifted slightly wide.\nAfter 21 minutes, England prop and captain Phil Vickery was penalised for being offside near the halfway line. The resulting penalty kick was taken by South Africa's centre Frans Steyn, but he missed the long-range effort. The match continued with large amounts of kicking from both sides until the 35th minute, when Steyn broke through the England line. South Africa managed to retain possession and eventually their hooker, John Smit, went for the try-line but was held up two metres short. The ball was eventually knocked on by South Africa and England were awarded a five-metre scrum. The scrum had to be reset several times, but the Springbok forwards were finally able to wheel the scrum through 90 degrees to force the turnover. They won the scrum on their own feed and continued to press at England's goal line before England were penalised for killing the ball. A penalty was awarded, which Montgomery kicked to give South Africa a 9–3 half-time lead.\nSecond half.\nThe second half was kicked off by South Africa's Butch James, and the ball was caught by England's number 8 Nick Easter. After stewards had dealt with a pitch invasion by infamous pitch invader Jimmy Jump, the ball was eventually received by Mathew Tait, who was able to break the South African defensive line, before being tackled metres short of the South African goal line. The ball was recycled and spread left to England winger Mark Cueto, who dived for the try line while being tackled by South African number eight Danie Rossouw. Referee Alain Rolland referred the decision to Australian Television Match Official Stuart Dickinson to determine whether Cueto was in touch before grounding the ball. Dickinson ruled that a foot was in touch and Rolland brought play back to an earlier penalty against Schalk Burger. Wilkinson converted the penalty to reduce South Africa's lead to 9–6 after 42 minutes.\nIn the 48th minute, Steyn made another break for South Africa and England flanker Martin Corry was penalised for playing the ball off his feet. Montgomery kicked the penalty to restore South Africa's six-point advantage. England penetrated South Africa's 22 in the 58th minute and their scrum-half Andy Gomarsall chipped the ball ahead for Toby Flood to run on to. However, the kick was too deep and was shepherded over the dead ball line by Percy Montgomery. Unable to reach the ball, and trying to force an English five-metre scrum, Flood pushed Montgomery in the back as they both chased for the ball, sending Montgomery into the advertising boards. In his attempt to hurdle the boards, Montgomery collided with a television camera, but referee Rolland decided not to penalise Flood. Three minutes later, just inside England's half, the English were penalised for obstruction, and Steyn kicked a 49-metre penalty to extend South Africa's lead to 15–6.\nIn the 67th minute, South African captain John Smit was penalised for a collision with Mark Cueto as Cueto chased his own kick. Wilkinson kicked the ball into touch in South Africa's 22 from his own half, but England lost their resulting line-out to give South Africa possession. Requiring at least two scores to overhaul South Africa's lead, England kept attacking, and Wilkinson attempted a long-range drop goal in the 71st minute but was unsuccessful.\nEngland kept possession for long periods during the last ten minutes, but were unable to break through the South African defence. They were penalised in the 75th minute for holding on in the tackle, and South Africa continued to try to play the match in England territory. England then knocked the ball on in the 79th minute, giving South Africa a scrum. The South African forwards secured the ball, and as soon as the clock ticked over the 80-minute mark, the ball was kicked into touch. Referee Rolland then blew the final whistle, and South Africa had won their second World Cup title. This was also the second World Cup title for retiring prop Os du Randt, who was the last player from the Springboks' 1995 championship team still active. He joined five Australians who had been on the Wallabies' 1991 and 1999 championship teams as the only players at that time to have won two World Cups (they would be joined by several New Zealanders who won in 2011 and 2015, by du Randt's Springboks teammate François Steyn in 2019 and a number of South Africans who won in 2019 and 2023)."

        "text": "Scott Glenndale Martin King (born June 25, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played in two National Hockey League games for the Detroit Red Wings during the 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1990 to 1993, was spent in the minor leagues. He was drafted 10th (190th overall) in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nKing was born in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He headed west from his hometown to join the Richmond Sockeyes of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League during his teenage years. \nCareer.\nMinor league hockey.\nA fast reflex goalie with a right-handed catch, King quickly earned the starting job for the Sockeyes and played 40 games that year, winning 23 and with a 5.05 goals against average (GAA). During the 1985–86 season, King played for the Vernon Lakers and posting an even better 17–9–0 record in 29 games with a 4.64 GAA. The Detroit Red Wings decided to draft King 190th overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft.\nKing attended University of Maine after beginning the 1986–87 season with the Abbotsford Falcons. He had four successful years with the Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey team, being named to all-star teams, his last three years there and winning the Hockey East championship game in 1989 against the Boston College Eagles.\nNHL.\nFor the 1990–91 season, King had graduated from the University Maine and joined the Detroit Red Wings organization. He started play for the Hampton Roads Admirals of the East Coast Hockey League playing 15 games. His 8–4–1 record allowed him to be quickly called up to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League. In 24 games King posted an 8–10–2 record, but showed promise and poise in the crease. When injury struck Red Wings goalie Tim Cheveldae, a slew of promising minors were called up to try and fill the void for the big club. King was called up on January 28, 1991 to back up goaltender Glen Hanlon in a game against the New Jersey Devils. New Jersey scored four goals against Hanlon in the first 15 minutes and he was pulled, putting King into his first NHL game. King gave up two goals on 11 shots but ended up with no record as the Wings lost 2–6. King finished out the year with Adirondack.\nDuring the 1991–92 season, King moved between Adirondack, the ECHL affiliate Toledo Storm, and the main club. King again was put into an NHL game on November 30, 1991, as he played the last 16 minutes of a game, replacing Cheveldae in a 3–7 loss against the St. Louis Blues. King played 33 games in Adirondack, finishing with a 14–14–3 record and a 3.53 GAA. Young goalie Chris Osgood was picked up by Detroit for the 1992–93 season and was instantly given the start in most of the games. King was relegated to Toledo where he had a productive year. Having a solid goalie veteran on the team, Toledo excelled and King finished with 26–11–7 record and a playoff berth. King ended the playoffs with a 10–3 record and a Riley Cup victory in six games over the Wheeling Thunderbirds."

        "title": "2010 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2010 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match played at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home of Real Madrid, on 22 May 2010, to determine the winners of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League. It was the first Champions League final to be played on a weekend, rather than the traditional weekday. The match was won by Inter Milan, who beat Bayern Munich 2–0 to complete the treble, a feat never before achieved by any team from either Italy or Germany. The refereeing team came from England and was led by Howard Webb.\nThe win gave Inter their third European Cup title, and their first since 1965; moreover, it was their first appearance in the final since 1972, and they were the first Italian team to appear since A.C. Milan won the competition in 2007. Meanwhile, Bayern had won the competition as recently as 2001 – their most recent final appearance – although they were the first German side to reach the final since Bayer Leverkusen in 2002. The 2010 final was the first not to feature an English side since Porto beat Monaco in 2004, due to Manchester United being knocked out by Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals on away goals. The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium had hosted three European Cup finals: in 1957, 1969 and 1980.\nAs the winners, Inter played against 2009–10 UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup, and also entered the semi-finals of the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup.\nBackground.\nPrior to the 2010 final, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan had met four times in European competition. In those four matches, Bayern held the edge with two wins to Inter's one; the other match finished as a draw. The first meeting between the two sides took place in the third round of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup; Inter won 2–0 the first match at the Olympiastadion in Munich, but Bayern responded with a 3–1 win at the San Siro two weeks later to go through on the away goals rule. They were next drawn together in Group B of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, along with Spartak Moscow and Sporting CP. The first match between Bayern and Inter was played at the San Siro, where Bayern won 2–0; the return match finished as a 1–1 draw.\nBoth teams went into the final chasing the treble, an achievement never before reached by teams from their respective countries; Inter came closest in 1965, when they won the Serie A and the European Cup but lost 1–0 to Juventus in the Coppa Italia final. Bayern Munich claimed their 22nd Bundesliga title on the last day of the season with a 3–1 win away to Hertha BSC on 8 May 2010, before claiming their eighth domestic Double with a 4–0 win over Werder Bremen in the 2010 DFB-Pokal Final on 15 May. Meanwhile, Inter beat Roma 1–0 for their sixth Coppa Italia on 5 May, and then won their fifth Serie A title in a row and their second Double on 16 May with a 1–0 win away to relegated Siena. With both teams having secured domestic Doubles going into the final, it was guaranteed that the Treble would be won for the second year in a row, following Barcelona's success in 2008–09.\nThe managers of both teams had won the Champions League before: Bayern manager Louis van Gaal won the competition with Ajax in 1995, while Inter's José Mourinho was manager of Porto's 2004 side. The winning manager would therefore become only the third in European Cup history to win as manager of two clubs, following in the footsteps of Ernst Happel (Feyenoord in 1970 and Hamburg in 1983) and Ottmar Hitzfeld (Borussia Dortmund in 1997 and Bayern Munich in 2001).\nThe Santiago Bernabéu Stadium had hosted three European Cup finals: in 1957, 1969 and 1980. Real Madrid themselves won the 1957 final – their second of five consecutive wins – beating Fiorentina 2–0 in front of 120,000 spectators, the second highest attendance in a European Cup final. A.C. Milan won the next final at the stadium, beating Ajax 4–1 in 1969, and Nottingham Forest won 1–0 against Hamburg in the most recent final in Madrid in 1980.\nThe stadium was opened in 1947 following the election of Santiago Bernabéu as the president of Real Madrid. Upon construction, the stadium had a maximum capacity in excess of 75,000, but this was increased to 125,000 with the addition of a fourth stand in 1954. The stadium was chosen as one of two venues for matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup, hosting both of the Spain team's matches, including their 2–1 win over the Soviet Union. In preparation for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, FIFA requirements forced renovations to the stadium, adding a canopy to three of the four stands and reducing the capacity to 90,800. The stadium hosted all three Group B matches and the final of the 1982 World Cup. Conversion to an all-seater stadium in 1998 further reduced capacity to just over 75,000, but the most recent expansion in 2006 increased capacity to just over 80,000. Only around 75,000 seats, however, were available for the 2010 final.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid was selected as the venue for the 2010 UEFA Champions League final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, on 28 March 2008. The committee – who selected the venue for the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final at the same meeting – based their decision on a number of key criteria, including stadium capacity, facilities and security. It had been decided that the final would be played on a Saturday for the first time in Champions League history at the UEFA Executive Committee's meeting in Lucerne, Switzerland, on 30 November 2007.\nThe unique visual identity of the 2010 final was revealed at a special ceremony at Madrid's \"Ciudad del Fútbol Español\" on 20 November 2009. In attendance at the ceremony were final ambassador Emilio Butragueño, Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar Llona and UEFA's competitions director Giorgio Marchetti. UEFA has given the Champions League final a unique visual identity every year since 1999, in order to give \"a distinctive flavour of the host city\". The logo features the UEFA Champions League trophy at its core, surrounded by elements of the Champions League \"starball\" logo, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Puerta de Alcalá. The logo was designed to capture \"the cultural and 'fiesta' aspects which Madrid is famed for\".\nA trophy handover ceremony was held at the Palacio de Cibeles in Madrid on 16 April 2010, when Johan Cruyff and Joan Laporta – as representatives of the 2009 champions, Barcelona – returned the UEFA Champions League Trophy to UEFA president Michel Platini. Platini then handed the trophy to Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar Llona and Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, the mayor of Madrid, so that it might be put on display in the city until the day of the final. Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez, players Raúl, Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo, and final ambassador Emilio Butragueño were also present at the ceremony.\nTicketing.\nAlthough the usual capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium was over 80,000, the net capacity for the 2010 Champions League final was around 75,000. The two finalists were each allocated 21,000 tickets, with a further 11,000 tickets being made available to the general public. Applications for those tickets were opened on 8 March 2010 and ran until 19 March; recipients were determined by a random lottery. These figures included a certain number of tickets set aside specifically for children; 2,000 tickets from each club's allocation went to children and their accompanying adults, as did 1,000 tickets from the general public's allocation. Finally, 500 tickets were reserved for children taking part in the activities at the UEFA Champions Festival in the week leading up to the final.\nA ticketing launch event was held in Madrid on 5 March 2010, at which the ticketing concept for the final was announced. The event was also used to promote the start of ticket sales for the match, and was attended by the ambassador for the final, Emilio Butragueño, the president of the Community of Madrid, Esperanza Aguirre, and representatives from UEFA, the Royal Spanish Football Federation and the host club, Real Madrid. At the event, Aguirre was presented with the first ticket for the final by Real Madrid players Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl.\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball for the 2010 Champions League final, the \"Adidas Finale Madrid\", was unveiled on 9 March 2010. It was the tenth ball to use the \"Starball\" design that had become synonymous with the UEFA Champions League. Each of the stars on the ball featured an element of the logos of each of the last 10 Champions League finals, drawn in gold. In reference to the colours of the Spanish flag, each gold star has a red border, while the base colour of the ball referred to the white of Real Madrid's kit. The ball retained the \"goosebump\" texture of the previous two versions, but the panel configuration was changed for the \"Finale Madrid\", with the panels following the star pattern on the ball.\nOfficials.\nThe referee for the 2010 UEFA Champions League final was Howard Webb, representing The Football Association of England. Webb became an international referee in 2005, and took charge of his first UEFA Champions League match in the August of that year, when he officiated the match between Haka and Vålerenga in the second qualifying round. His first appointment in the Champions League proper came a year later with the group stage encounter between Steaua București and Lyon on 26 September 2006. Prior to the 2010 final, he had refereed a further 17 Champions League matches and nine UEFA Cup matches. He was also a referee at UEFA Euro 2008, the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, and he was selected to be England's representative at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nAs usual, the referee was supported by assistant referees and a fourth official from the same country; in the 2010 final, Howard Webb was assisted by Darren Cann and Mike Mullarkey, with Martin Atkinson as the fourth official.\nBroadcasting.\nFor the first time in the United States, television coverage of the Champions League final was broadcast on a nationwide terrestrial network. Affiliates of Fox picked up coverage, beginning with a pre-game show at 14:30 EDT/11:30 PDT.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe 2010 Champions League final officially opened with the UEFA Champions Festival on 15 May 2010. The festival was held at Madrid's \"Parque del Retiro\" and ran for the entire week leading up to the final. It featured several events and exhibitions for fans to take part in; as well as being able to play on public-use mini-pitches, fans were able to meet famous faces from European football and explore the history of the Champions League. On the day of the final, the festival culminated with a match between former Spanish players and other European ex-professionals.\nThe UEFA Champions League Anthem was performed by Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flórez.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nThe Inter team that began the game featured no Italian players in the starting line-up, while Bayern started the game with five Germans, all internationals named in the provisional German squad for the 2010 World Cup. Franck Ribéry was a notable absence for Bayern, serving a three-match suspension after being sent off in the first leg of the semi-final against Lyon for a foul on Lisandro López, while Inter were without midfielder Thiago Motta, who was serving a two-match suspension.\nSummary.\nThe match was won 2–0 by Inter. Inter employed a counter-attacking strategy that saw them have less possession than Bayern, but Inter were able to comfortably defend their lead. Both goals were scored by Diego Milito, in the 35th and 70th minutes. Milito's first was scored following a long clearance by Inter goalkeeper Júlio César flicked down by Milito to Wesley Sneijder, who returned the pass to Milito to score. Milito's second goal came after he collected a pass from Samuel Eto'o and beat Daniel Van Buyten with the ball. Milito was substituted shortly before the end of the match, allowing him to be applauded by the Inter supporters. After the match, Milito stated the win brought \"incredible happiness\" and claimed his side deserved its victory. Bayern captain Mark van Bommel conceded Inter was the \"most effective team\", referring to the success of Inter's counter-attacking tactics. José Mourinho revealed after the match that he would likely resign from Inter to pursue the goal of being the first manager to win the Champions League with three clubs. Reports had linked him with a move to Real Madrid.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nAs a result of Inter's victory, Italy held onto its position in the top three of the UEFA country coefficient rankings and would therefore retain its fourth berth in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. If Bayern had won or the match had gone to penalties, Germany would have overtaken Italy and received an extra entry in 2010–11. Having beaten Roma both in the 2010 Coppa Italia Final and to the 2009–10 Serie A title, Inter won the treble for the first time in Italian football history.\nDespite winning the treble, José Mourinho resigned as manager of Inter on 28 May to take over from Manuel Pellegrini as manager of Real Madrid, citing a desire to become the first manager to win the Champions League with three clubs. However, he was unable to accomplish this feat, being eliminated in three successive semi-finals before returning to his former club Chelsea in June 2013, with Carlo Ancelotti replacing him at Real Madrid (who went on to win the club's tenth title in his first season).\nAs winners of the Champions League, Inter played in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup against 2009–10 UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid. They lost the match 2–0, with goals from José Antonio Reyes and Sergio Agüero. They also took part in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, entering at the semi-final stage. There they beat 2010 AFC Champions League winners Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma 3–0 to reach the final against 2010 CAF Champions League winners TP Mazembe, whom they also beat 3–0 to take the title."

The club was established in 1877 and has won the ECB National Club Cricket Championship on 2 occasions: 2003 and 2014. The club currently play in the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League being Champions in 2002, 2004, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2021.&lt;br&gt;\nGround.\nThe club has played at Longmoor Lane, Sandiacre, since around 1890. The current pavilion was built in 2002 with the aid of a National Lottery grant. The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Longmoor Lane pitch, rated by the DCCL as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd XI and Junior teams use Breaston CC's old ground, located south of Risley, Derbyshire, which is rated as a Grade B ground.&lt;br&gt;\nHistory.\nHistory of cricket in Sandiacre dates back to the early nineteenth century, where a match report was recorded between Sandiacre and Stapleford in the \"Nottingham Review\" on the 4th November 1814, which Sandiacre won. It's uncertain as to where the original home ground was, but the earliest clue was published in the \"Nottingham Review\" in 1838 stating that the ground was in a field near the Plough Inn. Sometime between 1877 - 1900, the club moved to rented farmland on Longmoor Lane. By 1921, the earliest reference to 'Sandiacre Town' appeared, possibly to help differentiate the club from neighbouring rivals using Sandiacre in their team names. After raising money from collecting door to door throughout Sandiacre and with help from the National Playing Field's Association, the club managed to buy the Ground on Longmoor Lane in 1956, three years after joining the Nott's Amateur League. After a century of eventful cricketing memories, the old pavilion was eventually replaced by the current pavilion in 2002, which was formally opened by Ian Botham and Ravi Bopara in 2003.\nThe Club currently has 3 senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a Sunday league team in the Newark Club Cricket Alliance league and a long established and very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub Performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2001.\nThe Newark Club Cricket Alliance Sunday League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2011."

        "text": "Michael David Minor (born December 26, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 MLB draft. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, and Cincinnati Reds.\nEarly life.\nMinor had an outstanding high school career at Forrest School in Chapel Hill, Tennessee and was drafted in the 13th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays after his senior season. However, he did not sign, choosing to attend Vanderbilt University.\nCollege career.\nMinor played at Vanderbilt University with fellow future first round draft picks Pedro Alvarez and David Price.\nUnited States National Team.\nMinor pitched for the United States National Team (Collegiate) in 2007 and 2008.\nOne highlight of the 2008 season was his earning the 4–1 win over Cuba in the championship game of the Haarlem Baseball Week tournament in The Netherlands. This victory marked the first time in recorded history that a United States Collegiate National Team has defeated the Cuba Olympic Team in a tournament title game. In the 2008 World University Baseball Championship held in Brno, Czech Republic, Minor led Team USA to its third gold medal alongside Stephen Strasburg. In the tournament, he was 1–0 with a 1.15 ERA and 16 strikeouts, allowing eight hits in 15 innings for Team USA. In 2008, he was named \"Baseball America\"s Summer Player of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nAtlanta Braves.\nMinor was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round (seventh overall) in the 2009 Major League Baseball draft and represented the United States in the 2010 All-Star Futures Game.\nMinor made his major-league debut on August 9, 2010 against the Houston Astros. He recorded his first strikeout against Chris Johnson. On the night, he went six innings giving up five hits and four runs (three earned) while walking one and striking out five batters; he got a no-decision. In his next start on August 17, 2010, Minor went six innings giving up five hits and two earned runs and got his first major league victory. Then, in his third career start against the Chicago Cubs, Minor went six innings giving up three earned runs while striking out 12 and earning his second career victory. Those 12 strikeouts set an Atlanta Braves rookie strikeout record in a single game; surpassing Tommy Hanson's 11 strikeouts in 2009. On August 18, 2011, in a game against the San Francisco Giants, Minor pitched six scoreless innings including facing the minimum number of batters over the last four innings. This victory was the first time in 17 major league starts that Minor did not give up a run.\nOn May 25, 2013, Minor hit his first career home run off Dillon Gee of the New York Mets in a 6–0 win.\nOn August 22, 2014, Minor pitched no-hit innings, before giving up an RBI single to the Reds' Billy Hamilton. The Braves eventually won the game in the 12th inning on Justin Upton's two-run home run. Minor finished the 2014 season with a 6–12 record and 4.77 ERA, pitching most of the year with a sore shoulder.\nIn 2015, Minor became the first Brave since John Rocker in 2001 to challenge the team in an arbitration hearing. He won and was awarded $5.6 million. On March 3, 2015, Minor again began feeling tightness in his shoulder and was diagnosed with rotator cuff inflammation. As a result, he was placed on the disabled list on March 10. Minor attempted to start throwing programs in mid-March and early April, but felt discomfort both times. He was moved to the 60-day disabled list on May 2. Eleven days later, Minor underwent surgery for a torn labrum, and missed the rest of the season.\nMinor became a free agent on December 2, 2015, when the Braves opted not to tender him a contract.\nKansas City Royals.\nMinor signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Royals worth $7.25 million with a club option worth $10 million for the 2018 season on February 19, 2016. \nMinor started the 2016 season on the disabled list. The Royals planned for Minor to return in the second half of the season, but persistent fatigue and discomfort in his shoulder forced Minor to stay on the disabled list for the rest of the season.\nBecause of his troubles staying healthy, the Royals announced that Minor would pitch out of the bullpen in 2017. A move to relief brought tremendous results for Minor, who saw his average fastball velocity climb to nearly 95 miles per hour, compared to 91 miles per hour as a starter. Minor would emerge as one of the Royals best relievers, finishing with a 2.55 ERA and six saves, with 88 strikeouts in 77 innings. Despite his success out of the bullpen, Minor returned to starting in 2018.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn December 4, 2017, Minor signed with the Texas Rangers to a three-year, $28 million deal.

        "text": "Rugby union in the Arabian Peninsula is a minor, but growing sport. The game is played in six out of seven countries on the peninsula, specifically the Gulf Cooperation states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The region hosts the annual Dubai Sevens and Dubai Women's Sevens tournaments which are global events on the World Rugby sevens series for men and women.\nHistory.\nRugby was first brought to the region by the British military around the mid-20th century. In addition, some Arabian royals and nobles had been sending their sons to English private schools, where they picked up the game.\nThe sport was promoted by Commonwealth expatriates working in the oil industry. The Emirs, greatly interested by the phenomenon, provided grounds and financial support. The Dubai Sevens was founded in 1970, and developed into one of the premier rugby sevens tournaments in the world. The Dubai Sevens also encouraged the setting up of a number of Arab teams.\nPrior to the end of 2010, rugby in all six Gulf Cooperation countries was administered by a single governing body, the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union (AGRFU). However, the International Rugby Board's governance restructuring project for the West Asia region under the Asian Rugby Football Union dissolved the AGRFU to allow separate national federations to be formed for each member country from 2011 onwards. The unified representative team for the six Gulf states played its final Test match in May 2010, before the split.\nThe UAE Rugby Federation was formed in 2009 and their national team inherited the former Arabian Gulf team's world ranking, while separate federations in Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the new sports governing bodies for rugby in those countries. Other countries previously under the unified Gulf Rugby umbrella that had not formed national governing bodies – Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman – were assisted by the UAE Rugby Federation in administering cross-border club competitions."

He played in 48 National Hockey League (NHL) games for the New York Rangers and the Detroit Cougars. He also earned a Doctor of Dental Medicine degree from the University of Toronto.\nPlaying career.\nMinor league hockey.\nBrown played hockey as a teen with the North Bay Arena Stars of the North Bay Hockey League. As a 16-year-old, Brown excelled and quickly join the Ontario Hockey Association Junior ranks, playing for both the Berlin Union Jacks and the St. Michael's Majors. During the 1916–17 season, Brown spent some time in the OHA-Senior playing with the Toronto St. Pats, scoring three goals in eight games. Deciding it was time for college, Brown enrolled in the University of Toronto to study dentistry. He also joined the Toronto Dentals, a local club made up of dentistry students, which had just won the Allan Cup. Brown successfully juggled both his studies and his play on the ice, and after two seasons with the Dentals, finally was offered a roster spot on the University of Toronto's Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team. Brown played on the team for two years, helping the team to win the Allan Cup in 1921 by scoring eight points in the five game playoff. After graduating, Brown decided to follow his hockey career and left dentistry for a later day. He joined the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds for the 1922–23 season and put up seven points in his first eight games. He continued to impress and in this second season with the Greyhounds, Brown helped lead the team to their first and his second Allan Cup.\nThe Greyhounds moved to Detroit for the 1926–27 season in an effort stem the loss of money from the club and Brown moved with them. The Detroit Greyhounds played only six games that season before they and the Northern Ontario Hockey Association Senior-A League folded.\nNHL.\nBrown didn't have to wait long before lacing up his skates again. The New York Rangers signed Brown as a free agent on December 23, 1926. Brown played the final 24 games of the 1926–27 season with the Blueshirts, scoring six goals and two assists. He played in both playoff games for New York that year, failing to record a point and watching the Boston Bruins go on to the Stanley Cup Finals. On October 10, 1927, Brown was traded to the Detroit Cougars for Harry Meeking and Archie Briden as part of Jack Adams' major restructuring plan for Detroit. Brown played only 24 games of the 1927–28 season in Detroit before again being traded. On February 13, 1928, the Cougars received Pete Palangio and cash from the Montreal Canadiens for Brown.\nBrown was quickly assigned to Montreal's farm team the Windsor Bulldogs of the Canadian Professional Hockey League. Brown scored 13 points in his first season as the team was getting ready for a move to the International Hockey League. Brown had his best year during the 1929–30 season, in which the defenceman scored 23 points and logged 22 penalty minutes. Brown played four more seasons in Windsor before retiring after the 1934–35 season.\nCoaching career.\nThe first game of the year for the Bulldogs during the 1934–35 season would turn out to be Brown's last, as He had been asked to try his hand at coaching the team that he had been a part of for the past seven years. As the head coach, Brown finished with a 14–23–7 record. Brown decided that coaching wasn't his passion and decided to retire from ice hockey."

        "title": "Virginia Cavaliers baseball",
        "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers baseball team represents the University of Virginia in NCAA Division I college baseball. Established in 1889, the team participates in the Coastal division of the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays its home games at Davenport Field at Disharoon Park. The team's head coach is Brian O'Connor. The team has reached the College World Series six times, most recently in 2023, and won the national championship in 2015.\nHistory.\nVirginia played its first baseball game, a 13–4 win over Richmond College, in 1889. The Cavaliers had limited success in their first 100 years of play, winning their first ACC regular season title and making their NCAA tournament debut in 1972 under Jim West and returning in 1985 and 1996 under Dennis Womack, failing to advance past regional play. They won their first ACC tournament championship in 1996 behind the pitching of All-American righthander Seth Greisinger. One highlight was the performance of left-handed pitcher Eppa Rixey, who won 266 games for the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds from 1912–1933 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as a Veterans Committee selection in 1963.\nIn 1966, left-handed pitcher Edward Turnbull became the program's first MLB draft pick, going to the Baltimore Orioles in the 17th round. Outfielder Brian Buchanan was the first Virginia player to become a first-round pick, going to the New York Yankees in the 1994 draft.\nTiering proposal and Davenport Field.\nIn 2001, the program was threatened by recommendations from a university task force that would have split the school's sports into four tiers, with each tier funded differently. The baseball program was placed in the lowest tier and would have lost the ability to offer athletic scholarships if the recommendation was implemented, but the university's Board of Visitors rejected the proposal.\nThe next year, the Virginia athletic department took steps to increase the program's competitiveness, notably renovating the team's stadium, which was renamed Davenport Field after longtime athletic administrator and former baseball coach Ted Davenport, who had died in 2001. The expansion was funded by $2 million in anonymous donations, believed to have come from bestselling author John Grisham, a Charlottesville resident whose son, Ty, played for the team. Before the renovation, the field did not have lights, and the infield was made of artificial turf handed down from an old football facility. Bermuda grass was installed during the renovations.\nBrian O'Connor era.\nWomack stepped down in 2004, and Notre Dame associate head coach Brian O'Connor took over and made an immediate impact, with the program hosting its first NCAA regional in his first season. The Cavaliers have made the NCAA tournament every year from 2004-2017, and again from 2021-2023. The Cavaliers have claimed two ACC regular season titles under Coach O'Connor and captured ACC tournament championships in 2009 and 2011.\nVirginia hosted NCAA regionals again in 2006 and 2007, but did not advance until 2009. That year, the Cavaliers won the Irvine Regional, defeating San Diego State ace Stephen Strasburg in the process, and defeated Ole Miss in the Oxford Super Regional to advance to the program's first College World Series. The Cavaliers would finish fifth, falling to eventual National Champion Louisiana State in their first game, eliminating #2 national seed Cal State Fullerton in their second game, and then bowing out in a 12-inning loss to Arkansas.\nThe Cavaliers won the Charlottesville Regional again in 2010, but fell to Oklahoma in the Charlottesville Super Regional. In 2011, entering the NCAA tournament as the top overall seed, they swept the Charlottesville Regional and rallied from a ninth-inning deficit to defeat UC Irvine on a two-run single from Chris Taylor in the Charlottesville Super Regional's decisive game three. They finished third in the College World Series, defeating California twice before twice losing to eventual champion South Carolina, with the elimination loss coming in 13 innings. The 2011 season also witnessed the only perfect game in Virginia baseball history, an accomplishment achieved by UVA pitcher Will Roberts during a March 30 win over George Washington. In 2013, Virginia swept the Charlottesville Regional before losing to Mississippi State in the Charlottesville Super Regional. \nDuring an impressive 2014 campaign, the Cavaliers finished 53-16 and were rewarded with the #3 National Seed. After sweeping past Arkansas and Bucknell in the Charlottesville Regional and defeating border rival Maryland in the Charlottesville Super Regional, the Cavaliers returned to the College World Series for the first time in three seasons. They would sweep their side of the bracket, defeating Ole Miss (twice) and TCU to advance to the CWS Finals for the first time in school history. After splitting the first two games, UVA would fall to Vanderbilt 3-2 in a decisive Game 3 of the College World Series finals, ending the most successful season in school history up to that point.\n2015 NCAA Champions.\nIn 2015, an injury-riddled Virginia team slumped in the regular season and needed a series win in the final regular-season series at North Carolina to sew up a bid in the ACC tournament. They made the NCAA tournament as a No. 3 seed and swept through the Lake Elsinore Regional, defeating Southern California (twice) and San Diego State. They hosted Maryland in the Charlottesville Super Regional and clinched a trip to the College World Series on Ernie Clement's two-run single in the bottom of the ninth of the second game.\nIn Omaha, Virginia defeated Arkansas and Florida (twice) to set up a finals rematch with Vanderbilt. The Commodores won the first game 5–1 before the Cavaliers evened the series with a 3–0 victory behind five innings from surprise starter Adam Haseley and four from Josh Sborz. Virginia fell behind early in the decisive third game, giving up two runs in the first inning, but Pavin Smith homered to pull the Cavaliers even and singled to score Haseley with the eventual winning run. Brandon Waddell threw seven strong innings, aided by an acrobatic, run-saving stop from third baseman Kenny Towns, as the Cavaliers won 4–2 to capture the program's first national championship and the first for an ACC program since Wake Forest in 1955.\nLean Years and Return to Omaha.\nThe 2015 National Champions followed that title up with another strong campaign in 2016, finishing 38–20 overall and 19-11 in the ACC. The Cavaliers were rewarded with the #12 national seed in the 2016 NCAA tournament and hosted the Charlottesville Regional, but were eliminated in three games. The Cavaliers followed up 2016 with another successful campaign in 2017, finishing 43–16 overall and 18–12 in the ACC. Despite the strong record, Virginia was denied the chance to host a regional, being sent to the TCU-hosted Fort Worth regional, falling in three games.\nThe 2018 Virginia baseball team finished 29–25 overall, 12–18 in conference play, missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2003 season. The team was slightly improved in 2019, finishing 32–24, 14–16 in conference, but once again missed the NCAA tournament. The 2020 team got off to a hot start, beginning the season with a 14–4 record and upsetting #8 in NC State in the ACC-opening series. On March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia and the ACC announced the season will be suspended until further notice. On March 17, 2020, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced all spring sports would be cancelled for the remainder of the season.\nThe Cavaliers would return to the Diamond and the NCAA tournament, finishing 36–27 overall, 18–18 in the ACC. They were rewarded with the 3-seed in the Columbia Regional. After falling to 2-seed and host South Carolina (Regional 1-seed Old Dominion was unable to host due to Covid-19 protocol), Virginia rallied to defeat Jacksonville, South Carolina, and Old Dominion twice to advance to the Super Regionals. During this regional, Cavalier closer Stephen Schoch would go viral for his remarks during a post-game interview, being positively compared to fictional pitcher Kenny Powers. The Cavaliers would then face Dallas Baptist in the Columbia Super Regional, defeating the Patriots in three games to advance to the CWS for the first time since their 2015 title. The Cavaliers would defeat #3 National seed Tennessee before falling to #7 seed and eventual National Champion Mississippi State and #2 seed Texas, ending an impressive postseason run.\nVirginia would finish 39–19 (17–13 ACC) in 2022, being rewarded with the 2-seed in the East Carolina-hosted Greenville Regional. After defeating Coastal Carolina in their first game, UVA would lose consecutive games to ECU and CCU to end their season. \nVirginia would respond with a stellar season in 2023, finishing the regular season with a 45–12 record, 19–11 in the ACC, and catcher Kyle Teel won the ACC Player of the Year award, becoming the first Cavalier to do so since Sean Doolittle in 2006. Virginia would receive the #7 National Seed and defeat Army and East Carolina twice to win the Charlottesville Regional. They defeated Duke 2 games to 1 in the Charlottesville Super Regional to reach the College World Series. However, their run ended there as they lost to Florida and TCU to end their season with a 50–15 record.\nHonors.\nNational Coach of the Year.\nLegend:\nHead coaches.\nWhen West died on May 24, 2009, the Cavaliers added a black circle with the number \"24\" above the team name on their uniforms for the rest of the season. West had worn that number when he was coach."

He was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1984 out of Florida State University.\nPlaying career.\nA forkball specialist, Gray started his professional career in 1984 in the Philadelphia Phillies' minor-league system for two years. He was traded along with John Denny from the Phillies to the Cincinnati Reds for Tom Hume and Gary Redus on December 11, 1985. In 1986, he posted a 14–2 record with a 2.35 ERA and 15 saves for the Double-A Vermont Reds. Gray played in Triple-A for the Nashville Sounds in 1987, compiling a 4.86 ERA in 53 appearances. Returning to Nashville in 1988, he went 8–5 with five saves and a 1.97 in 42 appearances, and was promoted to the Reds during midseason.

He returned to Triple-A Nashville for the 1989 season, logging a 3.66 ERA in 44 games.\nGray rejoined the Phillies organization before the 1990 season. At the end of spring training, he was told by the Phillies that he had not made the major-league roster; they asked him to go to Double-A Reading. Gray rejected the offer and signed with the Boston Red Sox organization. After starting the season in Triple-A with the Pawtucket Red Sox, he was promoted to Boston mid-season a become a significant contributor to the American League East division winners.

He never made it, as his right side went numb, and he suffered what was later diagnosed as a kind of stroke, ending what had been a brilliant season.\nGray missed the rest of the 1991 and 1992 seasons while recuperating from the stroke. He attempted to return to baseball over the following two seasons, but had lost a lot of velocity on his fastball and was never able to return to the majors.\nIn a three-season major-league career, Gray posted a 4–7 record with a 3.33 ERA and 10 saves in 96 appearances, including a 3.31 strikeout-to-walk ratio (96-to-29) in innings pitched.\nPost-playing career.\nGray returned to the game as a pitching coach.

All the players have represented their respective member teams of the ICC at either Test or ODI level, but only the records of their games for the ACA African XI are listed.\nThe rules of ODIs have changed since the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth man would be allowed to take to the field in the place of one of the players and would be allowed to bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result, this meant there were generally 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11 – even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Monde Zondeki bowled for Africa XI during the second match, but was substituted for Steve Tikolo during the innings break and Tikolo went on to bat in his place instead; both players are listed as receiving a cap for this match. These rules were not in place for the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.\nOf the six matches to have been played to date, the ACA African XI has only won one match: the inaugural match at Centurion. However, they went on to lose the next ODI, and the final match of the 2005 competition was called off due to rain, leading to the trophy was shared.\nIn the 2007 competition, the African XI suffered a 3–0 whitewash, losing the first two matches by 34 and 31 runs respectively. Despite half-centuries from AB de Villiers, Justin Kemp and Shaun Pollock in the final ODI they went on to lose by 13 runs.\nShaun Pollock was the first player to score a century in the competition, during the first ODI of the 2007 competition, which led to him being named Man of the Match. He also has the most runs to his name between both African XI and Asian XI players.\nMorné Morkel has the highest number of wickets for the African XI with 8, all captured during the 2007 series, and the second most wickets in the Afro-Asia Cup's history.\nStatistics are correct as of June 10, following the conclusion of the 2007 series."

        "text": "Anthony “A-Train” Thomas (born November 7, 1977) is an American former professional football running back, playing for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1997 to 2000, breaking their career rushing record at the time with a four-year total of 4,472 yards. As a senior he rushed for 1,733 yards with 18 touchdowns, and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten running back.\nThomas was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. As a rookie with the Bears in 2001, he rushed for over 1,100 yards and seven touchdowns to earn NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He played for the Bears from 2001 to 2004, Dallas Cowboys in 2005, New Orleans Saints in 2005, and Buffalo Bills from 2006 to 2007.\nHigh school career.\nThomas was born in Pineville, Louisiana, in 1977 and attended Winnfield Senior High School in Winnfield, Louisiana. He starred on the basketball, track, and football teams. He totaled 7,594 rushing yards and scored 682 points for the Winnfield tigers. He also set a state record with 106 career touchdowns while playing both running back and placekicker. He was named a first-team All-American and rated as the second-best running back in the country by the \"Prep Football Report\".\nCollege career.\nThomas enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1997. While playing at Michigan, he was given the nickname \"A-Train\" by Brent Musburger.\nAs a freshman, he was a member of the undefeated, national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team. That year, he was the Wolverines' #2 running back (behind Chris Howard), twice rushed for over 100 yards (122 yards against Baylor and 129 yards against Iowa), and compiled a total of 549 rushing yards and 219 receiving yards. He was honored as the 1997 Big Ten Freshman Of the Year by both the conference coaches and media.\nAfter his freshman year, Thomas led the Wolverines in rushing for three consecutive years with 893 yards in 1998, 1,297 yards in 1999, and 1,733 yards in 2000. His 1,733 rushing yards in 2000 remains the second highest single-season total in Michigan history. During the 2000 season, Thomas had nine games in which he rushed for over 100 yards, including 228 yards against Illinois, 199 yards against Northwestern, and 182 yards against both UCLA and Auburn. He was selected as a second-team All-Big Ten player in 1999 (coaches and media), and as a first-team All-Big Ten player in 2000 (coaches and media). He was also selected as both a team captain and most valuable player on the 2000 Michigan team.\nThomas's 4,472 rushing yards broke Jamie Morris' Michigan career rushing records. (Thomas's record was later broken by Mike Hart.) He also broke Tyrone Wheatley's modern Michigan career record with 56 touchdowns (Thomas's record was later broken by Blake Corum.) He also set and continues to hold Michigan records with an average of 144.4 rushing yards per game in 2000 and six games in a season with at least 150 rushing yards.\nProfessional career.\nIn April 2001, Thomas was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round (38th overall pick) of the 2001 NFL draft. On October 21, 2001, Thomas set two Bears rookie records with 188 rushing yards and a 8.55 yards/carry average in a 24–0 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He set his third franchise rookie record in the season finale with 33 carries; he also had 160 yards and a touchdown in the clinching victory over Jacksonville. With 1,183 rushing yards during the 2001 season, Thomas helped lead the Bears to a 13–3 record and an NFC Central championship. In January 2002, he received the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for the 2001 season.\nThomas remained the Bears' top running back for two more years with 721 rushing yards in 2002 and 1,024 rushing yards in 2003. In 2004, Thomas Jones took over as the Bears' lead back, and Thomas was limited to 404 yards on 122 carries.\nIn May 2005, Thomas signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys and was expected to be the backup running back to Julius Jones. He appeared in six games, two as a starter, for the 2005 Cowboys, gaining only 80 yards on 36 carries. Thomas' ineffectiveness in limited duty, his inability to play special teams, and the emergence of Marion Barber III as the primary backup led Dallas to release him in November 2005. He was quickly signed by New Orleans after they lost Deuce McAllister with a season ending knee injury. Thomas appeared in only four games, all as a backup for the Saints, and gained 12 yards on seven carries.\nOn April 28, 2006, Thomas signed with the Buffalo Bills. In 2006, he appeared in 16 games, two as a starter, for the Bills, and gained 378 yards on 107 carries. The following year, he appeared in 10 games and gained 89 yards on 36 carries. He was placed on injured reserve in early December 2007.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2011, Thomas served as the running backs coach at West Virginia Wesleyan College. He was promoted to special teams coordinator and assistant head coach in 2012.\nIn 2015, Thomas was selected for induction into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame."

        "title": "South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball",
        "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team represents the University of South Carolina and competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gamecocks won Southern Conference titles in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945, and then they gained national attention under hall of fame coach Frank McGuire, posting a 205–65 record from 1967 to 1976, which included the 1970 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship, the 1971 ACC Tournament title, and four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances from 1971 to 1974. The program also won the 1997 SEC championship, National Invitation Tournament (NIT) titles in 2005 and 2006, and a share of the 2009 SEC East division title. Most recently, the Gamecocks won the 2017 NCAA East Regional Championship, reaching the Final Four for the first time in school history. Lamont Paris is the current head coach, and the team plays at the 18,000-seat Colonial Life Arena.\nHistory.\nSouthern Conference years.\nSouth Carolina achieved a measure of regional prominence during its tenure in the Southern Conference, winning regular season championships in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945. The program also won the conference's tournament championship in 1933. During World War II, the basketball team's success was partially attributed to being assigned outstanding athletes by the U.S. Navy as part of the V-12 program. However, the Navy leaders kept the teams focus towards the war effort, and USC declined an invitation to the Southern Conference Tournament in 1944.\nFrank McGuire era (1965–1980).\nThe hiring of Frank McGuire before the 1964–65 season propelled South Carolina to its most successful period to date. McGuire's 16-year tenure was highlighted by an undefeated ACC regular season in 1970, an ACC Tournament championship in 1971, and three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances from 1971 to 1973. USC also posted a 69–16 overall record from 1968 to 1971, and John Roche won consecutive ACC Player of the Year Awards (1969–1970). In November 1968, the Gamecocks began playing at the 12,401 seat Carolina Coliseum, which became known as the \"House that Frank Built.\" The success South Carolina achieved on the court brought resentment and anger from fellow ACC schools, especially those on \"Tobacco Road,\" as the conference members of the state of North Carolina were known. The hostility of the road crowds, the unfriendly behavior of coaches and athletic directors in the conference, and the discrepancies in eligibility to compete in the NCAA tournament, which at that time was delegated strictly to the winner of the ACC tournament despite that year's championship game being the only Gamecocks loss, led McGuire to support South Carolina becoming an Independent before the 1971–72 season.\nAs an independent, the program gradually declined, and the university sought entrance into an athletic conference. This proved problematic because most conferences required schools to have a single athletic director, and South Carolina had multiple directors at the time. McGuire served as athletic director for the basketball program, and he would not relinquish his position. The university made several attempts to obtain McGuire's resignation, but ultimately honored his contract through 1980. McGuire finished with a 283–142 overall record at South Carolina and continues to be held in high regard by Gamecock fans. His six consecutive 20-win seasons from 1969 to 1974, which produced a 137–33 record, remain the benchmark for USC Basketball.\nMetro Conference and SEC.\nIn 1983, the university became affiliated with the Metro Conference. The basketball program was placed on probation by the NCAA in the spring of 1987 for two years because of recruiting violations and the sale of complimentary player tickets. From 1987 to 1991, George Felton led the Gamecocks to an 87–62 overall record, which included a 1989 NCAA Tournament appearance and a 1991 NIT berth. For three of Felton's five seasons (1987–1989), Tubby Smith served as an assistant coach before leaving to join Rick Pitino's staff at Kentucky. South Carolina joined the SEC before the 1992 season and initially struggled, posting a combined 20–35 record in 1992 and 1993.\nEddie Fogler era (1994–2001).\nEddie Fogler was hired away from Vanderbilt before the 1994 season and within a few years returned the Gamecocks to respectability. Under Fogler, South Carolina posted an impressive 66–28 record (34–14 SEC) during the 1996–1998 stretch, which included the school's first SEC championship in 1997. The 1997 Gamecocks posted a 15–1 record in SEC play and defeated league rival Kentucky twice, but lost in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. Fogler stepped down after the 2001 campaign, going 123–117 in eight seasons as the Gamecocks' head coach. His tenure included two NCAA Tournament appearances (1997, 1998) and two NIT appearances (1996, 2001). Fogler retired as one of the most successful head coaches in SEC Basketball history, having won regular season conference championships at both Vanderbilt and South Carolina.\nDave Odom era (2002–2008).\nSubsequent coach Dave Odom posted four 20-win seasons during his tenure at South Carolina. He led the Gamecocks to an appearance in the 2004 NCAA Tournament and consecutive NIT championships in 2005 and 2006. Odom's tenure also saw USC begin play at the 18,000 seat Colonial Life Arena during the 2002–2003 season. Following the 2007–2008 campaign, Odom resigned with a 128–104 overall record at USC.\nDarrin Horn era (2009–2012).\nOn April 1, 2008, Darrin Horn was named the new head basketball coach at USC. In his first season, Horn led the Gamecocks to a 21–10 record (10–6 SEC), two victories over Kentucky, and a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern Division title. After a 10–21 campaign in 2011–12, his third straight losing season, Horn was fired on March 13, 2012, finishing his tenure at Carolina with a 60–63 overall record and a 23–45 mark in the SEC.\nFrank Martin era (2012–2022).\nFrank Martin came to USC from Kansas State, where he had enjoyed five winning seasons and four NCAA Tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance with the Wildcats in 2010. After losing records in his first two seasons with the Gamecocks, he achieved a winning season in 2015, then reached the NIT in 2016, and then broke through into the 2017 NCAA Tournament, the program's first appearance in the event since 2004. On March 17, 2017, USC achieved its first NCAA Tournament victory since 1973 with a 20-point win over the Marquette Golden Eagles. Two nights later, the Gamecocks upset the #2 seed Duke Blue Devils to advance to their fourth Sweet 16. South Carolina then beat #3 seed Baylor Bears to advance to their first-ever Elite 8, two days later they upset Florida to advance to their first ever Final Four.\nLamont Paris era (2022–present).\nFormer Chattanooga head coach Lamont Paris was named South Carolina's 33rd head coach on March 24, 2022, to replace the terminated Frank Martin. Paris is the first African-American head coach in the history of the Gamecock men's basketball program.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Gamecocks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 10 times. Their combined record is 8–11.\nNIT results.\nThe Gamecocks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 22–10.

There were a total number of 38 participating athletes, with two semi-finals and five qualifying heats and the final held on Thursday August 29, 1991.\nSummary.\nAll the eyes were on 33 year old Greg Foster, who was, as yet, undefeated in World Championship finals. Foster had lane 4 in the center of the track. Missing was the reigning double Olympic Champion and world record holder Roger Kingdom out with an ACL surgery. Next to Foster in lane 5 was the leading qualifier from the semis was Tony Jarrett, who had just edged Foster in that semi. The other semi was significantly slower, won by Jack Pierce.\nBefore the gun went off, Foster was already running—a false start, common and legal in this era. When the starter raised the gun again, Foster had a strike against him, meaning he could be disqualified for a second offense. Ostensibly that should make Foster more cautious. The next start was legal, Mark McKoy got a good start and had a clear lead over the first hurdle, with Foster just inches ahead of the wall of competitors almost a full stride behind. Over the next two hurdles, Foster made up most of the gap. Challenged to his right, McKoy began to struggle, Foster taking a clear lead. Behind them, Pierce was separating from the group in third place. By the sixth hurdle, Pierce caught McKoy and had the momentum chasing Foster. The next chaser was Jarrett, who caught McKoy over the eighth hurdle. Pierce was gaining on Foster but was still half a metre behind over the last hurdle. In the run in to the finish line, that half metre disappeared, the two hit the finish line together with Pierce clearly ahead just inches past the finish line. Jarrett continued on to take bronze almost .2 of a second behind the leaders.\nWith new technology, Japanese officials were able to display the finish picture quickly after the race, still looking like a tie. Three minutes later, Foster was announced as the winner, now for the third time in a row.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;br&gt;\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Neil Berry (January 11, 1922 – August 24, 2016), sometimes listed as Cornelius John Berry, and in other sources as Neil John Berry, was an American Major League Baseball infielder who played seven seasons in the American League with the Detroit Tigers (1948–1952), St. Louis Browns (1953), Chicago White Sox (1953), and Baltimore Orioles (1954).\nEarly years.\nBerry was born in 1922 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He attended Kalamazoo Central High School where he played football and baseball. In 1938, at age 16, he was triple-threat halfback who led Kalamazoo to a conference championship, scored 12 touchdowns, and was selected as captain of the all-state football team. He also played basketball for Kalamazoo Central and was a member of the school's 1937 state championship team.\nBerry also played American Legion junior baseball as a shortstop, hitting .529 at age 17 in 1939. He enrolled at Western State Teachers College (now Western Michigan University) in the fall of 1940. He left the school after only one year. \nProfessional baseball.\nWinston-Salem (1942).\nBerry was signed by Wish Egan for the Detroit Tigers in November 1941. He was assigned to the Winston-Salem Twins where he played shortstop and appeared in 135 games during the 1942 season, compiling a .231 batting average. He was rated the best-fielding shortstop in the Piedmont League, selected to the Piedmont League all-star team, and voted the most popular player on the Winston-Salem team.\nMilitary service (1943-1945).\nHe missed the 1943, 1944, and 1945 seasons to military service. He spent 42 months in the Army Air Force during World War II. He was assigned as a physical training instructor in Texas and later trained as a gunner on a B29. He received orderss to deploy overseas, but the order was cancelled by Berry's commanding officer, and Berry never left the United States. \nBuffalo Bisons (1946-1947).\nAfter the war, he spent the 1946 and 1947 seasons with the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit's affiliate in the International League. He was regarded as \"one of the best defensive shortstops and fastest infielders in the International League.\"He compiled a .299 batting average with 50 RBIs for the Bisons in 1947.\n1948 season.\nBerry attended spring training with the Detroit Tigers in 1948 and made it to the major leagues in 1948, compiling a .500 batting average through April 6 -- more than 100 points above any other Detroit player. Manager Steve O'Neill called Berry \"the most pleasant surprise of the spring\" and added:\nThat boy has everything doesn't he? I like the way he can cover ground in the field. I also like the way he can tear around the bases. I don't know if he's the speediest on the team, but he sure looks like it.\nBerry made his major-league debut on April 20, 1948, as the Tigers' starting shortstop, tallying his first major-league hit in the ninth inning and driving in a run. Berry ultimately lost the starting shortstop job to Johnny Lipon. Berry remained with the Tigers throughout the 1948 season, starting 38 games at shortstop and 26 games at second base while compiling a .266 batting average and .358 on-base percentage.\nBerry later recalled that his fondest memory from his playing career was from the final game of the 1948 season. Berry hit a double and two singles off Bob Feller.\nStarting second baseman (1949).\nWith the retirement of Eddie Mayo, Berry became the Tigers' starting second baseman in 1949. He appeared in 95 games at the position (90 as the starter), but his batting average dropped to .237 batting average with a .299 on-base percentage in 365 plate appearances.\n1950-1954 seasons.\nIn 1950, Berry lost the starting second baseman job to Jerry Priddy, and with Johnny Lipon at shortstop, Berry saw limited action, starting only nine games at shortstop. He compiled a .250 batting average and .348 on-base percentage in 47 plate appearances. On October 1, 1950, Berry was part of a triple play; with base runners on first and second, George Kell fielded a ground ball at third base, threw to Berry at second base, and Berry then threw to Don Kolloway at first base. \nBerry continued Detroit's backup shortstop, starting 32 games at the position in 1951 and 55 games in 1952. \nOn October 26, 1952, the Tigers traded Berry and Cliff Mapes to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for pitcher Jake Crawford.

        "text": "Charles Anthony \"Chip\" Marshall (born Charles Anthony Marchlewicz; August 28, 1919 – April 15, 2007) was a professional baseball catcher who appeared in a single game for the 1941 St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed.\nBiography.\nMarshall played in the minor leagues from 1937 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1952. He served in the United States Army from June 1943 through October 1945. In 13 minor league seasons, he appeared in 1057 games, compiling a .240 batting average with 38 home runs and at least 155 RBIs. While predominantly a catcher, he also played 46 games as a second baseman in 1942.\nMarshall's lone major league appearance came with the St. Louis Cardinals on June 14, 1941, in a home game against Brooklyn Dodgers played at Sportsman's Park. With the Cardinals losing in the eighth inning, 12–5, Marshall entered the game as a pinch runner, replacing fellow catcher Gus Mancuso, who had just reached first base on a fielder's choice. Marshall did not advance, as the next two batters made outs, ending the inning. Marshall stayed in the game defensively for the top of the ninth inning, handling relief pitcher Ira Hutchinson. In an uneventful inning, Marshall made one putout, retiring batter Jimmy Wasdell. The Cardinals did not score in the bottom of the ninth, and Marshall did not have a plate appearance. As this was his only major league appearance, he holds a career 1.000 fielding average in MLB.\nBorn in Wilmington, Delaware, Marshall worked for the United States Postal Service after his professional baseball career, retiring in 1983. He was a coach for Babe Ruth League baseball for 18 years, and was a 1982 inductee of the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame. Marshall was married and had one daughter. He died in his home city in 2007, aged 87, and was interred there."

        "text": "Fenerbahçe Women's Volleyball, commonly known as Fenerbahçe, are the professional women's volleyball department of Fenerbahçe SK, a major Turkish multi-sport club based in Istanbul, Turkey. They play their matches at the 7.000-seated Burhan Felek Sport Hall. Fenerbahçe compete in the Turkish Women's Volleyball League, which is considered to be one of the best and most competitive leagues in the world.\nFounded in 1928, Fenerbahçe are one of the best volleyball teams in Turkey and in the world. They were crowned World Champions by winning the FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship undefeated in 2010, thus achieving the first Intercontinental Quadruple ever in Turkish volleyball history, after having won the Turkish League, Turkish Cup, and the Turkish Super Cup in 2010. Fenerbahçe became the first Turkish team to claim a World Championship title. After being runners-up in the CEV Champions League in 2010, Fenerbahçe finally were crowned European Champions in the 2011–12 season after defeating French powerhouse RC Cannes in three straight sets (25–14, 25–22, and 25–20) in the final game. The club also reached the third place of the Champions League twice, in the 2010–11 and 2015–16 seasons.\nFenerbahçe also won the CEV Cup by defeating Russia's Uralochka-NTMK Ekaterinburg 3–0 (25-11, 28-26, 25-22) in the 2014 finals in front of their passionate home crowd, thus writing volleyball history as the men's team won another continental title, the CEV Challenge Cup, the very same day. By achieving this unparalleled feat, Fenerbahçe became the first and only sports club in Turkey and one of a few in Europe with European titles won in both the men's and women's volleyball departments.\nIn Turkey the club have won 15 Turkish Championship titles (7 in the current Turkish Women's Volleyball League and 8 in the former Turkish Women's Volleyball Championship), 4 Turkish Cups, and 4 Turkish Super Cups, among others.\nHistory.\nThe women's volleyball department was founded in 1928 by Sabiha Gürayman who, as a young woman, played for the club's men's volleyball team, and was the first woman architect in Turkey. However, the section was closed due to lack of opponents. In 1954, a new era started with assistance from Çamlıca Girls' High School (). Starting in 1958, the girls won eight Turkish Championships among many other titles. In 1977, the department was closed again until 1989, this time due to insufficient funds. In 1993, the team was promoted from the Istanbul First League to the Turkish Second League. The following year, they played in the Turkish First League. However, they were relegated to the Turkish Second League in the 1995–96 season.\nFenerbahçe returned to the Turkish First League in the 2002–03 season, and were runners-up in the 2006–07 season. The senior team was renamed as \"Fenerbahçe Acıbadem\" due to a sponsorship agreement with the Acıbadem Healthcare Group from 2007 to 2011. The Yellow Angels were runners-up after Eczacıbaşı SK in the 2007–08 season, too. They gained the ninth Turkish title in their history in the 2008–09 season, after defeating their archrivals Eczacıbaşı SK in the finals (3–2, 0–3, 3–1, 3–1), which was their first ever title in the league's current format that had started with the 1984–85 season.\nFenerbahçe's women's team shone in the 2009–10 season as the Yellow Angels finished the first round of the 2009–10 Turkish League undefeated in 22 matches (setting a 66:2 set ratio record), and reached the Final Four of the 2009–10 CEV Women's Champions League undefeated. The team then beat the host team RC Cannes in a thrilling five-setter, but eventually lost to Volley Bergamo in five sets in the final, even though they came back after falling two sets down: 22–25, 21–25, 25–22, 25–20, 9–15. Yekaterina Gamova was named the best scorer and Nataša Osmokrović was chosen the best server of the tournament.\nThe star-studded team of Fenerbahçe were on top of the world on 21 December 2010 in Doha, Qatar after beating South American titleholders Sollys Osasco 3–0 (25–23, 25–22, 25–17) to become the first team in 16 years to claim the 2010 FIVB Women's Club World Championship where Katarzyna Skowrońska was named the MVP and Best Scorer, while Eda Erdem Dündar was the Best Server.\nIn 2011, Fenerbahçe SK organized the Champions League Final Four in the Burhan Felek Sports Hall in Istanbul, however, in the semi-final the Yellow Angels lost to Turkish rivals Vakıfbank in a heart-breaking five setter (25–19, 21–25, 25–21, 19–25, 11–15), and lost the chance to be the very first team in Turkish volleyball history to win the Champions League title. The Yellow Angels settled for the third place after beating Scavolini Pesaro in four sets (14–25, 25–21, 25–21, 25–21), thanks to the national heroines Seda Tokatlıoğlu, Naz Aydemir and Eda Erdem Dündar.\nIn 2012 the club won the CEV Volleyball Champions League, which was organized in Baku on 24–25 March 2012, having defeated French powerhouse RC Cannes in the final in three straight sets (25–14, 25–22, and 25–20).

They are Europe's most populous nation to have never qualified for a major international basketball competition.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA suspended Belarus from participating in international competitions.\nHistory.\nPrior to independence.\nBefore 1992, Belarus was occupied by the Soviet Union, with Belarusian born players taking part on the Soviet Union national team. \nEnsuing years.\nAfter Belarus gained independence from the Soviet Union, their first attempt to qualify for the premier European basketball tournament came in 1993. They ultimately came up short in their attempt. Throughout the rest of the 1990s and 2000s, Belarus were unsuccessful at securing qualification. During qualifying for the EuroBasket 2017, Belarus was stationed into Group D with another opportunity to reach the EuroBasket finals. The team began the qualifiers with two loses, before earning their first victory at home against Portugal. Belarus went on to win twice more to conclude the qualifiers at a record of (3–3), but it wasn't enough as the team was eliminated.\nFor qualification to the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Belarus first went through European Pre-Qualifiers. Belarus would finish with a (1–3) record in their pre-qualifying group, but would advance to the first round of the qualifiers; due to owning the point difference in their head-to-head against Portugal. There, they were placed in Group A, and right away the national team were overwhelmed in their first two matches by dominant performances from Slovenia and Montenegro respectively. They eventually notched their first win in the group in a rematch against Slovenia, but to no avail.

        "text": "Kevin Scott Conway (born 13 July 1963) is a Canadian former ice hockey player who played mainly in the United Kingdom. He is a member of the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nConway was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. He began his major-junior ice hockey career with the Oshawa Generals in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) during the 1980–81 season.\nThe following season, 1981–82, Conway joined the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds also in the OHL. He helped them to finish second in their division and to the quarter finals of the playoffs. Staying with the Greyhounds again for the 1982–83 season, Conway helped the team to finish first in their division, win the Hamilton Spectator Trophy and to the final of the playoffs where they were defeated by the Oshawa Generals.\nAfter just two games with the Greyhounds at the start of the 1983–84 season, Conway moved on to play with the Kingston Canadians. Although the Canadians finished bottom of their division that season and did not qualify for the playoffs, Conway still finished as the league's top scorer and in sixth place in the scoring leaders chart with 65 goals and 65 assists for 130 points in 63 games. Conway also won the William Hanley Trophy as the league's most sportsmanlike player.\nClub.\nConway started his professional career by signing for the Toledo Goaldiggers in the International Hockey League (IHL) and playing ten games for them during the 1983–84 season. The following season, 1984–85, Conway split between the Goaldiggers and the Salt Lake Golden Eagles also of the IHL.\nIn 1985, Conway signed for the Ayr Bruins in the Premier Division of the British Hockey League (BHL). Conway played for the Bruins for one season — taking the goal scoring record and being named to the 1986 Premier Division all-star team — before returning to North America and the IHL to play for the Indianapolis Checkers at the beginning of the 1986–87 season. Conway finished the season back in the United Kingdom with the Durham Wasps who he helped to win the Heinekin Championship at Wembley Arena. He started the 1987–88 season with Durham before finishing it with the Telford Tigers in Division 1 of the BHL and earning himself the British Ice Hockey Writers Association Player of the Year trophy. After a further season with the Tigers, Conway moved to the Cleveland Bombers for the 1989–90 season, again in Division 1, where he earned a place on the Division 1 All-star team of 1990. Conway helped the Bombers to promotion to the Premier Division and stayed with them for the 1990–91 season.\nConway started his long association with Basingstoke when he joined the Beavers in the 1991–92 season playing in Division 1 of the BHL. Conway stayed with the Basingstoke team for seven seasons, helping them to promotion to the Premier Division in 1993 and into the newly formed Ice Hockey Superleague (ISL) in 1996 when the team changed its name to the Basingstoke Bison. During his time with Basingstoke, Conway earned himself two more Division 1 All-star places in 1992 and 1993 and finished as the team's all-time leading scorer with 950 points. In honour of his achievements at the club, Basingstoke retired his number 10 shirt in 2005.\nConway spent the following ISL season, 1998–99, with the Newcastle Riverkings before splitting the 1999–00 season with Hull Thunder in the British National League (BNL) and the Chelmsford Chieftains in the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL), whom he helped to win the league and playoff championships. He joined the Solihull Barons in the 2000–01 season with whom he stayed until he retired from professional ice hockey in 2004. In his final season with Solihull, Conway was the leading goal, assist and point scorer for the team.\nAfter briefly coaching his son's junior ice hockey team, the Kingston River Rats, Conway was persuaded to come out of retirement by the Solway Sharks coach, Kevin Doherty, to play for the Sharks in the 2006–07 season in the Scottish National League and the Northern League. Conway continued to play for the Sharks in the 2007–08 season in the newly formed Scottish Premier Hockey League and the Northern League.\nInternational.\nConway made his first appearance for the Great Britain national ice hockey team at the Pool C World Championships held in Hull in 1992. Conway made an immediate impact for the team, scoring his first goal just 2 minutes and 16 seconds into his first game against Australia. Helping the GB team to win the tournament and gain promotion to Pool B, Conway scored 13 goals and 10 assists — making him the tournament leading scorer.\nConway also appeared in the 1993 GB team which won promotion to Pool A by sweeping all teams at the Pool B tournament held in the Netherlands. Conway was again the leading scorer for GB with 19 points from 8 goals an 11 assists.\nConway played for the GB team a total of 58 times between 1992 and 1999 and scored a total of 66 points from 33 goals and 33 assists."

        "title": "1991 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1991 State of Origin series saw the tenth time the annual three-match State of Origin series between the New South Wales and Queensland representative rugby league teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. It was notable as Wally Lewis' farewell from Origin football and featured his half-time stoush with Mark Geyer in Game II which match culminated in Michael O'Connor's sensational match-winning sideline conversion in teeming rain.\nFor the first time since State of Origin became a three-game series in 1982, Queensland named the same starting XIII for each game of the series. The Maroons only made two changes during the series, with Origin veterans Dale Shearer coming onto the bench for Game 2 in Sydney to replace Steve Renouf, and Bob Lindner, the player of the 1990 Kangaroo tour, named on the bench for Game 3 in Brisbane (replacing Gavin Allen) after recovering from a broken leg. This saw Queensland only use 19 players for the series. In contrast, NSW only had seven players there for the entire series (five of whom started each game) and used a total of 24 players.\nGame I.\nControversy preceded the start of the series when Maroon's coach and Queensland Origin figurehead Arthur Beetson was deposed in favour of Manly-Warringah coach and former New Zealand test coach Graham Lowe, the first and (as of 2017) only non-Queenslander to have coached the Maroons. Two time Canberra Raiders premiership winning coach Tim Sheens got the job as New South Wales coach, replacing \"Supercoach\" Jack Gibson who had retired from coaching. 1990 Kangaroo tour vice-captain Ben Elias was retained as captain of the Blues, while Wally Lewis retained the captaincy of Queensland despite Mal Meninga being the incumbent Australian test captain.\nQueensland lost their Australian fullback Gary Belcher to a knee injury only two days before the game and he was replaced by giant (197 cm) 20-year-old Brisbane Broncos fullback Paul Hauff. The Maroons also lost test hooker Kerrod Walters who had been suspended for 2 games. He was replaced by his older brother, Canberra Raiders premiership hooker Steve Walters. NSW coach Tim Sheens gave the Blues goal kicking duties to veteran Michael O'Connor over regular Penrith club kicker Greg Alexander despite O'Connor not having been Manly's first choice kicker since early in 1990 and having only kicked 2 goals to that point of the 1991 season.\nIt took sixty-four minutes for the first try to be scored in a nailbiting series opener at Lang Park. The try featured the two veterans of the Queensland side – Wally Lewis ran wide and powered halfway through an opening and then found Mal Meninga in support who bulldozed through Greg Alexander and Andrew Ettingshausen's attempted tackle to score. Laurie Daley scored his team's only try late in the second half after grubber-kicking behind Michael Hancock into the corner and winning the race to the ball. Meninga landed only one of his four shots at goal but it proved decisive as both Michael O'Connor and Alexander missed their only attempts. O'Connor's conversion attempt of Daley's try went wide leaving Qld with a 6–4 lead. Alexander had a chance to level the scores after NSW received a penalty when Meninga's restart from the Daley try was kicked over the dead ball line on the full, but his kick from half way was wide and short and fell safely into the arms of Wally Lewis who took the tackle to end the game.\nAfter only being a late callup into the Queensland team, replacement fullback Paul Hauff (who at 6'6\" (197 cm) was the tallest recorded fullback in premiership history) put in a near man of the match performance in his Origin and representative debut, with most judges believing he would have won the award had he not been forced off midway through the second half with a dislocated shoulder. Early in the first half he twice saved certain NSW tries when he first tackled a flying Greg Alexander into touch, and only minutes later he managed to scramble back and prevent Ettingshausen from picking up the ball and scoring next to the posts after ET put in a grubber kick behind Hauff.\nGame II.\nGame II of 1991 is remembered for a number of dramatic incidents. Played in drenching rain, the game exploded into violence before half-time when volatile New South Wales forward Mark Geyer chopped down on Queensland hooker Steve Walters in a tackle. Prop Andrew Gee ran in to assist his teammate, sparking a brawl which involved most players from both teams. When the dust settled, referee David Manson issued a handful of cautions, but as players left the field for half-time, Queensland captain Wally Lewis continued to goad Geyer, clearly expecting the New South Wales forward to be antagonised into a violent response right in front of Manson that would have him sent off. This became a lasting image in Australian sporting folklore.\nSoon after the break Geyer missed with a forearm directed towards Queensland fullback Paul Hauff, sparking another brawl when Peter Jackson and Gary Coyne ran in to target Geyer, while Wally Lewis was trying to calm his players by yelling that Geyer would be gone. However referee David Manson, himself a Queenslander, only cautioned the Blues second-rower. Geyer was later suspended for five matches for his questionable elbow to Hauff. The Maroons looked to have the series wrapped up when an Allan Langer break and Lewis pass led to a try to Dale Shearer 12 minutes from full-time. But with six minutes remaining, a cut-out pass by Blues halfback Ricky Stuart led to a try to centre Mark McGaw out wide, levelling the scores at 12-all. As the rain continued to belt down, O'Connor, who wasn't in great form with the boot but was surprisingly given the kicking duties despite Illawarra Steelers goal kicking winger Rod Wishart in the team, lined up the conversion attempt and sensationally landed the goal to give the Blues a 14–12 victory just before full-time.\nGame III.\nThe Game III decider back in Brisbane was fast-paced and desperately fought with never more than four points separating the sides. Queensland led 8–4 at half-time but two New South Wales tries, both unconverted by O'Connor who also missed a long-range penalty goal from near half-way, took the Blues to a 12–8 lead. Strangely coach Sheens had stuck with Game 2 hero O'Connor as goal kicker despite him not being the regular kicker for Manly and the presence in the side of regular club kickers Greg Alexander (Penrith) and Rod Wishart (Illawarra). Late in the second-half a superb dash by Maroons' hooker Steve Walters paved the way for a try to replacement back Dale Shearer, levelling the match. Repeating O'Connor's deed in Sydney, Maroon centre Mal Meninga landed the sideline conversion (the only goal kicked in the game), lifting Queensland to a 14–12 victory.\nTen minutes before the end of the game the Lang Park ground announcer advised the 33,226 strong crowd that Wally Lewis was playing his last game for Queensland. Lewis had decided to retire from Origin football after receiving news on the day of the game that his daughter Jaime-Lee was deaf, with only his family and the Qld team knowing about his decision. The Maroons supporters roared as they never had before to lift their weary gladiators to the line and Lewis to his ultimate victory and slow farewell lap around his home ground, hand-in-hand with his two young sons Mitchell and Lincoln. Queensland manager Dick \"Tosser\" Turner later admitted that Lewis had given an instruction and plotted the perfect timing for the announcement to be made."

The club was founded in 1892 and the members regularly sail on the River Mersey and New Brighton Marine Lake. The club mainly sails dinghies and has a thriving cadet section. The club hosts its annual regatta as part of the Wirral Regattas series where local sailors come to compete on the River Mersey.\nHistory.\nWest Cheshire Sailing Club was founded at New Brighton in 1892 by members of the now defunct Magazine Sailing Club and New Brighton Sailing Club.\nThe headquarters of the club, was located in a building on the New Brighton Pier. Boats were stored on shore at the pier, or on moorings in the Mersey. The club moved to its present location when the pier was demolished in 1961.\nThe brass cannon, now kept in the club was a signal gun from a large steam yacht, \"White Eagle\". She was built in Portsmouth, but spent most of her life in the Irish Sea on the Clyde. From time to time club members would fire this gun at special events.\nThe first Club Dinner held by WCSC was held with the Victoria Rowing Club at the Hotel Victoria, New Brighton, before World War I.\nTwo famous members of the club were Sir Ernest Marples MP, the man who planned the motorways and built the M1, as well as a stint as Postmaster General. He was for many years a member of the committee and Vice President from 1948 to 1958.\nLieutenant Commander Ian Fraser RN VC, was also a member of the club committee and captain of the club for three years. He served in submarines during World War II and was awarded the VC for his part in the attack on Japanese warships in Singapore Harbour in 1945.\nWest Cheshire Sailing Club in collaboration with Northern Kites have formed Wallasey Beach CIC who will now manage the club house to provide a community space."

        "text": "The 1988 Rose Bowl was the 74th edition of the college football bowl game, played on January 1, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The Michigan State Spartans defeated the USC Trojans 20–17 in a bowl rematch that was much closer than the 27–13 Spartan victory in the regular season. Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow was named the Player of the Game.\nThis was the last Rose Bowl game televised by NBC Sports, ending a 37-year partnership. ABC Sports picked up rights to broadcast the game the following year.\nThis was the Big Ten's first Rose Bowl win in seven years.\nTeams.\nThe teams opened the season against each other in East Lansing, Michigan in a nationally-televised game on Labor Day night. Michigan State took advantage of three USC turnovers to defeat the Trojans, 27–13.\nMichigan State Spartans.\nLed by head coach George Perles, a former Pittsburgh Steelers assistant coach, Michigan State had its best team in many years. The Spartans beat traditional Big 10 powers Michigan and Ohio State, and won the Big Ten by 1½ games over Indiana and Iowa, who tied for second place. They followed up the USC win by a 31–8 loss at Notre Dame, and then a 31–3 home loss to Florida State. The season got back on track with a 19–14 win at Iowa. A dramatic 17–11 win over in state rival Michigan occurred on October 10. On October 31, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, making this the first season since the 1966 National Championship when the Spartans defeated both Michigan and Ohio State. The Indiana Hoosiers also had beaten Michigan and Ohio State, and the meeting between Michigan State and Indiana on November 14 determined the Big Ten championship. Michigan State won 27–3 to clinch their first Rose Bowl appearance since the 1965 season. They are the only team in college history to not only beat Big 10 powers Ohio State and Michigan in the same season, but also the USC Trojans twice.\nUSC Trojans.\nUSC struggled early and was only 4–3 after seven games, but won its next three to set up a showdown with rival UCLA (9–1) for the Pac-10 title and Rose Bowl berth. The UCLA Bruins, with Troy Aikman at quarterback and Gaston Green at running back were favored, and led 13–0 at halftime. It could have been worse, as on the last play of the first half, UCLA's Eric Turner intercepted a deflected pass at the UCLA goal line and had nothing but green grass ahead of him as he appeared primed to return it for a touchdown. But USC QB Rodney Peete ran down Turner and tackled him at the 10-yard line as time expired. USC had cut the lead to 13–10, and then midway through the 4th quarter, quarterback Rodney Peete threw to WR Erik Afholter in the back of the end zone. Afholter juggled the ball atop his shoulder pad as he slid out the end zone; television replays indicated no possession but the referees ruled it a touchdown. Leading 17–13, USC then intercepted Aikman as he tried to lead UCLA back and ran out the clock.\nGame summary.\nThe game was a rematch of the season opener in East Lansing that Michigan State won 27–13. The game was dominated by defense; the story was Michigan State linebacker and game most valuable player Percy Snow, who had 17 unassisted tackles, while helping to force five USC turnovers. The Spartans also had their All-American running back Lorenzo White who proved to be a cut-back slashing workhorse with 35 carries for 113 yards .\nAfter USC tied the game early in the fourth quarter at 17, Michigan State marched to a game-winning field goal by John Langeloh with four minutes to play. The key play of the drive was a third down play in which Michigan State quarterback Bobby McAllister was nearly sacked, then scrambled and at the last instant found receiver Andre Rison at the sideline for a first down that kept the drive alive. USC had time to try to come back, and Trojans quarterback Rodney Peete led USC on a drive to the MSU 29-yard line with two minutes to play. But Peete fumbled the next snap, and Michigan State recovered before running out the clock. Lorenzo White's performance in this game, combined with his superb 4-year career, helped clinch his January 2019 election to the College Football Hall of Fame ."

        "text": "Tommy Bell (July 2, 1922 – February 20, 1986) was an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) and was regarded as \"one of the NFL's most respected referees\". When he joined the NFL as an official in 1962 from the Southeastern Conference, he was given the referee position, and stayed at that spot until his retirement in 1976. He officiated Super Bowl III in 1969 and Super Bowl VII in 1973. He is also the only official in history to referee in both a Super Bowl and NCAA Final Four (1959). He retired from the NFL following the 1976 AFC Championship Game between the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers, played December 26, 1976, to conclude a fifteen-year career in the league.\nBell was given a choice of officiating the AFC Championship game or Super Bowl XI as his final NFL game by then-Director of Officiating Art McNally. When Bell chose the former, Jim Tunney was selected as the referee for his second Super Bowl.\nHis successor as a referee, Jerry Markbreit, was the line judge on Bell's crew in 1976, Markbreit's rookie year in the NFL. The other members of Bell's 1976 crew were umpire Gordon Wells, head linesman (later down judge) Ray Dodez, back judge Tom Kelleher and field judge Ed Merrifield (the back judge and field judge positions were swapped in 1998).\nBell wore uniform number 7 throughout his NFL career. The number was not used during the 1977 and 1978 NFL seasons; fellow referee Fred Silva took the number in 1979 and wore it through his retirement in 1988. Ron Blum, who wore number 83 as a line judge from 1985 through 1992, changed to No. 7 upon his promotion to referee in 1993 and wore it through his retirement in 2007, even though he returned to his original position for his final four NFL seasons. Side judge Keith Washington currently wears No. 7.\nUnlike nearly all other professional football officials, Bell did not have to serve an apprenticeship at another position before becoming a referee. He was the last official to be a referee in his rookie season until Brad Allen was hired in 2014.\nPersonal.\nIn addition to NFL officiating, Bell was an attorney in Lexington, Kentucky, and provided color commentary on Kentucky Wildcats football broadcasts on radio and television following his retirement. He died of chronic leukemia, aged 63, on February 20, 1986.\nThe Rotary Club of Lexington (KY) honors Bell each year by awarding the Tommy Bell Award which recognizes Lexington's Outstanding High School Student Athlete."

        "title": "1992 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1992 State of Origin series saw the 11th time that the annual three-game series between the New South Wales and Queensland representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules. It was the first year of involvement by New South Wales' most successful coach Phil Gould, who made only four player changes to the Blues squad during the series - one of these necessitated by the return from injury of champion play-maker Ricky Stuart. For the first time in thirteen years of Origin there was no involvement by Wally Lewis to inspire Queensland.\nGames.\nGame I.\nGame I was a battle of attrition with a high casualty rate. Blues hooker Benny Elias spent time in the blood bin after copping a head gash which needed 10 stitches to close, Queensland second-rower Gary Larson left the field on a stretcher and Maroons prop Steve Jackson suffered severe concussion early in the match.\nThe Blues scored first from a planned move designed by Gould to enable Blues lock Bradley Clyde to encounter Mal Meninga one-on-one. Gould was convinced that Meninga's reduced lateral movement across field in defence was a weakness in the Queensland side. He devised a move that would isolate Meninga and which led to Clyde easily standing up his Canberra teammate to score in the corner.\nNew South Wales' front-rowers Glenn Lazarus and Paul Harragon slowly began to take control of the rucks and after winger Rod Wishart kicked a penalty goal midway through the second half, replacement forward Craig Salvatori scored a crucial Blues try. In a match with so few scoring opportunities, the Blues' eight-point lead was sufficient to enable them to close out the match.\nClyde went off injured after scoring the first try and Laurie Daley knocked himself out in the in-goal just after half-time. Ben Elias returned in the second-half his face smeared with blood and a red-stained bandage around his head to take over as captain due to Daley's departure and to protect the Blues' lead. This led to one of Origin's enduring images when photographers and broadcast cameramen captured shots after the final siren of Elias' mother Barbara on the field and working around interviewers, mopping up the still flowing blood from her son's forehead as he spoke post-match. \nGame II.\nIn game II, early in the match prop Martin Bella and five-eighth Peter Jackson were sent to the sin-bin for back-chatting referee Bill Harrigan and the Maroons were reduced to 11 men for ten minutes. A minute after Queensland were restored to their full complement, lock Billy Moore on debut, slipped through to score an unconverted try.\nTwo penalty goals to Rod Wishart levelled the scores before half time and as the minutes ticked by after the break it appeared the match was headed for the first draw in 35 Origin contests. It was wet and greasy in the second half and scoring chances were minimal with both sides maintaining impregnable defences. Ricky Stuart missed with two late attempts at field goal and then with just 66 seconds remaining, a complete lack of urgency from the Blues defensive line saw Queensland halfback Allan Langer land a wobbly field goal (the first of his career) from close range to steal a 5-4 victory for the home side.\nGame III.\nIn the Game III decider of 1992 New South Wales led 4-2 at half-time when 21-year-old Balmain Tigers centre Tim Brasher replaced injured Blues winger Rod Wishart. Brasher immediately injected his team with a shot of enthusiasm with a series of lightning bursts from dummy-half that helped build their momentum.\nThe first try was scored by Ricky Stuart who went over from a rehearsed move in the 14th minute.\nBlues fullback Andrew Ettingshausen next scored the try of the series midway through the second half following a Laurie Daley grubber-kick. It came after Elias went to the blind side from the play-the-ball, and passed to Daley who kicked. Centre Paul McGregor got to the ball first, stepped past a tackler and found Daley backing up, who gave the ball to Ettingshausen who scored for 8-4. Finally second-rower John Cartwright barged across the line from close range to open up a 16-4 lead.\nQueensland's efforts to strike back in the final 10 minutes were thwarted by two desperate tackles from Brasher, the first on a runaway Mark Coyne and the second a stunning ball-and-all effort on Mal Meninga, who threatened to score in the dying minutes."

        "text": "Festina was a former professional cycling team that was active in the professional peloton from 1989 to 2001. The team was sponsored by the Swiss watch manufacturer of the same name.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe team first appeared as \"Lotus-Zahor\" but the following year, 1990, the team became \"Lotus–Festina\". In 1993, the team became \"Festina–Lotus\" which it was known by until 2000. The team was a Spanish team from 1989 to 1992. Then the team was based in Andorra in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, the team became French-based from which it would stay until the team retired from the peloton, with the sole exception of 1996.\nIn 1991, the team signed the Portuguese cyclist Acácio da Silva who would not win the sprints classification in that year's Vuelta a España.\nThe team signed Sean Kelly in 1992 who won Milan–San Remo, the first Classic victory for the team. The team entered its first Tour de France in 1992. The team manager and directeur sportifs at this time included Miguel Moreno Cachinero and Carlos Machin Rodriguez but Bruno Roussel joined the team in 1993 and would lead the team during its most successful years. Richard Virenque joined the team in 1993. The following year the team challenged Miguel Induráin in the 1994 Tour de France whereby teammates Luc Leblanc and Richard Virenque finished the race 4th and 5th overall and Festina won the team classification. Over the following years, Festina would be present in the Tour de France with Virenque finishing the race 3rd overall in 1996 and second overall in 1997.\nFestina affair.\nVirenque was a favourite in the 1998 Tour de France but after team soigneur Willy Voet was caught by France-Belgium border officials with large quantities of doping products in his Festina team car, all members of the 1998 Tour team including the World Champion Laurent Brochard and Christophe Moreau were arrested and seven admitted to taking EPO and were ejected from the race. Team doctor Eric Rijkaert was also arrested. Rijkaert was team doctor from 1993 to 1998.\nLaurent Brochard, Christophe Moreau and Didier Rous confessed and were served a six-month suspension before returning to racing whereas Richard Virenque did not confess, releasing a book called \"Ma Vérité\" where he denied using doping products. However, on 24 October 2000, Virenque finally confessed and was handed a suspension. The team doctor that was at the heart of the scandal, Eric Rijkaert, released a book in 2000 about the affair and discussing doping in the sport called \"De Zaak Festina\".\nPost Festina affair.\nDue to these doping scandals, the team reorganised itself and sponsor Festina set up the \"Fondation d'Entreprise Festina\" which aimed to promote any actions that prevent doping taking place that are undertaken by institutions or individuals.\nAfter the Festina Affair Juan Fernández Martín, Yvon Sanquer, Michel Gros, Roberto Torres Toledano, Jacky Lachevere and Gerald Rue directed the team in its final years. The team achieved 3rd and 4th overall in the 2000 Tour de France with Joseba Beloki and Christophe Moreau and won the 2001 Vuelta a España with Ángel Casero before retiring from the sport at the end of the 2001 season. The sponsor Festina continued in professional cycling for many years more by being the official timekeeper at the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, the Vuelta a España and several other stage-races."

        "text": "Mike G. Everitt (born August 22, 1964) is an American former Major League Baseball umpire, who wore number 57. He worked in the American League from 1996 to 1999 and throughout both major leagues from 2000 to 2019.\nEarly life.\nEveritt attended Aztec High School in Aztec, New Mexico. He played several sports at the school and graduated in 1982. He appeared in that year's Connie Mack World Series.\nCareer.\nOver his major league career, Everitt has worked the All-Star Game one time 2006, the Wild Card Game three times (2013, 2016, 2019), the Division Series nine times (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2017), the League Championship Series 6.5 times (2002, 2003, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016, and the second half of the 2019 series starting in Game 4 after Jeff Nelson was removed after injury in Game 3), and the 2006 All-Star Game. Everitt has also umpired the World Series three times (, and ). Everitt was named a crew chief in February 2017.\nEveritt was the first base umpire for Rickey Henderson's 3,000th hit on October 7, 2001; that game was also Tony Gwynn's final MLB game. \nEveritt was the first base umpire on July 30, 2017, when Adrián Beltré of the Texas Rangers got his 3000th career hit against the Baltimore Orioles.\nControversies.\nOn April 22, 2000, Everitt was the home plate umpire for a game between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox which featured two bench-clearing brawls, 11 ejections and 16 player suspensions which totaled 82 games. Managers Phil Garner of Detroit and Jerry Manuel of Chicago were each suspended eight games.\nEveritt worked the 2003 National League Championship Series and was the left field umpire during Game 6, in which Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman arguably prevented Cubs left fielder Moisés Alou from catching a foul pop up hit by Florida Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo. Everitt ruled that the ball would have landed in the stands without Bartman's interference, and therefore Castillo was not out. Alou and Mark Prior vehemently protested the call to no avail and the Marlins proceeded to score 8 runs to win Game 6 and later the series.\nDuring a San Diego Padres vs. Cubs game in Chicago, on June 16, 2007, Everitt was the plate umpire. Padres pitcher Chris Young hit Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee up and in with a pitch. Rather than getting in between Lee and Young as Lee exchanged words with Young, Everitt instead was talking to Padres catcher Rob Bowen about an unknown subject. Lee ended up throwing a punch at Young, who threw a punch back, starting a benches-clearing brawl. Young, Lee, and others were ejected. Cubs play-by-play announcer Len Kasper criticized and questioned Everitt for not getting in between Lee and Young to prevent a brawl.\nDuring Game 4 of the 2009 World Series, between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies, Pedro Feliz hit a two-out single with Ryan Howard on second. There was a play at the plate and replay shows that Howard clearly - barely but clearly - missed home. However, the ball rolled away from Yankee catcher Jorge Posada and CC Sabathia, backing up the play, threw to second to try to get Feliz going to second. It was at that point that Mike Everitt signaled Howard was safe at the plate, the correct ruling. Howard had not touched home, but had not been tagged out either: there was no call to make until Sabathia tried to make a play on Feliz, therefore losing the right to appeal that Howard missed home.\nOn August 20, 2013, after the Boston Red Sox lost to the San Francisco Giants on a walk-off walk to batter Marco Scutaro, Red Sox starting pitcher Jake Peavy openly criticized plate umpire Everitt, stating, \"The last pitch [called ball four] was a strike...At the end of the day, for an umpire not to make the call to cost us a game, that's extremely unfortunate.\" Replays, however, indicate the pitch was located off the outer edge of home plate and correctly ruled a ball.\nOn June 30, 2016, in a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, Everitt permitted the Kansas City Royals to challenge a double-play call at first base despite both teams having returned to their dugouts. Under normal MLB rules, both teams retiring to their dugouts would make the play no longer eligible for replay, but Everitt gave the Royals - as described by Everitt to Matheny - a \"courtesy\". St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny was immediately ejected for raising the point with Everitt.\nOn August 27, 2016, in a game between the Los Angeles Angels and Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, Everitt made several contested strike calls against Detroit hitters, resulting in the eventual ejection of Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez, Manager Brad Ausmus, and Hitting Coach Wally Joyner, and right fielder J. D. Martinez in three separate incidents."

        "text": "The 1993 State of Origin series was the 12th year that the annual best-of-three series of rugby league football matches between the Queensland and New South Wales representative teams was contested under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland's favourite son Wally Lewis returned as coach just two years after his retirement as a player.\nGame I.\nNew South Wales were playing their second series under Phil Gould. Queensland were coached for the first time by their Origin \"King\" Wally Lewis.\nAn extraordinary defensive effort by New South Wales gave them the spoils in Game I. The Blues led 12–2 at half-time and then held on grimly in a dour second half repelling waves of Queensland attackers. At one stage in the second half, Queensland held the ball for 21 consecutive tackles within 10 metres of the Blues line, but never broke through. New South Wales in that half made an incredible 161 tackles and clung on for a 14–10 victory in an effort typified by one of their big-hearted forwards, Ian Roberts, who had to leave the field moments from the end suffering from exhaustion.\nThe Blues were inspired by Ricky Stuart and his Canberra halves partner Laurie Daley who overshadowed Brisbane halves duo Kevin Walters and Allan Langer.\nGame II.\nIn game II the series could easily have been levelled but Queensland allowed a number of scoring opportunities to slip away. The Maroons led 6–0 at the break after captain Mal Meninga crashed over at the bell but missed at least three try-scoring chances in the first half. Willie Carne scored a fair try from a well planned and well executed cross-field kick by Allan Langer but referee Eddie Ward ruled Carne off-side. Television replays showed he wasn't. In the 30th minute Meninga passed to winger Adrian Brunker who was tackled short of the line after Meninga looked as if he might have scored himself. Four minutes later, Queensland fullback Dale Shearer inexplicably lost the ball in the in-goal area when he should have scored.\nNew South Wales came out inspired by the half-time words of Phil Gould and struck back promptly and with purpose. Laurie Daley scored early in the second half and lock Brad Mackay was over three minutes later after a Ricky Stuart clearing kick was touched in flight putting NSW on-side and allowing Brad Fittler to regain possession. From having been under pressure and looking as if a loss was imminent, the Blues had bounced back for a four-point lead at 10–6.\nRod Wishart scored again for the Blues before Kevin Walters brought the game back into the balance with a try five minutes from full-time. With time ticking away the Maroons refused to concede and another memorable Origin image was created when Meninga came charging out of his own quarter and raced 40 metres upfield before confronting Laurie Daley the sole New South Wales defender. It was a State of Origin moment frozen in time, captain on captain and the match result resting on the winner of the confrontation. It was the Canberra Raiders captain Meninga being chased by his team-mate and understudy Daley. It was the face of the future Australian Test captain chasing down the present. Meninga drew Daley in and passed to Mark Hohn in support, only to see the front-rower drop the ball as the hooter sounded and the Blues retained the trophy.\nGame III.\nAlthough Game III was a dead rubber both teams put on a sterling performance in front of a crowd of 31,500. A first-half brawl erupted when an early scrum broke up in the 23rd minute. Regular combatants and bitter rivals Steve Walters and Ben Elias clashed while Paul Harragon and Martin Bella stood trading blows. In the aftermath referee Greg McCallum sent all four to the sin bin.\nWhile Maroons coach Lewis was able to take some consolation from the win, the night belonged to Queensland stalwart Bob Lindner who was playing his 25th and last Origin match and was farewelled by the Lang Park crowd."

        "title": "2002–03 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2002–03 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 82nd season of play for the program and 44th in the WCHA. The Golden Gophers represented the University of Minnesota, played their home games at the Mariucci Arena and were coached by Don Lucia, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nFresh off of the program's fourth national title, the first in 23 years, Minnesota entered the season with high hopes. Though the team lost several key players to graduation, including Hobey Baker Award-winner Jordan Leopold, they brought in an impressive collection of young talent. Perhaps the brightest young star that had ever donned the maroon and gold to that point, Thomas Vanek debuted for the team and Gophers would need the highly-regarded Austrian to make up for the lost offensive production of the departed John Pohl and Jeff Taffe.\nThough the Gophers were ranked #1 entering the year, that was due mostly to their being the defending champions. The Gophers suffered a setback when Team captain Grant Potulny was injured in the first game against Ohio State. What was initially thought to just be a fractured fibula that would keep him out for 4–6 weeks turned out to include ligament damage that would sideline Potulny for up to 4 months. Without him, the team looked a little out of sorts as the roster sought to soldier on. While Minnesota never looked bad, they weren't able to consistently put together a good stretch of games in the first two months of the season. Part of the problem was that Don Lucia was still trying to find out which one of his two goaltenders deserved to be the starter. Both Travis Weber and Justin Johnson got playing time but neither was able to seize control of the Minnesota cage by mid-November. The goalie rotation continued until Johnson had a rather a poor outing against Colorado College which was followed up by a solid performance by Weber. Afterwards, Weber remained in the cage and strung several good outings together, including a road sweep of long time rival Wisconsin.\nWhile Weber established himself in the cage, the offense too had steadily come along. The Gophers had shown from the start that the team could score but they had trouble with their consistency. With Vanek at the lead, the Gophers steadily improved throughout the fall and turned themselves into one of the best offenses in the country come winter time. While the team sorted through its early-season jitters, their ranking declined. When December rolled around the team had dropped to #10, however, because the NCAA tournament had expanded to 16 teams for that season, they were still in a solid position to earn a berth. The Gophers took no chances, however, and reeled off a series of impressive wins to jump up to 4th by the time January rolled around.\nThe team was stymied when they began the second half of the season and went winless in three games. They arrested their fall with a win over top-ranked North Dakota and then mostly held serve over the following month and a half. Entering the final few weeks of the season, Minnesota sat 7th in the polls but had a tremendous opportunity to move up with four games against ranked teams. Minnesota went 2–0–2 in those games, which, though they did not see their ranking improve, they were able to finish in a tie for second in the WCHA standings.\nConference tournament.\nBecause they held the tie-breaker, the Gophers received the second seed for the WCHA tournament and got to take on a bad but improving Michigan Tech squad. The Gophers won the first game fairly easily and appeared to be heading to a sweep in the second when Weber suffered an injury to his finger. Johnson was installed for the remainder of the contest and though the Gophers marched on to the semifinals, doing so without their starting goalie was not ideal. Though he was initially expected to be ready for the next game, Weber was unable to play against Minnesota State–Mankato. Seeing their backup needed a hand, Minnesota's offense shelled the Maverick cage, firing 49 shots to MSU's 17. Due to a masterful performance from opposing netminder Jon Volp, however, the two still needed overtime to settle the score. Just less than 4 minutes into the extra session, Vanek scored his 26th goal of the season and sent the Gophers to the championship match.\nColorado College was all that stood between Minnesota and a conference title. The top-seeded Tigers were the favorites to win but it was the Gophers who got off to a blazing start. Potulny had a hand in all three of Minnesota's goals in the first period to build a huge lead. The Tigers fought back with two power play goals in the second half of the game along with 38 shots but Johnson held the fort and enabled the Gophers to skate away with a 4–2 win.\nNCAA tournament.\nBecause they were hosting one of the four regionals, Minnesota was going to be placed in the West bracket. The WCHA championship helped Minnesota earn one of the #1 seeds and an advantageous match for the first round. Additionally, because two of the teams seeded 4th were also members of the WCHA, Minnesota was assigned to play Mercyhurst. While the Lakers won their conference tournament, they weren't considered much of a threat to the Gophers. With the return of Weber between the pipes and Potulny netting a hat-trick, Minnesota proved those sentiments correct with a resounding 9–2 victory.\nMinnesota's second game was expected to be a much closer affair as they were taking on #6 Ferris State. The Bulldogs were led by Hobey Baker finalist Chris Kunitz and gave the Gophers a demonstration of his abilities when he scored twice in the first period. Fortunately for Minnesota, they scored five times in the opening frame and cruised to a 7–4 victory.\nThe national semifinal saw Minnesota fight and law back from the brink of disaster. Facing off against #4 Michigan, the Gophers were badly outplayed in the first period and found themselves down by a goal. A Jed Ortmeyer score after the mid-way point of the game put the Wolverines up by two and had Minnesota staring into the void. Troy Riddle cut the lead in half on a rebound from Vanek before the end of the second while a marker less than two minutes into the third from Gino Guyer tied the score. Chris Harrington took two separate minor penalties afterwards but the Minnesota penalty kill held and kept the game knotted at 2-all. Overtime was required and both teams found it difficult to get the puck on the goal. In almost 9 minutes only 5 shots were recorded but it was the last one from Vanek that counted and sent Minnesota to the championship game.\nThe final game of the year came against New Hampshire in a rematch from earlier in the season. Minnesota carried the balance of play but Mike Ayers put up a strong performance in goal for the Wildcats and kept his team in the game. After two periods, Minnesota was leading on the shot clock 30–16 but the teams remained tied with one goal apiece. As time went on, it was just one mistake that separated Minnesota from disaster but, as he had most of the season, Thomas Vanek stepped in as the hero. Just past the 8-minute mark, Vanek broke the tie and then assisted on a second goal just 3 minutes later. After a power play goal from Barry Tallackson, Minnesota suddenly had a commanding 3-goal lead. New Hampshire desperately tried to tie the game but they had been outmatched on the ice all night. Pulling their goalie only allowed the Gophers to score a 5th goal and ensure the team a national championship. Minnesota was the first team in over 30 years to defend their national title.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: PTS = Points; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against\"\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | "

        "text": "Kingsley Jones (born 19 June 1970) is a Welsh rugby union coach, currently in charge of the Canadian national team. A former Welsh international player, Jones has played and coached at various levels, from playing at the amateur level to the professional level in Wales and England. He since went on to become a professional coach at club and international level.\nPersonal life.\nJones often appears on BBC 2 Wales' regular Sunday rugby union programme Scrum V.\nHis father, Phil Kingsley Jones, is the former manager of Jonah Lomu. Both his sons Dorian Jones and Rhys Jones are current professional rugby union players.\nPlaying career.\nJones, a former loose forward, first started playing for his local side Abertillery RFC (soon afterwards Abertillery became a member of the professional Welsh Premier Division) before being picked up by Cross Keys RFC in 1993. At Captaining Cross Keys, he played a single season for the side gaining experience at a higher level of the game, before moving to one of the leading sides in Wales, Pontypridd RFC in the Welsh Premier Division. Guided by Dennis John, Jones became a physical loose forward for the side, playing at Flanker or Number 8 in his sole season at the club.\nIn 1995, Jones joined Ebbw Vale RFC at the elite end of Welsh rugby. He was a regular in the backrow for Ebbw Vale, such that he was given captaincy on his arrival at his new club. On 24 August 1996, Jones made his international debut for Wales, starting in the backrow in a test match against the Barbarians. He gained his first cap against an international opponent a month later, starting against France in Cardiff. In 1998, he led Ebbw Vale to their first ever WRU Challenge Cup Final, only to lose to Llanelli, 19–12. In that same season, he was given captaincy of the national team in an away game to South Africa, in what was Jones' last international appearance for his country after rupturing his chiles tendon.\nAhead of the 1998/99 season, Jones crossed the border and represented Gloucester professionally for three seasons again being appointed as club captain on his arrival, before moving on to Worcester Warriors in the 2001–02 where he was appointed captain on his arrival for the third time in his career. He returned to Wales a season later, playing for Pontypridd, before ending his playing career at Doncaster as a player-coach.\nHe retired as a player in 2004, winning 10 caps for Wales between 1996 and 1998, and had made more than 100 appearances for a Welsh club. He had at some point captained every side that he played for, at club and international level. He had represented the Barbarians as a player on their 2000 UK tour of Ireland, Scotland, and England.\nCoaching career.\nSale Sharks (2004–2011).\nAfter retiring at the end of the 2003/04 season, Philippe Saint-André, who was newly appointed head coach of Sale Sharks, brought Jones in a forwards coach for the 2004–05 English Premiership. Between Saint-André and his assistants, Sale made it to the semi-final of the English Premiership, only to lose to London Wasps 43–22. Sale did however claim the 2004–05 European Challenge Cup title, after beating Pau in the final 27–3.\nIn 2005, Saint-André was promoted to Director of Rugby, which saw Jones replace Saint-André as head coach of the club. In Jones' first season in charge, he helped Sale go one step further and make the English Premiership final of that season. They faced Leicester Tigers in the final, who were defeated by the Sharks 45–20 to see Sale earn their first ever Premiership title. In Europe, Sale made it as far as the quarter-finals of the 2005–06 Heineken Cup, losing to Biarritz Olympique 11–6 in the knock-out game.\nThe 2006/07 season saw Jones's side struggle, after dropping to tenth during the English Premiership and failed to advance out of the group stage of the Heineken Cup. The following season saw Sale narrowly miss out on the knock-out stage of the 2007–08 English Premiership, however, Sale did progress to semi-finals of the 2007–08 European Challenge Cup, but in that game lost out to Bath 36–14.\nThe 2008/09 season was Philippe Saint-André's last season with the club after he announced in December 2008 he would be leaving his post as Director of Rugby. This meant Jones was to be promoted up to the top job with immediate effect. After Jones became Director of Rugby, he brought in Jason Robinson as head coach. In their first year of partnership, Sale narrowly remained in the top Premiership after slipping to eleventh on the table, while they failed to make much of an impact on the European scene. The 2010/11 season saw Jones bring in a new head coach to replace Robinson who left at the back end of the previous season. Mike Brewer became the full-time head coach after filling in for Robinson, however Brewer was sacked three months into the season.\n2010 Barbarians V England &amp; Ireland saw Jones again team up with Frenchman Philippe Saint Andre to coach the Barbarians with a defeat to England at Twickenham 35–28 and a win over Ireland in Thomond park 29–23.\nIn January 2011, Jones later announced his resignation, standing down as Director of Rugby at the club at the end of January 2011.\nRussia (2011–2014).\nAfter leaving Sale Sharks in January 2011, he joined the Russian national team as a consultant to Nikolay Nerush ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, before being officially named as National teams Director just months before the World Cup. Following the World Cup, Jones became the head coach of the national team after Nerush stood down.\nHis first match in charge was a narrow 33–32 win away to Portugal in the second leg of the 2010–12 European Nations Cup First Division. Despite two further victories over Ukraine, 38–19, and Spain, 41–37, Russia finished fourth in Jones' first season in charge. The 2012 IRB Nations Cup saw Russia pick up a sole victory, coming against Uruguay 19–13.\nThe 2012–14 European Nations Cup First Division, was the first full European Nation Cup competition Jones led his team in. Across tho two-year competition, he saw Russia finish third, behind Georgia and Romania. This meant Russia progress to the final stage of the European qualification process for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. However, on 22 May, just days before their play-off match against Germany, Jones announced he would be standing down from his post at Russia following the 2015 World Cup qualifier against Germany. His final match was won by the Russians 31–20, which saw them progress to the repechage, the final stage of qualification for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nHe left his post with 11 wins from 26 games Russia never losing to a team ranked below them with Jones at the helm, a 42% win rate.\nJones was replaced with Raphaël Saint-André, brother of French national coach and former coaching partner Philippe Saint-André.\nNewport Gwent Dragons (2013–2017).\nIn June 2013, Kingsley Jones was appointed as a consultant coach to Lyn Jones at Newport Gwent Dragons, sharing his commitments with his coaching duties in Russia. After Edwards departed the region in February 2014, Kingsley Jones took on a more hands on job with Lyn Jones, now doubling up as Director of Rugby and head coach. They had both previously worked with each other when Lyn Jones brought Kingsley Jones in as a consultant at London Welsh in 2012.\nFollowing the disruption in the 2013/14 season at the Dragons, Jones was named head coach ahead of the 2014/15 season after he became available after his Russia duties. His first match in charge was a 16–11 loss away to Connacht. Jones picked up his first victory in the fourth round after defeating Benetton Treviso 33–15. Despite finishing ninth on the table with eight victories, the Dragons knocked over Leinster home and away in a historic first ever season double over the Irish province. This was the first time since 2009 that the Dragons had defeat Leinster. During the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup, Jones led his side to a third seed position going into the knock-out stage. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Welsh rivals Cardiff Blues 25–21, before being defeated by Edinburgh 45–16 in the semis.\nIn the 2015–16 Pro12 season, the Dragons won just four League games, two of which was victories over Munster and Leinster. In the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup they repeated their fortunes of the previous season, making it to the semi-finals, where this time they lost to Montpellier 22–12.\nIn Jones' final season in charge of the region, the Dragons slipped to eleventh on the table despite gaining 12 losing bonus points. In the second half of the season, the Dragons won just one game, with the final 8 rounds between January and the end of the season all resulting in defeats. In June 2017, it was announced that the Welsh Rugby Union was taking over the region. Following this, it was later revealed that Bernard Jackman was to replaced Jones as head coach of the region. Jones' last game in charge was a 26–24 loss to the Blues.\nCanada (2017–present).\nFollowing his departure with the Dragons, Jones took up a new role with the Welsh Rugby Union, leading the unions exile programme. However, this was a short-term role with Jones being named the head coach of the Canadian national team on 21 September 2017 following the sacking of Mark Anscombe. Jones' first game in charge of Canada ended in a 51–9 uncapped loss to the Māori All Blacks in Vancouver. The following week, Canada had a record defeat to Georgia, losing 54–22. On 18 November, Canada Jones led Canada to their first win in 8 attempts, defeating Spain 37–27. However, Canada couldn't back this win up in their final match of their European tour, losing to Fiji 57–17, a record winning margin for the Flying Fijians over Canada.\nIn February 2018, Canada failed to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as Americas 2, after losing both tests to Uruguay (29–38 and 32–31). This meant Canada moved to the Repechage tournament for the first ever time. The 2018 Americas Rugby Championship saw Jones lead Canada to fourth, with wins over Brazil (45–5) and Chile (17–33). During the 2018 June test window, Canada lost all three of their games; losing 48–10 to Scotland, 43–20 to Russia, which was a first ever loss to the Bears, and 47–17 to the United States. In November 2018, Jones led Canada into the 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifying Repechage tournament. Canada came away with three from three victories after beating Kenya, Germany and Hong Kong to qualify for the World Cup.\nCanada started the World Cup year with a poor 2019 Americas Rugby Championship campaign; finishing fifth – their worst campaign since the tournament formed in 2016. They came away with just one victory, beating Chile 56–0 in Langford. Their poor form continued into the 2019 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup, losing all three games to finish bottom of the combined table.\nIn 2021 Canada failed to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France, the first time that Canada has not been represented.\nHonours.\nPlaying.\nPontypridd RFC\nEbbw Vale RFC\nCoaching.\nSale Sharks"

        "text": "Matt Simon (born December 6, 1953) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently a Defensive and Special Teams Analyst with the University of Maryland Terrapins. Prior to arriving at UMD, Simon was the offensive coordinator for the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football program, from 2017 to 2019. Simon has previously coached in the collegiate ranks,most notably as head coach at the University of North Texas from 1994 to 1997. Simon is one of only ten football coaches to win both an NCAA Division I-A/FBS national championship (with Washington in 1991) and a Super Bowl (with the Baltimore Ravens in 2000).\nBorn in Akron, Ohio, Simon grew up in El Paso, Texas. He attended Burges High School where he was a three-sport standout in football, track and wrestling. He earned four letters as a linebacker for the Eastern New Mexico University Greyhounds and was later inducted into the ENMU Hall of Honors. Immediately following his playing career, Simon began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at his alma mater. After one year as an assistant at Borger High School, Simon coached the tight end and linebacker positions at the University of Texas at El Paso under head coach Bill Michael.\nIn 1982, he became running backs and placekickers coach at the University of Washington. The Huskies went to nine bowl games over a span of ten seasons. In 1991, the Huskies tied the Miami Hurricanes for the national championship. In 1997, Simon was inducted into the University of Washington's Hall of Fame. Simon left Washington in 1992 for the offensive coordinator position at New Mexico under head coach Dennis Franchione. The Lobos averaged 413 yards and 30.5 points per game during that span. They ranked 13th in the country in 1992 and improved to 8th the following year.\nSimon succeeded Dennis Parker as head coach at North Texas in 1994, becoming only the 10th African American to lead a Division I-A football squad. In his first season, Simon guided North Texas to the Southland Conference Championship. He was named Southland Conference Coach of the Year, Black Coaches Association National Football Coach of the Year and AFCA Region 4 Coach of the Year. Simon resigned in January,1998 because of scheduling differences with the athletic administration. Simon believed the proposed 1998 non conference schedule put too many North Texas football players at risk for injury.\nAfter coaching at the Denver Broncos training camp and volunteering through the 1998–1999 season, Simon began his pro coaching career with the Baltimore Ravens. Under his guidance, Baltimore rushed for an average of 1,985 yards per season and defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV following the 2000 NFL season. In 2004, the Ravens’ ground attack produced 2,063 total yards and ranked 9th in the NFL. It was Jamal Lewis's fourth 1,000-yard rushing season under Simon. Baltimore rushed for at least 2,000 yards in three different seasons under Simon, including a team-record 2,674 yards in 2003 when Jamal Lewis was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year, and Associated Press All-Pro and selected to the AFC Pro Bowl. In 2006, Matt Simon resigned from the Ravens to pursue other opportunities in the NFL because of uncertainties with former head coach Brian Billick's tenor with the team.\nSimon's success with running backs continued during his time with the San Diego Chargers in the 2007–08 season. He helped lead LaDainian Tomlinson to his second NFL rushing title while coaching Pro Bowl Fullback, Lorenzo Neal and RB, Darren Sproles.\nIn 2011 Simon joined the coaching staff at the University of Buffalo, and served from 2011-2016. During his tenor at UB, Simon coached three All-Conference Running Backs and two All-Conference Punters and Kickers.\nOne of those All-Conference RBs, Branden Oliver, broke James Starks' single season school rushing record at the University at Buffalo in 2011 with Simon as his coach.\nA team highlight came when Buffalo played in only their second Bowl Game in team history, when they played in the 2013 Famous Idaho Potato Bowl.\nFrom 2017-18, Simon served as the Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach for the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens. Delaware finished 7-4 both seasons, while the 2018 team qualified for the FCS Division I Playoffs.\nSimon serves (2022-Current) as the Defensive Quality Control Coach for the Maryland Tarrapins, helping then win the 2022 Duke's Mayo Bowl, and the \n2023 Music City Bowl."

MRFU is part of the Mid-America Geographical Union (MAGU), which is of several Geographical Unions (GU's) that comprise USA Rugby.\nHistory.\nEarly History. \nThe honor of creating the Missouri Rugby Football Union belongs largely to Harry Langenberg. In 1933, Harry arrived back in St. Louis after attending Princeton University, where he was introduced to rugby. Harry not only played rugby, but also served as an assistant coach for a school club. In St. Louis, Harry joined forces with Edmond St. John Hoogewerf and Hugo Walther to form the Missouri Rugby Football Union.\nShortly after the formation of the Missouri Rugby Football Union, Harry founded the first club to become a member, the Ramblers. The Missouri Rugby Football Union is now one of the oldest of the 39 territorial unions operating within the USA Rugby Union, and one of the oldest sports organizations in the St. Louis area. The Ramblers Rugby Club is the second oldest surviving independent rugby club in the United States. The Ramblers were Missouri Rugby Football Union champions in 1947.\nGrand Rec. \nGrand Rec was the first team allowed to keep the Missouri Rugby Football Union trophy for winning the championship three years in a row, in 1950. During its last years a younger team, the Grand Rec Juniors, was formed and also played. After winning permanent possession of the championship trophy, Grand Rec disbanded, and the juniors became just Grand Rec. Paul Birchfield from Grand Rec became coach of the juniors, now Grand Rec, and coached them to a championship. Bill \"Terrible\" Turk was the only Grand Rec player who played on as a member of the juniors, now just Grand Rec. Among Grand Rec's original team was Rudy Bukich (see Wikipedia entry). All the Missouri Rugby Football Union games during this time were played on the pitch in Forest Park, St Louis, Missouri. During the original Grand Rec's reign, the champion of the Missouri Rugby Football Union played Princeton for the Missouri Challenge Cup. This series was discontinued when Princeton returned the cup, after having won the game the previous year, saying the scheduled date interfered with studying for exams.\nGateway Ruggerfest.\nThe MRFU has hosted the Gateway Ruggerfest Tournament annually since 1948. The tournament was traditionally scheduled on Easter weekend in Forest Park and was known as the Easter Ruggerfest. In recent years, the tournament has been scheduled the week after Easter and has outgrown the capacity of Forest Park. The 62nd annual Ruggerfest was held on April 10–11, 2010 at Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park in St. Louis County.\nSenior Clubs.\nMen's.\nMen's Division II\nMen's Division III\nWomen's.\n Women's Division I\nCollege Clubs.\nMen.\nCollegiate Division I-A\nCollegiate Division I-AA\nCollegiate Division II\nWomen's.\nSt. Louis Sabres Women's Rugby\nHigh School clubs.\nSingle School Programs\nMulti-School Programs\nHigh School Girls\nSt. Louis Sirens\nNodaway County High School Rugby Club"

In bandy, Petersén won a Swedish title in 1931 and twice played internationally in 1931–32.\nAfter retiring from competitions, Petersén ran his Mulle Coffee-Roastery in Duvbo, Stockholm."

        "title": "Oregon Ducks men's basketball",
        "text": "The Oregon Ducks men's basketball team is an intercollegiate basketball program that competes in the NCAA Division I and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference, representing the University of Oregon. The Ducks play their home games at Matthew Knight Arena, which has a capacity of 12,364. Then coached by Howard Hobson, Oregon won the first NCAA men's basketball national championship in 1939. They again reached the Final Four in 2017 under head coach Dana Altman, marking the longest span between appearances in NCAA history (78 years). The Ducks have made the NCAA tournament 18 times, and have won eight conference championships.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe University of Oregon men's basketball team played its first season in 1902–03 with Charles Burden as the head coach. Only two games were played that season with Oregon losing both games. Oregon did not record a win until its fourth season in 1907 against Roseburg. The season ended with a winning record of 4–3, under Hugo Bezdek, who also coached the football team. Bezdek left after that season to coach at Arkansas until 1913 when he went back to Oregon to coach until 1917.\nDuring Bezdek's absence, the basketball team was coached largely by William Hayward, Oregon's track coach. In 1923, William Reinhart took over as the head coach and remained through the erection of McArthur Court until 1935. Coach Reinhart suffered only one losing season at Oregon.\nThe Tall Firs.\nHoward Hobson, an alumnus of the university, became the head coach in 1935, following Reinhart's departure. His ideas were considered cutting edge during his years at Oregon and he was well ahead of his time. He ran a fast break offense little used by anyone else in the country at the time and his defenses were an unorthodox hybrid defense. He lobbied for the installment of a shot clock and three-point field goal years before they were first introduced.\nIn 1939, the Oregon Ducks became the first team to win the NCAA Basketball Championship. Sports editor L. H. Gregory coined the phrase \"Tall Firs\" to describe the Oregon players due to their taller stature compared to other teams in the country.\nThe season started with a long trip to the east coast for a series of games, ending with a loss to Stanford back west in San Francisco. The Ducks went 6–3 during that trip but gained valuable experience for the remainder of the season. Oregon went 14–2 to claim the North Division title in the Pacific Coast Conference, which set off a best-of-three playoff against the California Golden Bears. The Ducks won two games straight to claim the conference title.\nThe Ducks returned to San Francisco for the NCAA regional series where they defeated the Texas Longhorns in the first game 56–41 then the Oklahoma Sooners 55–37. The Ohio State Buckeyes had defeated Wake Forest and Villanova in their regional series to earn their right in the championship game. On March 27, Oregon and Ohio State squared off to claim the national title. Oregon emerged victorious to claim the first NCAA national championship trophy, defeating Ohio State 46–33.\nHoward Hobson remained as the head coach until 1947 except for a one-year hiatus during the 1944–45 season, coached by John Warren.\nKamikaze Kids.\nThe six decades following the Tall Firs consisted of an eclectic mix of up and down years, with more down than up. From Hobson's departure in 1947 until 1970, Oregon made only two NCAA Tournament appearances, in 1960 and 1961 under head coach Steve Belko. Those were the days when only one team per conference (usually the conference champion) was guaranteed a bid to the NCAA Tournament. One of Belko's stars was Stan Love, a gifted shooter and rebounder, who led the Pac-8 in scoring for two straight seasons. He is the father of current NBA star Kevin Love. In 1971, head coach Dick Harter arrived at Oregon and achieved some consistency with the program. Harter's teams were dubbed the Kamikaze Kids and featured hard play, diving for loose balls, and swarming defense. They were also credited for inspiring the intimidating atmosphere at McArthur Court. While they never earned any conference titles due to UCLA's dominance of the Pac-8 (their best finish was second in 1976–77), they were not without accomplishments. They assembled two 20 win seasons, appeared in three straight NITs, and upset #1 ranked UCLA in 1974.\nHarter's only losing season in Oregon was his first. He left in 1978 and the Ducks slid, suffering five consecutive losing seasons. Oregon made an appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1995 under head coach Jerry Green, but otherwise accrued largely mediocre records in the two decades after Harter's departure.\nErnie Kent era.\nIn 1997, Ernie Kent was hired to fill the vacancy at head coach left by Jerry Green. Kent had been one of Harter's Kamikaze Kids, and his teams were known for a similarly up-tempo style of play. In his third season as head coach, he took the Ducks back to the NCAA tournament where they fell in the first round. In 2002, Kent led the Ducks to their first conference championship since 1945, going through the regular season undefeated at home. They earned a number 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament that year and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating Montana, Wake Forest and Texas. They were eliminated by Kansas and finished the season with a number 11 ranking in the AP Poll. It was Oregon's deepest run in the tournament in 42 years.\nLuke Ridnour was selected as the Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2003 as the Ducks won the Pac-10 tournament, defeating the USC Trojans in the conference championship game 74–66. The Ducks entered the NCAA Tournament as an 8 seed and lost to Utah in the first round 58–60.\nOregon made a Final Four appearance in the NIT in 2004 but otherwise made little impact until 2007. Oregon swept its 12 intersectional games to start 2007 and upset #1 ranked UCLA in the third Pac-10 game. The Ducks finished the regular season with a 23–7 record and defeated Arizona, California, and USC to win the 2007 Pac-10 Tournament. The Ducks earned a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating Miami (Ohio) 58–56, Winthrop 75–61 and University of Nevada, Las Vegas 76–72. On March 25, played and lost to the eventual NCAA National Champions, the Florida Gators, by a score of 77–85.\nOregon was considered the favorite to land Class of 2007 high school stars Kevin Love and Kyle Singler, widely considered to be the greatest high school players to ever come out of Oregon. In the summer of 2005, Love and Singler dropped Oregon from their list because of the turmoil inside the Oregon team, centering on the moral allegations concerning coach Ernie Kent. Love eventually chose to attend UCLA and Singler chose Duke.\nThe Ducks were selected as a No. 9 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament in the Southern Region. They lost to No. 8 seed Mississippi State Bulldogs in first-round play on March 21, 2008, in Little Rock, Arkansas.\nOn March 15, 2010, the university announced that the decision had been made to fire Ernie Kent as a result of poor performance in the previous two seasons, placing 9th and 10th in conference in the respective years. Kent departed as the longest tenured Pac-10 coach and winningest coach in school history with 235 wins.\nDana Altman era.\nIn April 2010, Dana Altman from Creighton University was hired to replace Ernie Kent after a monthlong search. Altman led the Ducks to a CBI championship in his first year at Oregon and led the Ducks to the Sweet 16 during the 2012–13 season. Altman led the Ducks back to the NCAA Tournament in the 2013–14 season where they defeated BYU but fell to Wisconsin in the round of 32. It was their 12th NCAA tournament appearance and was the first time Oregon won tournament games in back to back seasons in program history. In 2014–15, Altman won his 2nd Pac-12 Coach of the Year in three seasons, as he had won the award in 2013. Altman also broke another school record as he became the first coach in Oregon history to go to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments (2013, 2014, 2015). Altman's success continued into the following season as Oregon won the 2015–16 regular season title, finishing 14–4 in league play. Altman also won the 2015–2016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year for the third time in four years. Lute Olson had been the only other coach in Pac-12 history to win the award three times in a four-year span.\nThe 2015–16 season was very noteworthy, with the Ducks emerging victorious in the 2015–16 Pac-12 Conference Tournament. This led to the Ducks being the top seed in the West Regional of the 2015–2016 NCAA tournament, its first ever top seeding in the NCAA tournament. The Ducks defeated Holy Cross and Saint Joseph's in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet 16 in Anaheim, where they defeated the number four seed and defending national champion Duke Blue Devils, 82–68, to advance to the Elite 8. The following year, the Ducks would go on to be Pac-12 conference co-champions with Arizona, whom they lost to in the championship game of the Pac-12 Tournament. In that year's NCAA Tournament the Ducks would advance all the way to the Final Four, losing to North Carolina by one point.\nVenues and facilities.\nMcArthur Court was constructed in 1926 and the first Oregon basketball game was played in the arena on January 14, 1927, defeating Willamette University 38–10. The arena is located across from Pioneer Cemetery and is named after Clifton McArthur, the first student body president. Even during the Ducks' lean years, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the Pac-10. A group of students known as the \"Pit Crew\" has at times created environments so intimidating that the basket would shake as opponents attempted free throws.\nIn early 2009, the university broke ground on a new $227 million basketball arena designed by TVA Architects to replace McArthur Court. The new arena was named Matthew Knight Arena, after Phil Knight's son who drowned in a scuba diving accident in 2004. The arena is considered to be the front door to the university due to its high-profile location from where the majority of vehicular traffic into the university stems. A primary goal was to create the best collegiate basketball venue in the country though many criticisms arose due to the funding and price tag associated with the design. The hardwood court was named after Patrick Kilkenny, a booster for the university and the former interim athletic director. It had been the subject of much debate upon its opening, due to its unconventional and artistic design. Designer Tinker Hatfield's idea was to pay tribute to the 1939 national championship team, nicknamed \"The Tall Firs\", by creating silhouetted firs around the edges of the court. Matthew Knight Arena opened its doors for the first time on January 13, 2011, with the Ducks defeating the University of Southern California 68–62.\nIndividual accomplishments.\nIndividual National Award Winners.\nPlayers\nCoaches\nAll-Americans.\nThe following players were named first, second or third-team All-Americans by one of outlets used by the NCAA to determine consensus selections\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Ducks have appeared in 18 NCAA tournaments.

        "title": "Rugby Road",
        "text": "Rugby Road is a street in Charlottesville, Virginia that serves as the center of the University of Virginia's fraternity and sorority system and its attendant social activity. It is located across the street from central Grounds, beginning at University Avenue across the street from the Rotunda branching off at Preston Avenue and finally curving down to the 250 Bypass, and marks one end of The Corner, a strip of restaurants and stores that cater mainly to students. Rugby Road is lined with a variety of architecturally significant houses from several different decades. Many of these are currently used by fraternities and sororities, although the majority of them were originally intended for single-family use; William Faulkner was one famous resident while he was a writer in residence at the University.\nIn addition to its social role, Rugby Road is also home to a variety of institutions and well known structures with a wide range of uses and purposes. These include Madison House, the University of Virginia School of Architecture, Mad Bowl, Beta Bridge, the Bayly Art Museum, and the official university structures on Carr's Hill, Fayerweather Hall and the President's House.\nMadison House.\nMadison House serves as the student volunteer center at the University of Virginia. It coordinates volunteers, develops leaders, builds community partnerships and promotes lifelong volunteer service. It is a non-profit student-run organization that helps students at the University of Virginia give back to the University and the greater Charlottesville community through community service. Madison House is unique in that it is student-led and has a multi-tiered leadership and volunteer system. There are 19 programs in which more than 3000 volunteers participate on a weekly basis. University alumni play an important role in the operation of Madison House by donating money to support the programs. Madison House has been recognized nationally with prestigious awards for the services it provides.\nMadison House originated at YMCA that was formed in 1856. YMCA was founded on religious values and its members considered volunteer service a big part of their club. Membership declined in the late 1960s and the group considered disbanding. There were members, however, who still believed in the values of volunteer service so they reincorporated as the Masters and Fellows of Madison Hall. Madison House was operating at the same time with a focus on community service. The Masters and Fellows of Madison Hall grew rapidly; in order to sustain their group they sold their property to the University. In 1975, the two groups incorporated and formed Madison House.\nThe programs run through Madison House include Adopt-a-Grandparent, Animals and Environment, Athletics, Big Sibling, Bridging the Gap, Cavs in the Classroom, Day Care, English as a Second Language, HELP Line, Holiday Sharing, Hoos Against Hunger and Homelessness, Housing Improvement Program, Medical Services, Migrant Aid, Outreach Services, PLAY, Recreational Therapy, Tutoring, and Youth Mentoring. Each program is run by a Head Program Director, a student who bears responsibility for setting goals for the program, budgeting funds, coordinating events, and training the 10-11 Program Directors who work under them in the program. In all, there are about 200 Program Directors who are each in charge of about 10-25 volunteers within a specific program. It is their job to motivate and train volunteers, and they show their willingness to do this with a ten-hour-a-week time commitment. This leadership pyramid is supported at its base by over 3000 student volunteers. These are undergraduate students committed to work for between one and five hours per week on the program to which they belong. Overseeing everything is the staff of Madison House, composed of specialists trained at managing non-profit organizations. They are in charge of the Head Program Directors and help to connect many of the programs to the Charlottesville community. There is also a Board of Directors, with mixed student, University, and community representation, that determines the mission of the House and hires the Executive Director.\nMadison House has received several awards for its service. In 1990, Madison House was designated a Point of Light by President George H. W. Bush. This award celebrates the success of the volunteers and spotlights the impact that various individuals, groups, businesses and families have made in their communities. In 2000, Madison House was the only Youth Volunteer group in Virginia to win the Governor's award for volunteer community service.\nMadison Bowl.\nMadison Bowl, or \"Mad Bowl\", as it has come to be known, is located behind Madison Hall between Rugby Road and Madison Lane. Originally owned by YMCA in 1895, Mad Bowl initially hosted five tennis courts; in 1914 a track with banked corners was added. The field has traditionally been used for many different recreational events, including many club and intramural sports, in particular rugby; the Fall Autumns Carnival; Springfest; fraternity and sorority events, fundraisers, and other special events, including the annual Easters party.\nAs early as 1898, University students celebrated Easter Week, or \"Easters\", a week-long celebration that included elaborate dances and athletic games which helped the students shake the winter doldrums. It was also an occasion to celebrate Thomas Jefferson's birthday, since the celebration often occurred right around April 13. Traditionally Easters had been celebrated with a ball, but by the 1960s, the fraternities took a more active role in running the weekend, and Easters became a large party held in the fraternity houses along Rugby Road and in Mad Bowl. The event became something like a public street party, attracting attendees from all over the East Coast as well as internationally. Easters may be responsible for the University's reputation as a party school, reportedly earning the University a reputation as a \"professional\" party location in Playboy in 1964. The last Easters celebration took place in 1982. During that year's celebration, a gas main ruptured on Grady Street and, while no one was seriously hurt, the rising likelihood of a serious public disaster forced the cancellation of the event from that time forward.\nIn 2006, the University and the city of Charlottesville teamed up to dig up Mad Bowl and replace utility lines, install drainage and add new surfacing. For years, runoff from Fayerweather and Madison Halls collected on the field, giving it the nickname \"Mud Bowl.\" Bad field conditions led to practice cancellations and higher safety risks to students using the field in muddy conditions, and difficulties in planning other field events. Irrigation and drainage systems were added for the field, as well as six inches of fresh soil and a layer of sod. No stadium lights were installed, so the field is exclusively for daytime use.\nFraternity and Sorority Houses.\nRugby Road and the neighboring streets house a large number of fraternity residences, including Delta Gamma, Theta Delta Chi, Sigma Phi (SERP), Delta Upsilon, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta, Delta Sigma Phi, St. Anthony Hall, St. Elmo Hall, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Phi Epsilon (SPE), Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Chi, Phi Delta Theta, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Pi Kappa Phi, Theta Chi, Kappa Sigma, Kappa Alpha Order, Chi Phi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Phi Society, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, Zeta Beta Tau, Zeta Psi, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Tau Omega, and Beta Theta Pi.\nIn 1983 the University's Board of Visitors decided to address the deteriorating conditions of many fraternity and sorority houses on Rugby Road. It created a limited partnership program, known as the Historic Renovation Corporation. The Historic Renovation Corporation became a partner in the ownership of many of the houses, renovated them, and then sold them back to their original owners, most of whom are University of Virginia alumni. The Historic Renovation Corporation is still operating today, and is currently providing property management services to the alumni owners of eleven Rugby Road houses.\nCarr's Hill.\nCarr's Hill sits at the corner of Rugby Road and University Avenue, facing Mad Bowl to the southeast and the Rotunda to the southwest. The site has long been important to the extended university community. As the enrollment at the University overflowed the original Jeffersonian rooms of the Academical Village, Sidney Carr's boardinghouse on Carr's Hill helped absorb the additional students starting in the mid-1840s. By 1877 Carr's Hill hosted dormitories, at which the University's first experiment in dining clubs took place.\nIn the years of the Civil War, Carr's Hill served as a drill field and as a site for the Confederate flag, which briefly flew above the Rotunda itself.\nThe University purchased the Carr's Hill property outright in June 1867 for $10,000, and over time it became the site of two significant University buildings: Fayerweather Hall and the President's residence. Fayerweather Hall, built in 1893, was the University's first dedicated indoor gymnasium, and is currently the site of the University of Virginia's Art History department. The President's House was constructed on Carr's Hill, which had to be terraced for the purpose. Construction began in 1907, two years after the inauguration of the first president of the University, Edwin Alderman, and finished in 1909. The house was designed by McKim, Mead, and White, the team of architects responsible for the buildings on the South Lawn (Rouss, Cocke, and Old Cabell Hall) and the rebuilding of the Rotunda.\nBeta Bridge.\nAn integral part of Rugby Road is \"Beta Bridge\". In the 1850s, a bridge was erected over the Chesapeake and Ohio train tracks in the location of what is now Beta Bridge, but the current structure was built in 1923. The bridge was a part of a citywide paving and improvement project to prepare Charlottesville area streets for the automobile. Although it was originally known simply as the Rugby Road Bridge, when the Beta Theta Pi fraternity built their house at the corner of Chancellor and Rugby in 1927, it took its current name. In 1971, that fraternity location was closed, and the Delta Upsilon fraternity moved into its current location at 180 Rugby Road. As the unofficial monitors of the bridge, brothers and pledges of DU would paint over offensive messages or messages which did not contain 'THX DU' (for \"Thanks Delta Upsilon\"). In 2011, Beta Theta Pi moved back into their original house next to the bridge, and now messages typically contain 'THX Beta'.\nThe tradition of bridge-painting at the university actually began in 1901 with students painting the railroad bridge crossing over University Avenue at The Corner. When the railroad tried to discourage the practice, students moved their messages to Beta Bridge on Rugby. The first recorded painting occurred in 1926 when a group of students reportedly splashed the bridge with green paint. Sports scores and praises for athletes remained the most common messages on the bridge until St. Patrick's Day of 1967. Holiday supporters painted the bridge a \"festive\" Irish green, but supporters of the English crown painted over the green with red, also writing \"God Save the Queen\" in white. The Irish patriots responded by changing the word \"Queen\" to \"Green\", and the tradition took off from there. Today, many University organizations paint the bridge to promote their activities.\nSome legal and censorship issues have arisen concerning messages and graffiti displayed on Beta Bridge. The bridge is technically property of the city of Charlottesville, and in 1971, five fraternity members were arrested by city police after painting the bridge. Since then, the city has gradually ceded more freedom to students, and messages concerning everything from gay rights to violence against women, career services announcements, memorials for deaths in the community, and fraternity and sorority events have appeared. In August 2005, however, students reported that offensive images and words were painted on the bridge, and University President John T. Casteen III asked the FBI's Civil Rights Unit to investigate the incident for racial implications. FBI Special Agent James Lamb determined that the graffiti was not racially motivated. The bridge has been allowed to remain a de facto \"public forum,\" where the only response to speech is more speech.\nFollowing the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, UVA students painted Beta Bridge to show their support. This stayed on the bridge for the rest of the school year (normally Beta Bridge is painted at least five times a week.)\nOn Oct. 2, 2007, \"UVA Today\" reported that a sheet of paint approximately 4 feet high, 10 feet long and 3 inches thick separated from a wall of the bridge and fell off. The piece, the second peel-off in the past 13 years, was so heavy that it had to be cut in half before being hauled away by Facilities Management workers. It is suggested that a combination of summer heat, moisture, and weight of layers prompted the peel-off.\nIn popular culture.\nRugby Road figures prominently in University social life. The song \"From Rugby Road to Vinegar Hill,\" a bawdy UVA drinking song, places the Rugby Road scene in the context of student drinking and fun. The song has recently been associated with the Virginia Pep Band, but dates at least to 1951 when it was recorded by the Virginia Glee Club and the University of Virginia Band."

        "text": "The 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, formally known as the 2008 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix, was a Formula One race held on 28 September 2008 at 20:00 SST at the newly built Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. It was the 15th race of the 2008 Formula One World Championship, the 800th Formula One World Championship race overall, and the first ever Formula One race held at night. This was also the first time Singapore hosted a Formula One race, as the last Singapore Grand Prix was a Formula Libre event in 1973.\nThe 61-lap race was won by Fernando Alonso for the Renault team from 15th on the grid after his teammate deliberately crashed on lap 14 to bring out the safety car after his first pit stop. Nico Rosberg claimed second in his Williams followed by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton. Felipe Massa of Ferrari started from pole position, but finished out of the points. Drivers' Championship leader Hamilton was second while reigning world champion Kimi Räikkönen qualified third. They continued in this order until Renault's Nelson Piquet Jr. deliberately crashed on lap 14, bringing out the safety car as planned after Alonso's pit stop. The leading drivers all pitted when the pit lane was opened. Massa prematurely left the pit box with his fuel hose still attached and dropped to last place.\nAlonso, who had pitted before the safety car was deployed, subsequently took the lead and won the race. Nico Rosberg managed to finish second despite incurring a stop-go penalty and Hamilton completed the podium in third. Red Bull Racing's David Coulthard finished 7th, scoring the final points of his career. Kazuki Nakajima also scored his final points. The result saw Hamilton extend his lead in the Driver's standings to 7 points over Massa, who failed to score. McLaren also took over the lead in the Constructors' Championship by one point from Ferrari.\nIn September 2009, Renault F1 admitted in an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting that Piquet had deliberately crashed per instructions from Renault team principal Flavio Briatore and chief engineer Pat Symonds in the hope of helping Alonso win. The Renault team were handed a disqualification from Formula One, which was suspended for two years pending any further rule infringements. Briatore was banned from all FIA-sanctioned events for life, while Symonds was banned for five years. Briatore and Symonds sued the FIA in French courts; on 5 January 2010, the Tribunal de Grande Instance overturned the ban which had been put in place on both men.\nReport.\nBackground.\nIn early 2007, talks of staging a Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore began, with the focus on arranging this to be a night race in order to cater Formula One's audience in Europe. The race was approved in May and construction for the grand prix complex began in August 2007. The lighting system consisted of nearly 1600 light projectors, separated by four meters and suspended 10 meters above the track. The system generated a total of 3000 lux intensity, approximately four times the intensity used in a standard football stadium. The whole system required total of 108,423 meter cables and was connected to twelve twin-powered generators, generating estimated power of three megawatts.\nAt the previous race in Italy, Sebastian Vettel took his and Toro Rosso's maiden win in the wet race. Vettel became the youngest driver to win a Formula One race, aged 21 years and 73 days. Ferrari's Felipe Massa finished in sixth place, narrowing Lewis Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship to a single point. They were followed by BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica and Massa's teammate Kimi Räikkönen. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were in the lead with 134 points, followed by McLaren-Mercedes and BMW Sauber.\nDue to the unusual time of the race, teams and drivers had to adapt their working hours by waking up at around midday local time, starting work around late afternoon, and staying up until 4am. Most drivers and teams praised the track after carrying out track inspections as well as arrangements undertaken by the track authorities. Concerns were raised about high bumps on kerbs of the Turn 10 chicane. Concerns were also expressed on safety measures needed in case of rain during the race.\nPractice.\nHamilton set the fastest time in the first practice session on 26 September. He was followed by the Ferraris of Massa and Räikkönen and Hamilton's teammate Kovalainen. Red Bull's Mark Webber suffered a crash at Turn 18, damaging his front suspension. A number of drivers faced problems at the final corner of the circuit, including Honda's Rubens Barrichello who crashed backwards into the barriers. Toyota's Jarno Trulli also spun at this corner and subsequently made his way into the pits by driving in the wrong direction. Trulli was fined €10,000 for his misconduct.\nRenault's Fernando Alonso was fastest in the second practice session, displacing Hamilton to second position with his final flying lap. The two were followed by Kovalainen, Massa and Nico Rosberg. During the session, Toro Rosso's Sébastien Bourdais almost collided with Nick Heidfeld's BMW Sauber as he exited from the pit lane into the first corner. In separate incidents, Timo Glock lost his front wing when he crashed into wall at Turn 7, Giancarlo Fisichella faced gearbox problems and Massa mistakenly took a wrong turn towards the escape road off the track.\nAlonso was again the fastest man on the track in the final practice session, with Hamilton and Massa second and third respectively. Numerous drivers faced problems with bumps on the track, narrowly avoiding accidents. Fisichella damaged his Force India VJM01's front wing and suspension after it launched off the kerbs at the Turn 10 chicane.\nQualifying.\nRäikkönen topped the first qualifying session, ahead of Kovalainen and Hamilton. Nelson Piquet Jr., Sébastien Bourdais, Rubens Barrichello, Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella were eliminated in this session. Fisichella was unable to record a time during the session after he crashed into barriers at Turn 3 due to a punctured tyre. During his flying lap, Barrichello was impeded by Nick Heidfeld and subsequently entered the pits to abandon his lap. Heidfeld was dropped three grid places for blocking and Barrichello was fined €10,000 for an unsafe pit lane entry as he did not use the deceleration zone.\nThe second qualifying session was led by Felipe Massa, with Kovalainen and Räikkönen in second and third place. Hamilton barely managed to reach the third session, after a driving mistake during his penultimate run. Fernando Alonso was eliminated early in this session when his car suffered a fuel feed problem before he could set a lap time. The other drivers who failed to reach the top ten were Jarno Trulli, Jenson Button and both Red Bulls of Mark Webber and David Coulthard.\nMassa took the pole position in the final session, with Hamilton, Räikkönen and Kubica completing first two rows of the grid. Massa secured his position by clocking lap time six-tenths faster than Hamilton, describing it as his best qualifying result of the season. Kovalainen, managing fifth position, rued his tyre selections in the final session. Kovalainen, Heidfeld, Vettel and Glock occupied the third and fourth rows of the grid while the Williams' of Rosberg and Nakajima completed the top ten.\nRace.\nThe race began at 20:00 SST. During the warm-up lap, Piquet spun out at Turn 23, but immediately recovered and took his position on the grid. At the start, Massa, championship rival Hamilton and Räikkönen all got through the first sequence of corners safely and retained their positions. Kubica and Kovalainen made contact at Turn 3, causing Kovalainen to lose two places to Vettel and Glock. Heidfeld and Alonso cut the first corner but they did not receive any penalty. Massa began to edge away from Hamilton, who in turn was pulling away from Räikkönen. Jarno Trulli had begun the race on a heavy fuel load, and soon was holding up a number of cars with Williams's Nico Rosberg immediately behind him. It was not until the seventh lap that Rosberg finally passed Trulli's Toyota, and soon Nakajima and Alonso got through as well.\nAfter ten laps, Massa had built up a lead of over three seconds to Hamilton and Räikkönen was a further seven seconds behind Hamilton. On lap twelve, Alonso was the first driver who came into the pits. He switched his super-soft tyres for the soft compound tyres and rejoined at the back of the field. Two laps later, teammate Piquet lost control of his car and hit the wall at Turn 17, blaming his hard tyres for the accident. This resulted in the first safety car period of the race. The two Red Bull cars and Rubens Barrichello managed to come into the pits before it was closed. With very little fuel left, Rosberg and Kubica had no choice but to pit despite the pit lane being closed. Barrichello's Honda then had a mechanical failure and became the second retirement of the race. After all the cars were behind the safety car, the pit lane was opened and nearly all the drivers pitted.\nIn the pits, Ferrari prematurely released Massa with the fuel hose still attached to the car. The Brazilian was also released into the path of Adrian Sutil, who narrowly avoided the Ferrari. Massa went the full length of the pitlane before stopping just before the exit. Massa rejoined at the back of the field after the Ferrari mechanics ran down the pitlane and removed the hose from the car. Cars who had either pitted before the safety car or were on one stop strategies were now in front. Rosberg now led from Trulli, Fisichella, Kubica, Alonso, Webber, Coulthard and Hamilton.\nRosberg started to pull away from the heavily fuelled Trulli and Fisichella's Force India, who held up most of the field behind him. In the next few laps, Felipe Massa was given a drive through penalty for an unsafe release from the pits while Rosberg and Kubica were given 10 second stop-go penalties for refuelling when the pitlane was closed. The Ferrari driver served his penalty and rejoined the track still in last place. Kubica came into the pits from fourth and dropped behind Massa. After building a lead of over fifteen seconds to Trulli, Rosberg served his penalty a lap later but only lost three positions. He rejoined the circuit in fourth behind Alonso and Jarno Trulli took over the lead.\nA lap later, Fisichella came in from second to make his only pit stop, moving Alonso and Rosberg into second and third. Trulli led the race for four more laps before making his only stop of the night, handing the lead to Alonso. He soon pulled away from Rosberg who pitted from second on lap 41, rejoining in seventh. Alonso made his final stop a lap later but still rejoined in the lead, just ahead of second and third placed Coulthard and Hamilton. Coulthard lost momentum and the McLaren overtook the Red Bull at turn seven. At the end of the lap, both cars pitted and Coulthard nearly left with his fuel hose attached.\nMark Webber retired on lap 29 with a gearbox issue. His team Red Bull Racing later claimed that a momentary electrical surge caused by a passing underground tram made the gearbox select two gears at once. The incident occurred in Turn 13. A tram line goes right underneath that section of the race track. These allegations were later denied by the city-state's railway operator.\nAfter 45 laps, Alonso led Timo Glock by just over six seconds and Rosberg by a further eleven seconds in third. The Toyota driver pitted two laps later, rejoining in fifth. Four laps later, Trulli began to slow down and soon retired after a mechanical failure. On the same lap, Räikkönen made his second and final stop of the race and rejoined in fifth. A lap later, Massa spun at Turn 18 and lightly tapped the tyre wall without sustaining much damage. Moments later, Sutil fell victim to the same corner and damaged his front suspension, becoming the fifth retirement of the night. The incident brought out the second safety car period of the race.\nThe safety car withdrew from the circuit with nine laps remaining and Alonso pulled away from Rosberg and Hamilton. Glock, Räikkönen, Vettel, Heidfeld and Coulthard (ultimately, claiming points for the final time) were in the remaining points positions. Rosberg was coming under pressure from Hamilton, who was looking to capitalize on Massa's incidents. With four laps remaining, Räikkönen bounced off the kerbs at the Turn 10 chicane and crashed into the barriers while chasing Glock, promoting Nakajima into the points. Alonso maintained his lead over Rosberg and took his first win for Renault since his return to the team. Rosberg held on to second and Hamilton settled for third. Massa finished in 13th place and the points difference between himself and Hamilton increased to seven points and McLaren took over the lead in the Constructors' Championship. With teammate Räikkönen failing to finish, this was the first time the Ferrari team had failed to score any points in a race since the 2006 Australian Grand Prix. Räikkönen recorded his tenth fastest lap of the season during the race, tying his own record that he shared with Michael Schumacher. Heidfeld broke Schumacher's record, being classified for the 25th consecutive race.\nPost-race.\nFernando Alonso credited his success to the team's strategy and bit of luck. He said that the team chose a two-stop strategy with a short initial stint as opposed to a one-stop strategy, considering the difficulties of overtaking on the track and possibility of brake problems. Nico Rosberg was pleased with his career best result, although he recalled when he thought his efforts for a good finish might have been in vain after being given a stop-and-go penalty. He mentioned that he had to come in for the pit stops on the same lap that the safety car came out, and admitted that he was annoyed with the penalty. Hamilton said that he tried to get close to Rosberg towards the final laps, after the second safety car period; however, seeing that overtaking was extremely risky, he decided against it, considering that neither of the Ferraris was going to score.\nFerrari team principal Stefano Domenicali said that the reason for Massa's pit incident was not the electronic signalling system but a human error. He defended the electronic system saying that the system saves any reaction time for the driver as opposed to a standard \"lollipop\" system, and considering it was a human error, the incident may have happened with a lollipop as well.\nToyota filed a protest against Toro Rosso for releasing Sebastian Vettel in Timo Glock's path during their first pit stops under the safety car; however, the stewards rejected Toyota's plea.\nIn the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton's third place moved him seven points clear of Felipe Massa on 84 points. With both Ferrari drivers failing to score, McLaren took over the lead in the Constructors' Championship on 135 points. Fernando Alonso's victory meant that Renault overtook Toyota for fourth place in the constructors standings.\nReactions.\nThe international media and many of those directly involved in Formula One praised the staging of the SingTel Singapore Grand Prix highly. Fears which were previously expressed about the weather, visibility, and narrow nature of the circuit itself all proved unfounded. Organisation of the event itself was widely deemed to be impeccable as the ushering, transport, and security services all ran like clockwork. The drivers complained about how bumpy the track was, particularly off the racing line, which made overtaking difficult on a street circuit hemmed in by barriers.\nFormula One's then-commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone heralded the Singapore Grand Prix as the \"new jewel in the Formula One sports crown\", a phrase often used to describe the Monaco Grand Prix circuit. He described Singapore as an example to follow and would make people reconsider their opinions of Asia.\nSeveral other prominent Formula One personalities were quoted as saying:\nLocally, Sunday's Formula One night race on the local MediaCorp TV Channel 5 drew more viewers than the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony in the previous month, becoming the highest-rated programme for the year. The average ratings for Sunday's race were 17.8 per cent, or 789,000 viewers, as compared to 17.3 per cent (765,000 viewers) for the opening of the Beijing Games. The world's inaugural Formula One race under floodlights is reported to have been watched by an estimated global TV audience of about 400 million.\nFIA investigation and aftermath.\nDuring the race, Renault F1 driver Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed on lap 15, which at the time he attributed to how difficult the car was to drive on heavy fuel. At the time, his Renault teammate Fernando Alonso was one of four drivers to have pitted for fuel (the other three being the Honda of Rubens Barrichello, and the two Red Bulls of Mark Webber and David Coulthard), hindering all others who have not, thus facilitating Fernando Alonso's victory at the end of the race. After Piquet, Jr. left Renault in August 2009, allegations surfaced that this crash had been deliberate, to give an advantage to Alonso. Following a Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) investigation in which Piquet, Jr. stated he had been ordered by Renault team principal Flavio Briatore and engineer Pat Symonds to stage the crash, on 4 September 2009 Renault were charged with conspiracy and race fixing, and were due to face the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September 2009. Initially, Renault and Briatore stated they would take legal action against Piquet, Jr. for making false allegations; before the 21 September meeting, Renault announced they would not contest the charges and that Briatore and Symonds had left the team."

Using slips is valid but risky with uppercuts since the punch is usually too close when the defender can determine the exact line of the punch.

        "text": "The Pakistan national cricket team toured India in November 2007 and played five ODIs and three Test matches between 6 November and 12 December. India won the ODI series by a 3–2 margin, while the Test series was won by a 1–0 margin.\nBackground.\nThe tour schedule was released in mid June 2007. It was announced that the Pakistan squad would arrive on 2 November and would play five ODIs followed by three Tests, the tour that would follow Australia's India tour for seven ODIs. In mid October 2007, the first three ODIs were rescheduled in that it was announced that they would be played a day each in advance, in order to accommodate the third ODI on a Sunday.\nThis was the fourth tour combined between the two countries in as many years. Pakistan came to India on the back of a superior record against the Indian side in both Tests and ODIs. In Tests they had a 12–8 record in their favour, while in ODIs from 1978 till the start of this series, they had won 62 per cent of the games, with the figure dropping to 57 after 2000. India also had a poor home record in ODIs against Pakistan having won six matches and lost 15 leading up to the series.\nIssam Ahmed of \"the Telegraph\" felt that on the backdrop of the declaration of emergency in Pakistan and the Pakistan team's \"disappointing\" performance at home against South Africa, \"enthusiasm on the street seems pretty hard to come by\". The same state was echoed in India by \"The Hindu\" which dubbed this Pakistan team the \"weakest ... to tour India\" while adding that despite the \"number of young players with proven ability [it] lacks names that inspire awe\". It also attributed this to \"playing each other every year, due to which the novelty of watching the two neighbours slug it out has waned\" and that the \"intensity ... has ... reduced\". However, Pakistan's coach Geoff Lawson called the series \"bigger than the Ashes\".\nSquads.\nA 16-member Pakistan ODI squad was named on 26 October 2007. Shoaib Akhtar who had served a ban that followed an altercation with a teammate was included in the side. From the team that played South Africa at home, Mohammad Hafeez and Khalid Latif were dropped. Younus Khan was appointed as their vice-captain. Mohammad Asif was ruled out initially for the first three ODIs, and later the subsequent ODIs and the Test series due to an elbow injury, before being replaced by Mohammad Sami leading into the Test series. India announced their squad for the first two ODIs 27 October. Rahul Dravid and Dinesh Karthik were dropped following inconsistent performances in the preceding series and were replaced by Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, with Praveen Kumar as the only new inclusion in the squad. An unchanged side announced for the next two ODIs.\nBowler Anil Kumble was named India's Test captain for the series. A 14-member squad was announced on 14 November for the first two Tests; Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and Irfan Pathan made way for spinners Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik. After S. Sreesanth and R. P. Singh were ruled out of the First Test owing to shoulder injury and an oblique abdominal strain respectively, Ishant Sharma and Munaf Patel, the latter recovering from injury himself, were drafted into the squad. After they lost Zaheer Khan to injury after the Second Test, India called in Irfan Pathan and V. R. V. Singh to their side for the Third. Pakistan named the same side for the Test series that played the ODIs. After Umar Gul was returned home following an injury sustained in the First Test, all-rounder Yasir Arafat was named as his replacement. Captain Shoaib Malik was ruled out of the Third Test upon failing a fitness test following an injury he suffered in the First Test. Subsequently, Younus Khan was asked to lead the side.\nTour match.\nAfter putting in Delhi to bat first in a pitch that assisted swing, Pakistan picked quick wickets reducing the hosts to 46/4. A 91-run stand between Shikhar Dhawan and Rajat Bhatia then followed before a lower order collapse took Delhi's score to 213 after 50 overs. In reply, Imran Nazir slammed 34 from 22 balls before he was removed by Amit Bhandari. Salman Butt and Misbah-ul-Haq (39) then put together a 116-run stand, with the former retiring hurt after brisk 83 off 84 balls. Subsequently, Yasir Hameed took the team home while remaining unbeaten on 33.\nBroadcast.\nIndia's public service broadcaster Prasar Bharati bought the broadcasting rights of the entire series, both ODIs and Tests, in Doordarshan for 81.25 crore. It also bought rights for radio commentary for 10,000 for each ODI and Test."

        "title": "Boxing News",
        "text": "Boxing News is a British weekly boxing magazine published by Kelsey Media. It is the oldest boxing magazine still in publication, dating back to 1909.\nHistory.\n\"Boxing News\" was founded in 1909 by its founding editor John Murray. By then the publication was simply titled \"Boxing\". Murray had also been a regular contributor to \"Health &amp; Strength\" magazine and convinced its owner, Bill Berry (later Lord Camrose) to launch a weekly magazine dedicated solely to boxing. It is believed that Murray had been inspired by Jack Johnson beating Tommy Burns to become the first black World heavyweight champion. In his first editorial, Murray stated; \"Boxing will stand for good clean sport. Its success or failure is in the hands of those who believe in the characteristics of this sport. Our energies will be devoted to giving the best paper that time, thought and money can devise.\" When circulation began to decline in the late 1920s, the name of the magazine was changed to \"Boxing, Racing and Football\".\nIn October 1931, the paper was sold to a syndicate of London sportsmen, who installed Sydney Rushton, a long-time London fight reporter, as the new editor. The layout changed, the page size was increased and Rushton proved less popular than Murray. The paper was again put up for sale and, while waiting for a buyer, the old features were reinstated and there was no official Editor.\nAnother set of sportsmen bought the paper and Godfrey Williams was named editor. He attempted to run Boxing as a newspaper, cutting popular features and reducing news stories down to the shortest possible length. The circulation quickly dropped to its lowest ever.\nBilly Masters, a city printer and huge boxing fan, saved the paper, appointing W.H. Miller as the new editor. He reinvigorated the magazine, and its popularity was boosted due to its first colour cover.\nIn 1935, Millier departed and the owner replaced him with Sydney Ackland, who had previously worked as John Murray's assistant editor and had been taught by him. World War II brought many changes as first Sydney, then replacement Stanley Nelson, contributed to the war effort. Murray then was reinstated as editor but ill health forced him to step down in 1941. Gilbert Odd took over until the building housing the paper was renovated. Odd was then called up for national service and both Masters and Murray served further terms. Now with the new name of Boxing News, the paper was bought by Australian publicist Vivian Brodzky and former promoter Sydney Hulls. Northern sports writer Bert Callis was the new editor. Odd took over for a second term upon Callis’ retirement. Odd implemented the tradition of reporting the results and fighters' weights for every single fight in the country. When Odd quit to write books, he was succeeded by Jack Wilson and then Tim Riley. When Brodzky died, Boxing News was sold twice in quick succession, and Graham Houston became editor in 1971, immediately broadening the range of coverage, especially in North America. Houston left in 1977 to work on morning newspapers in Canada. This prompted the appointment of Harry Mullan, thought to be one of the better editors. Circulation increased exponentially during the Mullan years, which doubled at a time of great change in the boxing world. Most notable new developments were the proliferation of ‘world’ titles and the increase in the number of major British promoters. Mullan was fiercely principled and well respected in the boxing fraternity. When Mullan left in October 1996, he was given a glowing tribute from then-BN publisher Peter Kravitz: \"His writing stands comparison with the Lieblings, Hausers and Mailers of this century of boxing.\"\nAssistant Editor Claude Abrams succeeded Mullan in November 1996. Boxing News was redesigned and switched to a full-colour format and become more extensive in content. In March 1999 the paper went to A3 size before reverting to A4, and increasing in size to 48 pages (from 24) in September 2005. The magazine remained the main trade paper in Britain. Abrams left Boxing News – after 22 years – in December 2009, just three months after the publication celebrated its centenary, and was succeeded as editor by Tris Dixon.\nDixon left the magazine in December 2014, with Matt Christie taking over as editor.\nThe magazine announced in 2021 that it would only recognize world champions as voted by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board."

        "title": "PDC World Championship Darts 2008",
        "text": "PDC World Championship Darts 2008 is a sports video game, published by Oxygen Interactive and developed and designed by Mere Mortals. It was released for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 PC, Wii, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation Portable. The game features sixteen professionals from the Professional Darts Corporation, and seven tournaments from the PDC circuit. It is a direct sequel to the previous year's \"PDC World Championship Darts\".\nThe game was localized for and released in North America on June 16, 2009, on the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable with the year 2008 dropped from its title. A Nintendo DS version was planned, but cancelled, although the DS version of the Nintendo-exclusive sequel, \"PDC World Championship Darts 2009\", was released as a port of the abovementioned North American localization at the same time it was released.\nGameplay.\nMuch like its predecessor, the game attempts to recreate playing real darts through the functions of the controller and rules set within the game. A variety of new and returning modes are also available for play.\nRules.\nThe game almost exactly follows the rules of the classic 501 darts game. Two professionals (one or two controlled by the player) throw darts onto the dartboard to decrease their score to 0, but they must end with a double. The only exception is the World Grand Prix where players must also start with a double. The dartboard's numbers are positioned just as they are in real darts.\nEach player throws three darts before the next player's turn. In standard rules, whoever reaches 0 first has won the leg. Varying amounts of legs comprise sets, a certain amount of which must be gained to win the match. An alternative format is matchplay, where certain amounts of legs must be gained to win the match.\nControls.\nThrowing darts is implemented as a three-step procedure across all platforms. The first step is for the player to decide the general area of where they want to throw, determined using a set of keyboard keys, the Wii Remote pointer or an analog stick, depending on platform and control option. The second step is to determine how strongly the dart is to be thrown towards the chosen aiming area. The throwing power oscillates automatically on the Wii version as long as a \"lock-on\" button is held, while other platforms determine it manually based on how far the other analog stick is pulled or how long a key is held down. In 'Amateur' mode the power can be seen with a blue that fills a power meter; in 'Professional' mode this aid is not present and the power can be seen via the movement of the character's arm. A new difficulty added is 'Master' mode where extra precision is required.\nOnce the desired amount of power is reached, the player then completes the throwing procedure in a third and final step by actually making the throwing motion. The Wii version implements this with an actual thrusting motion of the Wii Remote and the PC version assigns this move to another key to press. Other platforms implement the throwing action by quickly flicking the right analog stick forward just after it was pulled backward. Any deviation to the left or right while throwing the dart will also affect the dart's flight. The game also takes into account real-life darts physics, such as under- or over-stacking of darts, flights falling out, and bounce-outs. The former can be used to tactical advantage. These were not present in the first game.\nThe Wii version also utilizes an alternate control scheme that uses the Nunchuk's analog stick to adjust power and throw the dart, like most other platforms.\nModes.\nThere are numerous modes of play within the game. Aside from a simple Exhibition between one or two players, a single player can also create a custom character and begin a career to become the world's best dart player. Another mode allows any of the tournaments in career mode to be played individually. Or, the player can create a custom tournament with their own preferred format and play that individually or with others. Party Games mode is also available, allowing players to play games such as Around The Clock and Killer in an environment without a crowd.\nProfessionals.\nSixteen professionals were included in the game. This was six more than in the previous game, with them joining the original ten. The in-game players are below (listed along with their main career achievements):\nSpecial features.\nPDC Pro animations (throw styles and walk ons) have been motion-captured and are fully integrated.\nAll new graphic enhancements – player improvements and real-world sets and tournament locations, based on the locations from the PDC calendar.\nEnhanced audio including calling, commentary, convincing dynamic crowd sounds, and darts atmospherics.\nEnhanced A.I – player A.I. is calculated using real life averages from major tournaments and also based on actual playing characteristics i.e. stamina, belief, pressure, complacency and accuracy.\nImproved and in-depth career mode, realistically reflecting a player's progress through the PDC calendar, featuring 7 of the major PDC tournaments each season.\nAll new character editor, supplying a greater range of options to customise players' pros. Elements include male and female character models, skin tone, eye colour, nationality, name, hairstyle, hair colour, eyewear, shirt style and colour, throwing angle, level of difficulty and preferred checkout. Also includes options for dart barrel weights and flight designs."

        "title": "2008 World Series",
        "text": "The 2008 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2008 season. The 104th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies and the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays; the Phillies won the series, four games to one. The 2008 World Series is notable because it is the only World Series to involve a mid-game postponement and resumption (two days later).\nThe Series began on Wednesday, October 22, and concluded (after weather delays had postponed the end of Game 5) the following Wednesday, October 29. The AL's 4–3 win in the 2008 All-Star Game gave the Rays home field advantage for the series, meaning no more than three games would be played at Citizens Bank Park (the Phillies' home ballpark). The Phillies won their second championship in their 126-year history to bring the city of Philadelphia its first championship in 25 years (since the 1983 NBA Finals). This was the first postseason series lost by an MLB team based in the state of Florida; previously, the Rays and Florida Marlins were 8–0 in postseason series. Additionally, both the Phillies' World Series wins have come against a team making their World Series debut (in 1980, they beat the Kansas City Royals).\nThe Phillies advanced to the World Series after defeating the Milwaukee Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL's Divisional Series and Championship Series, respectively. The team won its position in the playoffs after its second consecutive NL East division title. This was the Phillies' first World Series appearance in fifteen years. The Tampa Bay Rays advanced to the World Series after defeating the Chicago White Sox and the Boston Red Sox, the 2007 World Series champion, in the AL's Division Series and 2008 American League Championship Series.\nGames 1 and 2 at Tropicana Field were the first World Series games played on artificial turf since the 1993 World Series matched two teams, the Toronto Blue Jays and Phillies, which each played their home games on artificial turf at the time. However, 2008 is the first World Series ever played on second generation artificial turf. Ironically the Phillies were in both Series but no longer use artificial turf since the end of 2003.\nTeams.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nPhiladelphia opened the season by posting a winning record in the opening month of April. The team scored 60 runs over a five-game span in late May and went 14–4 into the beginning of June. The team lost 9 of 11 games to end June, but came out of the All-Star break with a 9–6 record following the midseason hiatus. The Phillies posted the best road record in the National League, at 44–37. Philadelphia traded sweeps with the Los Angeles Dodgers in August and went 13–3 in their last 16 games, to win the National League East title for the second consecutive season. The second-seeded Phillies defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the Division Series, 3–1, and the Dodgers in the Championship Series, 4–1, to book their place in the 2008 Fall Classic. This was the Phillies' first World Series appearance in fifteen years.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays also began the season (their first after dropping the \"Devil\" from their name) with a winning record in the opening month of April. The Rays became the first team since 1903 to have the league's best record on Memorial Day (the last Monday in May) after finishing in last place the previous season. The team went 16–10 in June, but lost seven consecutive games leading up to the All-Star break. In August, the Rays lost seven games to finish out the month with an overall record of 84–51. The team concluded the season, albeit with a 13–14 record in September, by winning the American League East title for the first time in franchise history. As the Devil Rays, they had never finished with a winning record, nor finished higher than fourth in their division. The second-seeded Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 3–1 in the American League Division Series. In the American League Championship Series, Tampa Bay defeated the Boston Red Sox in 4–3, to advance to their first World Series in franchise history. The Rays became the third MLB team in the post-1969 \"Divisional Era\" to make the World Series in their first trip to the playoffs, joining the 1969 New York Mets and the 1997 Florida Marlins.\nSummary.\n† - Game suspended in the sixth inning due to rain.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe national anthem was performed by Backstreet Boys. The Philadelphia Phillies scored the first runs of the Series when Chase Utley hit a home run with Jayson Werth on base in the top of the first inning. The Phillies loaded the bases in the second inning, but were unable to score when Shane Victorino was thrown out at home plate by B. J. Upton. The Tampa Bay Rays loaded the bases in the bottom of the third inning; however, Upton grounded into an inning-ending double play and the score remained 2–0. The Phillies extended their lead when Carlos Ruiz batted in Victorino in the fourth inning. In the bottom of the inning, a home run from Carl Crawford pulled the Rays within two runs. The Rays added their second run the following inning when a double by Akinori Iwamura scored Jason Bartlett. Tampa Bay starting pitcher Scott Kazmir was removed after six innings; J. P. Howell and Grant Balfour combined to shut out the Phillies for  innings. Ryan Madson relieved Phillies' starter Cole Hamels in the eighth inning, pitching a single perfect inning. In the top of the ninth inning, two Phillies' runners reached base. Tampa Bay's Trever Miller was brought on and threw four pitches—striking out Ryan Howard—before he was relieved. Philadelphia stranded two runners, on second and third base, and entered the bottom of the ninth inning ahead by one run. Philadelphia's Brad Lidge struck out the first two batters he faced and retired the third batter to get the save.\nGame 2.\nThe national anthem was performed by Los Lonely Boys. Tampa Bay scored the first runs of the game in the first inning when Akinori Iwamura and B. J. Upton scored on consecutive ground outs by Carlos Peña and Evan Longoria respectively. The following inning Upton singled, scoring Dioner Navarro. Rocco Baldelli attempted to score from second base, but was thrown out by right fielder Jayson Werth, keeping the Rays lead at 3–0. Cliff Floyd extended the Rays lead to four runs after leading off the bottom of the fourth inning with a single, advancing to third base, and scoring on a Jason Bartlett sacrifice bunt. Rays starter James Shields shut out the Phillies through  innings to earn the win, before being relieved by Dan Wheeler who pitched an additional scoreless inning. Philles starter Brett Myers lasted seven innings, giving up four runs (three earned) and took the loss. Eric Bruntlett hit a home run in the top of the eighth inning to bring the score to 4–1. The Phillies added a second run in the top of the ninth inning against David Price, but were unable to score any more runs; Tampa Bay's win tied the Series at one game apiece.\nGame 3.\nSteve Carlton threw out the Ceremonial First pitch while Taylor Swift sang the national anthem. The third game of the Series was delayed for an hour and 31 minutes because of rain. Country music star Tim McGraw, son of Phillies reliever Tug McGraw, spread his father's ashes on the pitching mound of Citizens Bank Park, prior to the game's start. The Phillies scored in the bottom of the first inning after Jimmy Rollins led off with a single and eventually scored when Chase Utley grounded out. In the next half inning, Tampa Bay's Carl Crawford doubled, stole third base and scored on a Gabe Gross sacrifice fly to center field. Carlos Ruiz gave the Phillies their second lead of the night when he hit a home run in the bottom of the second inning. Starting pitchers Matt Garza and Jamie Moyer pitched six and innings respectively. The 2–1 score remained unchanged until the sixth inning when Chase Utley and Ryan Howard hit the 14th back-to-back home runs in World Series history. Crawford scored his second run of the game in the top of the seventh inning when he was batted in by Gross again. Dioner Navarro continued the rally by scoring on a Jason Bartlett ground out—bringing the score to 4–3. In the top of the eighth inning, B.J. Upton led off with a single, stole second and third, and scored on a throwing error by catcher Carlos Ruiz to tie the game. Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch by J.P. Howell leading off the bottom of the ninth, moved to second on a wild pitch and to third on a throwing error. Tampa Bay intentionally walked the next two batters, Shane Victorino and pinch hitter Greg Dobbs to load the bases, creating a force play at the plate. They then brought the infield in (including right fielder Ben Zobrist who was brought in to be a fifth infielder) and replaced Howell with Grant Balfour hoping to convert any groundball into a force out at home and preventing the game winning run. However, Bruntlett scored the winning run on Ruiz's 45-foot infield single. The infield single was fielded by third baseman Evan Longoria who threw desperately to the plate in an attempt to save a run. However, any hope of an out vanished as the throw missed Navarro and Bruntlett scored (it would not be counted as an error). Ruiz's walk-off infield single was the first walk-off infield single in World Series history, giving the Phillies a 2–1 lead in the series.\nPhillies reliever J. C. Romero earned the win and Howell took the loss.\nGame 4.\nRobin Roberts threw out the Ceremonial First pitch while Patti LaBelle sang the national anthem. Philadelphia took a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first inning, as Jimmy Rollins led off with a double and scored when Pat Burrell later walked with the bases loaded. The Phillies doubled their lead in the third inning when Chase Utley reached base on a fielding error and scored on Pedro Feliz's single. The Rays scored their first run when Carl Crawford hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth inning. Ryan Howard's three-run home run in the bottom of the inning brought the score to 5–1. Tampa Bay's Eric Hinske hit a pinch-hit home run to bring the Rays within three runs, but Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton responded with a home run of his own to re-extend the lead to four; it was the first time a pitcher hit a home run in the World Series since Ken Holtzman in game 4 of the 1974 World Series. Blanton pitched six innings, giving up two runs on four hits to acquire his first win of the Series. Jayson Werth hit a two-run home run in the eighth inning—the Phillies' third of the game—to bring the score to 8–2. Later in the inning, Ryan Howard's second home run, and fifth RBI, increased the Phillies' lead to eight runs. Philadelphia's four relief pitchers combined for three shutout innings, giving up one hit. Due to the late completion of the previous game, Games 3 and 4 each ended on the same calendar day.\nGame 5.\nThe national anthem was sung by John Oates. Philadelphia scored in the first inning for the third consecutive game, taking a 2–0 lead when Shane Victorino batted in Jayson Werth and Chase Utley. Tampa Bay cut the lead in half in the fourth inning; Carlos Peña doubled and was batted in on Evan Longoria's single, both players' first hits of the Series. The Rays then tied the game in the sixth inning when B. J. Upton scored from second base on a Peña single.\nThe game was suspended after the top of the sixth inning because of rain, making it the first game in World Series history not to be played through to completion or declared a tie. Phillies starter Cole Hamels, making his fifth start, had pitched six innings when the umpires suspended play. The Phillies pinch hit for Hamels in the bottom of the sixth inning. By retaking the lead in that half-inning, the Phillies put Hamels in line for the victory, which would have been his fifth win in the postseason, tying an MLB record. However, when Tampa Bay again tied the game in the seventh, Hamels was left with a no decision.\nAfter the game was suspended, umpiring crew chief Tim Tschida told reporters that he and his crew ordered the players off the field because the wind and rain threatened to make the game \"comical.\" Chase Utley agreed, saying that by the middle of the sixth inning, \"the infield was basically under water.\" Rain continued to fall in Philadelphia on Tuesday, further postponing the game to Wednesday, October 29.\nThe game resumed with the Phillies batting in the bottom of the sixth inning. Pinch hitter Geoff Jenkins led off with a double and was bunted to third by Rollins. Jayson Werth then batted in Jenkins to take the lead for the Phillies, 3–2. In the top of the seventh inning, Rocco Baldelli re-tied the game at three runs with a solo home run. Later in the inning, Utley faked a throw to first, then threw Bartlett out at home for the third out in a play later described as having saved the Series for the Phillies. In the bottom of the seventh, Pat Burrell led off with a double for his only hit of the series off pitcher J. P. Howell. Eric Bruntlett, pinch-running for Burrell, scored on a single by Pedro Feliz to put the Phillies up by a run again, 4–3. This gave Howell his second relief loss. In the top of the ninth, Brad Lidge gave up a single to Dioner Navarro and a stolen base to pinch runner Fernando Perez, but was able to strike out Eric Hinske to secure the World Series for the Phillies. Phillies reliever J. C. Romero got his second win of the Series.\nThe Phillies won the Series despite committing at least one error in each game. This game also marked only the second time in MLB history that first-inning runs were scored in each of the first five games played in a World Series (it had previously occurred in 2003).\nImplications of the suspension.\nUnder normal conditions, games are considered to be official games after five innings, or four and a half if the home team is leading at that point. However, postseason games are operated by the Commissioner's Office, thus are subject to the Commissioner's discretion of how to handle the scheduling of the games. So, with rain in the forecast for Philadelphia, Commissioner Bud Selig informed both the Rays and the Phillies management before the game began that a team would not be allowed to clinch the Series in a rain-shortened game.\nBecause of the rainfall, Game 5 was suspended after the top of the sixth inning. Rain continued to fall in Philadelphia on Tuesday, October 28, and the game ultimately resumed on Wednesday, October 29, at Citizens Bank Park. Official MLB records and statistics for a suspended game reflect the start date of the contest; October 27 for this game.\nThis was the first game in World Series history to be suspended. There had been three tied games in the history of the World Series: 1907, 1912, and 1922, all of them called due to darkness. In general, no ties would be needed under modern rules, which provide for suspension of a tied game and resumption of it at the next possible date. Weather has caused numerous delays and postponements in Series history (notable postponements beforehand coming in 1911, 1962, 1975, 1986, 1996 and 2006), but never any suspended games before 2008. Although not officially a suspended game, the longest postponement for a World Series was during the 1989 edition in which the start of Game 3 was delayed 10 days, due to the Loma Prieta earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area.\nSeveral Nevada sports betting agencies treated the suspended game as a completed game and a win for the Phillies on Monday, October 27. Under Nevada house rules, the final score of a baseball game is determined by reverting to the last completed full inning, and the Phillies led 2–1 at the end of the fifth inning. Game 5 side bets on Philadelphia were paid off while bets on totals and run-line bets were refunded.\nDuring the following offseason, Selig's interpretation of the rules became codified, as the 30 MLB club owners approved a rule change stipulating that all \"postseason games and games added to the regular season to determine qualifiers for the postseason\" become suspended games if they are called before nine innings are played, regardless of whether the game would otherwise qualify as an official game, or the score at the time the game is called. The game is resumed when conditions permit at the same location from the point of suspension. The first usage of that policy occurred during Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS, which was suspended after two innings because of rain and was resumed the following day.\nComposite line score.\n2008 World Series (4–1): Philadelphia Phillies (NL) beat Tampa Bay Rays (AL).\nWeather conditions.\nGames 3 and 5 of the World Series were delayed by rain storms in Philadelphia, with the start of Game 3 on Saturday, October 25 being delayed an hour and 31 minutes (with that game ending at 1:47 am EDT on Sunday, October 26). Game 5, which began on Monday, October 27, was suspended after the top of the 6th inning and resumed Wednesday, October 29. Wet weather which affected Game 5 continued into Tuesday in the Philadelphia area, as Major League Baseball officials studied radar data to determine when Game 5 of the World Series would continue under conditions deemed \"appropriate.\" Up to this point, there had never been a rain-shortened game in Series history, and this was the first suspension. As a result, had it been necessary to play them, Games 6 and 7 in St. Petersburg, originally scheduled for October 29 and 30, were postponed until a later date.\nWith temperatures plummeting towards and with a cold rain falling at Citizens Bank Park, some of the Phillies and Rays players opted for an Elmer Fudd look, wearing specially made caps with built-in ear flaps. The caps, manufactured by New Era, were introduced during this year's spring training but were not used on the field until Game 5. New Era also supplied regular ball caps to both teams, which some players continued to wear despite the cold weather.\nBroadcasting.\nThe games were televised on Fox in the United States with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver (himself a former Phillies broadcaster) as booth announcers and Chris Myers and Ken Rosenthal as field reporters. Jeanne Zelasko hosted the pre-game and post-game show with Kevin Kennedy and Mark Grace (Games 1, 2) or Eric Karros (Games 3, 4, 5). Fox Sports en Español did the simulcast of the Series in Spanish-language with Ángel Torres, Miguel Morales and Cos Villa behind the microphones. Fox's broadcasts were also streamed online at MLB.com.\nOn radio, the Series was broadcast nationally by ESPN Radio with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan announcing, and a Spanish broadcast on ESPN Deportes Radio. Locally, Dave Wills, Andy Freed, Dewayne Staats and Joe Magrane called the Series in English for the Rays on WHNZ-AM in Tampa, with Ricardo Tavaras and Enrique Oliu working the Spanish broadcast on St. Petersburg's WGES-AM. Harry Kalas, Scott Franzke, Larry Andersen, and Chris Wheeler called the Phillies' English broadcasts on WPHT-AM in Philadelphia, with Spanish announcers Danny Martinez, Bill Kulik and Juan Ramos on WUBA. Following their contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts. MLB.com also carried the local radio broadcasts for online streaming, while XM Satellite Radio aired the local and national feeds to its subscribers. For Harry Kalas, this series brought together a father and son calling the series for different teams; his son Todd worked as a pregame announcer for the Rays, and joined his father in the WPHT booth for an inning of Game 1.\nFor international viewers, MLB International televised the game with commentators Rick Sutcliffe and Dave O'Brien. This feed was also carried to U.S. service personnel stationed around the globe via the American Forces Network.\nThis World Series win had significance for McCarver and Harry Kalas. Both had been Phillies broadcasters in , but neither had gotten to call that year's World Series. McCarver was a backup commentator for \"Game of the Week\" on NBC, but he was not part of the network's Series announcing team. For Kalas, MLB radio-broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the Commissioner's Office, demanding a change to the rule. The following year, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers, due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans. In 2008, both called the Phillies' World Series win.\nRatings.\nIn both Nielsen ratings and total viewership, the 2008 edition of the Fall Classic set record lows for a televised World Series. The 8.4 average Nielsen rating sank below the 10.1 record set two years earlier in 2006. 2008 bears the distinction of being the first World Series to draw lower than a 10.0. Game three's 6.1 rating also set a record, since surpassed, for the lowest rated individual game.\nThe low numbers may have been affected by factors beyond MLB's control. Game 3 was delayed one hour thirty-one minutes for weather and, consequently, ended at 1:47 am ET. Game 5 was also suspended after 5.5 innings and resumed two days later. These factors likely brought the ratings down.\nIn recent years, several World Series have surpassed 2008's ratings lows, forming a long-term trend of declining World Series ratings. The 2010 World Series also generated an 8.4, before the 2012 World Series set a fresh record low with 7.6 (though this was a sweep, which usually draws lower ratings). The 2014 World Series, 2018 World Series, and 2019 World Series finished with 8.2, 8.3, and 8.1 Nielsen averages respectively, all lower than 2008. The 2020 World Series, coming after a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, set the new record for lowest World Series ratings with a 5.2. The 2021 World Series received a 6.5 to hold the current spot for 2nd lowest ratings, with 2008's 8.4 now tied with 2010 for 7th lowest.\nIn total viewership, 2008 is now the fourth least watched World Series, with 2021, 2020, and 2012 all posting lower viewership numbers.\nUmpiring.\nIn Game 2, home plate umpire Kerwin Danley appealed a call to the first base umpire after calling strike three; the first base umpire called ball four to award the Rays' Rocco Baldelli a walk. Baldelli indicated that the calls did not come up in the locker room, and he did not believe they had an effect on the results.\nIn Game 3, Phillies' pitcher Jamie Moyer threw the ball to Ryan Howard to force out the Rays' Carl Crawford at first base, despite umpire Tom Hallion calling Crawford safe in the game. In Game 4, Evan Longoria tagged Rollins at third base, though umpire Tim Welke had ruled Rollins safe. The league admitted these errors between Games 4 and 5.\nImpact and aftermath.\nPhillies.\nThe Phillies' second World Series championship brought about a series of firsts, not just for them, but for Philadelphia. In winning their first championship since , the Phillies brought the city of Philadelphia its first major professional sports championship since the 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals, breaking the alleged Curse of Billy Penn.\nIn summing up the firsts and given how long the city's sports fans have waited, Phillies President David Montgomery said that \"our first name is Philadelphia\", and he and manager Charlie Manuel dedicated the championship to the city of Philadelphia and the fans. Manuel also dedicated the championship to his mother, who died on the day of Game 2 of the NLCS. Phil Sheridan of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" said that the 25 years without a championship \"helped define this city as a sports town for way too long. It was long enough to turn passion too often to anger. Maybe this championship will turn the vinegar back into wine,\" and said that the fans \"waited forever and a day.\"\nOn Halloween, October 31, approximately two million fans lined Broad Street for a ticker-tape parade, making it the largest gathering for a championship parade in Philadelphia since the Flyers won the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals. This parade had significance for Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer and Phillies broadcaster Harry Kalas, as they both were at the 1980 parade. Moyer grew up in the Philadelphia area as a Phillies fan and whose childhood hero was Steve Carlton, a member of the 1980 team, and whom he won against in his first Major League start. He was at both of the Phillies' World Series parades, skipping school to attend in 1980, and as a pitcher in 2008. Kalas was at both parades, as a broadcaster for the Phillies. When comparing the parade to the one in 1980, he told WCAU-TV that \"this is bigger...the biggest I've ever seen.\"\nIn 2010, Philadelphia sports fans picked both of the Phillies' World Series wins as the two greatest moments in Philadelphia sports, picking the 2008 championship as the greatest moment.\nThe Phillies returned to the World Series in , the first defending champion to return to the Series since the 2001 New York Yankees. During that season they finished first in the National League East with a 93–69 mark, and eliminated the Rockies and the Dodgers in the NL playoffs. They would lose to the Yankees in six games.\nSubsequent regular season meetings between the Rays and the Phillies would be relatively uncommon. The Rays only visited Philadelphia twice within the next seven years (in 2012 and 2015).\nThis would be the last professional sports championship for the city of Philadelphia until the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41–33 in Super Bowl LII in 2018.\nRays.\nFor the Rays, at the same time the ticker-tape parade went down Broad Street in Philadelphia, thousands of Rays' fans attended a rally at Straub Park in St. Petersburg, celebrating their 2008 season.\nMayor Rick Baker said that the rally \"really needed to be done. There was so much demand in the community. They didn't win the World Series but they won the AL. And we want to celebrate that and thank them.\" He and Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio addressed the fans during the rally.\nThough the Rays missed the playoffs in 2009, they earned a winning record of 84–78, placing them third behind the Red Sox and eventual champion Yankees. From 2010-2013, the Rays won at least 90 games each season, a remarkable feat for a team with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. The 2008 Rays were covered in depth in the book \"The Extra 2%: How Wall Street Strategies Took a Major League Baseball Team from Worst to First\" by Jonah Keri.\nThe Rays returned to the World Series in , but lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nSeveral Rays players from 2008 later won a World Series with other teams. Jonny Gomes, who was not on the Rays' postseason roster, played on the Boston Red Sox's championship team. David Price won a World Series ring in with the Red Sox, but opted out of playing during the Dodgers' 2020 championship run due to COVID-19 concerns. Edwin Jackson won a ring in with the St. Louis Cardinals, and Ben Zobrist won two World Series in and as a key member of the Kansas City Royals and Chicago Cubs (where he won World Series MVP) respectively. Rays manager Joe Maddon was also the manager of the 2016 Cubs, while the architect of the 2008 team, GM Andrew Friedman, would win a World Series in 2020 with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Evan Longoria was a member of the 2023 Arizona Diamondbacks who lost that year's World Series to the Texas Rangers; Longoria's 15 year gap between World Series appearances is the longest for any position player in MLB history."

        "text": "The East Germany men's national basketball team () was recognised by FIBA as the German Democratic Republic basketball team from 1952 to 1990.\nEast Germany's biggest success during international events came at the EuroBasket 1963 in Wrocław. It was where they earned their highest ranked finish of sixth place.\nHistory.\nAfter the Second World War, two German national basketball teams were in existence. The East Germany national team joined FIBA as members in 1952. They wouldn't enter their first international tournament until the EuroBasket 1959, where they finished 14th.\nAt the EuroBasket 1961 in Belgrade, East Germany finished 12th out of the 19 teams, four spots ahead of West Germany. Overall, the national basketball team of East Germany had its biggest success at the EuroBasket 1963 in Wrocław. After four victories and three losses in the preliminary round, East Germany went as the third seed (behind the tournament winner Soviet Union and silver medalist Poland) in Group B. Since only the first two places advanced to the semi-finals, East Germany played against Belgium and Bulgaria in the classification round. After beating Belgium 81–35, East Germany lost to Bulgaria 62–77. According to many experts, East Germany was one of the biggest surprises of the tournament.\nAt the EuroBasket 1965 in Moscow/Tbilisi, the East German team could not repeat its impressive performance two years earlier. However, it outperformed its West German competitors by four spots and finished 10th out of the 16 teams. East Germany competed in its last EuroBasket in 1967, hosted in Helsinki/Tampere. They eventually finished out the event in 14th place.\nAfter failing at EuroBasket a year prior, East Germany entered qualification for the 1968 Summer Olympics. It was then they defeated West Germany for the second time, though they missed out on qualifying. Despite the lack of popularity of basketball in East Germany, it took the West German national team until 1973 to earn its first victory over the East Germans, who displayed disciplined playing styles. However, even after East Germany exhibited some solid performances at European basketball competitions, the national team never qualified for the World Cup or Summer Olympics.\nIts demise.\nIn 1969, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany decided to shift its focus towards sports that were most likely to win medals, and earn points at international competitions. Since basketball is a team sport, where in contrast to individual sports, the whole team can only win a single Olympic medal; it lost considerable government support. Eventually, the SED and Stasi leader Erich Mielke banned East German basketball players from traveling to non-socialist countries, and immensely limited the sponsorship and promotion of talents. This ultimately led to the end of East Germany's international basketball existence, which ceded completely after 1973, although the federation would continue to be recognised by FIBA as a full member, until reunification in 1990."

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the 29th round of the 1963 American Football League Draft and by the Cleveland Browns in the 17th round of the NFL Draft, but Anderson opted to remain at Penn State as a graduate assistant while earning his master's degree and playing for the semi-pro Newark Bears on the weekends.\nCoaching career.\nAnderson's first full-time coaching job was as an assistant at Lafayette College under future Philadelphia Eagles General Manager Harry Gamble, whom he then followed to the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. He returned to Penn State in 1973 at the invitation of head coach Joe Paterno. In his next 11 seasons as the Nittany Lions' offensive line coach, Anderson established himself as one of college football's best. Five of his players were named All-Americans: John Nessel, Tom Rafferty, Keith Dorney, Bill Dugan, and Sean Farrell; and a steady stream of Nittany Lion linemen went on to the NFL, including Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Munchak.\nIn 1984, he accepted the head coaching job at Rutgers where his six-year on-field record was 27–34–4. His best season was 1984, when the Scarlet Knights finished 7–3. Anderson was relieved of his duties at Rutgers in 1990 and returned to Penn State to resume duties as the team's offensive line coach. In 1993 Anderson moved to quarterbacks coach, following Jim Caldwell's departure to accept the head coaching job at Wake Forest. He returned to coaching the offensive line when Jay Paterno became coach of quarterbacks in 1999. Anderson was not retained after the arrival of new coach Bill O'Brien.\nRelationship with Jerry Sandusky.\nAnderson maintains a close personal relationship with former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. He testified at Sandusky's child sex abuse trial that it was not uncommon for assistant coaches and minors to be in the showers at the same time at the Lasch Football Complex."

        "text": "The 2007 Breeders' Cup World Championships took place on October 26 and 27 at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, the first time the event had been held in New Jersey. The 2007 event included several milestones, with three new races added, a second day added to the program and the introduction of the Breeders' Cup Challenge series. \nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge series was introduced in 2007 as a way to automatically qualify for the Breeders' Cup under a \"win and you're in\" format. In addition to the automatic entry, the goal was to build brand recognition for the Breeders' Cup and horse racing in general throughout the year, in combination with broadcast partner ESPN. \"This is a long race,\" said ESPN programmer Len DeLuca. \"This is a very long race, in terms of making the sport of kings interesting and accessible to the casual fan. But it's the next step in the evolution of horse racing coverage.\" \nThe 2007 series consisted of 24 races held at 6 different racetracks in the United States and Canada. Fourteen of the series winners later raced in the Breeders' Cup, with four of them winning: War Pass in the Juvenile, Ginger Punch in the Distaff, English Channel in the Turf and Curlin in the Classic.\nLead-up.\nThe Breeders' Cup was held at Monmouth Park for the first time in 2007. To accommodate the event, more than $25 million was invested in improving the facilities. The event was expected to generate $57.6 million for the state.\nThe European-contingent was led by Dylan Thomas, who was the top ranked horse in the world after winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. \"He's as good a horse as we've ever had,\" said trainer Aidan O'Brien. \"We think he's a superstar.\" O'Brien also shipped George Washington over to race in the Classic. George Washington had been retired after finishing sixth in the 2006 Classic but proved sub-fertile and returned to racing.\nFriday: New Races.\nIn January, The Breeders' Cup announced the creation of three new $1 million races to be held on Friday, the day before the traditional big day. By rule, the three new races could not be graded until several renewals were completed to evaluate their quality, meaning that these were the first Breeders' Cup Races that were not run under Grade 1 status. (In 1984, an exception was made for the original Breeders' Cup Races to immediately grant them grade 1 status.)\nThe three New races were:\nTV: ESPN2 4-6 PM ET \nThe attendance was 27,803.\nSaturday: Day 2.\nThe following races were run on the next day:\nThe Classic was marred by a fatal injury suffered by George Washington, the 2006 European 3-year-old champion who had returned to training when his stud career was scuttled by fertility problems. He suffered a dislocated fracture of his right front ankle and was euthanized on the track. \nTV:ESPN 12-7 PM"

He played college football at the University of Texas.\nEarly years.\nStephens was a 1956 graduate of Angleton High School. He was named an All-state and All-American at End as a senior. He was an outstanding all-around athlete who also excelled in basketball, baseball, and track.\nHe was widely recruited and committed to play football at the University of Texas which was then coached by Darrell Royal. He began as an end, before being switched to tackle as a sophomore.\nHe was a key contributor to the Longhorn's successes in the late 1950s which included an SWC Championship and appearances in both the Sugar Bowl and Cotton Bowl Classic. In his senior year he was named to the All-Southwest Conference team. He also pitched for the Texas Longhorns baseball team.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nStephens was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round (18th overall) of the 1960 NFL Draft. He played for the Browns in 1960 and 1961. While with the Browns he scored his only NFL touchdown on a 38-yard interception return against the Dallas Cowboys.\nOn July 11, 1962, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams along with a third round pick (#37-John Baker) and sixth round pick (#79-Terry Monaghan), in exchange for quarterback Frank Ryan and running back Tommy Wilson.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nIn 1962, he started at defensive tackle alongside NFL notables Merlin Olson, Lamar Lundy, and Deacon Jones. On September 8, 1963, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a future draft choice,\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn 1963, he played defensive end for the original \"Doomsday Defense\". He became a versatile starter along the four positions in the defensive line through 1966, until he was slowed by a knee injury and was replaced by Willie Townes.\nIn 1965, he made a field goal block to help the Cowboys set up a last minute touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers, winning the game to end a 5-game losing streak, which was key for the Cowboys to reach the 1966 Playoff Bowl.\nWhile he was with the Cowboys, the team made the transition from mediocrity to championship contention. He also played in the 1967 NFL Championship Game (commonly known as the Ice Bowl).\nHe was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the 1967 NFL Expansion Draft, but the Cowboys sent a fourth round draft choice (#103-Dan Sartin), in order to keep him. He was released on September 4, 1968.\nPersonal life.\nStephens married Jane (Olson) Stephens and had 5 children: Mark, Susan, Jeff, Shannon, and Walter. He taught American History and coached football at Magnolia Junior High School in Magnolia, Texas in the 1980s. He worked as a special education teacher for the Lockhart Independent School District in Lockhart, Texas during the 1990s. He was an active supporter of Special Olympics.\nThe Pete Logan character in the 2008 film was based on him. He died on March 28, 1998."

        "title": "Penalty (golf)",
        "text": "In the sport of golf, a penalty or penalty stroke is an additional stroke or strokes added to a player's score for an infraction of the rules. In match play, rather than adding strokes, the usual penalty is loss of the hole except for penalties assessed for relief from a hazard or a lost ball.\nSituations in which a penalty may be assessed include, but are not limited to:\nWhen a penalty is incurred because the ball has been lost or hit into an unplayable area, the player plays a new ball or moves the current one according to the rules governing the situation in which the substitution or placement occurs. This may be from the spot at which they hit the ball into that position (a stroke and distance penalty), a playable point directly in line with the hole and behind its current position, or in some circumstances at a point two club lengths or less and no closer to the hole from which the ball crossed the boundary of the unplayable condition. If the player elects to move an unplayable ball in a sand trap, the ball must remain in the hazard.\nThe penalty stroke assessed is not the stroke made on the new ball; it is counted in addition to any and all swings made at the ball. For instance, hitting a ball into a water hazard, dropping a new ball at the position from which the last one was hit, then hitting the new ball counts as three strokes, not two.\nHowever, under certain circumstances during informal games, especially involving novice players, the penalty stroke is not counted; the player simply drops a ball at the spot of the last hit and plays again. This is an unmitigated violation of several rules of the game which would normally call for disqualification from sanctioned play; however, in a friendly setting, it can help make the game more enjoyable and increase pace of play, as it reduces time spent searching for a ball and limits having to play from extremely disadvantageous lies. When an errant shot is re-played from the same spot, it is called a mulligan and neither the first shot nor the penalty stroke are counted."

He played college football at the College of the Holy Cross as a wide receiver and running back and was drafted by the Dolphins in the eleventh round of the 1972 NFL Draft.\nFootball career.\nJenkins was originally drafted as a wide receiver but switched to running back because of his blocking ability and the Dolphins' depth at wide receiver. Although he was on Miami's undefeated 1972 Super Bowl championship team, he did not get a single rushing attempt that season. He spent most of the season on the taxi squad except for the first three games in which he played solely on special teams before injuring his knee. He was on the Dolphins' roster for the 1973 Dolphins Super Bowl championship season but spent the season on injured reserve due to an injured shoulder.\nJenkins was traded to the New York Giants prior to the start of the 1974 season in exchange for a 14th round draft pick, with which the Dolphins selected defensive back James Lewis. He was released by the Giants in October after playing four games for them. He was then signed by the Bills a few days later. Jenkins made his only NFL pass reception with the Bills in a game against the Houston Oilers on November 10, 1974. The Bills released him after 5 games with them to make room on the roster for defensive back Al Randolph. He was then signed by the New England Patriots and played 4 games for them in 1974. In the final game of the season against the Dolphins, on December 15, Jenkins recovered a fumble to set up a Patriots touchdown, but Miami won the game. The Patriots released Jenkins before the 1975 season. In 1975, Jenkins was in Packers training camp. His reps were limited, and he went to coach Bart Starr to discuss his future. “Coach Starr said, ‘Eddie Jenkins, you’re going to make a great lawyer,’ ” Jenkins said.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his football career ended Jenkins obtained his J.D. degree from Suffolk Law School in 1978, the same law school as 1972 Miami teammate Nick Buoniconti graduated from. He subsequently worked as an attorney, and was a candidate for Suffolk County district attorney in 1990.\nHis son Julian Jenkins played as a defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2006 after being drafted in the 5th round of the 2006 NFL Draft."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on superstations",
        "text": "Several Major League Baseball teams have historically carried their games on superstations, which are broadcast television stations that are distributed on a regional or national basis on cable and satellite television.\nAmerican League.\nBoston Red Sox.\nWSBK-TV (channel 38) in Boston is best known in the market for being the longtime television home of the Boston Red Sox. WSBK became the Red Sox's over-air flagship station in 1975 and continued to carry the team's games for 20 years, until it lost the rights in 1996 to independent station WABU (channel 68, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WBPX-TV). After a seven-year hiatus, WSBK – in partnership with CBS owned-and-operated sister station WBZ-TV (channel 4) – reassumed over-the-air broadcast rights to the Red Sox in 2003, although its telecasts were limited to Friday night games. Most of the team's games were carried by cable and satellite regional sports network New England Sports Network, which aired the Friday night games outside of the Boston designated market area, effectively resulting in WSBK being blacked out in these areas (the Red Sox maintain an 80% ownership interest in NESN). Among the nationally prominent announcers that have called Red Sox games on the station include Dick Stockton and Sean McDonough. WBZ stopped broadcasting the games after the 2004 season; NESN later announced that WSBK would lose over-the-air rights in early 2006, resulting in the team's game telecasts becoming cable-exclusive.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox's game broadcast were originally televised by WGN-TV (channel 9) for 20 seasons from 1948 – the station signed on in April of that year – to 1967. The team's game telecasts moved to then-upstart independent station WFLD (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) – which, like WGN-TV, carried White Sox games on more than occasion – in 1968. WGN-TV regained broadcast rights for the White Sox in 1973, and entered into a contractual agreement with then-competing independent WSNS-TV (channel 44, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station) to have that station carry select games, an arrangement that lasted through the 1980 season. WGN-TV became the exclusive television broadcaster of White Sox games in 1981, before WFLD re-obtained broadcast rights the following year. After an eight-year run on WFLD, the White Sox returned to WGN-TV in 1990 after co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf agreed to long-term deals with the station for both the Sox and his NBA franchise, the Chicago Bulls.\nWGN-TV would enter into a programming arrangement with independent station WCIU-TV (channel 26) in July 1999 for that station to carry select White Sox, Chicago Bulls and Chicago Cubs games within the Chicago market that WGN is under contract to produce and air; the agreement was the result of network affiliation contracts with WGN-TV (first with The WB at the time the WCIU deal was made, and now with The CW) limit the number of programming preemptions allowed each year, as well as due to rights restrictions put in place by the National Basketball Association which limit the number of Bulls telecasts aired on WGN's national superstation feed (now known as WGN America) to only fifteen games per season.\nSimilarly to the Chicago Cubs, White Sox telecasts on WGN America ended in 2014 with the channel's switch to reruns and original programs. The White Sox left WGN-TV after the 2019 season; since 2020, NBC Sports Chicago has aired all White Sox games that are not exclusive to MLB's national broadcasters.\nDetroit Tigers.\nWKBD (channel 50, now a CW owned-and-operated station), which was distributed throughout Michigan as a regional superstation and served as the default Fox affiliate for much of the state until WJBK-TV (channel 2) switched to the network from CBS in December 1994, obtained the broadcast rights to Detroit Tigers baseball games in 1993; the station carried the games from 1994 to 2005. One of the notable Tigers games aired by WKBD was the team's final game played at Tiger Stadium on September 27, 1999.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nLos Angeles independent station KTLA (channel 5) assumed the broadcast television rights to the Los Angeles Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) in 1964 from competing independent KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV); the team was owned by Gene Autry for much of its tenure as the team's local television broadcaster, Autry had acquired KTLA that year through his media company Golden West Broadcasters. The team's broadcast rights remained with KTLA after Golden West's sale of the station to Tribune Broadcasting in 1983. KTLA lost the then-California Angels's broadcast rights in 1995, with the team moving their game telecasts to KCAL-TV for the 1996 season (that station's owner at the time, The Walt Disney Company, held an ownership interest in the Angels that briefly overlapped with KCAL's contract with the team until the station was sold to Young Broadcasting that year as a result of Disney's purchase of ABC, owners of KABC-TV (channel 7)). KCAL-TV televised the Angels games until the 2005 season.\nNew York Yankees.\nNew York City independent station WPIX (channel 11) obtained the broadcast rights to the New York Yankees in 1951, and carried the team's games for 47 years until 1998. It was through its coverage of Yankees baseball games that WPIX, which had also for a time aired games from the New York Giants baseball franchise (which later moved to San Francisco), that WPIX gained perhaps its greatest fame and identity. WPIX lost the broadcast television rights to the Yankees to Fox owned-and-operated station WNYW (channel 5) following the 1998 Major League Baseball season, sharing rights with the Madison Square Garden Network, which became the team's exclusive local broadcaster in 2001.\nIn September 2001, fellow New York superstation WWOR-TV (channel 9, now a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station) began airing several Yankees baseball games that were originally scheduled to air on sister station WNYW. WWOR began carrying Yankees games on a full-time basis in 2005, through a production agreement with the YES Network (WWOR's former parent company, News Corporation (which spun off WWOR, WNYW and the remainder of its U.S. entertainment and broadcasting properties – excluding YES Network – to 21st Century Fox in July 2013), would acquire a majority interest in the regional sports network in 2011). In 2015, after a 17-year absence, the Yankees returned to WPIX through an agreement with YES, similar to the WWOR agreement.\nTexas Rangers.\nDallas/Fort Worth independent station KTVT (channel 11), which began to distribute its signal through C band satellite services and cable systems across the southwestern United States in the late 1970s, obtained the broadcast rights to the Texas Rangers in 1985, after the team spent the previous ten seasons broadcasting their games over WBAP/KXAS-TV (channel 5), the area's NBC station. Edward L. Gaylord, president of the Oklahoma Publishing Company (corporate sister of the station's then-owner, Gaylord Broadcasting Company), had purchased a minority ownership stake in the team around the time that KTVT began airing the Rangers telecasts. KTVT's status as a regional superstation hampered Gaylord's efforts to purchase a controlling interest in the Rangers, as the league's other team owners already had to contend with superstation coverage of the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs and the New York Mets, and had concerns to about a fourth team join them. KTVT relinquished the Rangers television rights in 1995, as a result of the station's forthcoming affiliation with CBS (as part of a deal between Gaylord Broadcasting and CBS that also involved Seattle sister station KSTW (also on channel 11), stemming that network's longtime Dallas affiliate KDFW (channel 4), switching to Fox through New World Communications affiliation agreement with Fox), with the team moving its games to independent station KXTX-TV (channel 39, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station), with KXAS also airing a selected portion of games.\nNational League.\nAtlanta Braves.\nAfter Ted Turner acquired struggling independent station WJRJ-TV (channel 17) in Atlanta in 1970, Turner began developing a sports presence for the station by obtaining the television rights to several of the city's professional sports teams – including the Atlanta Hawks NBA and the Atlanta Flames (now the Calgary Flames) NHL franchises. The first such franchise to join channel 17 occurred in 1972, Turner obtained the local rights to televise games from the city's Major League Baseball franchise, the Atlanta Braves, on what had become WTCG beginning with the 1973 season, moving over to the station from NBC affiliate WSB-TV (channel 2, now an ABC affiliate), which had held television rights to the Braves since the team moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee in 1966 (the radio broadcast rights remained with WSB-TV's sister radio station, WSB (750 AM)). The move surprised Atlanta media observers, especially considering that WTCG lost money ever since Turner took over the station, it was only then just starting to break even and become a competitive outlet. Turner bought the team outright before the 1976 season, mainly as a means to retain rights to the team and to prevent the team from relocating, following dismal attendance during 1974 and 1975 seasons.\nThe Braves games, among other changes to channel 17's schedule, helped improve the station's fortunes as the decade wore on; during the decade, Turner syndicated Braves telecasts to various television stations throughout Georgia and bordering states (mostly network-affiliated stations, as there were few independent stations in the Southeastern United States at the time), extending as far north as Charlotte, North Carolina – where Turner owned another struggling independent WRET-TV (channel 36, now WCNC-TV), which became the market's NBC affiliate in 1978. Games that were syndicated to these stations consisted of Sunday afternoon events and a single prime time game, with games scheduled during the middle of the week airing mainly during the summer months (when the major broadcast networks were airing reruns); most, if not all, of the other MLB teams regionally syndicated their games in their respective areas of the country.\nThe Braves would receive national carriage starting with the 1977 season, as Turner uplinked WTCG's signal via satellite for distribution to cable systems throughout the United States on December 17, 1976, turning it into the first national superstation. WTCG discontinued syndicating the Braves telecasts circa 1978–1979, when the station had received significant cable penetration across the Southern states, making the Braves the first team not to provide live coverage of its games to broadcast television stations outside of its home market. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Braves games on what was now WTBS garnered very high ratings, usually around a 2.0 ratings share or at times, even higher. At the time, the station referred to them as \"America's team\" in a promotional campaign; a likely majority of viewers watching the games resided in the Southeastern U.S. – namely in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee – which were among the first states where cable providers began to carry WTCG/WTBS, as Turner Broadcasting steadily struck carriage agreements with cable and satellite providers throughout the country, and also attracted fans living in rural areas that were not within the market of a Major League Baseball franchise.\nThe games became regionally-exclusive when Turner acquired the rights to a package of regular season games from other Major League Baseball teams and league post-season games (including the Division Series and alternating rights to the League Championship Series with Fox) for WTBS's national TBS feed; these changes were the impetus of Turner's June 2007 decision to separate WTBS from the TBS national feed and convert channel 17 locally into a standalone independent station, as WPCH-TV, on October 1, 2007. After the Meredith Corporation (owners of CBS affiliate WGCL-TV (channel 46)) entered into a local marketing agreement with the Turner Broadcasting System to operate WPCH, production of the Braves telecasts was transferred the latter company's Turner Sports division to regional sports network Fox Sports South. On February 28, 2013, Fox Sports South and SportSouth signed an agreement to acquire the 45-game package held by WPCH, rendering the team's game telecasts cable-exclusive beginning with the 2013 season, ending channel 17's 40-year relationship with the Braves.\nChicago Cubs.\nWGN-TV has had a long association with the Chicago Cubs, whose games have aired on the station since the station signed on in April 1948; the station's corporate parent, the Tribune Company (which operates WGN-TV through its Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary) purchased the National League franchise in 1981, eventually selling the team to businessman Thomas S. Ricketts in 2008. Legendary Chicago sportscaster Jack Brickhouse, the longtime sports director (and later vice president of sports programming) for WGN-TV and sister radio station WGN 720 AM), served as the play-by-play announcer for both the Chicago Cubs and White Sox until 1967, when the White Sox (for whom Brickhouse performed play-by-play duties for home games) ended their first stint on WGN-TV; Brickhouse primarily called Cubs games until his retirement from broadcasting in 1981. Another legendary sports broadcaster, Harry Caray (who served as a fill-in sports anchor on the station's newscasts during the 1970s) served as the lead play-by-play announcer for the White Sox on television and radio from 1971 to 1981, before joining the Cubs with the 1982 season.\nAfter Brickhouse retired, Caray was asked to replace Brickhouse as the Cubs' lead television announcer. Caray (who was known for memorable signature catchphrases during big plays (such as \"Holy Cow!\") and performed his unique rendition of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch of each game from the WGN-TV broadcast booth) further established his place among Chicago's most-beloved personalities over the next 16 years, primarily working with analyst Steve Stone. As WGN-TV gained prominence as a national superstation during the 1980s and 1990s (the station was uplinked to satellite as a superstation in October 1978), Caray's fan base – and that of the Cubs – expanded beyond Chicago and the Midwestern United States.\nOn November 5, 2013, the Cubs exercised an option to opt out of its television contract with WGN-TV following the 2014 season; as part of the move, the team gave the station a 30-day window to make a counteroffer – which, in any instance, would raise the rights fees that the station pays the team from its current annual rate of $20 million – to obtain rights to games starting with the 2015 Major League Baseball season (the opt-out option reduced the duration of an agreement to broadcast Cubs games that regional sports network Comcast SportsNet Chicago does not hold rights to from 2022 to 2019, aligning it with the end of the current term of the cable channel's contract); if WGN-TV opts not to produce a suitable bid or any bid at all, the broadcast rights would be opened up for negotiation with other local broadcast and cable television outlets. However, in January 2014, reports surfaced that the Cubs and WGN-TV discussed an option to allow the station to carry a reduced number of games for the 2015 season onward should the contract be renewed. In December 2014, the Cubs finalized a new broadcast deal with WGN-TV, in which the station will televise 45 games per season, beginning with the 2015 season. However, because of Tribune's decision to shift WGN America's programming strategy to focus on reruns and original programming, Cubs telecasts (along with those of the White Sox and Bulls) no longer air nationally via WGN America. The broadcasts that air on WGN-TV in the Chicago market are available nationally through MLB Extra Innings on DirecTV and other select providers. The Cubs later ended their association with WGN-TV after the 2019 season; since 2020, the Marquee Sports Network has aired all Cubs games that are not exclusive to one of MLB's national broadcasters.\nColorado Rockies.\nKWGN-TV (channel 2, now a CW affiliate) in Denver obtained the over-the-air broadcast rights to the Colorado Rockies in 1993 as an independent station. The then-WB affiliate lost the rights to the team's broadcasts after the 2002 season, with the games moving to UPN affiliate KTVD (channel 20, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) in 2003.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nKTLA began carrying Los Angeles Dodgers games beginning with the team's 1993 season, obtaining the television rights from KTTV (channel 11), which had carried the team's games from 1958 (when the team relocated to Los Angeles from Brooklyn, New York) until 1992. KTLA lost the rights in 2001, with games moving to UPN affiliate KCOP-TV (channel 13, now a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station) in 2002 to 2005. In 2006, the Dodgers moved their over-the-air broadcasts to CBS Corporation-owned independent station KCAL-TV (channel 9); KCAL broadcast the team's games until the 2013 season, when the Dodgers launched SportsNet LA in partnership with Time Warner Cable.\nSportsNet LA would constrain itself from widespread provider availability in Southern California – its distribution is primarily limited to the former Time Warner systems in the region that are now part of Charter Communications' Spectrum service – as Time Warner Cable reportedly proposed a monthly transmission rate estimated at $4.90 per household to other cable and satellite providers (including Cox Communications, Frontier FiOS, AT&amp;T U-verse, DirecTV and Dish Network), with carriage fees increasing over the length of the contract (TWC reduced the fee to $3.50 per household in March 2016, an offer that was rejected; Charter indicated it would restore the carriage fee rate above $4.50 for the 2017 season). This created complaints from fans wanting to watch the final broadcasts of retiring legendary commentator Vin Scully, and led to SportsNet LA entering into an agreement with KTLA owner Tribune Broadcasting on September 2, 2016, in which the station would simulcast six Dodgers games that SportsNet LA was already scheduled to air during the final two weeks of the 2016 regular season. On March 8, 2017, SportsNet LA and KTLA extended their simulcasting arrangement to encompass ten games scheduled to air on the regional sports network during the first five weeks of the 2017 regular season. In 2020, AT&amp;T reached a deal with Spectrum (formed after a merger between Time Warner Cable and Charter) to add SportsNet LA to its services (AT&amp;T TV, AT&amp;T U-verse, and DirecTV, the latter of which has since been spun off); other providers in the Dodgers' market are still in disputes.\nNew York Mets.\nWOR-TV (now WWOR-TV, and originally licensed to New York City, before its city of license was moved to nearby Secaucus, New Jersey in 1986) held broadcast rights to New York City's National League baseball teams of the period during the 1950s: it obtained rights to the Brooklyn Dodgers beginning with the 1950 season, followed by the New York Giants beginning in 1951; WOR-TV lost the television rights to both teams when they moved to California (the Dodgers to Los Angeles, and the Giants to San Francisco) after the 1957 season. After a three-year stint carrying the Philadelphia Phillies beginning in 1958, the station began televising games from the New York Mets expansion team in 1962, a relationship that would last until 1998. WPIX subsequently signed an agreement to broadcast Mets games beginning with the 1999 season."

The American coxed four team coxed by Kennedy won the bronze medal in the coxed four event.\nBiography.\nTaking his position at the rear of the boat, John Kennedy coxed the four members of the Bachelor’s Barge rowing club which won the qualifier for the 1924 Olympics in Paris with four other members of the Bachelor's Barge Club on Philadelphia's Schuykill River on June 13, 1924 Before joining Bachelor’s, he attended the University of Pennsylvania and coxed their lightweight and junior varsity crews. Kennedy enlisted in the US Army right at the end of World War I, just after turning 18-years-old, but was discharged two months later when the war ended. He later worked as a radio technician in a department store.\nOlympics.\nAfter their arrival in Paris, the American coxed four team won their heat in the preliminary round with a time of 7 minutes 19 seconds for the 1.24 mile course. In the final round, the Americans won the bronze medal in the coxed four event. The competition, the fourth appearance of the event, was held from July 13–17, 1924 on the river Seine. There were 10 boats (51 competitors, with Switzerland making one substitution) from 10 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The competition was won by Switzerland, the nation's second consecutive victory in the event, with France taking the Silver medal.\nAs shown at left, the coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain shown as a yellow dot. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar and each rowing on one side. The competition used the 2000 metres (1.24 miles) distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since. The Americans finished with a time of 7:23, only two and a half seconds behind France who took the bronze. Switzerland, the pre-race favorite, finished with a sizable three-minute lead over second place France. Bob Gerhardt took the position of bowsmen in the front, Sid Jelinek rowed in seat two, Edward Mitchell Jr. rowed third, Henry Welsford rowed fourth (last) or Sweep, and John Kennedy functioned as coxswain.\nKennedy died on January 9, 1971, in Lakewood, Colorado."

Teams representing 39 countries participated in several levels of competition. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1996 competition.\nThe top Championship Group tournament took place in Sweden from 23 April to 7 May 1995, with games played in Stockholm and Gävle. In the tournament final, Finland won the gold medal by defeating Sweden 4–1 at the Globen arena in Stockholm. The Finnish goals were scored by Timo Jutila and Ville Peltonen, who scored a hat trick. The gold medal was the first in Finland's history. Sweden had written a fight song, \"Den glider in\", which also was intended to be the official song of the championships. After the finals, the song became very popular in Finland. The final still has an important place in Finnish hockey culture today, a common exclamation being \"95: Never forget!\"\nBecause of the 1994–95 NHL lockout, it originally created a dream scenario for the tournament hosts. With a cancelled NHL season, all NHL players free from injuries would have been available. But when the NHL season began in late January 1995, it instead created a scenario where fewer NHL players than usual became available. The Canadian and American teams would logically be hit the hardest, but the Americans found a way to lead their group in the first round. The Canadians, who struggled in the early tournament, beat the Americans in the quarter-finals, lasted until overtime against Sweden in the semifinal, and then beat the Czechs for the bronze. Andrew McKim, playing in the minors for the Adirondack Red Wings, ended up being the tournament scoring leader.\nWorld Championship Group A (Sweden).\nConsolation round 11–12 place.\n\"Switzerland was relegated to Group B.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Slovakia).\nPlayed in Bratislava, 12–21 April.

Nine teams took part this year because Yugoslavia was given the right to return to the group that they had last played in as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The consequence was that two teams were relegated. They played in three groups of three where the first place teams contested promotion and the third place teams contested relegation. Two years after failing to qualify for Group C, Belarus got a rematch against Ukraine and Kazakhstan, this time coming out on top.\nFinal round 21–23 place.\n\"Belarus was promoted to Group B.\"\nConsolation round 27–29 place.\n\"Both Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were relegated to group C2.\"\nWorld Championship Group C2 (South Africa).\nPlayed in Johannesburg and Krugersdorp in South Africa from 21 to 30 March.

        "text": "The 1990 State of Origin series saw the ninth time that the annual three-game series between New South Wales and Queensland representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules. It was the first year that the Australian Rugby League took an Origin match to Melbourne to showcase the code in Victoria. New South Wales broke an eight-game losing streak in game I and took the series for the first time since 1986.\nGames.\nGame One.\nGame I at the Sydney Football Stadium was a typical Origin arm-wrestle and resulted in the lowest score in the series' 10-year history to that point. Queensland's Wally Lewis withdrew pre-match due to a hamstring tear (only the 2nd Origin match he had missed in the series' history), Maroon's hero Gene Miles had retired and Tony Currie, Michael Hancock and Kerrod Walters were all out with injuries.\nNew South Wales' captain Benny Elias played what was regarded as his finest representative performance with a copybook dummy-half display. Blues' centre Mark \"Sparkles\" McGaw scored the only try of the match. He outplayed his opposite, the Mal Meninga and pulled off a covering tackle on winger Alan McIndoe that was so comprehensive that both McIndoe's boots came flying from his feet. The win was the Blues' first since the post-series exhibition match in 1987.\nGame Two.\nThe public relations exercise to showcase the game in Melbourne proved a success with a sell-out crowd of 25,800 cramming into Olympic Park. The game was highlighted by NSW halfback Ricky Stuart racing 70 metres to score, easily outpacing Qld winger Les Kiss who made no ground on the former Wallaby.\nQueensland halfback Allan Langer's stealing of the ball from Blues replacement prop Glenn Lazarus helped spell the end of three years of Queensland State of Origin dominance which had included two consecutive series clean sweeps from 1988. Langer's steal was a defining moment giving Rod Wishart the chance to put the Blues ahead 8-6. Shortly afterwards Brad Mackay swooped on an intercept and streaked away for the try that put the game out of reach for the Maroons.\nGame Three.\nIn Game III the Blues led 10-4 after just 24 minutes and looked set for a series whitewash. Then the Maroons clawed back to 10-all early in the second half with their Origin \"King\" Wally Lewis landing a wide conversion after Gary Belcher had taken the earlier kicks. Western Suburbs Magpies' forward Steve Jackson who the year before had scored a Grand Final try to give his club the Canberra Raiders the premiership, scored an almost identical try to give Queensland the game and a face-saving sole victory in the series."

        "text": "South Africa resumed official international cricket in 1991 after the moratorium imposed by the International Cricket Conference in 1970 was lifted. This was the first edition of the sir Vivian Richards trophy. This had restricted official contact with South Africa as a response to the policy of apartheid and South Africa's refusal to select non-white players for their international sporting teams. It formed part of the wider sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era. The South African national team made a short tour of India in 1991. It then played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The decade saw a number of tours of South Africa by major international teams as well as the continued playing of domestic competitions.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe former Currie Cup was renamed the Castle Cup in 1990 and then the SuperSport Series in 1996.\nInternational tours.\n1992–93, India.\nThe first major tour of South Africa after the lifting of apartheid was by India. The series was the first official tour of the country for 23 years and the first ever by \"a recognised non-white side\". A four–match Test match series was won 1–0 by South Africa who also won a seven–match One Day International (ODI) series 5–2.\nDespite cricket that \"Wisden\" described as \"humdrum\", the tour was considered a wider social and political success and was dubbed the \"Friendship Tour\". It was the first Test series in which an independent umpire stood in matches, and introduction by the International Cricket Conference to try to reduce the possibility for umpires to be biased in their decisions. Television replays to deal with run out and stumping line decisions were also used for the first time on the tour, an innovation introduced by the United Cricket Board of South Africa. Both innovations have become standard in the years since the tour.\n1993–94, Australia.\nThe second major tour of post-apartheid South Africa was by Australia in early 1994. South Africa had just toured Australia and drawn a three–Test series 1–1, and the return three–match Test tour produced the same result. Four ODIs were also played during the tour between the two evenly matched teams. The ODI series was also tied.\nThe tour was marred by two incidents during the first Test match where Australian players were sanctioned by the match referee and by the Australian Cricket Board for verbal abuse of their opponents, but was otherwise considered a success.\n1994–95, New Zealand.\nNew Zealand toured South Africa from November 1994 to January 1995 and played a three-match Test series against South Africa. This was New Zealand's third tour of South Africa and their first since the early 1960s. South Africa won the Test series 2–1. New Zealand also competed in the Mandela Trophy with South Africa and Pakistan but were eliminated in the group stage.\n1994–95, Pakistan.\nThe Pakistan national cricket team toured South Africa from November 1994 to January 1995, prior to visiting Zimbabwe. Pakistan played one Test against the South Africa. South Africa won the Test match by 324 runs. Pakistan also competed in the Mandela Trophy with South Africa and New Zealand but were defeated by South Africa 2–0 in the best-of-three finals.\n1997–98, Sri Lanka.\nThe Sri Lanka national cricket team toured South Africa in March 1998. This was the first time Sri Lanka had toured South Africa on a Test tour. South Africa won the series 2–0.\n1999–2000, Zimbabwe.\nThe Zimbabwe national cricket team played their first Test match in South Africa in October and November 1999. South Africa won the Test match, which was the first to be held at Springbok Park in Bloemfontein, easily as well as a return match played immediately afterwards at Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.\nZimbabwe returned in January and February 2000 to compete in the 2000 Standard Bank Triangular Tournament against South Africa and England but were eliminated at the group stage."
