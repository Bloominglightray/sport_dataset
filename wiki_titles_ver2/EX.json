        "title": "Bill O'Connor (American football)",
        "text": "William Francis \"Zeke\" O'Connor, Jr. (May 2, 1926 – March 6, 2021) was an American football end who played five seasons in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and Canadian Football League (CFL) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. After retiring, O'Connor went into business and devoted himself to helping Nepalese Sherpas.\nO'Connor grew up in a large Catholic family in New York City and went to college at the University of Notre Dame. After starting for Notre Dame's football team as a freshman in 1944, he spent two years in the U.S. Navy during World War II and played for a service team at Naval Station Great Lakes that was coached by Paul Brown. O'Connor returned to Notre Dame in 1946 and graduated in 1947, but he did not play in his senior year because of a knee injury.\nO'Connor signed in 1948 with the Buffalo Bills of the AAFC, where he played for one year. He was then traded to the Cleveland Browns, another AAFC team coached by Brown. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1949, but O'Connor was cut early the next year and played one season for the minor-league Jersey City Giants. He next had a one-year stint with the New York Yanks of the National Football League before his playing career in the CFL with the Toronto Argonauts. A late-game touchdown catch by O'Connor helped the Argonauts win the Grey Cup in 1952.\nO'Connor worked for Sears in Canada after his playing career, and served as the color commentator for Grey Cup broadcasts from 1956 to 1981. He became friends with the famed mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary and helped establish a foundation in his name to benefit Sherpas in Nepal. On September 24, 2015, O'Connor was the recipient of the Sandy Hawley Community Service Award, awarded by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.\nEarly life and college.\nO'Connor was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx, one of the city's five boroughs. He was the son of a police officer and part of a large Catholic family. O'Connor attended Mount Saint Michael Academy, a Catholic school in the Bronx, where he played football and was voted the team's best end in 1942 and 1943. His large size – he was six feet, four inches tall – made him an attractive prospect for college football programs across the country, and he accepted a scholarship offer from Notre Dame.\nO'Connor was a starter for Notre Dame as a freshman left end in 1944. The team finished the season with an 8–2 win–loss record under coach Edward McKeever, but O'Connor joined a V-12 Navy College Training Program in the middle of the year as World War II raged on. O'Connor played for a U.S. Navy team in a game against Army held in London in late 1944. In 1945, he played for a service team at Naval Station Great Lakes outside of Chicago that was coached by Paul Brown. He caught a touchdown pass that December in a 39–7 win over Notre Dame.\nO'Connor returned to Notre Dame in 1946, but coach Frank Leahy demoted him to the second-team midway through the season as punishment for leaving the school's South Bend, Indiana, campus to see a girl. He suffered a knee injury in a practice before the start of the 1947 season that kept him on the bench all year. Notre Dame went undefeated in 1946 and 1947, and won the college football national championship both years by finishing first in the national polls.\nProfessional career.\nO'Connor was selected by the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the fourth round of the 1948 draft. The Green Bay Packers of the National Football League were also interested in signing him, but O'Connor chose to play for the Bills because several Notre Dame alumni – including quarterback George Ratterman – were on the team. He had 301 receiving yards and two touchdowns in 1948, when the Bills had a 7–7 record and won the AAFC's eastern division. The Bills lost the AAFC championship game to the Cleveland Browns.\nThe Bills traded O'Connor in early 1949 to the Browns for tackle Bob McClelland. O'Connor played in nine games for the Browns, a team coached by Paul Brown, but did not have a reception. Cleveland won the AAFC championship that year, its fourth in a row. The Browns cut O'Connor before the beginning of the next season, and he played in 1950 for the Jersey City Giants, a minor-league team in the now-defunct American Association.\nO'Connor signed in 1951 to play for the New York Yanks, an NFL team. The Yanks finished with a 1–9–2 win–loss–tie record, putting them out of contention in the NFL's National Division. O'Connor earned a master's degree from Columbia University while playing in New York.\nIn 1952, O'Connor began a two-year stint with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). In O'Connor's first season with the team, the Argonauts finished with a 7–4–1 record and went on to win the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship trophy. O'Connor caught a touchdown pass off of his fingertips late in the championship game from Nobby Wirkowski, sealing the 21–11 win over the Edmonton Eskimos. The play was one of the most celebrated of its era in the CFL and the Grey Cup, which was televised for the first time in 1952. O'Connor retired from football after the 1953 season, when the Argonauts finished with a 5–9 regular-season record.\nLater life.\nO'Connor stayed in Canada after finishing his football career. He coached football in Toronto and took an entry-level job at Sears, a global department store chain. He also served as a color commentator for Grey Cup broadcasts from 1956 to 1981. He worked at Sears for 31 years, rising to vice president of public relations.\nAs O'Connor climbed the corporate ladder at Sears, he became the head of marketing for sporting goods in Canada and handled the company's relationships with major sports figures. These included Ted Williams and Sir Edmund Hillary, who became the first man to summit Mount Everest in 1953. O'Connor and Hillary met while O'Connor was on a camping trip in Ottawa in 1973 and struck up a friendship. Later that year, Hillary invited O'Connor and several other Sears executives to visit Nepal and consider charitable contributions for the Sherpa people who helped him climb Everest. O'Connor suffered from altitude sickness on the trip, but agreed to establish the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada when he returned to Toronto.\nO'Connor started the foundation and was its president for more than 30 years, helping build schools and hospitals in Nepal. He also introduced Nepal to the Special Olympics, an athletic competition for disabled adults. His daughter Karen took over the foundation in 2008. O'Connor published a memoir in 2012 called \"Journey with the Sherpas: The Story of Zeke O'Connor and the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation\". He later lived in Toronto and still visited the Sherpas annually. He has three children. O'Connor died on March 6, 2021, at the age of 94."

        "title": "2013 Super Rugby final",
        "text": "The 2013 Super Rugby final was contested on 3 August 2013 by the Canberra-based Brumbies and Hamilton-based Chiefs. The Chiefs won 27–22 to give them their second consecutive Super Rugby title. The match was the last of the 2013 Super Rugby season, and was hosted by the Chiefs at Waikato Stadium. It was the eighteenth final in the history of the Southern Hemisphere's premier domestic rugby competition, and the third under the expanded fifteen-team format. The Chiefs had qualified highest during the regular season, while the Brumbies qualified third.\nThe Chiefs directly qualified for their semi-final, where they beat fellow New Zealand team the Crusaders 20–19. The Brumbies defeated the Cheetahs in a close qualifying final, and then travelled to Pretoria where they beat the Bulls in their semi-final. The Chiefs hosted the final after qualifying higher than the Brumbies, who had to travel back from South Africa for the match.\nThe Brumbies led early in the final, and were ahead 16–9 at half-time following a converted try and three penalties from inside-centre Christian Lealiifano. After penalties were exchanged early in the second half, the Brumbies were ahead 22–12, before the Chiefs scored two tries and a penalty to take the lead 27–22 with seven minutes remaining. The Brumbies were unable to score further, and the Chiefs went on to win.\nRoad to the final.\nThe 2013 Super Rugby competition involved fifteen teams, five each from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. 2013 marked the eighteenth season of the competition and the third in the expanded fifteen team format: twelve teams competed between 1996 and 2005, before increasing to fourteen between 2006 and 2010. The competition began on 24 February with the regular season consisting of 120 matches over twenty one weeks. Each team played teams from their own country twice (home and away) and four teams from each of the other two countries once (two at home and two away). The top six teams after the regular season advanced to the finals.\nThe Chiefs qualified top of the table after the regular season, and played the Crusaders in their semi-final where they won 20–19. The win also guaranteed the side would host the final, regardless of their opposition. The Brumbies finished third on the overall table, and top of the Australian Conference after the regular season. They hosted the Cheetahs in their qualifying final, who they defeated 15–13 in Canberra. They then travelled to Pretoria where they faced the Bulls in their semi-final. The match was won 26–23 after a late try.\nThe Chiefs went into the final with twelve wins and four losses whereas the Brumbies went in with ten wins, four losses and two draws. The Chiefs and the Brumbies did not meet during the conference round. They had last met at Mount Maunganui in round four of the 2012 season where the Brumbies were beaten 29–22 by the Chiefs.\nThe Chiefs were looking to be the fourth team to defend the title back to back since the Blues (1996 and 1997), Crusaders who defended it three years in a row (1998, 1999 and 2000) and the Bulls (2009 and 2010). The Brumbies were hoping to win the title for the third time which would put them equal second all-time with the Blues and Bulls with three Super Rugby titles.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe Brumbies dominated the scoring early in the match, with their inside-centre Christian Lealiifano scoring three early penalties to give his team a 9–0 lead after 20 minutes. The Chiefs responded with three penalties of their own, all scored by Aaron Cruden, to level the scores 9–9 after 32 minutes. The Brumbies were played a territory-based strategy, and were the first team to score a try, when after 35 minutes, Chiefs' scrum-half Tawera Kerr-Barlow threw an errant pass following being pressured by Brumbies' flanker George Smith; the resulting pass was intercepted by Lealiifano who ran to score. The try was converted and the Brumbies led 16–9 at half-time.\nThe Brumbies were awarded a penalty at the 45-minute mark, which they converted to lead 19–9. The Chiefs responded with a penalty three minutes later, but missed another penalty opportunity soon after. When the Brumbies won possession at the break-down, a grubber kick was recovered by Brumbies' wing Clyde Rathbone, who was stopped with a try-saving tackle from Cruden. From the resulting play the Brumbies attacked the Chiefs try-line, and the Television Match Official was asked to adjudicate whether the Brumbies had forced the ball over the line, but the result was inconclusive and a try was not awarded. The Brumbies were awarded another penalty which they converted to leave the scores 22–12 after sixty minutes. Following a sustained attack, and having the ball held up over the try-line, the Chiefs were awarded a scrum five-metres from the Brumbies' line. Chiefs' flanker Liam Messam scored from the resulting scrum, and the try was unconverted to narrow the Brumbies' lead to 22–17. After attacking from their own half, Chiefs' substitute Robbie Robinson ran through a gap in the Brumbies' defence to score a try, which was converted by Cruden to give the Chiefs the lead 24–22 after 72 minutes. Two minutes later the Chiefs were awarded a penalty which they kicked to give them a five-point lead. The Brumbies attacked throughout the remainder of the match, but the Chiefs' defence held, and the match finished 27–22 to the Chiefs.\nThe man-of-the-match was awarded to Messam. A victory parade through Hamilton was hosted in the Chiefs' honour on 6 August 2013."

Winlaton Vulcans were replaced by Gateshead Storm A. Jarrow Vikings, Peterlee Pumas and Sunderland Nissan took part in the newly North regional division against teams from Cumbria.\nThe promotion of three teams to the RLC National Division left the already depleted Premier North unviable and an artificial North Premier was created out of two of the North East and North regional divisions. The North East division was scrapped and did not return until the 2009 season.\nIn 2011 the league was split into 2 divisions (premier and regional).

The Tribe, led by 11th year head coach Tony Shaver, played their home games at Kaplan Arena and were members of the Colonial Athletic Association. With his 11th season, Shaver became the longest-tenured coach in program history.\nThe team finished the season 20–12, 10–6 in CAA play and lost in the championship game of the 2014 CAA men's basketball tournament to Delaware, 74–75. The one-point margin is the closest that William &amp; Mary has come to qualifying for the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament; the Tribe lost all seven of its previous tournament bid-clinching games including three prior CAA championship games (1983, 2008, and 2010). Despite the team's final record, William &amp; Mary elected not to participate in a postseason tournament, which would have been its first postseason bid since 2010.\nPreseason.\nOn October 22, 2013, William &amp; Mary was picked to finish fifth, out of nine teams, in the Colonial Athletic Association's pre-season coaches poll.

The Bulls, led by first year head coach Bobby Hurley, played their home games at Alumni Arena as members of the East Division of the Mid-American Conference. They finished the season 19–10, 13–5 in MAC play to be champions of the East division. They lost in the semifinals of the MAC tournament to Eastern Michigan. Despite the 19 wins and the division title, the Bulls did not participate in postseason play.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nFollowing the firing of previous head coach Reggie Witherspoon and departures of assistant coaches Turner Battle, Kevin Heck, and Jim Kwitchoff, Buffalo began the re-tooling of its staff by hiring Bobby Hurley, formerly the associate head coach at Rhode Island, as their 12th head coach in program history, on March 26, 2013. Prior to his time at Rhode Island, Hurley was an assistant coach for Wagner.\nOn April 12, 2013, Hurley announced that Levi Watkins and Eric Harrield would join the team as assistant coaches. Watkins, a former player for NC State, had spent the past eight years working for the Wolfpack in different parts of the team. Harrield joined the team after spending five years as an assistant coach for New York City high school basketball powerhouse St. Anthony's High School. On June 18, Nate Oats was hired to fill out the coaching staff. Oats joined the Bulls from another high school basketball powerhouse, Romulus High School in Michigan.\nOn September 16, 2013, Hurley announced the team's complete schedule for the season. The main highlight on the non-conference schedule was a game against rival Canisius at the First Niagara Center, home of the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League. Other key non-conference games included a trip to Texas A&amp;M (Buffalo's first game against an SEC opponent since 1976), and home games against South Dakota State and rival St. Bonaventure. In the conference schedule, the Bulls were to play home-and-home series with Akron, Bowling Green, Kent State, Miami, Ohio, Northern Illinois, and Ball State, while playing one game against Central Michigan, Western Michigan, Eastern Michigan, and Toledo.\nNovember.\nOn November 8, the Bulls opened their season in College Station, Texas, as visitors against Texas A&amp;M. Bobby Hurley's head coaching debut was spoiled by a strong defensive performance by the Aggies, who outscored Buffalo 25–6 over the final ten minutes en route to an 82–58 victory. Star forward Javon McCrea led the Bulls with 14 points.\nSchedule and results.\nSource: \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0068B4; color:white;\"| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0068B4; color:white\"| Conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0068B4; color:white\"| MAC tournament"

        "text": "Des Moines Golf and Country Club is a private country club in West Des Moines, Iowa, located few minutes west of Des Moines. Its golf courses have consistently been ranked in the top ten golf courses in the state of Iowa.\nEstablished in 1899, it established its current site in 1970. In late September 1897, the foundation of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club was established. Newspaper accounts have the details: “A forty-acre field owned by Mr. J. S. Polk just north of the station at the end of Ingersoll Line will be fitted up for the grounds. Mr. Polk has consented to rent the ground to the club and become a member himself.” \nAn organizational meeting on October 7 ratified articles of incorporation. N. T. Guernsey was elected as the first president of the new club. The incorporation papers were filed in Polk County on October 11, 1897. In 1906, Joe Roseman was appointed as head professional and greens superintendent.\nIn 1923, the Ashworth estate in West Des Moines was purchased and a new 18-hole golf course was designed. Following a devastating fire in 1946, a new clubhouse was built and membership rose to 365. In 1966, the new east-west freeway (now Interstate 235) cut through the heart of the golf course and members voted to move and build a new facility, featuring two golf courses, doubling the size of the clubhouse as well as membership.\nThe club relocated to Dallas County in 1970, opening a new course on a hillside overlooking a valley in West Des Moines. Its tri-level clubhouse is the hub of all activities, including 12 tennis courts, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and the Pool and Tennis Pavilion.\nThe club hosted the 1999 U.S. Senior Open, with a record 200,000 fans showing up for the four-day event, won by Dave Eichelberger. It hosted the Solheim Cup in 2017.\nGolf courses.\nLocation #1 – Located at the intersection of Ingersoll Avenue and Polk Boulevard, the first golf course was a haphazard 18 holes with no definition. It was later changed to a 9-hole course by designer Warren Dickinson. A \"new\" 9 was created with a \"modern look\" with fairways, trees, bunkers, and a few traps. The first Iowa Golf Association Championship was held on the grounds on August 28, 1900.\nLocation #2 – In 1903, Warren Dickinson, then club president, announced on October 2 that the current golf links would be turned back over to Mr. Polk and the club had secured a 20-year lease on owned by the Gilchrest family near Waveland Golf Course. Thomas Bendelow, an employee of the Spalding Company, came to Des Moines on December 4 to design the new golf course. Bendelow designed over 600 courses in the United States.\nLocation #3 – In 1921, as the lease on the land for Location #2 was set to expire, the club made plans to move to 147 acres bought from the Ashworth family just off White Pole Road, later named Ashworth Road (current site of Dowling Catholic High School). At this time a faction of golfers led by the Hubbells and Denmans split off to build their own golf course on the south side of Des Moines called Wakonda Club. The new club on Ashworth was designed by the landscape architecture firm Pearse, Robinson, and Sprague. Warren Dickinson was also very prominent in the design of the new club. Upon moving to Location #4, 55 acres were sold to the Catholic Diocese for $320,000 and were sold for a commercial plaza, residential and apartment housing for $650,000.\nLocation #4 (current site) – In 1957, the members learned of the planned east-west freeway (I-235) and planning was put into place to find an alternative site. In 1966, the members purchased in West Des Moines, and the first 18 holes were dedicated in the spring of 1968."

He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Erasmus Hall High School, where as a senior in 1947–48 he led them to a PSAL championship. Due to his poor academic grades, Roth was ineligible to attend CCNY his freshman year; one year later Roth was admitted to the school as a sophomore. It was this season that CCNY won both national basketball championships (the NIT was actually considered the premier national championship at the time). One year later, news broke about a point-shaving scandal that was sweeping east coast universities, and at its heart was CCNY's squad led by Nat Holman. Roth was one of the players arrested in the scandal. In July 1952, a judge suspended his sentence after Roth volunteered to join the United States Army as a private in the following month.\nRoth's admission into CCNY despite his poor grades was a result of transcript altering by Holman. Nationally, all of the players who were convicted of participating in the scandal were banned from ever playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nProfessional career.\nEastern League.\nDue to his ban, Roth played for a time in the Eastern League, although it is unknown which team he played for.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his playing days, Roth went back to CCNY to earn his business degree, then moved to the suburbs of New York City to sell insurance. He died June 19, 2003, in Rockford, New York."

        "text": "The 2013–14 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team represented the University of Tennessee in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team's head coach was Cuonzo Martin, who was in his third season at Tennessee. The team played their home games at the Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee as a member of the Southeastern Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Vols posted a record of 20–13 (11–7 SEC) in the 2012–13 season and finished sixth in the SEC standings in Cuonzo Martin's second season as head coach. The season was highlighted by a 30-point victory over rival Kentucky and a victory over a team that competed in the Final Four, Wichita State. The Volunteers lost in the first round of the 2013 NIT to Mercer.\nSeason Summary.\nGoing into the season, Cuonzo Martin faced pressure and unrest from the Tennessee fanbase, restless after having missed the NCAA Tournament two consecutive seasons. During the 2011–12 and 2012-13 seasons, promising finishes to the regular season were undermined by early season losses to inferior out of conference opponents; bewildering losses to College of Charleston, Oakland and Austin Peay scuttled any hopes of a tournament appearance each of those seasons, respectively. Frustrations grew shortly after Tennessee inexplicably dropped a game to a sub-100\nRPI UTEP squad during the Battle for Atlantis tournament in November. A bubble team throughout the season, Tennessee ultimately nabbed a bid to the NCAA Tournament (despite the earlier loss to UTEP and suffering a sweep at the hands of a sub-100 RPI Texas A&amp;M). In any case, Martin rallied the team to a 4-0 finish to end the regular season at 20-11. A victory over a moribund South Carolina outfit and a third straight loss to #1 Florida put Tennessee at 21-12. This was enough to earn Tennessee an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, Martin's first and only appearance with Tennessee. The Vols were placed in the First Four as an 11 seed, where Tennessee beat Iowa in overtime to move on to the field of 64. Tennessee routed Umass in the second round and Mercer in the round of 32. As a result, Tennessee earned a trip to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2010. The Vols faced Michigan and came within one basket of making what would have been only their second Elite 8 appearance but fell to the Wolverines, 73-71, thanks to a controversial charge called on Jarnell Stokes.\nDespite the late season surge and performance in the tourney (the latter accomplishment arguably the fruit of a favorable tournament draw and a Mercer upset of Duke), Cuonzo Martin would leave Tennessee at season's end to take the head coaching job at the University of California-Berkeley.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF9933; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF9933; color:white;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF9933;\"| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#FF9933;\"| NCAA tournament"

The game was televised nationally by NBC and was the final Pro Bowl on network television before ABC’s airing in 2018 as part of a simulcast with sister network ESPN, whose parent company Disney currently holds domestic television rights to the game.\nSignificant changes to the Pro Bowl format were adopted in an attempt to make the game more \"fan-friendly\". These changes were proposed by National Football League Players Association president Dominique Foxworth and developed in partnership between the league and the player's union.\nThe most significant change was a switch to a \"fantasy draft\" format rather than pitting AFC all-stars against NFC all-stars. Hall of Fame players Jerry Rice and Deion Sanders were chosen as honorary team captains, and joined by two active players each to assist in their selections. Chuck Pagano of the AFC South winning Indianapolis Colts coached Team Sanders, while Ron Rivera of the NFC South winning Carolina Panthers coached Team Rice. These coaches were selected for coaching the highest seeded teams to lose in the Divisional round of the playoffs, which has been the convention since the 2010 Pro Bowl.\nTeam Rice won the game 22–21.\nSummary.\nTo begin the game, the coin toss was won by Team Sanders. They decided to defer to the second half, so Team Rice started with the ball.\nThe game featured six interceptions and nine sacks, while the 22–21 score was the lowest since the 2006 Pro Bowl, which ended with a 23–17 NFC win.\nScoring summary.\nThe scores broken down by quarter:\nRosters.\nSelected but did not participate.\nNotes:\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally by NBC and was the final Pro Bowl on network television until 2018. ESPN took over the exclusive broadcast rights to the Pro Bowl, effective in 2015, and eventually began simulcasting the game on ABC in 2018.\nIn France, the game was televised by BeIN Sport, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland, by Sky Sports.

        "text": "Shaun Pollock is a former South African cricketer who took 21 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. A five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of 2014, 41 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at the international level. With 829 wickets at the international level, Pollock is South Africa's most prolific wicket-taker. The \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" described him as \"one of the most balanced cricketers to represent South Africa in the modern era\" and named him one of their \"Cricketers of the Year\" alongside four other players in 2003. With fellow cricketer Allan Donald, he formed a formidable bowling partnership and the duo were mainly responsible for many of South Africa's key victories in the late 1990s.\nPollock made his Test debut against England in November 1995. He picked up his first five-wicket haul during the fifth match of the same series. In January 1998, Pollock took a career-best figure of 7 wickets for 87 runs against Australia, bowling 41 overs. His figures of 6 wickets for 30 runs, against Sri Lanka, in January 2001 are the best by a South African captain. In Tests, he has taken fifers against all cricketing nations with the exception of Bangladesh, and is most successful against West Indies with four fifers.\nPollock's One Day International (ODI) debut was against England in January 1996, capturing four wickets for 34 runs and was named \"Man of the match\". However, it took another three years to pick up a fifer, this time against the West Indies when he picked up six wickets for 35 runs in a math which South Africa lost. With five fifers in ODIs, he has the highest number of fifers than any other South African bowler, and ninth in the all-time list. Pollock played 12 Twenty20 Internationals between 2005 and 2008. He never managed to take a fifer in this format; his best bowling figures remain 3 wickets for 28 runs."

        "text": "The 2012 Motocross des Nations was a motocross race held on 29 September and 30 September 2012 in Lommel, Belgium.\nPreview.\nFor the first time in the last few years it looked as though the deep and energy-sapping sands of Lommel may offer up a chance for the European teams to un-seat the United States and end their 7-year winning streak. The Americans entered as reigning champions, but had three riders who had never experienced this sort of sand before. 2012 AMA MX1 Champion, Ryan Dungey led the charge and had been rarely beaten throughout the American season. Blake Baggett, 2012 AMA MX2 champion and Justin Barcia had shown great speed throughout the season, whilst battling each other for the American MX2 crown.\nThe home team Belgium had three riders who were looking in great form, and most importantly for this event, consistent. Clement Desalle had had an injury free season and was the only real challenger to Tony Cairoli throughout the GP season. The same could be said of MX2 rider Jeremy van Horebeek, who finished in third place in the MX2 Grand Prix and was in his last year riding a 250cc machine before moving up to the MX1 class for 2013. The final member of the team Ken de Dycker had been picked up by KTM in 2012 to stand in for the injured Max Nagl, he stayed with the manufacturer once Nagl had returned and had played second fiddle to his world champion teammate Tony Cairoli throughout much of the season, when it looked as though he had the speed to beat him.\nCairoli himself had won yet another world title, mostly un-opposed, and led the Italian team which contained, Husqvarna factory rider and mid-pack MX2 runner Alessandro Lupino and Marchetti KTM MX1 racer Davide Guarneri. Neither could be described as sand riders though.\nThe MX2 world champion Jeffrey Herlings had an outside chance of taking to the top-step of the podium, but would have to carry potentially bad results from British Championship MX1 rider Marc de Reuver and fellow MX2 grand prix star Glenn Coldenhoff.\nGermany had turned out their strongest team for some years. Max Nagl had spent the majority of the season out injured but came back with a bang in the final few rounds of the year. Ken Roczen had come back from a tough debut year in the United States, but had been picking up form and Markus Schiffer was capable of top 10 MX1 grand prix pace.\nLast year's runners up France had a full strength team but weren't great in such deep sand, the same could be said for Great Britain.\nAustralia finished third in 2011, but where stricken by injuries to both Chad Reed and Brett Metcalfe, along with MX2 GP runner Dean Ferris. This years team consisted wholly of Australian Championship riders, and no-one knew how they would cope.\nInjuries were a problem for many other teams. South Africa weren't expected to do as well as last year as they'd lost both Tyla Rattray and Gareth Swanepoel. Spain had lost number 1 rider Jonathan Barragan, Japan had lost both Yoshitaka Atsuta and Akira Narita, Finland legend Antti Pyrhonen had retired and Austria had lost both Pascal Raucheneker and Gunter Schmidiger.\nFor New Zealand legend and former MX1 world championship runner up Joshua Coppins this would be his last professional event before retirement.\nMongolia were scheduled to return to the MXDN but canceled at the last minute because of logistical reasons. An under-strength Brazil side were flown out to replace them but it was a team without any of its countries top 5 riders.\nEntry List.\nThe entry list is taken from the official Motocross World Championship website.\nNote 1: Mongolia did not participate.\nB Final.\nNote 1: New Zealand won the B final which meant they qualified for the main races.\nRace.\nNote 1: Denmark and Switzerland both lost one rider through injury and Finland lost two, their scores are placed differently from the rest of the field who lost no riders."

        "title": "2011 Petra Kvitová tennis season",
        "text": "The 2011 Petra Kvitová tennis season officially began at the 2011 Brisbane International, the first of two simultaneous events which opened the official 2011 season.\nYearly summary.\nAustralian Open series.\nKvitová began her season at the 2011 Brisbane International, as an unseeded player. She upset third seed Nadia Petrova in the first round, then followed it up with wins over Ksenia Pervak, Dominika Cibulková and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to reach her first final since 2009, where she faced Andrea Petkovic of Germany. Kvitová won in straight sets to win only her second career title and first in almost two years.\nAs a result of reaching the final in Brisbane, Kvitová had to withdraw from the qualifying draw for the Medibank International Sydney.\nKvitová's next tournament was the 2011 Australian Open, where she was the 25th seed. She defeated Sally Peers, Anna Chakvetadze, fifth seed Samantha Stosur and Flavia Pennetta, the latter in three sets, to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the first time. There, she lost to World No. 2 Vera Zvonareva in straight sets. Following the run in Australia, Kvitová entered the world's top 20 for the first time.\nFed Cup quarter-finals.\nFollowing the Australian Open, Kvitová was named in the Czech Republic Fed Cup team for its quarter-final against Slovakia. Kvitová won both of her rubbers against Dominika Cibulková and Daniela Hantuchová; her victory over the latter ensured the Czech Republic would progress through to the semi-finals.\nIndoor/Middle East series.\nFollowing the Fed Cup quarter-finals, Kvitová participated at the 2011 Open GDF Suez, where she was seeded fourth. After surviving three-setters against fellow Czech Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová and Yanina Wickmayer in earlier rounds, she reached the final, upsetting soon-to-be World No. 1 Kim Clijsters in straight sets to win her second title for the year.\nKvitová then made an early exit from her next tournament, losing in the first round of the 2011 Dubai Tennis Championships to Ayumi Morita of Japan.\nAmerican hard court season.\nThe next stop for Kvitová following the Middle East swing was the Premier Mandatory Indian Wells tournament in March. After receiving a bye in the opening round, Kvitová was upset by fellow Czech Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová, whom she had beaten in Paris the previous month, in the second round.\nKvitová then received a wildcard into the Bahamas Women's Open, but she was upset in the first round by Kristina Barrois in three sets, marking a third consecutive defeat.\nThe Sony Ericsson Open saw somewhat of a brief return to form for Kvitová; after receiving a first round bye, she defeated Varvara Lepchenko for her first match victory in almost six weeks, but was then upset in three sets by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.\nFed Cup semi-finals.\nFollowing her disappointing North American hard court season, Kvitová next represented the Czech Republic in its semi-final against Belgium. Kvitová won both of her singles rubbers against Kirsten Flipkens and Yanina Wickmayer, as the Czechs progressed to the final.\nClay court season.\nKvitová kicked off her clay court season at the Mutua Madrid Open, where she was seeded 16th. After defeating Alexandra Dulgheru and Chanelle Scheepers in the first two rounds, she defeated second seed Vera Zvonareva in straight sets in the Round of 16 to progress to the quarter-finals. She then went on to defeat Dominika Cibulková (who had upset Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova in earlier rounds) and Li Na to reach her third final for the year, where she would meet Victoria Azarenka. In the final, Kvitová survived a first set tiebreak and went on to win in straight sets, claiming her first career Tier I/Premier Mandatory title in the process. By winning this title, Kvitová entered the Top 10 for the first time in her career.\nRather than participate in Rome, Kvitová decided to travel home to participate at her home ITF event, the Sparta Prague Open. Seeded first, Kvitová reached her fourth final of the year, but would end up losing to Slovak Magdaléna Rybáriková. During the tournament, she suffered a hip injury, which would force her to withdraw from the Brussels Open the following week.\nKvitová's next tournament was the 2011 French Open, where she was seeded ninth. She defeated Gréta Arn, Zheng Jie and Vania King to reach the fourth round, where she was defeated by the eventual champion, Li Na, in three sets, having led by a break in the final set.\nGrass court season.\nFollowing a modest clay court campaign, Kvitová made the transition to grass by participating in the AEGON International event in Eastbourne. She defeated Anastasija Sevastova, Ekaterina Makarova, Agnieszka Radwańska and Daniela Hantuchová (the latter retiring) to reach the final, but found Marion Bartoli too good for her in the championship match, losing in three sets.\nWimbledon was next for Kvitová, where she had reached the semi-finals in 2010. Intent on going one better, Kvitová won her first four matches without conceding more than three games in a single set, before surviving three-set thrillers against Tsvetana Pironkova and Victoria Azarenka, to reach her first Grand Slam final. There, she met Maria Sharapova, who was seen as a favourite to win her second title after previously triumphing in 2004. However, Kvitová would win in straight sets to win her first Grand Slam title at the expense of the Russian.\nUS Open series.\nKvitová's form dropped off following her successful grass court campaign. She suffered a pair of losses to Andrea Petkovic in Toronto and Cincinnati (both in the third round and both after receiving a first round bye), then became the first reigning Wimbledon champion to lose in the first round of the US Open when she lost her first match to Alexandra Dulgheru. She finished the US Open series with a paltry 2–3 win-loss record from five matches.\nAsian hard court season.\nFollowing her unsuccessful US Open series campaign, Kvitová rebounded at the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, defeating Mandy Minella, Vania King and Maria Sharapova (retired) before losing to Vera Zvonareva in the semi-finals.\nKvitová then received a first round bye at the China Open, but was defeated in her first match by Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden. That would be the last time that Kvitová was beaten in 2011.\nIndoor hard court season.\nFollowing the Asian hard court swing, Kvitová received a wildcard into the Generali Ladies Linz, thus making her the top seed. With the exception of her semi-final victory over Jelena Janković, Kvitová won all of her matches in straight sets, including in the final, where she defeated Dominika Cibulková to win her fifth title of the year.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nAs a result of Kvitová's excellent results this year, she qualified for the 2011 WTA Tour Championships for the first time in her career. She drew Vera Zvonareva, Caroline Wozniacki and Agnieszka Radwańska in her group in the round robin stage. She went through this stage without dropping a set, thus qualifying for the semi-finals. She then defeated Samantha Stosur in three sets to advance to the final, where she would meet Victoria Azarenka for the third time in the year. Kvitová would win in three sets, to claim her sixth title of the year, go through the entire championships undefeated and become the first woman since Maria Sharapova in 2004 to win the title on her first attempt.\nFed Cup final.\nTo round out the season, Kvitová took part in the Czech Republic's Fed Cup championship match against Russia. She won both of her singles rubbers, against Maria Kirilenko and Svetlana Kuznetsova, as the Czechs claimed their sixth Fed Cup title. Her two singles rubbers saw her finish 2011 on a twelve-match winning streak, which she would unofficially extend to eighteen in the early part of 2012.\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-head match-ups.\n\"Ordered by percentage, number of victories to number of losses, then in alphabetical order\""

        "title": "Platform tennis",
        "text": "Platform tennis is derived from tennis, developed in 1928 at Fox Meadow Tennis Club in Scarsdale, New York by James Cogswell and Fessenden Blanchard.\nDevelopment.\nCogswell and Blanchard had been seeking to develop a sport that could be played outdoors during the winter. The original platform they constructed was long and wide, dimensions that were dictated by the Cogswell property's steep slope and constrained by the presence of a large rock. The court was too small for volleyball and the overhanging foliage precluded badminton, two alternatives that Cogswell and Blanchard had considered, leaving a form of deck tennis as the only option that they deemed viable. Cogswell found paddle tennis equipment in a sporting goods store and started using it on their court after lowering the net that they had used to play deck tennis. As the balls they used tended to go out of play, fencing was added, rising from an initial height of up to as of 1932. The dimensions of by were expanded to the by size of a badminton court. As this left a narrow strip out of play between the court and the fencing, the fences were put into play and players were allowed to hit the ball after it hit off of the fence. The court dimensions expanded to their final size in 1932, making it equivalent to one-quarter the size of a standard tennis court. In 1935, Scarsdale's Fox Meadow Club hosted the first national championship.\nRules.\nCourt.\nThe court is one-quarter the size of a traditional tennis court and is surrounded by a chicken wire fence high. The taut fencing allows balls to be played off the wall and remain in play. Originally developed on land unsuitable for traditional tennis courts, such as along hills, the space under the platform allows for the installation of heating equipment that, together with lighting, can allow for year-long play around the clock, even in cold weather. Courts in warm-weather locations are more likely to be constructed on level ground, as the need for clearing snow and ice is obviated. The deck is long by in width. The court measures in length by in width and is divided by a net that is kept taut at a height of at its center and at either end.\nBall and paddle.\nA spongy ball measuring in diameter is used. The ball can be served overhand. The ball is struck with a paddle that extends and which may have up to 87 holes measuring no more than in diameter to improve its aerodynamics.\nService.\nA serve is the first shot to begin a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it into the diagonally opposite service box. The ball may make contact with the net: if it lands in the service box, it is a valid serve. There are no \"lets\" in platform tennis.\nThe rules governing the serve are different for singles and doubles play. In a game of singles, similar rules of tennis apply, i.e. the server may make two attempts at a valid serve. Only after a second failed attempt (a \"fault\") is the point lost. In a game of doubles, the server is given a single chance for a valid serve. For this reason, serves are often much less aggressive in a doubles game.\nScoring.\nPlatform tennis uses the same scoring rules of tennis for game, set and match. See: \"Tennis scoring system\""

Dubuque teams were an affiliate of the Houston Astros (1975–1976), Kansas City Royals (1968), Los Angeles Dodgers (1962*, 1967), Cleveland Indians (1961–1966), Pittsburgh Pirates (1959–1960) and Chicago White Sox (1954–1958).\nThe Midwest Dodgers (1962), who briefly gave Dubuque a second team in 1962, evolved into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Midwest League.\nDubuque baseball history.\nDubuque debuted playing as members in the Northwestern League in 1870.\nThe Dubuque Red Stockings played in the Northwestern League in 1879. Dubuque played in the Central Interstate League in 1888, Illinois–Iowa League in 1890, Eastern Iowa League in 1895 and the Western Association from 1895–1899.\nThe Dubuque Shamrocks played in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League from 1903–1905. During their inaugural season, the club was managed by future World Series-winning skipper Clarence \"Pants\" Rowland. The Shamrocks won the 1905 Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League Championship.\nThe Dubuque Dubs played in the Three-I League from 1906–1915. The franchise moved to Freeport, Illinois and became the Freeport Comeons on July 14, 1915. Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Red Faber played for the Dubs in 1909–1910.\nThe Dubs returned in 1917 playing in the Central Association. The Dubs again moved mid-season, to Charles City, Iowa, where they became the Charles City Tractorites.\nThe Dubuque Climbers played in the Mississippi Valley League in 1922 and 1923. Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Joe McGinnity played for Dubuque both years, managing the 1923 team. McGinnity was 5–8 in 19 games in 1922. He was 15–12 with a 3.93 ERA in 42 games in 1923, at the age of 53. He led the squad to a first-place finish and the Mississippi Valley League Championship 1923.\nAfter returning to the Dubs name for the 1924 season, the team became the Dubuque Ironmen for 1925. Hall of Fame baseball player Iron Joe McGinnity played for the team.\nThe name was the Dubuque Speasmen during the 1926 season and was managed by Bill Speas, after whom the team was nicknamed. The team featured multiple players who played or who would go on to play in the major leagues: Estel Crabtree, Luther Harvel, Al Platte and Webb Schultz.\nThey were once again the Dubs from 1924–1928. In 1927, still under manager Speas, they were Mississippi Valley League champions, finishing first in the standings.\nThey were the Dubuque Tigers from 1929 to 1932 and won a league championship in 1929. Numerous future and former major league players played for the team, including Otto Bluege, Paul Speraw and Biggs Wehde in 1929, Johnny Dickshot, Wally Millies and Wehde in 1930, George Caithamer, Red Lutz, Hal Trosky and Phil Weintraub in 1931, and Maurice Archdeacon, Red Evans and Wehde in 1932. Following the 1932 season, the Tigers folded.\nThe Dubuque Packers were in the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League from 1954–55. The Packers remained after that league evolved into the Midwest League in 1955. The Packers played in the Midwest League from 1956–1968, before returning to play from 1974–1976. The Packers won Midwest League Championships in both 1955 and 1962.\nIn 1962, the Keokuk Dodgers franchise was moved by the Midwest League from Keokuk, Iowa to Dubuque on August 2, 1962, to finish the season as the Midwest Dodgers. The team was an affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. This move briefly gave Dubuque two teams. After the season, the Midwest Dodgers franchise moved and became the Wisconsin Rapids Twins. This franchise evolved into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Midwest League.\nAfter the Packers folded, following the 1968 season, Dubuque was without a team until the Midwest League Quincy Gems franchise moved to Dubuque in 1974. The Packers played in the Midwest League from 1974–1976. The Danville Dodgers and Dubuque Packers franchises both folded from the Midwest League after the 1976 season.\nBallpark.\nFrom 1915 to 1976, Dubuque teams played at Memorial Stadium / John Petrakis Park. Built in 1914, Memorial Stadium was renamed after the president and GM of the franchise in 1967. Its dimensions were (LF-CF-RF): 340-400-340. The park was prone to flooding. The stadium was located at the 4th Street Extension, before East Dubuque Bridge in Dubuque, Iowa.\nMedia.\nThe Dubuque Packers were the subject of the documentary \"A Pitch in Time: The Story of the Dubuque Packers\" (2013). The documentary was produced and directed by journalist Katlyn Gerken.\nNotable alumni.\nJoe McGinnity.\nNicknamed \"Iron Man\", Hall of Famer Joe McGinnity was a player/manager for three seasons (1922–23, 1925) in Dubuque, beginning at age 51. In his career, McGinnity won 246 Major League games and 231 Minor League games. Spanning 26 seasons, McGinnity threw 7,210 Innings in winning 485 games. He went 5-8 in 1922, 15-12 in 1923. He then went 6-6 in 1925, his final season to pitch, at age 54.\nJohn Petrakis.\nThe namesake of the ballpark, John Petrakis served as the President and GM of the franchise. Petrakis was a longtime baseball supporter in Dubuque and was instrumental in youth baseball and minor league baseball. Petrakis was recognized on a National level. In 1956, Petrakis was featured in the Saturday Evening Post and received the \"Executive of the Year for minor leagues\" by the Sporting News. After the demise of the original ballpark, a new field, within the Gerald McAleece Park &amp; Recreation Complex, was named \"John Petrakis Field\" and dedicated on May 4, 1986."

        "text": "Don Bradman Cricket 14 (re-release retitled Don Bradman Cricket) is a cricket video game for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was developed by Big Ant Studios and published by Tru Blu Entertainment. The game was originally released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in various countries that compete in cricket in April 2014; it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 11 February 2015. Its sequel \"Don Bradman Cricket 17\" was released on 16 December 2016.\nFeatures.\nThe game features a number of different game modes, including a career mode, custom matches and online games. The career mode involves a user creating a player who starts off at 16 years old and plays for a career of up to 20 years. There is also a Cricket Academy program in which a user can create and edit teams, players and competitions. This was released as a stand-alone game before the console release date.\nThe game contains the original cricket stats of every player and they can be modified too. Each cricketer face is created in a realistic way to experience a new feel. Big Ant Studios updated the academy and brought the 'Practice Nets' feature into it in the weeks prior to the launch of the full game. The gameplay features were announced as having \"Unique Batting and Bowling Controls\" with a full 360 shot delivery with no shot markers. The gameplay also involves a \"Fully featured Fielding System\" which allows \"full control of the field\". The Ball Physics in the game has been labelled as having \"realistic edges and ball movement off players\". Appeal and Electric Reviews have also been included into the game, which enables a user to challenge the umpire for a decision in which is questionable. There are Practice nets and Match practice which are new features to the game and are supposed to help a new 'cricketing gamer' to play the game. Users can also save games online and offline. The commentary team consists of Matthew Hill and David Basheer.\nThere are 11 unlicensed grounds within the game, with 2 licensed. The game includes 79 teams within the game, most of which are unlicensed. There are international and domestic teams (current generation) historical teams and future generation teams. There are 17 international teams, 6 Australian domestic teams, 18 English domestic, along with \"All time best\" teams and \"historical\" teams.\nDevelopment.\nAccording to Ross Symons, CEO of Big Ant Studios, development of the game was hindered by the parallel development of \"Ashes Cricket 2013\", an officially licensed rival cricket game. Symons claims that the developers of \"Ashes Cricket 2013\" applied pressure via the Australian Cricket Board to warn various partners off his game, while the eventual poor reception to \"Ashes Cricket 2013\" forced him to delay \"Don Bradman Cricket 14\" as not to be caught up in the controversy.\nThe game was built using a Big Ant Studios-built game engine written in Assembly language and C++.\nReception.\n\"Don Bradman Cricket 14\" has received positive reviews from critics. Tristan Ogilvie of IGN rated the console version 6.8/10, praising the \"comprehensive control setup\" and \"License-dodging player creation\", but also criticized the high amount of bugs, lack of field radars and unrealistic super-fielders. However, the PC version was rated 8/10 by IGN, who later believed that the fixes made it in the interim turned it into \"easily the finest and fully-featured cricket game ever made\". Dene Benham of NZGamer gave the game 7.9/10, praising the batting and bowling aspects, but criticized the clunky menus and twitchy animations. Critical Hit awarded it 8.7 citing it as \"the best cricket game of last generation\".\nSequel.\nBig Ant Studios have announced on the planetcricket forum that they are currently working on a sequel titled \" Don Bradman Cricket 17\". They have taken voice commentary samples from the fans to add diversity to the game.\nOn 28 May 2016, BigAnt Studios officially announced Don Bradman Cricket 17 for PS4, Xbox One and PC, which was released in late December 2016. Academy Demo was made available on Steam."

        "title": "Dale Jones (American football)",
        "text": "Marvin Dale Jones (born March 8, 1963) is an American football coach and former player. He was most recently the defensive coordinator for Appalachian State. He served in various capacities for Appalachian State (1996–2022), including three years as defensive coordinator (2010–2012). Jones previously worked as a defensive coordinator for Georgia Military College (1992–1996) and the Parma Panthers (1990) of the Italian Football League (IFL).\nJones played linebacker at the University of Tennessee, where he was a member of the 1985 \"Sugar Vols\" squad, and was a captain of the 1986 team. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the 10th round of the 1987 NFL Draft, and played during the 1987 NFL strike as a replacement player.\nEarly years.\nJones was born in Lee County, Virginia, the second from the youngest of 13 children. After his family moved to Cleveland, Tennessee he attended Bradley Central High School, where he was twice named All-State at defensive end. However, college recruiters had questions over his size (he weighed less than 180 pounds his senior year). For a whole summer, he would work all day on a farm in his hometown and then run six miles home at night.\nHe turned down a scholarship from Tennessee State University and instead chose to spend a year at the Tennessee Military Institute— a prep school— while gaining extra weight and muscle mass. Working with long-time coach Bill Dupes, Jones led the TMI squad in tackles in 1981, and was a team captain. He also gained nearly 30 pounds.\nCollege career.\nJones's performance at TMI caught the attention of University of Tennessee coaches, and he was finally offered a scholarship. He was injured prior to the 1982 season, however, and redshirted.\n1983 season.\nHe began the 1983 season as the third-string right outside linebacker, but still received playing time due to injuries to the Vols' starting linebackers. He had 6 tackles in the opener against Pittsburgh, and had two tackles-for-loss in the team's 41–34 victory over Alabama.\nHe led all players with 14 tackles in Tennessee's 30–23 victory over Maryland in the 1983 Florida Citrus Bowl. He finished the season with 77 tackles (43 solo), 2 sacks and 7 tackles-for-loss. He registered 11 \"big plays,\" second only to teammate Reggie White's phenomenal 29. He was named to the Freshman All-American team by \"The Football News\".\n1984 season.\nAs part of a linebacker corps that included future NFL players Reggie McKenzie, Alvin Toles and Carl Zander, Jones opened the 1984 season with 12 tackles in Tennessee's 34–27 win over Washington State. In the Vols' loss to Auburn, Jones stuffed running back Brent Fullwood at the one-yard line, causing a fumble and preventing a touchdown.\nHe had 13 tackles in Tennessee's 28–27 win over Alabama. He finished the season as the team's leader in \"big plays,\" with 4 sacks, 4 forced fumbles (led the team), and 7 tackles-for-loss. His 109 total tackles was second only to Zander's 167. He was named to the Sophomore All-American team by \"The Football News\".\n1985 season.\nJones is frequently recalled as the \"emotional leader\" of the 1985 \"Sugar Vols\" squad. In Tennessee's 38–20 upset of #1 Auburn on September 28, Jones led a swarming defense that held eventual Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson to 80 yards on 17 carries (Jackson entered the game averaging over 200 yards per game for the season). Following the team's 17–10 loss to Florida on October 12, Jones rallied the team with a locker room speech in which he declared, \"This is the only game we're going to lose all year.\"\nThe biggest play of Jones's career came in Tennessee's win over Alabama, which took place at Legion Field on October 19. After Tennessee's star quarterback Tony Robinson left the game with an injury, Alabama seized the momentum and scored a touchdown to cut the lead to 16–14, and had driven into Tennessee territory for what would have been the go-ahead score, when Jones tipped a pass from quarterback Mike Shula and caught it as he fell to the ground for a drive-killing interception. Jones also recovered a fumble late in the 3rd quarter that set up Tennessee's third field goal.\nIn Tennessee's 6–6 tie against Georgia Tech on October 26, Jones batted away a 3rd-down pass by John Dewberry to force the Yellow Jackets to settle for a field goal early in the first quarter, and was named \"SEC Lineman of the Week\" for his overall performance. In the Vols' 34–14 win over Ole Miss, Jones had two third-quarter sacks, both of which forced Ole Miss to punt from their own end zone.\nIn Tennessee's upset of Miami in the 1986 Sugar Bowl, Jones had 7 tackles as a part of a defensive effort that held the Hurricanes' high-scoring offense to just 7 points. Jones sacked Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde twice for -38 yards, including a crucial sack late in the second quarter that forced Miami to settle for a long, unsuccessful field goal attempt.\nJones finished the 1985 season with 82 tackles (59 solo), 5 sacks, 9 tackles-for-loss, 5 forced fumbles, and 4 pass deflections as the Vols finished 9–1–2. He was named All-SEC, 3rd-team All-American and SEC defensive lineman of the year honors from the Atlanta Touchdown Club.\n1986 season.\nJones was a tri-captain of Tennessee's 1986 squad, and was named to \"Playboy\"'s preseason All-American team. The Vols struggled to a 2–5 start before winning their final four games to secure a winning season. Jones had 11 tackles (2 for minus yardage) and a fumble recovery in Tennessee's 21–14 victory over Minnesota in the 1986 Liberty Bowl, and was named the game's \"Outstanding Defensive Player.\"\nJones finished the 1986 season with 88 tackles (53 solo), 4.5 sacks, and 2 tackles-for-loss. He was again named All-SEC, and received All-American honorable mention by the Associated Press.\nRecords and legacy.\nDuring his four years at Tennessee, Jones amassed 349 total tackles (233 solo), 14.5 sacks, 24 tackles-for-loss, and 11 forced fumbles. As of the 2012 season, he was tied with Rico McCoy for 9th place on the school's career tackles list. He is tied with Keith DeLong for seventh place in career solo tackles, and is fourth in tackles-for-loss behind Leonard Little, Reggie White and Eric Westmoreland. He is second in forced fumbles behind Andy Spiva, who had 14 from 1973 to 1976.\nTennessee coach Johnny Majors described Jones as \"one of the greatest leaders I ever had.\" He stated that Jones \"personifies what college football is all about to the highest degree,\" and noted, \"I have never seen a young man in my life that it meant more to play for one particular school than it does for Dale Jones to play at Tennessee.\"\nJones remains one of the best-known former Tennessee defenders, achieving what \"Knoxville News Sentinel\" reporter Mike Strange describes as \"folk-hero status\" among Vol fans. In a 2005 article, reporter John Painter wrote, \"Mention Dale Jones is making an appearance in Knoxville and chances are it would resemble 'Jimmy Buffett Night' in Key West. Gonna draw a crowd.\"\nHe was honored as a Vol \"Legend of the Game\" during Tennessee's game against Alabama on October 25, 2014.\nProfessional career.\nJones was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 10th round (262nd overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. He was waived on September 1. On September 2, he was claimed off waivers by the Houston Oilers. He was released on September 6.\nAfter the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. In September, he was re-signed to be a part of the Cowboys replacement team, that was given the mock name \"Rhinestone Cowboys\" by the media and started in three games at left outside linebacker. Against the New York Jets on October 4, he posted 6 tackles and one fumble recovery. In the win over the Philadelphia Eagles on October 11, he recovered a fumble and returned it 26 yards to the 1-yard line. In the game against the Washington Redskins on October 19, a hit by Jones knocked Redskins quarterback Ed Rubbert out of the game in the first quarter, ironically, this allowed Jones's former college teammate, backup quarterback Tony Robinson, to enter the game and lead the Redskins to a 13–7 upset victory. He was again released after the strike ended on October 26.\nCoaching career.\nJones returned to Tennessee as a graduate assistant in 1989. The following year, he was hired as defensive coordinator of the Italian League Parma Panthers, joining former high school and college teammate Chris White. After a year with the Panthers, he joined the Florida Gators staff as an assistant in 1991. Later that year, he was hired as the linebackers and defensive backs coach at Georgia Military College, and was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1992.\nIn 1996, Jones was hired by Appalachian State head coach Jerry Moore as the Mountaineers' defensive line and special teams coach. In 2005, he switched to linebackers coach. He was elevated to defensive coordinator for the 2010 season, helping to engineer the Mountaineers' transition to a 3-4 defense. Following Moore's retirement in 2012, long-time Wofford assistant Nate Woody was hired as defensive coordinator as part of the new staff assembled by Moore's successor, Scott Satterfield. Jones returned to his earlier position of defensive line coach. Prior to the 2014 season, he switched to inside linebackers coach.\nDuring Jones's initial tenure as defensive line coach, eight of his lineman moved on to play in the NFL, six received FCS All-American honors, and 15 were All-Southern Conference. Two, Josh Jeffries (2002) and K.T. Stovall (2003), received the Southern Conference Defensive Player of the Year award. Jones was named \"Special Teams Coordinator of the Year\" by \"American Football Monthly\" in 2002. Players Jones has worked with at Appalachian State who would go on to play in the NFL include Marques Murrell, D.J. Smith, Demetrius McCray, Jeremy Kimbrough and Jason Hunter. He also recruited punter Sam Martin.\nOn January 4, 2019, he followed head coach Scott Satterfield to the University of Louisville and was named the new inside linebackers coach.\nOn January 15, 2020, Appalachian State announced that Jones had agreed to return as defensive coordinator under new head coach Shawn Clark. Following the 2022 season, head coach Shawn Clark announced that Jones' contract wouldn't be renewed."

        "text": "U Sports men's ice hockey is the highest level of play of men's ice hockey at the university level and operates under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As of the 2018 season, 48 teams from Canadian universities are divided into three athletic conferences, drawing from three regional associations of U Sports: Canada West Universities Athletic Association, Ontario University Athletics, and Atlantic University Sport. At the end of every season, eight teams compete for the David Johnston University Cup, awarded to the U Sports Men's Hockey Championship team.\nHistory.\nThe Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union was established in 1961 by Major W.J. McLeod, Athletic Director of the Royal Military College of Canada. By the 1962-63 season, the CIAU had created a National Championship for their ice hockey playoffs: the David Johnston University Cup.\nThe first ever national championship was competed for in Kingston, Ontario between the UBC Thunderbirds and the McMaster Marlins. The Marlins won the game 3-2.\nThe CIAU had competition in Canadian post-secondary varsity hockey at a national level, but rivalries only existed on an exhibition basis. The Canadian Colleges Athletic Association, now Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association, held national championships between 1975 and 2001. At one time, seven conferences in the CCAA sanctioned hockey, but only two do today — the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference and the Quebec Student Sport Federation (now known by its French initialism of RSEQ).\nIn 1978, the governing body of the league changed its name to the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union. The body's name was changed in 2001 to Canadian Interuniversity Sport, and most recently in 2016, to the current U Sports.\nThe most successful team in U Sports history is the Alberta Golden Bears with 16 David Johnston University Cup titles, winning 28% of all championships awarded to date. This is followed by the Toronto Varsity Blues (last in 1984) and the UNB Reds (last in 2024) with 10 championships apiece. The reigning champions are the UNB Reds, who defeated the UQTR Patriotes 4-0 in Toronto, Ontario in March 2024.\nOn April 4, 2016, St. Thomas University announced the discontinuation of their men's hockey program, reducing the teams participating in the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference to seven. \nOn August 12, 2016, Kori Cheverie was announced as an assistant coach for the Ryerson Rams men’s ice hockey team, making her the first female full-time assistant coach in U Sports men’s hockey history.\nThe MacEwan Griffins and Trinity Western Spartans joined the Canada West conference beginning with the 2020-21 season. However, the Lethbridge Pronghorns announced the discontinuation of their hockey programs following the 2019-20 season due to budgetary constraints. Furthermore, following the cancellation of the 2020–21 season, the Laurentian Voyageurs discontinued their men's ice hockey program in 2021 leaving U Sports with 35 men's ice hockey teams.\nTeams.\nFormer teams.\nThe following schools previously sponsored ice hockey but currently do not field a varsity men's team.\nAwards.\nThe following are annual U Sports trophies and awards:"

        "title": "List of AFC Wimbledon records and statistics",
        "text": " AFC Wimbledon is an English professional association football club, based at Plough Lane in Wimbledon, Greater London. The club was formed on 30 May 2002 by supporters of Wimbledon Football Club, led by Kris Stewart, Marc Jones and Trevor Williams who strongly opposed the decision of an independent commission appointed by the FA to allow the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes, to be subsequently rebranded as MK Dons.\nThe club was accepted into the Combined Counties League for the 2002–03 season and proceeded to rise through the non-League system, winning five promotions in nine seasons to return to the Football League less than a decade after the original Wimbledon Football Club had still been competing in the top flight of English football. AFC Wimbledon's average home attendance at league fixtures for their first season exceeded 3,000 – higher than the average attendance in the same season of Wimbledon F.C., who were still playing in the First Division (now the Football League Championship).\nThis list encompasses the major honours won by AFC Wimbledon and records set by the club, its managers and its players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made the most competitive first-team appearances. The club's attendance records are also included in the list.\nAs of 2020, AFC Wimbledon still hold the record for the longest run of unbeaten league games at any level of senior football in the United Kingdom. The club remained unbeaten for 78 league matches between 26 February 2003 (a 3–1 away win at Chessington United) and 27 November 2004 (a 2–1 away win at Bashley).\nThe club's record appearance maker is defender Barry Fuller, who made 233 appearances in all competitions between 2013 and 2018 and the club's record goalscorer is Kevin Cooper, who scored 104 goals in 99 appearances in all competitions between 2002 and 2004.\nHonours.\nFollowing the move of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes and its rebranding as Milton Keynes Dons, there was much debate over the rightful home of all the honours won by Wimbledon F.C.. Former supporters argued that the trophies won by Wimbledon F.C. rightfully belong to the community of Wimbledon and should be returned to the local area. AFC Wimbledon believe that the honours of Wimbledon F.C. belong to the fans, as illustrated by the following statement on the club's official website:\nIn October 2006, an agreement was reached between Milton Keynes Dons F.C., the MK Dons Supporters Association, the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association and the Football Supporters Federation. The replica of the FA Cup plus all club patrimony gathered under the name of Wimbledon F.C. would be returned to the London Borough of Merton. Ownership of trademarks and website domain names related to Wimbledon F.C. would also be transferred to the Borough. It was also agreed that any reference made to Milton Keynes Dons F.C. should refer only to events after 7 August 2004, the date of the first league match played as Milton Keynes Dons. As a result of this deal, the Football Supporters Federation announced that the supporters of Milton Keynes Dons would be permitted to become members of the federation, and that it would no longer appeal to the supporters of other clubs to boycott MK Dons matches. The replica trophies and Wimbledon F.C. memorabilia were returned to Merton on 2 August 2007.\nHonours.\n\"Only honours won by AFC Wimbledon are listed here. For a list of honours won by Wimbledon F.C., see Wimbledon F.C. Honours\"\nPlayers.\nMost league appearances.\nFootball League era (2011–present).\nThe following table shows the 10 players who have made the most appearances for AFC Wimbledon in Football League matches as well as all major Football League cup competitions in descending order. The statistics only incorporate appearances made by players since AFC Wimbledon gained promotion to the Football League in 2011. In instances where two players have the same total number of appearances, higher number of total starts shall be given precedence when determining ranking.

        "text": "The Dutch Lions is the Dutch national American Football team. The team represents the Netherlands in international competition and is made up entirely of Dutch national players, typically but not exclusively playing in the AFBN and GFL competitions.\nHistory.\nThe Lions first competed internationally in 1986. After failing to progress further than the first qualification round in 1987 (in Finland) and 1989 (in Germany), they achieved a 3rd-place finish in the 1991 European Championship in Finland. However, after failing to qualify for the tournament in 1993, combined with upheaval at home within the Dutch governing bodies, the Dutch National Team was to face a long absence from international competition.\nNine years after their previous incarnation, the Dutch returned to the international American Football scene in 2002 under the name Dutch Lions, finishing 5th in the 2003 EFAF C Group European Championship in Denmark after losses to Russia and Italy. Two more losses, this time to Switzerland and Norway in the 2007 EFAF C Group European Championship, led to another 5th place. Five years later, under new head coach Winston Ronde, the Lions improved on those results by finishing 3rd in the 2012 EFAF C Group Championship, this time in Austria, with a close loss to Serbia and a win over Russia.\nIn 2013 and 2014, the Lions played a series of practice games against Poland, Belgium, Czech Republic and Catalonia, losing only the game against Czech Republic in Prague. In 2015, head coach Winston Ronde resigned, and was replaced by Reyhan Agaoglu. After an away loss in a practice game against Switzerland, the Dutch Lions succeeded in qualifying for the 2016 European Championship Qualifying Tournament by defeating rivals Belgium in Waalwijk.\nThe Lions played host to Ireland in their first ever international practice game, again in Waalwijk, in 2016 as a warm up to the upcoming tournament in the United Kingdom. The Lions were comfortably ahead 20-0 when the game was abandoned early in the third quarter due to lightning.\nIn September 2016 the Dutch Lions travelled to Worcester, United Kingdom to compete in the qualifying tournament for the 2018 European Championship. Despite leading 13-0 at half time, an injury to Quarterback Richard Bouthoorn contributed to a heartbreaking 20-13 loss in the semi-final, thereby ending the dreams of competing in the 2018 finals. The Netherlands bounced back in the bronze medal game to defeat Russia 17-6. The Lions ended the 2016 season by taking a makeshift squad to face Poland in Lublin in an exhibition game, losing comprehensively 42-14.\nIn August 2017, it was revealed by the Belgian American Football Federation that American Football Bond Nederland had made the decision to put the Dutch Lions programme on hold until 2018. After the resignation of head coach Reyhan Agaoglu, the federation planned to announce a new head coach after the summer of 2017. \nThe Dutch Lions have never qualified for the IFAF World Championship."

        "text": "The men's track time trial in Cycling at the 1996 Summer Olympics was a time trial race in which each of the twenty cyclists attempted to set the fastest time for four laps (1 kilometre) of the track. The race was held on Wednesday, July 24, 1996 at the Stone Mountain Velodrome. There were 20 competitors from 20 nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist. The event was won by Florian Rousseau of France, the nation's first victory in the men's track trial since 1968 and fourth overall (most of any nation, leading multiple others by two). Erin Hartwell of the United States took silver, becoming the fourth man to win multiple medals in the event. Japan won its first track time trial medal with Takanobu Jumonji's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The returning cyclists from 1992 were silver medalist Shane Kelly of Australia, bronze medalist Erin Hartwell of the United States, eighth-place finisher Gene Samuel of Trinidad and Tobago, ninth-place finisher Dirk Jan van Hameren of the Netherlands, twelfth-place finisher Aleksandr Kirichenko of the Unified Team (also the 1988 gold medalist for the Soviet Union, and now competing for Russia), thirteenth-place finisher Christian Meidlinger of Austria, and twentieth-place finisher Grzegorz Krejner of Poland. Kelly was the reigning world champion and world record holder, as well. Kelly and two-time (1993 and 1994) world champion Florian Rousseau of France were the favorites.\nRussia and Ukraine each made their debut in the men's track time trial. France made its 17th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nErin Hartwell broke the Olympic record with a time of 1:02.940. Florian Rousseau later bettered that, finishing in 1:02.712.\nResults.\nHartwell's Olympic-record race gave him the lead until the last two riders, favorites Rousseau and Kelly (guaranteeing Hartwell a rare second medal to add to his 1992 bronze). Rousseau outdid Hartwell's time, dropping the Olympic record further. Kelly, however, had his foot slip from his toe clip shortly after starting and did not finish."

        "text": "The World Series Cricket Cavaliers XI was a cricket team formed to play in World Series Cricket. Taking the International Cavaliers as its inspiration, the team was envisaged as a way of giving those players under contract to the WSC organisation, but not picked regularly for one of the three main teams (Australia XI, the West Indies XI and the Rest Of The World XI) regular match play and opportunities to win prize money. The team was formed in 1978, before the start of the second season of World Series Cricket, with a tour of Australia scheduled to take place at the same time as the main competition. This would see the Cavaliers play each of the other three WSC teams at a range of smaller venues around Australia between November 1978 and February 1979.\nCavaliers XI Country Tour 1978/79.\nFollowing the end of the 1977/78 World Series Cricket season, Kerry Packer's organisation signed up a second tranche of players to participate in the series. The consequence of this was that there were invariably more players available than there were places in the three WSC teams. To compensate for those players who were not being selected regularly, a new side was formed in 1978 that would undertake a tour of Australia. The plan was for this new side, which came to be called the \"Cavaliers XI\", to take on each of the other three WSC teams in turn in a series of both one-day and two-day games. The schedule would see whichever of the three teams was not playing either a Supertest or an International Cup game taking on Cavaliers XI. This ensured not only that the \"fringe\" players got both match practice and access to prize money on offer by playing for the Cavaliers, but also that the other teams were also able to continue playing during \"downtime\" periods when they were not in the main WSC schedule. It had the further effect of bringing World Series Cricket to a number of smaller venues around the country, rather than restricting it to playing in the major cities.\nThe Country Tour for Cavaliers XI eventually encompassed a total of 9 two-day games and 15 one-day games. These were scheduled in four separate blocks. The first three games were all one-day, with each scheduled against one of the other WSC teams and played in Western Australia. This was followed by a two-week tour of Queensland against West Indies XI, then another two-week tour of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) against Australia, with a final three-week stint against Rest Of The World XI, again in Victoria and NSW. The final game saw Cavaliers XI take on West Indies XI in a two-day game in Tasmania.\nCavaliers XI overall record"

        "text": "Me1 vs Me2 Snooker with Richard Herring is the world's longest running snooker podcast, presented by stand-up comedian Richard Herring. First published in December 2011 it peaked at number one in the iTunes charts of the same month. In each podcast Richard Herring performs against himself in a game of snooker (typically in the guise of the titular sportsmen Me1 and Me2). \nIt is not only notable for being the only audio podcast (to date) which actually incorporates the game of snooker within it, but for the subtext of a man satirising mental health issues and \"fighting against a tide of mediocrity and repetition, struggling to create a brave, new and original vision.\" As of 14 September 2023, 168 frames have been played for the podcast - with the scores, amazingly, sitting at 80-80.\nOrigins.\nRichard Herring had found success with other podcasts such as the award-winning \"Collings and Herrin\" which had made a successful transition to BBC Radio 6 Music in 2010. His move into snooker podcasting originated through tweeting a live commentary of a game of snooker he played against himself backstage at a comedy club, what started as a joke became something more serious. Herring stated \"I attempt to antagonise and lose listeners by commentating on myself playing snooker against myself in my basement. Most people are baffled, confused, even angry about it. But 5,000 people around the world tune in to find out which me will win this week's frame.\"\nFilmed and live performances.\nFilmed versions of the snooker podcast act as bonus features for Herring's stand-up DVDs \"What Is Love Anyway\" (2012) and \"Talking Cock\" (2013), which both feature special cup performances. August 2013 saw the first ever frame of Me1 vs Me2 Snooker to be played in front of a live paying audience at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In 2016 a five frame match was filmed and performed at the Tempting Failure Festival dedicated to transgressive art. On 4 December 2019 a live performance was given in front of an audience (and filmed for the Kickstarter) for the 2019 \"Chris Evans (not that one) Trophy\" at the Cockpit Theatre in London.\nIn July 2020, a special filmed performance was broadcast on BBC Two. Since Frame 103 in August 2020 – when the podcast returned from a hiatus of several months during the Covid-19 lockdown – matches have been live-streamed on the video streaming service Twitch and subsequently made available on-demand via Herring's Twitch and YouTube channels. The traditional audio-only versions continue to be released as the podcast. During this time, the format has expanded further to include occasional knockout tournaments and leagues featuring matches between other numbered versions of Herring besides the familiar Me1 and Me2, each with their own personalities and characteristics.\nMedia coverage.\nIn July 2013 the \"Huffington Post\" described the podcast as being \"representative of the diversity of podcasting.\" \"Time Out\" pre-emptively described the event as one of the top ten Edinburgh Fringe comedy highlights of 2013 stating that listeners \"will either have to giggle away at the ridiculous concept, or become deeply irritated.\" In April 2014 Helen Zaltzman and Olly Mann interviewed Herring about the podcast on BBC Radio 4, which premiered clips of self-playing snooker on the radio of the first time. In the same month \"The Telegraph\" included \"Me1 vs Me2 Snooker\" in its list of top podcasts describing it as a \"wonderfully oddball, regularly hilarious series - in which Herring splits into two versions of himself… other over a long drawn-out game of snooker\"."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2015)",
        "text": "The 2015 Royal Rumble was the 28th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on January 25, 2015, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was the second Royal Rumble held at this venue after the 2004 event, when it was formerly known as Wachovia Center; the arena changed its name to Wells Fargo Center in 2010. It was also the first Royal Rumble to livestream on the WWE Network, which launched in February 2014. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2015 event, the winner received a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 31.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Roman Reigns won the 2015 Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Rusev. Also on the event's card, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Miz and Damien Mizdow to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, while WWE World Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar successfully defended his title against Seth Rollins and John Cena in a triple threat match in the penultimate match.\nLike the previous year's event, the 2015 Royal Rumble was mared by a strongly negative audience reaction to the Royal Rumble match, which was won by Roman Reigns. The event as a whole, however, received mixed reviews, with the WWE World Heavyweight Championship triple threat match receiving the most praise from critics and fans. The event received 145,000 buys (excluding WWE Network views), down from the previous year's 467,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2015, the winner received a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 31. Announced on October 7, 2014, the 2015 event was the 28th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 25, 2015, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was the second Royal Rumble held at this venue after the 2004 event, when it was formerly known as Wachovia Center; the arena changed its name to Wells Fargo Center in 2010. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, the event was available through WWE's livestreaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February 2014, which made it the first Royal Rumble to air on the WWE Network.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nAt SummerSlam, Brock Lesnar defeated John Cena and won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Cena would receive his rematch the following month at Night of Champions which he would win by disqualification after Seth Rollins interfered and attempted to cash-in his Money in the Bank contract. At the next event, Hell in a Cell, Cena defeated Authority member Randy Orton in a Hell in a Cell match to earn a future title shot at Lesnar. The Authority was then removed from power after losing the 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match at Survivor Series with Cena being the only one who could bring them back if he chose to. At , Cena faced Rollins in a tables match which he won to retain his number one contender status. Later in the event, it was announced that Cena would face Lesnar for the title at the Royal Rumble. On the final \"Raw\" of 2014, Rollins attacked special guest host Edge and threatened to perform a Curb Stomp on him if Cena did not reinstate The Authority. Cena came down to save Edge but reluctantly brought The Authority back after Rollins held Edge hostage. On the January 5, 2015, episode of \"Raw\", Rollins was added to the Lesnar-Cena title match by Triple H as a reward for bringing back The Authority, turning the singles match into a Triple Threat. That same episode, the members of Team Cena from Survivor Series (Dolph Ziggler, Ryback, and Erick Rowan) were fired by The Authority for helping Cena to remove them from power. The following week, Lesnar returned for the contract signing with Cena and Rollins. A brawl broke out between all three men and ended when Rollins performed a Curb Stomp each on Cena and Lesnar. On the final \"Raw\" before the Royal Rumble, Triple H forced Cena to compete in a 3-on-1 Handicap match against Rollins, Big Show and Kane to not only secure his spot in the Triple Threat match, but also win Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan their jobs back. During the match, Sting, who previously assisted Team Cena at Survivor Series, caused a distraction which allowed Cena to roll-up Rollins for the win to keep his spot in the match and reinstate Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan. Lesnar then came down to the ring and attacked Rollins before executing an F-5 each on Kane and Big Show. Rollins then retreated to avoid further punishment.\nOn the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Miz and Damien Mizdow to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the January 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that The Usos would defend the titles against Miz and Mizdow at the event.\nOn the January 5 episode of \"Raw\", Paige came out and helped Natalya to defeat Nikki Bella. On the January 6 episode of \"Main Event\", Natalya came out and helped Paige to defeat Nikki Bella. On the January 12 episode of \"Raw\", Brie Bella defeated Paige due to distraction by Tyson Kidd. On the January 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", Natalya defeated Nikki via submission. On the January 19 episode of \"Raw\", after Paige and Natalya defeated Summer Rae and Alicia Fox, it was announced that The Bella Twins (Brie and Nikki) would face Paige and Natalya in a tag team match at the event.\nOn the January 5 episode of \"Raw\", Cesaro and Tyson Kidd attacked Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, which let Adam Rose to defeat Big E. On the January 19, episode of \"Raw\", Big E and Kofi defeated Cesaro and Kidd. Later in the night, it was announced that The New Day would face Cesaro, Kidd and Rose in a six-man tag team elimination match on the Royal Rumble Kickoff Show. On January 25, it was changed to a tag team match with Cesaro and Kidd (accompanied by Rose) vs. Big E and Kingston (accompanied by Woods) due to Woods being unable to compete.\nOn the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) made their WWE debut. Over the next few weeks, the duo would easily defeat local preliminary wrestlers and compare themselves to famous tag teams, like The Road Warriors. On the January 19 episode of \"Raw\", the Ascension were confronted and attacked by the New World Order(nWo), the APA and New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg) after the Ascension interfered in the nWo reunion segment. Later in the night, it was announced that the Ascension would face the New Age Outlaws at the event.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show, Cesaro and Tyson Kidd (accompanied by Adam Rose and Natalya) faced The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston, accompanied by Xavier Woods). Kingston and Big E were in control for most of the match until Cesaro executed a European uppercut on Kingston (from the outside) and Kidd executed a fisherman's neckbreaker on Kingston to secure a decisive victory.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) facing The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn). The Ascension had control for the majority of the match, however, Gunn came back with a tilt-a-whirl slam and positioned Viktor for the \"Famouser\". Viktor made a blind tag to Konnor and executed the \"Fall of Man\" on Gunn for the win.\nNext was the WWE Tag Team Championship match between The Miz and Damien Mizdow and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). During the match, The Miz refused to tag Mizdow into the match, but Mizdow made a few saves. Miz executed a \"Skull Crushing Finale\" on Jey for a near-fall. Mizdow did the same to Jey but earned a near-fall again. The Usos won the match with a \"Samoan Splash\" on Miz.\nAfter that, The Bella Twins (Brie Bella and Divas Champion Nikki Bella) faced Paige and Natalya. Nikki executed a forearm smash on Natalya for the victory.\nIn the fourth match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match. Lesnar dominated the match early with multiple Suplexes on both Cena and Rollins, at one point even executing a double German suplex on Rollins' associates J&amp;J Security, briefly taking them out of the match. Lesnar then applied the Kimura Lock on Cena, but Rollins broke it up. Cena executed an Attitude Adjustment on Lesnar, but Rollins threw Cena out of the ring to steal a pin attempt, but Lesnar kicked out at one. Lesnar caught Rollins and executed an F-5 on him, but Cena broke up the pin. Cena executed three more Attitude Adjustments on Lesnar, but Rollins broke up the pin. Rollins then executed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar, but Cena broke up the pin. Cena tackled Lesnar through the barricade in the timekeeper's area, threw him to the steel steps, hit him with the same steel steps putting him on an announce table and Rollins finished the combo with a Diving Elbow Drop on him through it. Doctors came from backstage to check on and eventually attempt to stretcher out Lesnar. Cena eventually locked in the STF on Rollins, but J&amp;J Security (Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury) interfered once more, resulting in Cena executing a Double Attitude Adjustment on Mercury and Noble, finally ending their involvement in the match. Cena then executed an Attitude Adjustment on Rollins and Rollins would execute a Curb Stomp on Cena in turn with both resulting in near-falls. Eventually, Rollins took Cena down and performed a Phoenix Splash on him, and was about to cover Cena. But; an angry Lesnar quickly recovered from the broken announcers table and rushed past the EMTs sent to check on him, returned to the ring, took down both men with German suplexes and one of those threw Cena out of the ring. Rollins tried to take advantage after landing on his feet after an attempted German from Lesnar failed; hit Lesnar twice with his Money in the Bank briefcase, and positioned the briefcase under Lesnar's head. As Rollins attempted a second Curb Stomp to Lesnar (with the briefcase still underneath his head), Lesnar countered with a second F-5 on Rollins to retain the title by pinfall.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the traditional 30-man Royal Rumble match, where the winner would receive a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 31. The Miz and R-Truth started the match at #1 and #2 respectively. Bubba Ray Dudley made his return to WWE at #3 eliminating Miz and Truth. Bray Wyatt at #5 would soon begin a string of eliminations one by one (including Bubba and The Boogeyman, who was another surprise entrant at #7). The string ended once Daniel Bryan entered at #10. During the string, Curtis Axel, who was supposed to enter at #6, was attacked by Erick Rowan and was unable to compete in the match.\nDiamond Dallas Page was the third surprise entrant at #14 and executed the Diamond Cutter on various wrestlers, before being eliminated by #15 entrant U.S. Champion Rusev. Like in 2014, the rumble reception entered again to a turning point for worse, when Wyatt eliminated Bryan (the biggest fan-favorite) enraging almost all the audience even more than previous year due to his absence. Towards the end of the match, Kane at #24 and Big Show at #29 from The Authority teamed up to go on a string of eliminations (including Wyatt and other fan-favorites like Ryback at #23, Dolph Ziggler at final #30 and Dean Ambrose at #25, who was teaming up with Roman Reigns at #19 as The Shield against the duo).\nThe Final Four consisted of Rusev (who was outside the ring at the time having gone under the bottom rope), Reigns, Kane and Show. Reigns (who during the match suffered a cut from Show on one cheek, after being thrown to a padded turnbuckle and another one from Kane on the lips, after a Big Boot) eliminated the duo at the same time. However, they both re-entered the ring and began a double team assault on Reigns. The Rock emerged and executed a Spinebuster-People's Elbow combo on Kane. Show attempted to Chokeslam Rock, but Rock hit a low-blow on Show, setting up a Rock Bottom, after a Superman Punch from Reigns. Rusev re-entered the ring, but was Speared by Reigns, who proceeded to eliminate him to win the match. As WWE World Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman saw this on a TV in their locker room, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon showed up at the end of the show unhappy with the result as Rock congratulated Reigns. Almost all the audience booed Reigns as the winner even more than Batista the previous year, whereas at the same event, Reigns was cheered.\nReception.\nThe very negative reaction of the fans attending the event in Philadelphia towards the Royal Rumble match and its winner was described as being even worse than the 2014 event. When Daniel Bryan was eliminated in the first half of the match, the crowd repeatedly chanted his name for the second half of the match while booing other wrestlers making their entrance to the match, including eventual winner Roman Reigns. The crowd grew even more unhappy when fan favorites Dolph Ziggler and Dean Ambrose were eliminated, and chanted for the anti-American villain Rusev when the main event came down to Rusev and Reigns, as well as chants of \"bullshit\" and \"CM Punk\". Reigns was booed after winning the main event, even after he received The Rock's endorsement, and The Rock was heckled for helping Reigns. Many fans took to social media to display their displeasure at Bryan's elimination.\nDave Scherer of \"PWInsider\" wrote that the event \"is definitely worth watching for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship triple threat match and how the Rumble went bad\". He added that \"bringing Bryan back for this match was a huge mistake, at least tonight\", as \"the fans wanted Bryan and they took him away\", with the result that it \"totally killed Roman in the eyes of those fans\", resulting in a \"really bad\" ending.\nJames Caldwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" rated the Royal Rumble main event as 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting that it was a \"pretty good Rumble\" until \"the crowd turned on the match when they saw the writing on the wall for how it would end\". Caldwell praised Bray Wyatt's involvement in the match and noted that Bubba Ray Dudley was a \"good surprise return\", but added that any good moments during the match were \"overshadowed by the ending\". Caldwell rated the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match as 4.0 out of 5 stars, praising the \"very strong story-telling\" and describing the action as \"top-notch\" but adding that the match was \"too dependent on the finisher kick-outs\". He rated the Tag Team Championship match at 2.5 stars, describing it as a \"solid tag match\", while the Divas match and the opening bout between The Ascension and The New Age Outlaws were both rated at 1.5 stars out of 5.\nKenny Herzog of \"Rolling Stone\" questioned the possibility of the Royal Rumble match being the worst in history, arguing that several factors such as the poor treatment of former Intercontinental champions, Daniel Bryan's unexpected early elimination and Kane and Big Show's dominance over younger talent all detracted from the match. Herzog concluded, \"That was less a Rumble match – i.e. the kind replete with feats of endurance and athleticism, free-for-all chaos and dozens of developing stories – than random gauntlet of triple-threat and four-way slugfests with no pacing or point. Unless, that is, you still think serving some idea of the Authority's omnipresence is really what's best for business.\" Despite this, Herzog praised the lively Philadelphia crowd, the return of Bubba Ray Dudley and Rollins' performance in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match as positives.\nLuke Winkie of \"Sports Illustrated\" was less critical of the Royal Rumble match, attributing Bryan's elimination to good storytelling and an instance where \"you're supposed to hate the product\". Winkie suggested that the \"tepid reaction to [Reigns'] win has much more to do with Daniel Bryan’s early departure than it does with [Reigns'] actual reputation\". Winkie singled out Ziggler's late entrance and elimination as \"the most heartbreaking\". He also praised the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match as being an early \"Match of the Year\" candidate, while questioning whether anyone cared about the Ascension.\nWWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley, who had been critical of the previous year's show, wrote that he was saddened by the prospect of the Royal Rumble losing its luster and relevance as an annual event, and that he now considers it to be \"a roadblock to the good will and excitement needed for a truly memorable WrestleMania atmosphere.\" Foley took aim at WWE for the supposedly unimaginative and unflattering use of fan favorites in the main Royal Rumble match, and, based on his observations of fans as they exited the arena, said \"there was no joy in Philadelphia\".\nObserving the ensuing debates among wrestling enthusiasts, communications psychologist Carrrielynn Reinhard commented the online discourse highlighted fans' emotional attachment to wrestlers' fictional personas, similar to that of \"shippers\" in other fandoms.\nIn 2024, Roman Reigns spoke about his victory. He pointed that, after the bad reception by the public, he tries to forget about the Royal Rumble.\nAftermath.\nShortly after the event, #CancelWWENetwork became the top Twitter trend worldwide, while \"PWInsider\" reported that the WWE Network online cancellation page had crashed and that some subscribers who had called WWE to cancel their subscription were told to call back the next day as there were too many people attempting to manually cancel their subscription. The day after the Royal Rumble, Dave Meltzer reported on Wrestling Observer Radio that Vince McMahon and WWE had expected that Reigns's victory would receive some backlash, but not to the level they had experienced, and that despite this, WWE would not add Daniel Bryan to the main event at WrestleMania 31, since Vince felt that \"it would be a repeat and gone to the well one time too often\". Two days after the Royal Rumble event, WWE announced that the WWE Network surpassed 1 million subscribers worldwide, but the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" newsletter reported that the recent \"upset subscribers canceling\" had yet to be factored into the subscriber count. Four days after the Royal Rumble, WWE announced a new promotion for the WWE Network where new subscribers could watch for free for the month of February. In February 2015, WWE held a poll on WWE.com asking if fans thought Bryan or Reigns was more deserving of headlining WrestleMania 31; following more than 33,000 votes, 86% of votes went to Bryan. Also in that month, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon responded to #CancelWWENetwork in a conference call, saying that the controversy was good for WWE. McMahon labelled it as a vocal minority upset that \"the babyface did not win\" and \"Santa Claus didn't come on that PPV\", but he expected those who complained to continue watching WWE anyway.\nWWE had to postpone the post-Rumble \"Raw\" from Hartford, Connecticut due to the January 2015 nor'easter, marking the first time WWE had to cancel a scheduled \"Raw\" taping since the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide and the first time \"Raw\" had to be moved to another city since 2009. WWE also canceled its scheduled \"SmackDown\" taping from Boston the following night. WWE decided to have \"Raw\" come from WWE headquarters in nearby Stamford, Connecticut instead, announcing it would hold a live \"SmackDown\" on Thursday from Hartford, honoring tickets that would be used for \"Raw\", while allowing fans in Boston to either exchange their tickets for an upcoming house show on June 27 or obtaining a full refund. The post-Rumble \"Raw\" showed the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match and the main event of the Royal Rumble, albeit with commercial breaks. Seth Rollins, Brock Lesnar, Paul Heyman, Roman Reigns, and Daniel Bryan did in-studio interviews with several WWE announcers, such as Michael Cole, Renee Young and Byron Saxton, while Dean Ambrose \"walked\" to WWE headquarters from Hartford due to the statewide 9 PM travel ban.\nAlthough Curtis Axel being unable to participate in the Rumble match was not unprecedented, the fact that Axel was not eliminated (having never officially entered the match) ended up trended on Twitter following the event, and also received supportive tweets from former WWE wrestlers Lance Storm and Tommy Dreamer, and then later from current WWE wrestlers Xavier Woods, Zack Ryder, and David Otunga, the latter offering his legal services. This led to an angle where he began referring to himself as \"the true winner\" of the Royal Rumble, claiming that he still had not been eliminated from the match and that he thus deserved a match with Lesnar at WrestleMania 31 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. This also led to Axel starting his own hashtag (#AxelMania). Instead of facing Brock Lesnar, Axel participated in the second annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 31, but was the first wrestler eliminated after the majority of the field threw him out of the ring.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds."

        "text": "The archery events at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place in Yumenoshima Park. Five events were planned with a mixed team event staged for the first time.\nQualification.\nThere were 128 qualifying places available for archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics: 64 for men and 64 for women. The qualification standards were released by World Archery in March 2018.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) is permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualify teams for a particular gender are able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There are 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs may earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.\nSix places are reserved for Japan as the host nation, and a further four are to be decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 118 places are then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earn quota places for their respective NOCs, though not necessarily for themselves.\nThere is no qualification process prior to the 2020 Games for the mixed team event. Instead, qualification for that event is done through the ranking rounds at the beginning of the Games. Each NOC that has qualified at least one man and one woman will have the scores of that NOC's top-scoring man and top-scoring woman in the ranking round summed; the top 16 NOCs are to qualify for mixed team competition.\nCompetition format.\nA total of 128 athletes are expected across the five events: the men's individual, women's individual, men's team, women's team and mixed team. The mixed team event is a new event added for 2020.\nAll five events are scheduled to be recurve archery events, held under the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and rules. The competition is expected to start with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer is to shoot a total of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1–64 according to their score.\nThe ranking round is also to be used to seed the men's and women's teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team. In addition, the ranking round is scheduled to determine the 16 pairs that qualify for the mixed team event (for nations that have both men and women competing, the top men's score and the top women's score are combined) as well as seeding those 16 teams.\nEach event was played in a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semi-final losers, who played off to decide the bronze medal winner.\nIndividual events.\nIn the individual events, all 64 competitors entered the competition at the first round, the round of 64. The draw was seeded according to the result of the ranking round so the first seed shot against the 64th seed in the first round.\nEach match is to be scored using the Archery Olympic Round, consisting of the best-of-five sets, with three arrows per set. The winner of each set receives two points, and if the scores in the set are tied then each archer receives one point. If at the end of five sets the score is tied at 5–5, a single arrow shoot-off is held and the closest to the center is declared the winner.\nMen's and women's team events.\nIn the team events, the top four seeded teams from the ranking round are to receive a bye to the quarter-final. The remaining eight teams, seeded 5th to 12th, compete for the remaining four places in the quarter-finals.\nThe team event follows the same Archery Olympic Round set system as the individual event, though each set consists of six arrows (two per team member) and only four sets are held.\nMixed team event.\nIn the mixed team event, the top 16 seeded teams from the ranking round competed in a single-elimination bracket. \nAs with the men's and women's team events, the set system uses two arrows per team member (which means four arrows per team in mixed team) and four sets.\nSchedule.\nAll times are Japan Standard Time ().\nParticipating nations.\n128 archers from 51 nations qualified. Qualification tournaments include the 2019 World Archery Championships, various continental events, and a final qualification tournament."

        "text": "The boxing tournaments at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place from 24 July to 8 August 2021 at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan. Thirteen events were staged, the same number as in London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. However, for the first time since the London Games, the programme has been updated, with the number of men's events reduced by two and the number of women's events increased by the same number.\nOn 22 May 2019, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the International Boxing Association (AIBA) had been stripped of the right to organise the tournament, due to \"issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics and refereeing and judging\". Boxing will instead be organised by an ad-hoc task force led by Morinari Watanabe, president of the International Gymnastics Federation.\nCompetition format.\nOn March 23, 2013, the AIBA instituted significant changes to the format. The World Series of Boxing, AIBA's pro team league which started in 2010, already enabled team members to retain 2012 Olympic eligibility. The newer AIBA Pro Boxing Tournament, consisting of pros who sign 5 year contracts with AIBA and compete on pro cards leading up to the tournament, also provides a pathway for new pros to retain their Olympic eligibility and retain ties with national committees. The elimination of headgear and the adoption of the \"10-point must\" scoring system further clears the delineation between amateur and pro format.\nThe number of weight classes for men was reduced from ten to eight, with a featherweight class introduced and events at light-flyweight (introduced in 1968), bantamweight (staged at every Olympics since 1904 bar 1912, when boxing events weren't held) and light-welterweight (introduced in 1952) removed. The women's weight classes saw a corresponding increase from three to five, with featherweight and welterweight categories introduced.\nThe IOC confirmed weight limits for all 13 classes on 19 June 2019.\nMen contested matches in these eight weight classes:\nWomen contested matches in these five weight classes:\nQualifying criteria.\nEach National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to one athlete in each event. Six places (four men and two women) were reserved for the host nation Japan, while eight further places (five men and three women) were allocated to the Tripartite Invitation Commission.\nAll other places were allocated through four Continental Olympic Qualification Events (one each for Africa, the Americas, Asia/Oceania and Europe) between January 2020 and June 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed several events for the boxing including impacting the first 3 days of the European Qualification Event. The Americas Qualification Event and World Olympic Qualification Event were then cancelled in 2021."

        "title": "Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The cycling competitions of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo featured 22 events in five disciplines. \nCycling competitions had been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics, fencing and swimming.\nSince the 1896 contests which featured five track events and an 87 km road race from Athens to Marathon and back, Olympic cycling had gradually evolved to include women's competitions, mountain bike and BMX to arrive at the current 22 events.\nThe cycling program for this edition was expanded with 4 more events than those held in 2016. BMX freestyle was added in the program for the first time and there will also be a return of Madison events on the track that had been removed from the Olympic program in 2012. The award of the extra events was widely seen as a reward for the agreement of the UCI that the track cycling and mountain bike events be taken out of Tokyo and held in Izu, Shizuoka, allowing for significant costs savings to the organising committee. As Izu was not covered by the state of emergency imposed by the Japanese government, cycling was one of the very few sports at these games that allowed a limited number of local spectators to attend.\nGreat Britain's stranglehold on the velodrome events slackened for the first time since 2008, with their three golds matched by the Netherlands and six other golds shared among six nations. They also failed to win a road medal for the first time since 2004. Nevertheless, with three golds, three silvers and a bronze inside the velodrome, and a hugely successful mountain bike and BMX campaign outside it (three golds, a silver and a bronze from the six events) for the fourth Olympics in a row, Great Britain topped the medal table in cycling with twelve medals, six gold, closely followed by the Netherlands with twelve medals but five golds. Between them the two top nations won half of all the 22 gold medals on offer in cycling; no other nation won more than one, and aside from 12 medals won by each of the 'Big 2', only the Swiss managed more than three medals in total, thanks to their dominance of the mountain bike podium (winning 4 medals from 6).\nDuring the Games, Jason Kenny and Laura Kenny respectively took the records for the most successful male and female Olympic cyclists in history, Jason with a seventh gold in men's keirin, and Laura with a fifth in women's madison. They also became their nation's most successful male and female Olympians in history.\nVenues.\nTrack cycling was planned for a temporary venue in Ariake. To save $100 million in construction costs, it was announced after months of negotiations that the venue for track cycling would be the existing velodrome in Izu.\nThe International Cycling Union (UCI) resisted moving track cycling 120 km outside Tokyo to Izu. The UCI feared it would detract from the Olympic experience for both athletes and fans. Eventually, the UCI agreed to change. The Japanese Cycling Federation and local authorities committed to establishing at Izu a multi-sport cycling center, to create local cycling programs, and to develop the cycling sport.\nFor road cycling the start and finish were originally planned at the Imperial Palace Garden. Later it was announced that the finishes would be at the Fuji International Speedway with the starts of the road races at the Musashinonomori Park.\nQualification.\nJapan, as the host country, received one guaranteed quota place per gender in the BMX Racing, BMX Freestyle, and mountain bike events and two quota places per gender in the road race events (there are no guaranteed places in the road time trial or any track events).\nMost of the qualification was done through UCI ranking lists, with some spots allocated through world championship events or continental qualification events.\nCourses.\nRoad races.\nThe courses for the men's and women's road races were revealed in August 2018. The races started in Musashinonomori Park in Chofu, western Tokyo with the finish at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka prefecture.\nThe men's road race was 234 kilometres long with a total elevation of 4865 m. The women's race was 137 km long with a total elevation of 2692 metres.\nThe first part of the men's and women's races is identical. The course first passes through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After 80 km there is a long climb on Doushi Road with a total elevation of 1000 m. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass there is a fast 15 km descent. From here the courses are different for men and women.\nAfter the descent, the men's race heads towards the lower slopes of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, with a 14.3 km long climb with a 6.0% average incline. The riders then head to the Fuji Speedway section, where they cross the finish line twice before entering the last part of the race, which includes the Mikuni Pass peak at about 30 km to go. This climb is 6.8 km at a height of 1159 metres with an average incline of 10.2% including sections reaching 20%. After the climb, the race returns to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass before finishing on the Fuji Speedway circuit.\nThe women's race does not include the two tough climbs at Mount Fuji and Mikuni Pass. Instead, the race remains on the Fuji Speedway circuit, where the women ride 1.5 laps before the final crossing of the finish line."

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo featured three disciplines for both individual and team competitions.\nOriginally scheduled for 25 July – 8 August 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the games had been postponed with the equestrian events set for 24 July – 7 August 2021.\nQualification.\nThe 200 quota places for equestrian were divided between the three disciplines (75 for jumping, 65 for eventing, and 60 for dressage). Teams in each discipline consisted of three horse and rider pairs; any NOC that qualified a team (20 teams for jumping, 15 each for eventing and dressage) also received 3 entries in the individual competition for that discipline. NOCs that did not qualify teams could earn one individual place in dressage and jumping, and up to two individual places in eventing, for a total of 15 entries in jumping and dressage and 20 for eventing. Teams qualify primarily through specific competitions (World Equestrian Games and continental tournaments), while individuals qualified through ranking. The host nation, Japan, automatically qualified a team in each discipline.\nParticipating nations.\n50 nations have qualified. Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Luxembourg, Singapore and Sri Lanka were scheduled to make their Olympic debuts in equestrian events.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:\nCompetition format.\nDressage.\nTeams are made of three athletes, all of whom are also competing for individual medals. Nations without a team can be represented by a single individual athlete.\nDressage competition starts with the Grand Prix, which serves as a qualifier for both team and individual competitions. Athletes are drawn into six heats of ten athletes each, with the opening three heats being scheduled for the first day, and the remaining three heats for the second day. Heats are drawn in such a way that no more than one athlete per NOC can be assigned to the same heat. Once the Grand Prix heats are concluded, team scores are decided by adding up individual scores of the respective team members. The top eight ranked teams qualify for the team final (Grand Prix Special), while the top two individual athletes from each heat, plus the next best six ranked athletes, qualify for the individual final (Grand Prix Freestyle).\nGrand Prix Special, which is used to decide team medals, is a slightly more rigorous dressage test with emphasis on difficult transitions (such as collected walk - piaffe). Special is performed to music of athletes' choice, which, however, is not judged. As the slate is wiped clean after the Grand Prix, team medals are determined solely based on scores achieved in the Special. Nations taking part in the team final are allowed to enter a substitute athlete between the Grand Prix and up to two hours before the Special.\nGrand Prix Freestyle is open for 18 athletes and is used to decide individual medals. Each athlete designs their own test for the Freestyle, which must be set to music and must contain 16 compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe or flying changes on a curving line) in order to increase their scores. Individual medals are assigned based on scores in the Freestyle.\nEventing.\nCompetitions for team and individual medals run concurrently. Each athlete, riding the same horse, performs a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals are then awarded by adding together the scores of team members, from all three phases. The team with the lowest number of penalty points wins the gold. The top 25 individual athletes after the first jumping round perform a second, final, jumping round to determine individual medals. Therefore, those competing for individual glory complete one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds.\nAthletes who for various reasons fail to start or finish any of the phases are eliminated from the individual competition. Teams with eliminated athletes receive penalty points: 100 penalty points for each eliminated athlete during dressage and jumping phases, and 200 penalty points for each eliminated athlete during cross-country phase. While they are excluded from the individual event, eliminated athletes may continue to compete in the following phases for their teams, unless they were eliminated for lameness, fall of horse, abuse of horse or otherwise disqualified. Teams can additionally bring forward a reserve athlete at any point of the competition. In such case, the respective team is awarded 20 additional penalty points.\nJumping.\nIndividual and team competitions are run separately.\nIndividual competition is up first and it takes two competition days. First competition day serves as a qualifier, where a total of 75 athletes may start. Each athlete tackles the same course, which includes 12 to 14 numbered obstacles. Athletes are ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points, and top 30 advance to individual final. In case of a tie for the last qualification place, athletes are separated by the time of their round. Individual final is held on a different course that includes 12 to 15 numbered obstacles. Athletes are once again ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points. If two or more athletes are tied for a medal position, the tie is resolved in a jump-off.\nFirst day of team competition serves as a qualifier, and is opened to a total of 20 teams. At the end of the qualifier, teams receive their placing by adding up the penalties incurred by the three team members. Athletes who withdraw or are eliminated or who retire from the competition will not be given a score. Teams with one athlete who has withdrawn, retired or been eliminated from the team qualifier will be placed according to the combined penalties incurred by the two athletes who completed the competition. Teams in which all three athletes completed the competition without being eliminated or retiring shall be placed before teams with only two athletes who completed the competition without being eliminated or retiring. Teams with two athletes who have withdrawn and/or retired and/or been eliminated from the competition will be eliminated. The top 10 teams based on the qualifier results advance to team final. In case of a tie for the last qualification place, teams are separated by the combined time of their three team members. Team final is held on a different course. Teams are once again ranked based on accumulated number of penalty points of their team members. If two or more teams are tied for a medal position, the tie is resolved in a jump-off.\nCompetition schedule.\nAll times are Japan Standard Time ()."

        "text": "The rowing competitions at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place between 23 and 30 July 2021 at the Sea Forest Waterway (Central Breakwater) in Tokyo Bay. Fourteen medal events were contested by 526 athletes (263 men and women each).\nCompetition format.\nThe rowing programme featured a total of fourteen events, seven each for both men and women in identical boat classes. This gender equality was suggested by the World Rowing Federation at its February 2017 congress, with the recommendation adopted by the International Olympic Committee in June 2017. This balancing was achieved by deleting the men's lightweight four and adding the women's coxless four boat classes. The women's coxless four previously ran at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics; the only time this boat class was an Olympic event. The changes to the Olympic rowing schedule were the first since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\nEvents for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics included both disciplines of rowing: sweep rowing, where competitors each use a single oar, and sculling, where they use two placed on opposite sides of the boat. There was also one lightweight (weight restricted) event for each gender: the lightweight double sculls. Sculling events include men's and women's singles, doubles, lightweight doubles, and quads. Sweep events included men's and women's coxless pairs, coxless fours, and eights.\nRegatta venue.\nThe event took at the Sea Forest Waterway, a new venue constructed specifically for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. The water is about 6 metres deep. The course is 2335 meters long and 198 meters wide. Each lane is 12.5 m wide. There were 8 lanes.\nQualification.\nA total of 526 quota spots were available. Each qualified nation entered one boat for each of the fourteen events. The majority of the berths were awarded based on the results at the 2019 World Rowing Championships, held in Ottensheim, Austria from 25 August to 1 September 2019. Places were awarded to National Olympic Committees, not to specific athletes, finishing in the top 9 in the single sculls (both men and women), top 5 in the eights, top 8 in the fours and quadruple sculls, top 7 in the lightweight double sculls, and top 11 each in the pairs and double sculls. Further berths were distributed to the nations (and in this case to specific competitors) at four continental qualifying regattas in Asia and Oceania, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, and at a final Olympic qualification regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland.\nCompetition schedule.\nOn 23 July, World Rowing announced changes to the schedule due to forecasted inclement weather for 26 July. All racing originally scheduled for 26 July was moved to 25 July. The eights heats were also moved from 25 to 24 July to accommodate the new schedule. Further revisions were made on 25 July, cancelling racing on 27 July due to Tropical Storm Nepartak hitting parts of Japan.\nParticipation.\nEvents by number of boats entered.\nEach event has the same number of boats entered for men and women.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations"

The venue was also used for the 1964 Olympic Games although significantly regenerated, the IOC now encouraging regeneration, cost reductions and sustainability. The RS:X, Laser, Laser Radial, Finn, 470, 49er, 49erFX, and Nacra17 are all returning for 2020; there are no significant changes to the Olympic programme from 2016.\nCompetition format.\nQualification.\nThe number of sailors competing has been reduced from 380 to 350, with an equal numbers of male and female athletes for the first time ever. \nThe qualification period commenced at the 2018 Sailing World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark. There, 101 places, about forty percent of the total quota, will be awarded to the highest finishing nations. Six places will be available in the men's Laser and women's Laser Radial classes at the 2018 Asian Games and 2019 Pan American Games, whereas sixty-one more will be distributed to the sailors at the World Championships for all boats in 2019. Continental qualification regattas were held to decide the remainder of the total quota, while two spots each in the one-person dinghy classes were granted to eligible NOCs through the Tripartite Commission Invitation.\nAs hosts, Japan has been guaranteed one quota place in each of the ten classes.\nClasses (equipment).\nThe events remained unchanged for 2020 which was unusual with the only significant change being the Nacra 17 changing to a foiling configuration.\nScoring.\nThe format for the 2020 Olympics is fleet racing, where all competitors start and sail the course together. They are scored according to the low-point system, where first place is scored 1, second place is scored 2, etc. There is a series of preliminary races followed by the final Medal Race. The RS:X, 49er, 49erFX, and Nacra 17 classes have 12 preliminary races, other classes have 10.\nAt the end of the preliminary races, the top ten boats in each class (i.e. those with the lowest total scores) advance to the Medal Race. Each boat might exclude one race from their total. The Medal Race cannot be excluded from the series score and counts double. The boat with the lowest overall total after all races is the winner. Any ties in the final rankings are broken in favour of the competitor/crew finishing higher in the Medal Race."

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the games were postponed to 2021. However, their official name remained 2020 Summer Olympics with swimming events set for 24 July–1 August 2021 and marathon swimming set for 4–5 August 2021.\nSwimming featured a record total of 37 events (18 for each gender and 1 mixed), with the addition of the men's 800 m freestyle, women's 1500 m freestyle, and the mixed medley relay.\nEvents.\nSwimming at the 2020 Olympics featured a total of 37 events (18 each for men and women and 1 mixed event), including two 10 km open-water marathons. This was a slight increase from the 34 events contested in the previous Olympic Games. The following events were contested (all pool events are long course, and distances are in meters unless stated):\nSchedule.\nUnlike the previous Olympics, swimming program schedule occurred in two segments. For the pool events, similar to the case of the 2008 Games, prelims were held in the evening, with semifinals and final in the following morning session, spanning a day between semifinals and finals in those events with semifinals. The shift of the normal morning prelims and evening finals (to evening prelims and morning finals) occurred for these Games due to the prior request made by US broadcaster NBC (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on May 7, 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games and is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC), so that the finals from the event could be shown live in the United States.\nQualification.\nSwimming – individual events.\nFINA establishes qualifying times for individual events. The time standards consisted of two types: an \"Olympic \"Qualifying\" Time\" (OQT) and an \"Olympic \"Selection\" time\" (OST). Each country was able to enter up to two swimmers per event, provided both swimmers met the (faster) \"qualifying\" time. A country was able to enter one swimmer per event that met the \"invitation\" standard. Any swimmer who met the \"qualifying\" time was entered in the event for the Games; a swimmer meeting the \"invitation\" standard was eligible for entry, and their entry was allotted/filled in by ranking. If a country has no swimmers who meet either of the qualifying standards, it may have entered one male and one female. A country that did not receive an allocation spot but had at least one swimmer who met a qualifying standard might have entered the swimmer with the highest ranking.\nSwimming – relay events.\nEach relay event features 16 teams, composed of:\nOpen-water swimming.\nThe men's and women's 10 km races featured 25 swimmers:\nMedal summary.\nMen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nWomen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nMixed events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals."

If an NOC had both a mixed doubles pair and a team in one or both genders qualify, the doubles player must be a member of the team in their gender.\nFor individual events, between 64 and 70 individual players qualified. Each NOC with a qualified team were permitted to enter two members of that team in the individual competition. 22 quota places would be awarded through continental championships to individuals who belong to an NOC without a qualified team. There would be one Tripartite Commission invitation place. The remainder of the total 172 quota places would be filled through a final world singles qualifying tournament (no less than two and no more than eight qualifiers) and then the ITTF world ranking.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 173 athletes (85 men and 88 women), representing 57 NOCs, competed in five events. One Czech athlete tested positive for COVID-19 and withdrew from the Games. Two NOCs (China and Hungary) replaced injured athletes with reserves in the team event."

The hard-court Deco Turf surface at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games was chosen by the Tokyo Organizing Committee. This marked the fifth time that this type of surface was utilized for the Olympic Games.\nThe format at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games was a single-elimination tournament with men's and women's singles draws consisting of 64 players. There were six rounds of competition in singles, five rounds in doubles (draw size of 32), and four rounds in mixed doubles (draw size of 16). Players and teams reaching the semifinals were assured of competing for a medal with the two losing semifinalists competing for the bronze medal. All singles matches were best of three sets with a standard tiebreak (first to seven points) in every set, including the final set. In all doubles competition, a match tiebreak (first to ten points) was played instead of a third set.\nQualification.\nTo be eligible, a player must meet certain requirements related to play on Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup teams. Qualification for the singles competitions is based primarily on the world rankings of 14 June 2021, with 56 players entering each of the men's and women's events (limited to four per National Olympic Committee (NOC)). Six of the remaining eight slots are to be allocated by continent for NOCs with no other qualifiers. The final two spots are reserved, one for the host nation and one for a previous Olympic gold medalist or Grand Slam champion. In the men's and women's doubles competitions, 32 teams are scheduled to compete. Up to 10 places are reserved for players in the top 10 of the doubles ranking, who could select any player from their NOC ranked in the top 300 in either singles or doubles. The remaining slots are allocated by combined rankings, with preference given to singles players once the total player quota is met. One team per gender is to be reserved for the host nation if none has already become eligible otherwise. No quota spots are available for mixed doubles; instead, all teams will consist of players already entered in the singles or doubles. The top 15 combined ranking teams and the host nation are eligible.\nAndy Murray of Great Britain was the two-time defending champion in men's singles, but withdrew before his first-round match due to a quadriceps strain. Monica Puig of Puerto Rico was the defending champion in women's singles, but did not return to defend her title in order to recover from surgery.\nMedal summary.\nIn men's singles, Alexander Zverev of Germany won the gold medal by defeating Karen Khachanov of the Russian Olympic Committee, 6–3, 6–1. In men's doubles, Nikola Mektić and Mate Pavić of Croatia defeated compatriots Marin Čilić and Ivan Dodig 6–4, 3–6, 10–6.\nIn women's singles, Belinda Bencic of Switzerland won the gold medal over Markéta Vondroušová of the Czech Republic 7–5, 2–6, 6–3.

        "text": "The 1976 World Championships in Athletics () was the first global, international athletics competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Hosted on 18 September 1976 in Malmö, Sweden, it featured just one event: a men's 50 kilometres race walk contest. The course passed through the streets of the city and the start and finish points were within Malmö Stadion.\nSummary.\nThe International Olympic Committee had decided to drop the men's 50 km walk from the Olympic athletics programme for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, despite its constant presence at the games since 1932. The IAAF chose to host its own world championship event instead, a month and a half after the Olympics.\nIt was the first World Championships that the IAAF had hosted separate from the Olympic Games (traditionally the main championship for the sport) and race winner Soviet athlete Veniamin Soldatenko (runner-up at the 1972 Olympics) became the first ever IAAF world champion and at 37 years and 258 days he remains the oldest male athlete to win that accolade. Mexico's Enrique Vera came second and Finnish walker Reima Salonen was third. A total of 42 walkers representing 20 countries entered the championships race and 37 finished, with four failed to finish and one being disqualified.\nThis marked the beginning of a move away from this arrangement as a 1976 IAAF Council meeting decided that the organisation would host its own, full-programme, championships on a quadrennial basis. The two-race 1980 World Championships in Athletics filled in for the lack of a women's 400 metres hurdles and 3000 metres run at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The competition came of age at the 41-event 1983 World Championships in Athletics, which is considered the first edition proper."

His preferred position is at wing, but he is also capable at centre.\nHaving made his Saints bow against Saracens in the LV= Cup, Elliott made a try-scoring Aviva Premiership debut on the wing against Sale Sharks in 2011.\nHe made it back-to-back scores a week later against London Irish and carried his scoring form into England U20's Six Nations winning campaign, crossing in the opening win against Wales.\nInjury disrupted the remainder of Elliott's season but he returned by scoring a two tries as the Saints beat Saracens in his first appearance of the 2011/12 season and repeating the trick for the Saints' Heineken Cup visit to Castres in December.\nThough battling with injuries throughout his career, Elliott found himself a regular on Saints' teamsheet and their scoresheet, after finishing the 2012/13 season as the Saint's leading try scorer after 5 tries in 2 games against Bath Rugby and Sale Sharks helped him achieve a total of 11 for the season.\nElliott also featured strongly in Saints' double winning season, racking up 28 appearances for the Midlands side that season, though he did not feature in the 23-man squads for either the Aviva Premiership and European Rugby Challenge Cup finals where Saints secured the titles. Elliott, however, did score a now iconic try against Leinster Rugby that season as Saints battled their way to the European Rugby Challenge Cup Final.\nMost recently Elliott was battling to return from injury and finally did in November of the 2016/17 season against Newcastle Falcons in the opening round of the season's Anglo-Welsh Cup.\nElliott then started six other fixtures in the most recent season before falling to injury again, dislocating his shoulder as he made a try-saving tackle against Bristol Rugby at Franklin's Gardens in January and has not played since then.\nOn 26 July 2018, Elliott left Northampton to sign for RFU Championship side Bedford Blues ahead of the 2018-19 season. However, Elliott left Bedford immediately to sign for Italian club Zebre in the Pro14 from the 2018-19 to 2020-21 season. Elliott rejoined Bedford Blues ahead of the 2021-22 Championship Rugby season and was a shoe in at outside centre, regularly featuring in the championship rugby podcasts Team of the Week at no. 13."

The race started and finished on 6 August at Fort Copacabana and was won by Greg Van Avermaet of Belgium. It was Belgium's first victory in the men's individual road race since 1952 and second overall, tying France and the Soviet Union for second-most behind Italy (five). Belgium matched Italy for most total medals, at seven. Jakob Fuglsang won Denmark's fourth silver medal in the event; the nation had yet to win gold. Rafał Majka's bronze was Poland's first medal in the event since 1980.\nQualification.\nNations could earn qualification spots primarily through UCI tours. The top five nations at the UCI World Tour earned five quota places, with nations further down the rankings earning progressively fewer quota places. There were also up to three places per nation available through continental tours and championships. Individuals could also earn places if their nation's ranking was insufficient. A few places were reserved for the host nation and Tripartite Commission invitations.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial had been re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race. Azerbaijan, the Dominican Republic, Kosovo, and Laos each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 20th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nPre-race favourites.\nDue to the grueling nature of the course, the riders expected to finish with a medal were all known for their climbing and descending skills. Favorites heading into the race were Alejandro Valverde, Vincenzo Nibali, Chris Froome, Joaquim Rodríguez and Julian Alaphilippe. If Froome had won gold, he would have become the first person to ever win Tour de France and the cycling road race in the same season.\nCourse.\nThe men's course was long. Starting at Fort Copacabana, the peloton headed west to pass through Ipanema, Barra, and Reserva Maripendi Beaches via the coastal road leading to the Pontal / Grumari circuit loop. After four laps of the Grumari sector (99.2 km of 241.5 km), the course returned east via the same coastal road to enter the Vista Chinesa Circuit loop at Gávea for three laps ( of ) before finishing back at Fort Copacabana. As with all road races in the Olympic Games, the athletes are escorted by law enforcement to keep traffic and bystanders out of harm's way. For the 2016 Olympics, escort for the riders is done by the Brazilian Federal Highway Police (PRF).\nStart list.\nThe following NOCs had qualified riders to compete in the road race event. The following riders were confirmed by their respective NOCs.\nResults.\nIn the table below, \"s.t.\" indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before him, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time."

There were 27 competitors from 16 nations, as once again nations were allowed to enter up to two cyclists (the limit had fluctuated between one and two since 1928). The event was won by Jason Kenny of Great Britain, successfully defending his gold from 2012 and making it the third straight Games that Great Britain was atop the podium for the sprint. Kenny was the third man to win two consecutive gold medals in the sprint, fourth man to win two golds at any point, and third man to win three medals of any color. He beat his teammate Callum Skinner in the final; it was the second time in three Games that Great Britain had both the top spots—and potentially could have been the third if nations had not been limited to a single cyclist in 2012. Denis Dmitriev earned Russia's first men's sprint medal with his bronze.\nThe medals were presented by Barry Maister, IOC member, New Zealand and David Lappartient, Vice President of the UCI.\nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Four of the quarterfinalists from 2012 returned: gold medalist (and 2008 silver medalist) Jason Kenny of Great Britain, silver medalist Grégory Baugé of France, fourth-place finisher Njisane Phillip of Trinidad and Tobago, and fifth-place finisher Denis Dmitriev of Russia. Baugé had won the 2015 world championship (adding to his 2009–12 run, though the 2011 title had been stripped from him) and Dmitriev had been a fixture on the world championships podium throughout the four years since the last Games. Kenny had struggled for much of that period, but had a strong 2016 including a victory over Matthew Glaetzer of Australia in the 2016 worlds final.\nNo nations made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 26th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nQualification.\nThere were 27 quota places available for the sprint. The nine nations qualified for the team sprint event could enter two members of the team in the individual sprint. The other nine places were assigned to nations based on the 2014–16 UCI track rankings, with one place for each of the top nine nations not qualified through team sprint.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a single-elimination tournament, with repechages after the first two rounds, after seeding via time trial. The time trial involved an 875-metre distance, but with only the last 200 metres timed. All other races were 750 metres (three laps of the track) with side-by-side starts, with time kept for the last 200 metres. The first two main rounds featured single head-to-head races, with winners advancing and losers competing in repechages. Repechage races were contested by up to 3 cyclists. Beginning with the quarterfinals, each match pitted two cyclists against each other in best-of-three races.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nCallum Skinner set a new Olympic record of 9.703 seconds in the qualifying round, but Jason Kenny regained the record with his time of 9.551. Matthew Glaetzer also finished under the old record time."

        "text": "Brian Robert Graham (born 1936) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s and 1960s. A New South Wales representative goal-kicking , he played club football in the NSWRFL Premiership for Sydney's St. George (with whom he won 5 consecutive grand finals) and Newtown.\nCareer.\nSt. George\nOriginally from Grafton, New South Wales, Graham started playing first grade for the St. George club in the 1955 NSWRFL season. The following season the club won the first of what would become a record eleven consecutive premierships, but Graham did not play first grade. However, at the end of the 1957 NSWRFL season St. George had again reached the grand final and Graham played at fullback in their 31–9 victory over Manly-Warringah. He also played for Saints and fullback in the 1958 NSWRFL season's grand final victory over Western Suburbs.\nPersonal life.\nMarried in 1958, Graham and his wife Lola resided in Sydney, Australia, with their three children; Philip Graham, Kerrin Graham and Paul Graham. Graham has 7 grandchildren.\nIn 1959 Graham gained his first representative honours when he was selected to play at fullback for the City New South Wales rugby league team in their 37–7 victory against Country. He was then chosen as fullback for New South Wales in two matches against Queensland. At the end of the 1959 NSWRFL season Graham again played for St. George at fullback, scoring a try in their 20–0 victory over Manly. He was the 1960 NSWRFL season's top points scorer, and he landed five goals in Saints' 31–6 win against Eastern Suburbs in the premiership decider. In the 1961 ANZAC Day game against Eastern Suburbs Graham sealed his side's win with a 79th-minute penalty in front of 19,386 spectators at the SCG. In the 1961 NSWRFL season decider St. George faced Western Suburbs and defeated them 22–0, with Graham kicking five goals.\nIn late 1962 and throughout 1963, Graham had his career with Saints curtailed after being transferred to Korea as part his oil company work. He continued playing for St. George in 1964, surpassing Doug Fleming's point scoring record for the club, but after receiving offers from Newtown and Manly-Warringah in early 1965 was transferred to the former for £1,000.\nNewtown\nGraham commenced playing with Newtown in the 1965 NSWRFL season, and that year took a pay dispute with his former club to the NSWRFL. During the 1967 NSWRFL season Newtown took the club captaincy from Kangaroo forward Paul Quinn and handed it to Graham. This was Graham's last season in first grade.\nIn 1979 Graham's 19-year-old son Philip started playing first grade for St. George as well."

        "text": "The 1955–56 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team represented the University of Michigan in college ice hockey. In its 12th year under head coach Vic Heyliger, the team compiled a 20–2–1 record, outscored opponents 109 to 49, and won the 1956 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The Wolverines defeated St. Lawrence 2–1 in overtime in the first round of the Frozen Four. They then defeated Michigan Tech by a 7–5 score in the championship game at Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The 1956 championship was Michigan's sixth NCAA hockey championship in nine years.\nGoalie Lorne Howes was selected as the team's Most Valuable Player and was also named Most Valuable Player in the 1956 NCAA Tournament. Team captain Bill MacFarland was the team's leading scorer with 19 goals, 28 assists, and 47 total points in 23 games. Howes, MacFarland, and defenseman Bob Schiller were all named to the All-American college hockey team.\nSchedule.\nConference games against Michigan State, Michigan Tech and Minnesota were only worth 1 point in the standings.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRegular season.\nMcGill: Dec. 3, 1955.\nOn December 3, 1955, the Wolverines opened their season with a 5-3 victory over McGill in front of a sellout crowd of 3,700 at the Coliseum in Ann Arbor. Dick Dunnigan scored two goals for Michigan. Bill MacFarland, Ed Switzer, and Wally Maxwell scored one each. Team captain MacFarland sustained \"a severe ankle sprain\" after colliding with the boards in the third period. \"The Michigan Daily\" praised the play of the newest Wolverine, Wally Maxwell: \"His scoring punch and sharp passing should make him one of Michigan's leading offense threats.\"\nAt North Dakota: December 9–10, 1955.\nThe Wolverines next played a Friday/Saturday series against the North Dakota Fighting Sioux on December 9 and 10, 1955, at Grand Forks, North Dakota. Michigan won the first game, 5-1, before a \"violently partisan\" crowd of 3,800 at Grand Forks. Michigan's goals were scored by Dick Dunnigan, Ed Switzer, Tom Rendall, Jay Goold, and Wally Maxwell. Goalie Lorne Howes made 23 saves.\nThe Wolverines lost the second game to North Dakota by a 4-2 score. Michigan goalie Lorne Howes was struck by the puck above his left eye at the start of the third period and sustained a gash. The game was delayed while Howes had the wound stitched. Ed Switzer and Bernie Hanna scored Michigan's goals. South Dakota's final goal came late in the third period after Michigan coach Vic Heyliger pulled the goalie for an extra skater.\nDenver: December 13 and 14, 1955.\nThe Wolverines returned home for a Tuesday/Wednesday series against the Denver Pioneers on December 13 and 14, 1955. In the Tuesday night game, the teams played to a 3-3 tie before a crowd of 2,500 at the Coliseum in Ann Arbor. Michigan held a 3-1 lead with five minutes left in the game, but the Pioneers scored twice, including a tying goal with 49 second remaining. Neither team scored in the 10-minute overtime period, and the game ended in a tie. Wally Maxwell scored two goals in the game, and Ed Switzer scored one. With the tie, Michigan fell to 1-1-1 in three WIHL games.\nMichigan won the Wednesday night game by a 6-2 score in front of a crowd of 2,700 at the Coliseum. Defenseman Bob Pitts was the star of the game with two goals and a strong defensive performance. Team captain Bill MacFarland also scored twice. Michigan's remaining goals were scored by Ed Switzer and Tom Rendall. Denver's second goal came on an errant effort by Michigan to clear the zone. A Michigan defender inadvertently passed the puck backward into the net. After the game, Michigan coach Vic Heyliger said, \"When these boys want to play hockey, they can really get out there and play. This is what we've been waiting for.\"\nIneligible Players.\nOn February 7 the Big Ten ruled that Mike Buchanan and Wally Maxwell were ineligible to play due to having accepted expense money from outside sources while playing in high school. While the ruling ended the college careers of both players, no action was taken against Michigan as the violations occurred prior to either player entering college. Furthermore, Michigan was not required to forfeit any games in which either player had participated (including the 1955 national championship in which Buchanan had played).\n1956 NCAA championship.\nAfter compiling an 18–2–1 record and winning the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League (WIHL) championship, Michigan was invited to participate in the Frozen Four for the ninth consecutive year. The 1956 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was held at Broadmoor Arena at The Broadmoor, a luxury hotel located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. St. Lawrence University (from Canton, New York) and Boston College were invited from the East and Michigan and Michigan Technological University (from Houghton, Michigan) were invited from the West.\nSemifinal vs. St. Lawrence.\nOn March 16, 1956, the Wolverines faced the St. Lawrence Saints in the opening round. Neither team scored in the first period, as Michigan goalie Lorne Howes made 11 saves and the Wolverines were held to five shots on goal. St. Lawrence took a 1–0 lead with an unassisted goal by McKinnon with less than a minute remaining in the second period. St. Lawrence goalie Whittier had 15 saves in the second period. At the 3:59 mark in the third period, Michigan tied the score at 1–1 as Ed Switzer scored a goal with assists by Neil McDonald and Bob Pitts. Howes made 13 saves in the third period (30 saves in the game), and the third period ended in a tie. In the overtime period, Tom Rendall scored the winning goal at the 1:21 mark with an assist from Don McIntosh.\nChampionship vs. Michigan Tech..\nOn March 17, 1956, the Wolverines faced the Michigan Tech Huskies in the championship game. The Wolverines and Huskies had played four times in the regular season with Michigan winning all four games by a combined score of 21–7. In the championship game, Michigan struck first with a goal by Ed Switzer, assisted by Neil McDonald, only 23 seconds into the game. The period ended with Michigan ahead 4–3. Michigan's remaining goals in the first period were scored by Neil McDonald (assist by Bob Schiller at 9:22), Aubrey (unassisted at 11:04), and Schiller (assist by McDonald at 13:11). Michigan goalie Lorne Howes made 19 saves in the first period. In the second period, Michigan Tech took a 5–4 lead, scoring two goals in the opening 7:15. The Wolverines tied the score at 5–5 on a goal by Ed Switzer, assisted by Bernie Hanna at 7:58. Michigan then took the lead, scoring two goals within 11 seconds of the other. Switzer scored at the 14:38 mark (assist by Dick Dunnigan), and Neil McDonald followed with an unassisted goal at 14:49. The third period was scoreless as Howes tallied 19 more saves. Switzer's third goal of the game gave him a hat trick.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nMichigan goalie Lorne Howes, who totaled 46 saves in the championship game, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. Michigan players also took five of six first-team spots on the Associated Press All-Tournament Team. The Michigan players so honored were Howes, defensemen Bob Pitts and Bob Schiller, center Tom Rendall, and wing Ed Switzer. Shortly after winning the championship, the members of the Michigan hockey team selected Bob Pitts as captain of the 1956–57 Michigan hockey team.\nRoster and scoring statistics.\nFourteen players received varsity letters for the 1955–56 Michigan hockey team. Those 14 players are listed in bold below. Richard T. Brown received the Manager's \"M\"."

A part of the storied Federer–Nadal rivalry, it pitted the world No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer against the world No. 2 Rafael Nadal. After 3 hours and 45 minutes, Federer defeated Nadal 7–6(9–7), 4–6, 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 6–2.\nUpon its conclusion, it was almost universally praised as the greatest Wimbledon final since Borg–McEnroe in 1980.\nBackground.\nRoger Federer and Rafael Nadal have a storied rivalry that many consider to be the greatest in tennis history. As they entered the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, the two men had collectively won the last nine consecutive Grand Slam titles.\nThe 2007 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was a rematch of the previous year's Championships final. Federer had won not only that match, but had also been the Wimbledon champion four years in a row and was on a quest of tying Björn Borg's record of five consecutive Wimbledon Championships.\nNadal, on the other hand, had just won the French Open for the third time in a row and was trying to achieve the rare French Open-Wimbledon double. Additionally, Nadal had denied Federer from completing the Career Grand Slam, and becoming the first man since 1968 to win all four Grand Slams consecutively.\nThe hype preceding the match was enormous because although Federer was the four-time defending champion, Nadal entered the match with an 8-4 lead in their head-to-head record.\nMatch details.\nThe chair umpire was Carlos Ramos of Portugal.\nFederer leapt out to an early lead in the first set but it was decided in a memorable tiebreaker. Federer appeared to have won the set only to have the call reversed by the new review system Hawkeye. Federer would eventually win the first set 7–6. Nadal rebounded in the second set, breaking Federer in the final game to take the set 6–4.\nNeither player could break through in the third set which saw twelve consecutive holds before Federer won the tiebreaker and seized the two sets to one advantage. Nadal shocked many by racing to a 4–0 lead in the fourth set, and after an injury time-out he closed out the set 6–2.\nThe final set was a dramatic affair with Nadal failing to convert four break points in the third and fifth games that would have given him an early lead. Federer proved too strong in the latter part of the set, breaking Nadal in the sixth and eighth games to close out the match.\nStatistics.\nSource\nSignificance.\nThis match was historic as it saw Federer equal Björn Borg's open-era record of five consecutive Wimbledon Championships. Due to this potential Borg returned to the All England Club for the first time in many years to witness the Wimbledon final.\nThe victory also equalled Federer with Borg and Rod Laver with 11 Grand Slam championships, leaving him only three behind Pete Sampras in his quest to achieve the all-time record.\nThis was the first Wimbledon final to use the replay technology system Hawk-Eye. The system proved controversial reversing a set point for Federer in the first set. In the fourth set Federer grew frustrated with almost all of the reviews going Nadal's way and asked the umpire to turn it off saying, \"it's killing me today.\"\nThis was also the first time that Federer or Nadal had ever played a fifth set in a Grand Slam final. They would go on to also play five sets in the final the following year, which Nadal won in what many consider the greatest match of all time. Nadal would also beat Federer in five sets at the 2009 Australian Open, and Federer would beat Nadal in five sets in the final of the 2017 Australian Open.\nDue to construction of a new retractable roof, this was the only Wimbledon final played without the upper facade which had been removed."

A serious knee injury disrupted his season, and he returned to Glasgow in 2012 to join the Warriors on loan with the move being made permanent in 2013.\nOn 14 February 2017, Edinburgh Rugby announced that they had signed him on a three-year deal and that he would begin playing for them from the summer.\nInternational career.\nBennett has represented Scotland at Under 18 level four times and played 21 times at under-20 level including appearances at the 2011, 2012 and 2013 IRB Junior World Championships.\nBennett was named in Vern Cotter's first ever squad for Scotland's 2014 summer tour, but failed to play in any of the four games. He was reselected in Scotland's squad for the 2014 Autumn Internationals, making his debut in Scotland's 41–31 victory over Argentina on 8 November 2014.\nAfter establishing himself in the squad, Bennett played in all five of Scotland's matches in the 2015 Six Nations Championship, notching tries against Italy and England. He also had a potentially decisive try against Wales controversially disallowed, after team-mate Sam Hidalgo-Clyne was judged to have knocked-on when fouled near the try line.\nAfter recovering from an injury which ruled him out of the run-in to Glasgow Warriors' 2014–15 Pro12 title triumph, Bennett was selected in Scotland's 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He scored two tries in the team's opening match victory over Japan. Bennett was nominated for \"Breakthrough Player of the Year\" by World Rugby after the tournament.

        "title": "Wimbledon Manor House",
        "text": "Wimbledon manor house; the residence of the lord of the manor, was an English country house at Wimbledon, Surrey, now part of Greater London. The manor house was over the centuries exploded, burnt and several times demolished. The first known manor house, The Old Rectory was built around 1500 still stands as a private home, despite very nearly falling into a state beyond repair, in the 19th century. The ambitious later Elizabethan prodigy house, Wimbledon Palace, was \"a house of the first importance\" according to Sir John Summerson, and is now demolished.\nThe manor house passed through several further iterations, being entirely rebuilt three times. From the 18th Century onwards the manor lands began to reduce in size as various owners sold off parts. What was known as the 'Old Park', an area of around 300 acres stretching westwards from the present Cannizaro House (now a hotel) and public park, was sold off in 1705. Most of the present day Wimbledon Common was also once part of the manor, with grazing rights given to tenants of the lord of the manor.\nThe Common was saved from enclosure and development in 1871 by a remarkably early act of conservation. 42 acres, previously part of the manor parklands, are now occupied by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club that has made \"Wimbledon\" synonymous with tennis. Further tracts of the Grade II* listed public Wimbledon Park include its present-day golf course and the lake, the latter created along with further improvements to the park by the famous landscaper 'Capability' Brown for Earl Spencer, in 1768.\nEarly history.\nUntil 1328, Wimbledon manor formed part of the manor of Mortlake. In 1364, Simon Islip, the Archbishop of Canterbury, gave the demesne lands to Merton Priory. Wimbledon was among the possessions of the church forfeited by Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1397. On the accession of Henry IV, Arundel was restored, and the archbishops continued to hold the manor of Wimbledon until 1536, when Thomas Cranmer, then archbishop, handed the manor and advowson to Henry VIII, as part of the Reformation and the Dissolution of the Monasteries, who then granted them to Thomas Cromwell. In 1540, Wimbledon manor was taken back from Cromwell on his death by the crown and annexed to Hampton Court. Henry VIII gave it to his queen, Catherine Parr, in 1543. After her death in 1548 the manor remained in the Crown until 1556, when Queen Mary granted it to Cardinal Pole as part of the Counter Reformation. Queen Elizabeth I seized it back and gave it to Sir Christopher Hatton in 1576 who sold it to Sir Thomas Cecil the same year .\nThe Old Rectory.\nThe Old Rectory, Wimbledon's first known manor house and its oldest surviving residence, originally known as the Parsonage House, was commissioned by the church in the early 1500s and is Grade II* listed. The house was once moated, and adjoins the grounds of St Mary's Church. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the former rectory manor and its \"Parsonage\" or \"Rectory\" house, compulsorily purchased from the church and vested in the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Cromwell, in 1536, were on his downfall in 1540 seized by Henry VIII who gave them to his sixth and last wife Catherine Parr in 1543. On 20 December 1546, in the months prior to his death, during a tour of his Surrey estates, the king was overcome by his various ailments and was unable to continue on to his Palace at Whitehall, so he stopped for three days at Catherine's house. In 1550, the house became a grace and favour home for Sir William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. Described by one of Cecil's biographers as \"not luxurious, but adequate\", a survey from 1649 describes The Old Rectory as \"A two storey house with a large dining hall, a withdrawing chamber, a parlour and little chamber, and extensive service quarters. A spiral staircase to the first floor with ten chambers and five closets, with five garrets in the roof\".\nBy 1720, it was known as The Old Laundry House, presumably for the Cecil house built in 1588, next door (see below). The house was uninhabited when Sir Theodore Janssen bought the manor in 1717 (see below) and who allegedly pulled down the south wing and restored the remainder of the house. By 1861, the house was a near ruin when it was sold as part of Wimbledon Park (but not the manor), by Earl Spencer, to the developer, John Beaumont (see below). Beaumont restored and extended The Old Rectory, repaired the exterior, transformed the interior, laid out the grounds and planted the famous fig walk. His successor, Samuel Willson, who bought the house for £6,000 in 1882, carried on the works, adding two-storey drawing-room wing and installing carved-oak doors and English, Flemish and Italian chimney pieces. In 1909 the house was purchased by marine engineer Matthias Jacobs, who enlarged it considerably with help from his brother, an architect, who designed a new single-storey billiard room, a large service wing to the north and a study extension to mask the chapel. In 1923, Thomas Lethaby purchased the house and he concentrated on embellishing the interior. The drawing room was fitted with oak panelling from the Chantry House, Newark, an elaborate plaster ceiling based on one at Knole House, and a grand fireplace. \nThe Lethabys sold the house in 1947. In 1953, Russell Brock, later Baron Brock of Wimbledon, an eminent cardiologist, bought the house for £13,750. The Brock family sold it in 1978 and the kitchen garden was sold and developed for housing known today as Rectory Orchard. The Old Rectory was then bought by an Iraqi entrepreneur and philanthropist, Basil Faidhi. Faidhi had fled Iraq for Britain and though he spent vast sums restoring the house with assistance from English Heritage, he also created a basement discothèque for his daughter, Nina, and a bar. In 1992 Faidhi commissioned Wimbledon historian Richard Milward to write a history of the building: \"The Rectory – Wimbledon’s Oldest House\".\nIn 1994, the astrophysicist, songwriter and lead guitarist of the rock band \"Queen\", Brian May CBE, paid £4 million for the house, with the intention of living there with his partner and later wife, the long-running BBC TV soap opera \"Eastenders\" actress Anita Dobson. In 2006 May sold The Old Rectory for £16 million to an Italian architect-owner Antonella Carminati and her husband, who initiated further works with the help of the architect Sir Donald Insall CBE. In 2012, the Carminatis put The Old Rectory on the market for £26 million. The house standing in acres, was sold in June 2013 for an undisclosed sum to Ian Taylor.\nCecil Wimbledon.\nSir Thomas Cecil, later Earl of Exeter, had connections with Wimbledon manor, before he bought it in 1576, for he had lived there when he was a child, in The Old Rectory. His father, Sir William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, had tenure of the house as a grace-and-favor residence by the Crown. Whilst Sir Thomas did own The Old Rectory, as it came as part of the manor, he decided to build a grand new Wimbledon manor house which was to be known as Wimbledon Palace. This was built next door to The Old Rectory and completed in 1588, England's \"Annus Mirabilis\". It was a leading example of the Elizabethan prodigy house. Sir Thomas' son Edward Cecil was made 1st Viscount Wimbledon on the basis of this seat. Edward's sarcophagus sits within the Cecil chapel at St Mary's church, Wimbledon, near the site of his demolished home.\nThe site, which was near the village of Wimbledon, was near the top of a high hill, astride the upper part of what is now Home Park Road, with extensive views northwards over the present day Wimbledon Park, above a steep slope that was dramatically terraced with massive retaining walls. The house was built on a modified H plan, with a slightly recessed central range facing south, and on the north, a central entrance between deep flanking wings, with matching staircase towers in the inner corners. An informally arranged service wing, not part of the symmetrical design, lay to the west. The entrance court, essentially a deep gated terrace entered from the sides, lay 26 steps below the upper \"cour d'honneur\", which could be approached only by a monumental axial staircase with paired helical flights rising from a central raised landing. Wimbledon's series of terraces and axial stairs and its hilltop site was \"inspired presumably\" by the Villa Farnese at Caprarola.\nThe estate stood within a day's ride of Westminster, making it eminently suitable for an active courtier; there, the Cecils entertained Queen Elizabeth I of England for three days in 1599. John Thorpe's undated plan of Wimbledon's ground floor and forecourts of \"ca\" 1609, suggests that they were about twelve acres in extent, divided among eleven separate spaces, featuring plantations, walks, and parterres, laid out asymmetrically on the sloping site. The house was damaged in 1628 by the accidental igniting of gunpowder stored there. The glories of this house, after repairs had been effected, were concentrated in the long Gallery, one of two in the house, which was richly painted and marbleized, no doubt by Francis Cleyn, who was responsible also for the exterior that was painted \"en camaieu\" in tones of yellow and burnt ochre.\nKing Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria.\nImmediately after Viscount Wimbledon died, in 1638, the manor together with manor house was sold by his heirs to trustees for the queen of Charles I, who gave it to Queen Henrietta-Maria. Alterations and expansion were made in 1640–41, just at the outbreak of the English Civil War. Overseeing plans and construction was the court architect Inigo Jones, Surveyor of the King's Works, and on site was the prominent sculptor-builder Nicholas Stone. The two-storey house with a flat balustraded roof was severe in outward aspect. Thomas Fuller calls Wimbledon manor house \"a daring structure;\" and says, that \"by some it has been thought to equal Nonsuch, if not to exceed it.\"\nThe magnificent gardens which were created for the Queen by French garden designer Andre Mollet, were later described in a Parliamentary inventory taken in 1649; after noting the lower court and the upper court, the survey reported its several ascents in detail, counting the very steps:\nThe scite of this manor-house being placed on the side slipp of a rising ground, renders it to stand of that height that, betwixt the basis of the brick-wall of the sayd lower court, and the hall door of the sayd manor-house, there are five severall assents, consisting of three-score and ten stepps, which are distinguished in a very graceful manner; to witt, from the parke to a payre of rayled gates, set betwixt two large pillers of brick; in the middle of the wall standing on the north side of the sayd lower court is the first assent, consisting of eight stepps, of good freestone, layed in a long square, within which gates, levell with the highest of those eight stepps, is a pavement of freestone, leading to a payr of iron gates rayled on each side thereof with turned ballasters of freestone, within which is a little paved court leading to an arched vault neatly pillowred with brick, conteyning on each side of the pillers a little roome well arched, serving for celleridge of botteled wines; on each side of this vault are a payre of staires of stone stepps, twentie-three stepps in assent, eight foote nine inches broad; meeting an even landing-place in the height thereof, leading from the foresayed gates unto the lower court, and make the second assent; from the height of this assent a pavement of Flanders brickes thirteene foot six inches broad\", leading \"to the third assent, which stands on the south side of the lower courte, consisting of a round modell, in the middle whereof is a payre of iron gates rayled as aforesayd, within which is a fountayne fitted with a leaden cesterne fed with a pipe of lead; this round conteynes a payre of stone stayres of 26 stepps in assent, ordered and adorned as the second assent is, and leades into the sayd higher courte, and soe makes the third assent; from the height whereof a pavement of square stone nine foote broad and eightie-seaven foote long leades up to the fowerth assent, which consists of eleven stepps of freestone very well wrought and ordered, leading into a gallery paved with square stone, sixtie-two foote long and eight foote broad...\nFrom the forementioned first assent there is a way cut forth of the parke, planted on each side thereof with elmes and other trees, in a very decent order, extending itself in a direct line two hundred thirty-one perches from thence quite through the parke northward unto Putney-common, being a very special ornament to the whole house.\nCivil War and the Interregnum.\nAs a consequence of the English Civil War, the monarchy was overthrown in 1649 and the Crown lands were put up for sale. The manor passed to the Cromwellian General John Lambert. \"Lambert,\" says Roger Coke, in \"A Detection of the Court and State of England during the four last reigns and the interregnum\" (1719), \"after he had been discarded by Cromwell, betook himself to Wimbledon-house, where he turned florist, and had the finest tulips and gilliflowers that could be got for love or money; yet in these outward pleasures he nourished the ambition which he entertained before he was cashiered by Cromwell.\" The reputation of Wimbledon manor house in the history of flower gardening thus begins with General Lambert, who painted some of the flowers he was cultivating. Though the Queen's flower gardens may have fallen to ruin in the decade of the Civil War, the glory of Wimbledon aside from the straight avenue of elms and other trees centred on the house, that stretched forth as far as Putney was chiefly its fruit. Among a thousand fruit trees of every kind, the Parliament-men who inventoried the house and gardens in 1649 noted the \"three great and fayer\" fig trees that covered a very \"greate part of the walls of the south side of the manor-house\" \"by the spreading and dilating of themselves in a very large proporcion, but yet in a most decent manner\"; to have grown so extensive in 1649 the figs must have been planted in the time of Lord Exeter or his son Lord Wimbledon. The orangery in 1649 held 42 orange trees planted in boxes, valued at £10 each, and 18 young ones, a lemon tree \"bearing greate and very large lemmons\" (£20) a \"pomecitron\" tree\" (\"Citrus medica\", valued at £10), and six pomegranate trees. Doubtless the inventoried bay tree (\"Laurus nobilis\") and the equally tender \"Irish arbutis, very lovely to looke upon,\" were being taken into the orangery for winter protection, as England was then in the frigid grip of the Little Ice Age.\nThe Restoration.\n When the monarchy was restored in 1660 with Charles II, Wimbledon manor was promptly given back to Charles' widow Henrietta-Maria, who sold it the following year to trustees for John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol. Bristol's widow sold it to Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, the Lord Treasurer, who was afterwards created Duke of Leeds. John Evelyn's name is loosely connected with the gardens on the grounds he went with the Lord Treasurer to view the house and grounds, 18 March 1678: of an entry in his diary that same year: \"My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him.to Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol ; so breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with two of his daughters, my lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne, and having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.\"\nSir Theodore Janssen.\nThe Duke's heirs sold the manor in 1717, to Sir Theodore Janssen 1st Baronet of Wimbledon, one of the founding directors of the Bank of England, the new parallel East India Company, and the ill-fated South Sea Company. Janssen paid the famous architect Colen Campbell and Gould, £70 as \"overseers\" of a new house to be built for him at Wimbledon in 1720. Built in part with brick from the Elizabethan manor house on a new site to the south west of St Mary's church. Janssen, as a director of the South Sea Company, was heavily involved in the South Sea Bubble fiasco, where the directors were accused by Parliament, in 1721, of committing fraud. Parliament itself was not immune from implication in the scandal, for several members of the cabinet were impeached for their corruption. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Aislabie, was found guilty of the \"most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption\", and imprisoned. Janssen petitioned Parliament for leniency before they introduced a Bill enabling them to confiscate the assets of the directors. Parliament allowed him to keep £50,000 but in the end he evidently kept £100,000\" Consequently, in 1721, he was also stripped of Wimbledon manor by Parliament.\nIn 1741, Janssen, appears to be living next door to the house he had built, albeit with the Campbell design incomplete (see map). Because the house was sold in 1749, the year after his death, this might indicate that he at least continued to own the house, which had been separated from the manor estate, in 1721; with the Rush family as tenants (see map). This theory appears to be confirmed by the Wimbledon Museum: \"Although he (Janssen) was allowed to keep his newly built house he preferred to live in another, nearer the High Street\". Reports that the Duchess of Marlborough owned and demolished this house, therefore, seem to be incorrect. Sir Theodore continued to live out his life quietly in Wimbledon. He died in 1748 aged 94 and is buried in the graveyard of St Mary's Church. \nSo in 1749 the Janssen house and land comprising some 70 acres, was sold to Mrs Martha Rush. In 1759 it was inherited by her son Samuel. In 1782 alterations were made to the facade and a further storey was added; possibly completing the original Campbell design (see pic). In 1783 the estate was inherited by Sir William Beaumaris Rush who died there in 1833 aged 83. The family were for a century and a half the proprietors of a great vinegar yard in Southwark, afterwards Potts's, and from the last of those wealthy merchants Sir William inherited a large fortune. The house, which had become known as Belvedere House, stood at what became the rear gardens of today's Nos. 6-12 Alan Road, was eventually demolished in 1900, to make way for a housing development to be known as the Belvedere Estate.\nThe Duchess of Marlborough.\nIn 1723, the manor was purchased for £15,000 by Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Sarah was the widow of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who had died the year before, in 1722.The Duchess demolished the remains of the old Cecil manor house then she turned to the \"Architect Earl\" of Pembroke, Henry Herbert, for another house on a new site completed in 1733. This was immediately behind where the former Cecil house had stood and close to the junction of the present Arthur Road and Home Park Road in the grounds of the current Ricards Lodge school.This iteration of Wimbledon manor house was engraved in 1771 for the fifth volume of \"Vitruvius Britannicus\", where attribution for the design of fifty years previous was given to Lord Pembroke's assistant Roger Morris. Letters of the Duchess of Marlborough do mention Morris on the site, but implying that he was acting on Pembroke's behalf, and the architect-builder Francis Smith of Warwick is also mentioned, as surveyor. \nPalladian Wimbledon manor was a compact house of gray brick with Portland stone dressings, of seven bays, its broader end bays slightly projecting; the three central bays were crowned with a pediment over a lightly projecting Ionic portico of four attached columns.The ground floor was sunken to allow the Duchess, who had gout, to enter at first floor level, without going up steps. Evidently the Duchess was not pleased with the finished house for she wrote to her granddaughter, Diana, Duchess of Bedford, sometime between 1732 and 1735 that the Earl's talent was little more than to \"imitate ill whatever was useless\" in Inigo Jones and Palladio's buildings.\nEnglish Heritage, which lists Wimbledon Park a Grade II* protected monument, suggest that the Duchess consulted the landscape gardener Charles Bridgeman, but the extent of his contribution is unknown. Through the Duchess of Marlborough, Wimbledon manor passed, in 1744, to her heir, the 10-year-old John, Viscount Spencer, soon to be made the 1st Earl Spencer.Under a contract of late 1764 Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown undertook landscaping projects in the park, which still comprised some 1200 acres; his work, which included the lake (Wimbledon Park Lake), was complete by 1768, In 1780, Hannah More visited the house as the guest of Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St. Asaph, to whom Lord Spencer lent the house annually for a season: \"\"I did not think there could have been so beautiful a place within seven miles of London. The park has as much variety of ground, and is as un-Londonish as if it were an hundred miles out.\" \"Hannah More enjoyed the Duchess of Marlborough's books in the library, where: \"numbers of the books were presents to her from the great authors of her time, whose names she had carefully written in the blank leaves, for I believe she had the pride of being thought learned, as well as rich and beautiful.\" \"elegantly fitted up, and are used as an occasional retirement by Lord Spencer's family. The situation is singularly eligible, having a beautiful home prospect of the park, with a fine piece of water towards the north, and an extensive view over the country of Surrey on the south.\" The house burnt down at Easter 1785, spreading from the laundry-room where linen was being aired in preparation for the return of the family after a brief absence. Lord Spencer cleared away the ruins and leveled and turfed the ground, so that scarcely a trace remained of its foundations except for a tunnel, which still survives, which had linked the main house to the separate staff quarters.\nSpencer Wimbledon.\nBetween 1799 and 1802 the 2nd Earl Spencer had Wimbledon manor house rebuilt, in the Regency style, very close to the site of the Marlborough house, incorporating the surviving staff quarters. The new house would be called Wimbledon Park House, allegedly to designs by 'Capability' Brown's son-in-law, Henry Holland. Joseph Paxton, renowned later as the designer of the Crystal Palace for the 1851 Great Exhibition, worked here as a garden-boy assisting his brother, the head gardener. Sir Joseph Paxton returned to design new formal gardens in the 1840s for the Duke of Somerset, Spencer's tenant at the house from 1827. In 1838 the Duke entertained Queen Victoria there. In 1846 the Spencers left Wimbledon Park House, selling the estate (but not the manorial title) for £85,000 (£71 an acre), to the real estate developer John Augustus Beaumont, an insurance company director, who reduced the size of the park after 1860, with speculative streets of houses. The last Wimbledon manor house, Wimbledon Park House, isolated from its parkland and surrounded by increasingly dense suburban development, and having passed through a succession of owners, became dilapidated — the house was demolished in about 1949. The land on which it and the Marlborough house had stood was the site of Park House Middle School, built in 1972 and demolished in the early 2000s after Merton Council reverted to a two-tier school system. It now forms part of the sports fields of Ricards Lodge School. In 1864, still lord of the manor, the 5th Earl, attempted to get a private parliamentary bill to enclose Wimbledon Common, which he still owned, for the creation of a new park with a house and gardens and to sell part for building. Though Sir Joseph Paxton testified on Earl Spencer's behalf, in a landmark decision for English common land, and following an enquiry, permission was refused and 1871-created Board of Conservators received the land to preserve it in its natural condition. In 1996 the 9th Earl Spencer sold his vestigial interest in Wimbledon, the title of lord of the manor of Wimbledon, to a buyer from Brazil for £171,000; manors may bring minor rights such as fishing, lesser mineral, and foraging rights but no powers nor property are believed to appertain to the archaic estate (interest in land), an incorporeal hereditament."

        "title": "2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final",
        "text": "The 2009 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. A significant part of the Federer–Roddick rivalry, it pitted five-time champion Roger Federer against American Andy Roddick for the third time in a Wimbledon final and the fourth time in a Grand Slam final. After 4 hours and 17 minutes, Federer won 5–7, 7–6(8–6), 7–6(7–5), 3–6, 16–14.\nThis match was historic as it saw Federer capture his fifteenth major title, breaking the all-time Grand Slam record held by Pete Sampras. The victory also caused Federer to reclaim the world number 1 ranking from his rival Rafael Nadal.\nThe championship set a record for longest match played in Grand Slam final history (in terms of games), due, particularly, to the unprecedented thirty games contested in the ultimate set. \nThis record will likely never be broken, due to a tie-break rule imposed by the Grand Slam Board in March 2022, which enforces a 10-point tie-break once the score reaches 6–6 in any Grand Slam final set.\nBackground.\nRoger Federer had tied Sampras with fourteen major singles titles a month earlier at the 2009 French Open and was seeking to set a new standard of excellence in the men's game by capturing an unprecedented fifteenth championship. Former world number 1 Andy Roddick was looking to capture his first Wimbledon title and second Grand Slam, having won the 2003 US Open.\nThe 2009 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the fourth Grand Slam final that Federer and Roddick had contested and by far the most competitive. Federer had won all of the previous finals at the 2004 Wimbledon Championships, the 2005 Wimbledon Championships and the 2006 US Open.\nFederer had cruised through the bottom half of the draw only dropping a single set en route to his seventh consecutive Wimbledon final. Roddick, however, had survived a grueling five set quarterfinal against former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt where he won 6–3, 6–7(10–12), 7–6(7–1), 4–6, 6–4. Roddick then defeated British hope Andy Murray, the world number 3, in the semifinals 6–4, 4–6, 7–6(9–7), 7–6(7–5) to book a spot in his third Wimbledon final.\nMatch details.\nThe chair umpire was Lars Graff of Sweden. Both players began the match strongly, with the first eleven games of the first set going with serve. However, with Federer serving at 5–6, Roddick broke to take the first set. Perhaps the most critical moment of the match was in the second-set tiebreaker, when Roddick led 6–2 with four set points to take a commanding lead. Federer subsequently reeled off six consecutive points to even the match at one set apiece. The most memorable moment of the tiebreaker was when Roddick served at 6–5 set point and botched a back-hand volley wide to even up the tiebreaker.\nThe third set was a tight affair without any breaks of serve for the second consecutive set. The tiebreaker went to Federer who was now only one set away from breaking Pete Sampras' all-time Grand Slam record. Roddick, however, surprised many by breaking Federer in the fourth set to even the match and take the Wimbledon final to a decisive fifth set for the third consecutive year.\nThe fifth set would turn out to be a historic battle. Both players were dominant on serve throughout the first sixteen games without a single break point opportunity to be had. A moment of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8–8 down 15–40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not another break opportunity until Roddick served at 14–15 and Federer broke him, for the first time in the entire match, to win a record-breaking fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.\nStatistics.\nSource\nSignificance.\nThis match was the culmination of Federer's historic summer of 2009. After winning the French Open a month earlier to complete the career grand slam, Federer's win gave him his standalone record 15th major title and led many to proclaim him as the greatest player of all time.\nDue to the historic nature of Federer's accomplishment, Pete Sampras flew to London from California to witness Federer set the all-time Grand Slam record. It was the first time that he had returned to the All England Club for The Championships since 2002. Other tennis legends Björn Borg and Rod Laver also attended.\nThe match set the record of most games played in a Grand Slam final (77) and most games played in the fifth set of any Grand Slam final (30). The previous record for most games played in a Grand Slam final was the 1927 Australian Championships final (71) and the previous record for most games in a fifth set was the 1927 French Championships final (20). Roddick's 39 winning games in the final was the most won by any player, not to have also won the championship.\nIn the United States the match was the most watched Wimbledon final in a decade, since the all American contest of Sampras-Agassi in 1999. It pulled in 5.71 million viewers, which constituted a 9% increase over the Federer–Nadal final of 2008. In the United Kingdom the final averaged 7.1 million viewers, with a peak of 11.1 million when Federer clinched victory."

Zhang improved his record to 10.00 in the semifinal, but failed to advance to the final, it took 9 thousands faster as Christophe Lemaitre was the last qualifier. He was also timed officially in 10.00 in the same second heat of the semifinal round. Jamaica qualified four individuals into the final.\nWith his record, Usain Bolt was the favorite and with defending champion Yohan Blake injured, Justin Gatlin was Bolt's closest expected rival. Gatlin did have an early season victory against Bolt.\nThe final was held in a rainstorm. Gatlin got the best start, but Bolt, who overtook Gatlin, pulled away for the win. Nesta Carter chased them to finish third. Under the conditions, the medallists were the only finalists to improve upon their semifinal time in better weather earlier in the evening.\nWith the Russian all comers record at 10.03 coming into this meet, three competitors improved upon this mark through the heats. First Kemar Bailey-Cole improved the record to 10.02 in heat 1, which stood for less than 10 minutes when Gatlin took the record to 9.99 in heat 3 and 15 minutes later, Mike Rodgers improved it to 9.98 in heat 6. In the first semifinal, Gatlin regained the record, running 9.94, which lasted until the next semifinal when Nickel Ashmeade ran 9.90.

Mid way into the turn, Usain Bolt had a clear lead. Coming off the turn, Bolt had several meters on the field. The winner determined, Bolt eased off and cruised across the finish in what would be a great time for any other human being, just a slow 200 for Bolt in 19.66. Coming off the turn about even with Gemili and Nickel Ashmeade, Warren Weir out in lane 8 separated from those two and gained significantly on the slowing Bolt, setting a personal best of 19.79.\nTaking a lesson from American teammate Wallace Spearmon who was vanquished in the semis, Curtis Mitchell spotted the field several meters then closed from dead last at the end of the turn to take the bronze.

At the gun, Merritt took it out hard, passing Luguelín Santos to his outside and leaving him a couple meters behind at the halfway mark. James worked hard along the backstretch and into the turn to keep up with Merritt reaching the final straight two meters back, Jonathan Borlée one meter further back while the rest of the field almost 5 meters back with Santos the last out of the turn. Then the long striding James began to flail in quicksand. As Merritt charged home for the personal best 43.74 win, James fell back through the field.

        "title": "Alex Guerrero (baseball)",
        "text": "Alexander Guerrero Perez (born November 20, 1986) is a Cuban-born former professional baseball left fielder and third baseman. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Major League Baseball (MLB) and for the Chunichi Dragons and Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He defected from Cuba in 2013 to pursue a contract in\nMLB. He signed with the Dodgers and made his MLB debut in 2014. He played primarily shortstop in Cuba, but played third base and left field for the Dodgers, who released him in 2016.\nCareer.\nCuban career.\nAs a member of Cuba's Las Tunas team in the Cuban National Series, Guerrero was named to the 2010–2011 All-Star team as well as playing for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2012 Haarlem Baseball Week and the 2011 World Port Tournament. He was part of the initial roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but did not make the final roster and reportedly sat out the regular season because he was upset at his snub.\nU.S. career.\nHe defected from Cuba in 2013 and obtained residency in Haiti. He began training in the Dominican Republic and on September 9, 2013, it was reported that he had been cleared by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to sign with U.S. teams.\nGuerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years. The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22.\nGuerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\n2014.\nGuerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes.\nDuring a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats.\n2015.\nIn spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract allowing him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on their opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense.\nIn his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nAfter two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well there was a clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games.\nOn June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers.\nHis production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average.\n2016.\nGuerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8.\nChunichi Dragons.\nOn November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi franchise record for most consecutive games with a home run, with 6, after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a home run set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2.\nYomiuri Giants.\nOn December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal. On December 2, 2019, he became a free agent.\nFubon Guardians.\nIn May 2021, Guerrero agreed to a deal with the Fubon Guardians of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). However, shortly after signing, Taiwan was shut down due to a COVID-19 outbreak and Guerrero was unable to enter the country. When borders reopened, Guerrero opted-out of his contract with the team without having played in a game."

        "title": "2012 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final",
        "text": "The 2012 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships. It pitted six-time champion Roger Federer and Andy Murray against each other in a Grand Slam final for the third time. After 3 hours and 24 minutes, Federer emerged victorious 4–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–4.\nThe match saw Federer win a record seventeenth major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon championship. The victory also caused Federer to dethrone Novak Djokovic as World No. 1 and break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men's tennis, having been one week short of the record when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010.\nMurray became the first British man to reach the final of Wimbledon since 1938, and was seeking to be the first British Wimbledon champion since 1936.\nBackground.\nRoger Federer entered the match as the all-time Grand Slam champion with a record of sixteen major titles, although he had not won any in the two and a half years since his victory at the 2010 Australian Open. Andy Murray had not yet won a single major title and was looking to avoid being the first male player since his coach Ivan Lendl to lose his first four finals.\nThe 2012 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the third Grand Slam final that Federer and Murray had contested. Federer had won both previous finals, at the 2008 US Open and the 2010 Australian Open.\nSince Federer's victory at the 2010 Australian Open, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had combined to win nine consecutive major tournaments, and had competed head-to-head in the last four consecutive finals. Nadal, however, had suffered a second round defeat to world no. 100 Lukas Rosol. Federer, on the other hand, had to battle through an epic five-set encounter in the third round against Frenchman Julien Benneteau where he survived 4–6, 6–7, 6–2, 7–6, 6–1. Federer would go on to beat the world no. 1 and defending champion Djokovic in the semifinals to reach the Wimbledon final for a record eighth appearance.\nMatch details.\nThe chair umpire was Enric Molina of Spain.\nThe players traded breaks early in the first set before Murray broke Federer in the ninth game and served out the set at 6–4. Murray had multiple chances to break throughout the beginning of the second set, but the six-time champion fought off all four break points. Federer broke Murray at 6–5 with a drop volley winner on set point. Rain stopped play early in the third set, and play was suspended for half an hour as the roof was closed for the first time for a Wimbledon final. The crucial moment came in the sixth game of the third set which lasted 20 minutes and saw ten deuces, with Federer finally converting the break on his sixth opportunity. Federer earned a break early in the fourth set and served the match out for his seventh Wimbledon Championship 4–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–4.\nStatistics.\nSource\nSignificance.\nThe match enabled Federer to break three of the sport's most prestigious all-time records. He broke his own all-time record of Grand Slams, setting the new mark at seventeen. He also tied Pete Sampras for the most Wimbledon singles titles with seven.\nFederer secured the world no. 1 position for the first time since June 2010 which enabled him to pass Sampras and set the record for most weeks at the summit of men's tennis. Federer went on to spend an additional 17 weeks at world no. 1 and set the record (since the 1973 inception of the ATP rankings) at 302 weeks. It was Federer's last major title for four and a half years, when he won his 18th grand slam at the 2017 Australian Open.\nFor Murray, it was his fourth grand slam final defeat without yet achieving a victory, emulating his coach Ivan Lendl. However, four weeks later Murray defeated Federer in three straight sets to win the Olympic men's singles gold for Great Britain, which also took place at Wimbledon on the very same centre court. Murray also won his first grand slam title that year at the US Open and his first Wimbledon title the following year.\nThis was the first final to be played under the new retractable roof that was originally installed in 2009.\nThe television ratings in the United Kingdom set a record with 16.9 million viewers, which was the highest Wimbledon final viewership since accurate statistics began in 1990. In the United States it scored the second largest ratings for a Wimbledon final in the last decade behind only 2009 when Federer beat American Andy Roddick 16–14 in the fifth set."

        "title": "2014 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2014 State of Origin series was the 33rd time the annual best-of-three series between the Queensland and New South Wales rugby league teams has been played entirely under 'state of origin' rules (1980 and 1981 were only 1 game series). It is the second series to be administered by the Australian Rugby League Commission which was created in a major restructure of the sport's administration in Australia.\nOriginally, New South Wales were to host two home matches this year, however the ARLC Commission announced in November 2012 a new five-year cycle which would see Queensland instead host two home matches this year, as well as in 2017, the Blues to host two home matches in 2016 and the remaining match in 2015 to be hosted at a neutral venue (later named to be the 100,024 capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground).\nFormer Canberra, Queensland and Australian captain Mal Meninga remained as coach of the Queensland side, having won all eight previous editions dating back to 2006. New South Wales were coached by former Canberra, NSW and Australia captain Laurie Daley for a second consecutive year.\nConsecutive victories over Queensland in the first and second games with respective scores of 12–8 and 6–4 have enabled New South Wales to finally conclude their opposition's eight year domination of uninterrupted Origin series victories. Additionally, with the exception of Luke Lewis, every player to have so far featured in this year's New South Wales squad have achieved their first ever series win. The Blues had the chance to record their first series clean sweep since 2000, however the Maroons won the final game 32–8 to reduce the final series margin to 2–1 in New South Wales' favour.\nGame I.\nBreaking usual tradition, the Queensland squad was announced before New South Wales. Changes to the team were largely minor with Matt Gillett earning his first promotion to the starting side to replace the injured Sam Thaiday in the second-row whilst Aidan Guerra from the Sydney Roosters makes his debut from the bench. The halves combination for New South Wales were once again modified, with Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs pairing Josh Reynolds and Trent Hodkinson (making his debut) replacing the Roosters and incumbent halves pairing of James Maloney and Mitchell Pearce. Pearce, who played in every game as halfback since the second match of the 2010 series and held the record for consecutive matches in the position, was omitted largely due to him being arrested at a Kings Cross nightclub for drunken misbehaviour. After missing out from the second and third games from last year due to injury, Jarryd Hayne returned to the side to reclaim his fullback role over Josh Dugan. Daniel Tupou will be the second debutant in the side to partner his Roosters team mate Michael Jennings on the left edge, with Brett Morris switching to the other side to be alongside his twin brother Josh. Beau Scott was recalled into the side in the starting second-row after being overlooked from last year's series. Joining the bench, fellow forward Tony Williams was also recalled due to improved form and likely combinations with his club team mate halves. Notable forced omissions from the squad were Greg Bird (suspension), Andrew Fifita (injury) and Boyd Cordner (injury).\nQueensland opened the scoring for the series with a try to winger Darius Boyd in the fifth minute. The attempted conversion from Johnathan Thurston, who only needed four points to surpass Mal Meninga as the highest pointscorer in Origin history, was unsuccessful; leaving the score 4–0 to the Maroons.\nShortly after, halfback Cooper Cronk left the field with a broken arm, and did not return for the match. This meant that interchange player Daly Cherry-Evans was brought on to replace Cronk, thus unsettling the Maroons' attacking structure. At 19 minutes, winger Brett Morris scored the Blues' first try, but appeared to suffer a shoulder injury in doing so. Another try to the Blues, through fullback Jarryd Hayne, saw the Blues lead the Maroons 10–4 at halftime.\nBoyd scored the only try of the second half in the 57th minute, and was denied a third when former Dragons team-mate Morris tackled him just short of the try-line with five minutes remaining. Queensland continued to attack the New South Wales line in the final minutes; they had one last play after a penalty in the last few seconds, but desperate defence from the Blues ensured that they would win their first match in Brisbane since 2009 and first Game I in the city since 2003.\nThe Blues' victory set a new television viewership record for an opening State of Origin match, with 2.596 million metro viewers watching the match, with 1.23 million watching in Sydney alone. Total national viewership was 4.056 million. \nIn the aftermath of the Blues' victory, five-eighth Josh Reynolds was charged with a dangerous tackle on the Maroons' Brent Tate, but earned a successful downgrade at the judiciary, freeing him to play in Game II, while Brett Morris was later diagnosed with a fractured shoulder which has ruled him out for the entire series. Maroons halfback Cooper Cronk's arm injury resulted in a prognosis of up to twelve weeks, meaning his Origin series was already over.\nGame II.\nHeading into the second match of the series, Queensland had a host of injury concerns with Billy Slater, Greg Inglis and Daly Cherry-Evans all in significant doubt, whilst the man Cherry-Evans deputised for, Cooper Cronk, was suspected to be ruled out of the remainder of the series with a broken arm he suffered in the first game. As a result, Mal Meninga chose to carry 22 man squad into game two, where he would name Will Chambers, Ben Hunt, Jacob Lillyman, Anthony Milford and Willie Tonga as his reserves. Sam Thaiday returned from injury that ruled him of the first game to rejoin the starting forward pack. To further complicate matters, forwards Josh Papalii and Corey Parker would later rule themselves out with injury, forcing Meninga to announce David Taylor as another reserve. On game day, Slater, Inglis and Cherry-Evans would pass fitness to reprise their positions, with Thaiday named at lock and Aidan Guerra into the starting second row. Changes on the bench saw Taylor and Lilyman joining the demoted Chris McQueen.\nLaurie Daley would have his own share of injury headaches, as twins and right side wing-centre pairing Brett Morris and Josh Morris were ultimately ruled out with injuries sustained from game one. Daley would choose Will Hopoate and Josh Dugan as the respective replacements, both players of whom debuted in 2011 as centre and fullback but were instead selected to play in unfamiliar positions. Unavailable for the first game due to suspension, Greg Bird returns to the side as lock, shifting Paul Gallen to the front row whilst James Tamou replaced Tony Williams on the interchange.\nThe first half was played with high intensity displayed from both sides, with the only points in the first half coming from two penalty goals to Maroons five-eighth Johnathan Thurston; those two successful penalty conversions saw him overtake his coach Mal Meninga as the highest pointscorer in State of Origin history. Nearing halftime, Blues five-eighth Josh Reynolds prevented a certain Maroons try by kicking the ball away from the Maroons' tryline.\nSam Thaiday appeared to have scored the first try of the match for the Maroons in the 51st minute, only for the replay to show that he had lost possession of the ball whilst trying to ground the ball on the try-line thanks to a strong tackle from Jarryd Hayne. Following numerous handling mistakes from the Blues, halfback Trent Hodkinson then scored the only try of the match with seven minutes to go; his successful conversion seeing the team lead 6–4 entering the final five minutes. The game had controversy with the kick restart being declared by the referee to be out on the full providing NSW with a penalty from half way despite replays clearly showing the ball touching Aaron Woods which should have resulted in a NSW goal line drop out, providing QLD with an attacking opportunity.\nQueensland were unable to score in the final five minutes, resulting in New South Wales clinching their first series victory since 2005 and sentencing Maroons coach Mal Meninga to his first and only Origin series defeat since taking over as coach of Queensland in 2006. The match result of 6–4 also resulted as the Maroons' first tryless defeat since 1999. As a result of the victory, a fireworks display was held at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe game also again saw the Origin Record for TV Ratings broken, with 2.682 million metro viewers and a national total of 4.159 million watching the match.\nGame III.\nAs had been the case in the first two matches, the first half was a defensive affair, with the first try not coming until just before half-time, when Cameron Smith pounced on a kick by Daly Cherry-Evans to score close to the posts with two minutes remaining. The successful conversion by Johnathan Thurston made the score 6–2 in favour of the Maroons at half-time.\nAt half-time, most of the former players who had taken part during Queensland's eight-year Origin reign were honoured.\nThe Maroons dominated in the second half, scoring four tries to one as they easily produced the best attacking performance of any state this series. Tries to Billy Slater, Darius Boyd, Aidan Guerra and Cooper Cronk pushed the final score out to 32–8. Josh Dugan scored the only try for the Blues, whose five-eighth Josh Reynolds was booked for a shoulder charge on Maroons winger Will Chambers in the second half.\nQueensland's 32–8 Game III victory saw them outscore the Blues 44–26 across the three matches. Queensland's win also made Cameron Smith the first player in State of Origin history to win 20 games.\nAfter both states completed their lap of honour post-match, Paul Gallen then became the first New South Wales captain since Danny Buderus in 2005 to raise the State of Origin shield. Gallen was also named the Wally Lewis Medallist for being the best player in the series, whilst Corey Parker was named by Channel Nine as the man-of-the-match.\nTeams.\nThe 18th, 19th &amp; 20th man are reserves to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, do not actually play.\nQueensland Maroons.\n1 - The number 11 jumper was rested in honour of Arthur Beetson in Game One, which marked the 100th State Of Origin game, with Chris McQueen wearing the number 18 jumper. Playing at prop forward, Beetson captained Queensland in the first ever State of Origin game at Lang Park in 1980 and wore the number 11 jumper.\nUnder-20s.\nNew South Wales retained the Darren Lockyer Shield.\nNSW: Clint Gutherson (Manly), Jake Mamo (Newcastle), Aaron Gray (South Sydney), Sione Mata'utia (Newcastle), Tyrone Phillips (Canterbury), Drew Hutchison (St George Illawarra), Mitchell Moses (Wests Tigers), Jake Trbojevic (Manly), Kaysa Pritchard (c) (Parramatta), Matthew Lodge (Wests Tigers), Jakiel Mariner (Sydney Roosters), Adam Elliott (Canterbury), Jack Bird (St George Illawarra).

        "text": "Derrick Lamont Coleman (born October 18, 1990) is a former American football fullback who is an assistant to player engagement for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Minnesota Vikings in 2012. He played college football for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nEarly life.\nColeman became deaf when he was three years old; he primarily uses lip reading for communication. He attended Troy High School in Fullerton, California, and played college football for UCLA.\nPlaying career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nColeman went undrafted, then signed as an undrafted free agent with the Minnesota Vikings on April 28, 2012. He was waived by the Vikings in August.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nColeman was signed by the Seattle Seahawks in December 2012. He made the 2013 season cut after the fourth preseason game and thus was added to the 53-man roster. In week one's game between the Seahawks and the Carolina Panthers, Coleman had three catches for 30 yards. Coleman scored his first NFL touchdown on December 2, 2013, on \"Monday Night Football\" against the New Orleans Saints off of a ricocheted ball from Kellen Davis. Coleman was a part of the Seahawks Super Bowl XLVIII championship team. On October 15, 2015, Coleman was suspended indefinitely after an arrest on hit-and-run charges, but the suspension was lifted on October 19, after a team investigation.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn March 21, 2017, Coleman signed with the Atlanta Falcons. On September 10, he made his Falcons debut in the 23–17 victory over the Chicago Bears.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn May 9, 2018, Coleman signed with the Arizona Cardinals.\nOn November 19, 2020, the Las Vegas Raiders hosted Coleman for a workout.\nExecutive career.\nOn April 18, 2023, Coleman was hired by the Green Bay Packers as assistant to player engagement, serving under Grey Ruegamer.\nPersonal life.\nColeman is a Christian.\nIn January 2014, Coleman was featured in a widely praised commercial for Duracell batteries. The commercial inspired twin sisters Riley and Erin Kovalcik, who also wear hearing aids, to write him a letter of support. After exchanging letters, Coleman and Duracell decided to invite the Kovalcik family to watch the Super Bowl XLVIII in person on February 2, 2014.\nOn October 15, 2015, Coleman was reportedly driving his Dodge Ram erratically in Bellevue, Washington. It is alleged that Coleman fled the scene on foot but was spotted and detained by police within 10 minutes. Police reported that Coleman claimed to have smoked spice, a synthetic form of marijuana, about an hour prior to the incident. On October 6, 2016, he pled guilty to vehicular assault and hit-and-run charges. On October 15, 2016, he was ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service and was required to be under community supervision for 12 months. Under the agreement, he was also required to pay the victim restitution and property damages. In the NFL, Coleman served a four-game suspension which commenced on October 14, 2016."

        "title": "2013 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2013 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2013 NRL season. Played on Sunday, 6 October at Sydney's ANZ Stadium between the minor premiers Sydney Roosters and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. The Roosters won the match 26–18 to claim their 13th premiership title, and became the first team since the St George Illawarra Dragons in 2010 to win both the minor premiership and the premiership in the same season.\nBackground.\nThe NRL premiership for the 2013 season was decided between two Sydney based clubs, the minor premiers Sydney Roosters and the 4th-placed Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. It was the first time in 41 years the two sides played for a premiership title, Manly being victorious on the previous occasion, claiming the 1972 title 19-14 in the then NSWRL competition. Both the Roosters and Manly-Warringah had featured prominently in grand finals since the turn of the new century, with the Roosters making the grand finals in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2010, whilst the Manly club had featured in 2007, 2008 and 2011 deciders. Despite making the most appearances in the past 14 seasons the Roosters had only been successful in one of their six previous appearances, when they defeated grand final debutants New Zealand Warriors 30 points to 8 in 2002. Manly's last premiership victory was also against the New Zealand Warriors when they defeated them in the 2011 decider 24 points to 10. It marked the first time since 2005 that neither Wayne Bennett, Craig Bellamy or Des Hasler will not coach a side to a grand final, as each had claimed a grand final victory during the previous seven seasons. Both Trent Robinson and Geoff Toovey were debutant grand final coaches in their first and second respective years in the NRL.\nTeam lists.\nNote: Both Boyd Cordner and Luke O'Donnell were late inclusions to the Roosters squad with Cordner replacing Frank-Paul Nuuausala at lock and both Nuuausala and O'Donnell replacing Isaac Liu and Dylan Napa on the interchange bench.\nMatch details.\n1st half.\nManly began strongly and had control early on. Pressure led to Roosters five-eighth James Maloney kicking out on the full, and a tackle from his opposing number Kieran Foran on back-rower Sonny-Bill Williams led to a dropped ball and possession for the Manly side, which quickly led to their first try, scored by winger Jorge Taufua. Captain Jamie Lyon missed the conversion, making it 4–0 to Manly-Warringah, however a penalty a few minutes later led to a scoreline of 6-0 by the 17th minute. The Roosters came back to score through winger Daniel Tupou on the back of a cross-field bomb from Maloney, and the 's sideline conversion brought the scoreline to 6–6. A few minutes later a contentious penalty to the Roosters gave them another two points, and they took the lead into the halftime break, 8–6.\n2nd half.\nIn only the 43rd minute, Manly were in scoring position, with halfback Daly Cherry-Evans grubber-kicking for Lyon, however he was tackled without the ball by Roosters substitute Mitch Aubusson, leading the video referees to rule a penalty try. Lyon converted it to bring Manly-Warringah back to the lead at 12–8. A forced drop-out conceded by the Roosters put Manly into attacking position quickly and they capitalised, Matai scoring and Lyon again converting to push the score out to 18–8 with only 30 minutes remaining. Roosters back-rower Aiden Guerra next scored however, and a conversion brought the Roosters back into the game at 18–14, before a line-break and offload from Williams to Maloney opened Manly's defensive line. Maloney sprinted downfield and gave a pass to Minichello. The Roosters captain then put centre Shaun Kenny-Dowall in to score which, along with a conversion from Maloney, put the Minor Premiers back in the lead at 20–18 with 18 minutes to go. An error from the Roosters put Manly back into contention, but a knock on from winger David Williams and a lack of capitalisation on a Roosters mistake brought them back to the Manly end of the field following another line-break from the Roosters' Williams. A grubber kick from Maloney led to a freakish try to centre Michael Jennings, who grounded the ball only centimetres inside the dead ball line. A final conversion to Maloney took the score to 26–18, and even a short kick-off attempt from Manly couldn't crack the Roosters' defence in the last six minutes of play.\nPost-match.\nSydney Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello became the first fullback to captain his team to a Grand Final victory since Frank 'Skinny' McMillan in 1934. Manly halfback Daly Cherry-Evans was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for best and fairest in the Grand Final, the first awarded to a player from a losing side since 1993, and only the third time this had happened, at the time. Jack Wighton, from the Canberra Raiders, later achieved this, coincidentally against the Roosters, in 2019. Roosters coach Trent Robinson became the first coach to win a premiership in their first year of coaching in the NRL since Ricky Stuart in 2002.\nThe premiership rings awarded to the members of the winning team were worth AU$6,000.\nAftermath.\nThe Roosters' premiership victory qualified them for the 2014 World Club Challenge, to be played in the 2014 pre-season against the winners of the 2013 Super League Grand final, Wigan Warriors."

        "title": "Ted Page (baseball)",
        "text": "Theodore Roosevelt Page (April 22, 1903 - December 1, 1984), nicknamed \"Terrible Ted\", was an American baseball player. From 1923 to 1937, Page played for numerous Negro league teams, including the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords. On a 1986 Larry Fritsch baseball card (“Negro League Baseball Stars, #4), “…Page is regarded as one of the best outfielders ever to play the game.” He is a member of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nPage was born in Glasgow, Kentucky in 1903. In his early years, Page said that he had no awareness of racial differences. His family moved to Youngstown, Ohio when he was nine, and they lived in a neighborhood largely composed of families of European descent. He said that many of his childhood friends were Polish and Italian. Representatives from the Ohio State University football team pursued Page and his friend Joe Donchess, but Page did not finish high school and Donchess ended up as an All-American end at University of Pittsburgh.\nCareer.\nIn 1923, Page signed with the Toledo Tigers, but he was cut before playing a game. Over the next several seasons, he played for numerous Negro league teams, including the Newark Stars, Brooklyn Royal Giants and Baltimore Black Sox.\nPage played with the Homestead Grays in 1930 and 1931. Page is sometimes remembered for a fight that he had with Grays teammate George Scales. He knocked out two of Scales's teeth after Scales criticized his performance on the field. The fight was broken up, but Page slept with a gun in his hand that night and Scales kept a knife in his hand. He moved on to the Pittsburgh Crawfords, where he batted in front of Cool Papa Bell. Players on Gus Greenlee's Crawfords teams frequently worked for Greenlee in the offseason. One winter after a Crawfords season, Page made $15 per week to act as a watchman at the numbers house of owner Gus Greenlee. Teammate Judy Johnson once worked as Greenlee's chauffeur.\nIn 1934, popular major league pitcher Dizzy Dean assembled a team of major league players and a team of Negro league players to tour large metropolitan areas and play exhibition games against each other. The Negro league team included Page, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Jud \"Boojum\" Wilson and Cool Papa Bell. The major league team included Paul Dean, Larry French and a retired Hack Wilson. Page said that his team won seven out of nine matchups.\nLater life and legacy.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Page operated a bowling alley in Pittsburgh. He was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1977. Page was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat on December 1, 1984. Jeffrey Sullivan, 20, was charged with his murder. Sullivan had performed yard work for Page and said that Page owed him money. Sullivan was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving a life sentence.\nIn August 2013, the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project announced that it would hold a ceremony to mark Page's grave at Allegheny Cemetery in Pennsylvania. Page's ashes were thought to have been lost, but they were located in a community cellar at the cemetery. During his later life, Page raised money to mark the grave of Negro league star Josh Gibson at the same cemetery.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads"

        "text": "The 2013–14 Akron Zips men's basketball team represented the University of Akron during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Zips, led by tenth year head coach Keith Dambrot, played their home games at the James A. Rhodes Arena as members of the East Division of the Mid-American Conference. They finished the season 21–13, 12–6 in MAC play to finish in second place in the East Division. They advanced to the semifinals of the MAC tournament where they lost to Western Michigan. They were invited to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament where they lost in the first round to IPFW.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nAkron announced their complete season schedule on September 2, 2013. On the non-conference schedule, the Zips announced they would compete in the annual Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii. Other key non-conference games included a trip to Saint Mary's during the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, as well as a road game against South Carolina. For the conference schedule, Akron scheduled home-and-home series with Ball State, Eastern Michigan, Ohio, Miami, Kent State, Bowling Green, and Buffalo. Northern Illinois, Toledo, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan were to be played once each.\nAkron opened their preseason with an exhibition victory against Bluffton on November 1. Senior Nick Harney scored 21 points to lead the Zips in a 95–40 rout.\nNovember.\nThe Zips hosted Coastal Carolina on November 8 in their season and home opener. Led by Demetrius Treadwell, who had 13 points and eight rebounds, the Zips held an 11-point lead at halftime and finished off a 72–63 victory, their first of the season. Akron then traveled to Moraga, California to take on traditional mid-major power Saint Mary's as part of the ESPN Hoops Tip-Off Marathon on November 12. The Zips kept it close early behind the play of Treadwell, and despite a strong advantage in rebounding, Akron's poor shooting couldn't lead them to victory, falling 63–85.\nOn November 16, the Zips traveled to Murfreesboro, Tennessee to take on 2013 NCAA tournament participant Middle Tennessee. After being tied at halftime, Akron stayed with three points until the Blue Raiders pulled ahead by five with 7:10 remaining, eventually winning 80–73. The win extended the Blue Raiders' home winning streak to 32 games.\nDecember.\nFollowing a three-week layoff without playing a game, the Zips returned to action on December 6 when they visited Cleveland State. Cleveland State lost the lead eight minutes into the first half, and Akron, led by Nick Harney, who scored 15 points, pulled out a 73–61 victory. One week later, the Zips hosted MEAC foe Bethune-Cookman. Akron held control of the game and never let go, and capped the first half with 37–6 run. Treadwell scored 19 points and shot a perfect 7–7 from the field to lead the team to an 84–56 win, their second straight.\nOn December 16, the Zips played host to the Golden Eagles of Oral Roberts University. Tied midway in the second half at 52, Reggie McAdams drained two 3-pointers that gave Akron a lead they would not relinquish en route to a 74–64 triumph.\nSchedule and results.\nSource: \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C29C41; color:#000E41;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C29C41; color:#000E41;\"| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C29C41; color:#000E41;\"| Conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C29C41; color:#000E41;\"| MAC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C29C41; color:#000E41;\"| CIT"

        "text": "Desmond Haynes is a retired West Indian cricketer and former captain of the West Indies cricket team. He played 116 Test 238 One Day International (ODI) matches, and scored 7,487 and 8,648 runs respectively. He scored centuries (100 or more runs in an innings) in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches on 18 and 17 occasions respectively during his international career. He was rated by \"Trinidad and Tobago Guardian\" as \"one of the greatest of all time\", while the BBC described him as \"one of the greatest opening partnerships in history with fellow Barbadian Gordon Greenidge.\" The cricket almanac \"Wisden\" noted his \"combination of timing and barely evident power\", and named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1991.\nHaynes made his Test debut against Australia at the Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, in March 1978. His first Test century came in February 1980 against New Zealand at the Carisbrook, Dunedin, a match the West Indies lost by one wicket. His highest score of 184 runs came the same year against England at the Lord's Cricket Ground, London. Five of his Test centuries came against Australia. Haynes scored Test centuries at twelve cricket grounds, against five different opponents, including eight at venues outside the West Indies. As of October 2023, he is seventh in the list of Test century-makers for the West Indies.\nHaynes scored a century on his ODI debut in February 1978 against Australia at the Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's. His score of 148 runs in the match earned him a man of the match award, resulting in the West Indies' win. His highest score in ODIs remained 152 runs, against India at the Bourda, Georgetown in March 1989. Due to his man-of-the-match performance, the West Indies won the match by 101 runs, and the series 5–0. He was most successful against Australia making six ODI centuries against them. Haynes' 17 ODI centuries was previously a record, until Sachin Tendulkar surpassed it in 1998. As of October 2023, Haynes is the third in the list of ODI century-makers for the West Indies."

        "title": "Royal Sydney Golf Club",
        "text": "Royal Sydney Golf Club is golf club in Rose Bay, New South Wales, Australia, a suburb of Sydney.\nFounded in 1893, Royal Sydney is one of Australia's premier sporting and social clubs. It features an 18-hole Championship Course, a 9-hole Centenary Course, two golf practice areas, a golf teaching studio, 18 tennis courts, two bowling greens, two croquet lawns, a squash court, a Fitness Centre as well as an elegant Clubhouse. \nIt has hosted the Australian Open on 15 occasions between 1906 and 2016.\nHistory.\nRoyal Sydney was one of the earliest golf clubs founded in Australia, initially as 'Sydney Golf Club' in 1893, in Concord, New South Wales. Four years later, in 1897, Queen Victoria granted the Club its ‘Royal’ prefix. Tennis, billiards and croquet have been played since 1905 and bowls was introduced in 1929. The current Clubhouse was built in 1922 and, in 2003, was extensively renovated. In 2011, a fitness centre and swimming pool was built.\nGolf Courses.\nChampionship Course.\nThe Championship Course has been accurately described as \"an ‘old-fashioned’, traditional, heavily bunkered, tough test of golf, especially in any wind. There are no gimmicks, no tricks, chasms or watery caverns\". Its undulating fairways and treacherous bunkers (of which there are more than 120) ensure that the Championship Course is a challenge, even for the most avid golfer.\nCentenary Course.\nRoyal Sydney also offers a 9-hole course called the Centenary Course. It was completely rebuilt to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Club in 1997. The course was designed to utilise every golf club in the bag for the competent golfer with dynamic terrain, featuring tight fairways and small contoured greens. Water comes into play on six of the nine holes, presenting a further challenge for golfers.\nAustralian Open Championships.\nRoyal Sydney has hosted the Australian Open on 15 occasions.\nRoyal Sydney has also hosted one Women's Australian Open, in 2007, won by Karrie Webb.\nOther Sports.\nSnooker.\nThe Royal Sydney Golf Club maintains three Championship quality, full-size tables, which are some of the last remaining among Sydney's private clubs. The Club holds annual singles, doubles and handicap tournaments for snooker, along with a monthly \"Lightning Snooker\" competition, which takes place on the first Thursday of each month. The snooker room enjoys a strong patronage, with a dedicated Women's evening on Wednesdays and is a popular location following a round of golf or as a book-end to a dining reservation.\nTennis.\nRoyal Sydney also possesses 18 tennis courts - 11 lawn courts and seven hard courts.\nThe Club has hosted many tournaments (most recently the 2011 Davis Cup tie between Australia and Switzerland) and produced a number of internationally successful players including Sir Norman Brookes and Gerald Patterson.\nAlthough the starting date of tennis at Royal Sydney is unknown, historical records first indicate the existence of courts in 1905. The popularity of tennis grew and in 1913 another nine courts were laid. By 1920 there were twenty-five courts in play.\nIn July 2003, Royal Sydney hosted a ladies Federation Cup tie.\nCroquet.\nThe Royal Sydney Golf Club features two croquet lawns which are available for the use of members and their guests all year round. Croquet is a popular sport for many Royal Sydney members with competitions and social days held on a regular basis throughout the year. In March 2009, Royal Sydney hosted the Australian Croquet Championships, and in March 2015 welcomed the Eire Cup (Australian Association Croquet Championships).\nBowls.\nBowls has been played at Royal Sydney since 1929. The Club currently has two bowling greens which are available for the use of members and their guests all year round. The greens are used both for competitive and social play.\nSquash.\nSquash courts were first constructed at Royal Sydney in 1912. The Club was host to the New South Wales and Australian Championships several times during the 1930s when the game was riding a wave of popularity. Although the popularity of squash waned slightly in the latter part of the 1980s and 1990s, the Club still has a squash court for use by members all year round."

        "text": "The Metropolitan Golf Club is one of the renowned sandbelt courses of Melbourne and is widely recognised as one of the finest championship courses in Australia. It is located in Oakleigh South, in the city's south-eastern suburbs, approximately twenty minutes' drive from the CBD.\nHistory.\nMetropolitan Golf Club shares its origins with Royal Melbourne Golf Club, which was founded in 1891 as Melbourne Golf Club, with the Royal title being granted in 1895. When the original course at Caulfield was turned over to housing, Royal Melbourne moved to a new course at Sandringham. Members who remained formed the Caulfield Golf Club, and in 1906 purchased a farm in Oakleigh with a two-storey house. In 1908 they moved to the new course, designed by club member J B MacKenzie, renaming their club as The Metropolitan Golf Club. In 1960, several holes were lost in order to build a school, with replacement holes designed by Dick Wilson being built on adjacent land.\nCourse.\nMetropolitan enjoys a reputation as one of the best conditioned year-round courses in Australia. Prior to the 1997 Australian Open, Greg Norman described Metropolitan's pure couch grass fairways as the best he had played on anywhere in the world. During the 2001 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, a number of the world's top-ranked players compared the condition of the course to Augusta National. The bentgrass greens are large, firm and fast and are hand-mown right to the edge of the greenside bunkers. In total, there are 103 bunkers on the course and almost every hole is flanked by huge stands of Australian native trees which provide sanctuary to many species of native birds, including the noisy but beautiful sulphur-crested cockatoo and the multi-coloured rainbow lorikeet.\nTournament history.\nThe Metropolitan hosted the Kirk-Windeyer Cup in 1929, the Australian Open in 1930, and the Melbourne Centenary Open in 1934. The Australian Open returned in 1934 when it was won by Gene Sarazen, and again in 1951, when Peter Thomson was victorious.\nIn 1968, Metropolitan hosted the Australian PGA Championship; the tournament was won by Kel Nagle, who defeated a strong field that included Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. In 1979, Jack Newton won the Australian Open at Metropolitan by one stroke from a young Greg Norman, who three-putted the final green. The Australian Open returned in 1986, with Rodger Davis celebrating a popular win, in 1993, when American Brad Faxon triumphed with a four-round score of 275 (13 under par), and in 1997, when English Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood defeated Norman on the fourth hole of a sudden-death playoff after Norman once again three-putted the final green.\nIn addition to the Australian Open (7 times) and the Australian PGA Championship (5 times), Metropolitan has hosted many other elite professional and amateur tournaments, including the Australian Amateur (5 times) and the Victorian Open, for which it was the regular venue in the early 1980s.\nMetropolitan celebrated its centenary year in 2001 and hosted the 2001 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in the first week of January. Sixty-four of the highest ranked golfers in the world competed in elimination format for US$5 million and the Walter Hagen Cup, on the course Hagen described in 1930 as \"by far the finest course I have played in Australia\". Pre-tournament favorite and world number 2 Ernie Els was knocked out in the semi-final by little known Swede Pierre Fulke, who couldn't repeat his effort in the 36-hole final the next day in losing to American Steve Stricker 2 &amp; 1.\nIn February 2009, Metropolitan hosted the Women's Australian Open, which marked 100 years of play on the course at Oakleigh. The event was won by England's Laura Davies\nMetropolitan hosted the World Cup in November 2018."

The course opened in 1990; however with no funds available for the daily operation of the course, it closed in dramatic circumstances after just one day. The course stayed untouched for five years and became unkempt and overgrown before a consortium of Australian business people acquired the course and established The Grand Golf Club. After 18 months of restoration, led by Norman, the course was re-opened in 1997 by Greg Norman.

The BBC produce over 900 hours of footage that is distributed to broadcasters in 159 different countries. BBC Wimbledon coverage is presented by former British number one and 1976 French Open Champion Sue Barker. Matches are broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Two, the Red Button, or Online via the BBC Sport website. Highlights are also shown on the long-running Today at Wimbledon, presented by Clare Balding, who replaced John Inverdale in 2015. The same year, the programme was renamed \"Wimbledon 2day\", with a new lighthearted magazine format, but after only one year, the format has been abandoned for 2016.\nESPN took full control of televising the US Open in 2015. When taking over, ESPN ended 47 years of coverage produced and aired by CBS. ESPN uses ESPN and ESPN2 for broadcasts, while putting outer court coverage on ESPN+. In the UK, Sky Sports had shown the event from 1991 until 2015 but decided not to renew its contract to broadcast this event and the rights later went to Amazon Prime. Sky decided to return to tennis in 2023 when it regained the rights to the event. This bid was successful and Sky will now show the tournament until 2027.\nHistorical breakdown.\n1930s-1940s.\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the Wimbledon tournament on television in the UK. The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2027. During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. The original commentator on TV at Wimbledon was Freddie Grisewood up until 1954. One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC's \"voice of tennis\". Maskell commentated on TV at Wimbledon from 1951 until his retirement in 1991. John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Boris Becker and Lindsay Davenport; and general sports commentators including Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins. The coverage is presented by Sue Barker (live) and Claire Balding (highlights).

Bud Palmer, Jack Kramer, Lindsey Nelson, Don Budge, Bill Stern and Bill Talbert were among the commentators during this period.\nITV showed live coverage of Wimbledon from 1956 to 1968, with Fred Perry as their lead commentator (Perry's great friend Dan Maskell was the lead commentator on the BBC's coverage throughout this period). ITV broadcast Wimbledon for fewer hours each day than BBC and had advertisements, which the BBC did not have.\n1960s.\nIn the United States, ABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles Final in 1963 on its \"Wide World of Sports\" series. ABC also covered the US Championships from 1965 to 1967, taking over from NBC.\nRegular telecasts of the later stages of the Australian championships in Australia began in the mid 1960s. Channel 2 broadcast the 1965, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1971 events. Channel 9 broadcast the 1969 event.\nCBS Sports broadcast the first US Open Tennis Championships in 1968. Bud Collins called the action alongside Jack Kramer.\nJames Wall (best known for playing Mr. Baxter on \"Captain Kangaroo\") was also the stage manager for 41 consecutive years on the US Open Tennis Championships telecasts.\nNBC began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final.\n1970s.\nFrom 1973 to 2018, the Seven Network served as the host broadcaster of the Australian Open. In March 2018, it was announced that the Nine Network had acquired the rights to the tournament beginning in 2020, for a period of five years. The network later bought the rights for the 2019 tournament as well. The Open's broadcast rights are lucrative in the country, as it occurs near the end of the Summer non-ratings season — which gives its broadcaster opportunities to promote their upcoming programming lineup.\nNBC's coverage of the French Open began in 1975. Other than a three-year stint for the tournament on CBS, NBC has remained the U.S. broadcast television home of the French Open since 1983. The network shows weekend morning early-round matches in the afternoon on tape-delay; however, if a match is still being played, it will televise the match live. NBC's current deal for the tournament does not allow ESPN2 or Tennis Channel to show NBC's tape-delayed matches. NBC also tape-delays the men's semifinal, broadcasting it in the late morning on the same day, however it broadcasts both finals live.\nAlso in 1975, HBO began airing coverage (same day, weekday coverage only) of Wimbledon and did so until 1999.\nMeanwhile, in 1975, the WTA increased its financial stature by signing a television broadcast contract with CBS, the first in the WTA's history. Further financial developments ensued.\nIn 1978, Hughes televised eight tournaments, all slotted for 6 to 8 p.m. on Saturdays and 5 to 7 p.m. on Sundays (all Eastern time). The telecasts were sold to commercial stations on an individual market basis by Taft Broadcasting. The announcers for these broadcasts were Bud Collins and Donald Dell.\nBBC Television broadcast the 1977 and 1978 US Open finals (it did not broadcast the event again until 1981).\nThe BBC broadcasts two traditional Grass warm up events in the fortnight before the Wimbledon Championships. First is the AEGON Championships from Queen's Club, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The BBC has covered the tournament since 1979 and has a contract in place until 2024. Coverage is led by Sue Barker with commentary by Andrew Castle, Andrew Cotter, John Lloyd &amp; Peter Fleming. The following week is the WTA AEGON International event from Eastbourne. In 2015, coverage was introduced by John Inverdale and Lee McKenzie with commentary from Andrew Cotter, Sam Smith, Chris Bradnam &amp; Annabel Croft. Both events are primarily shown on BBC Two.\nAmericans had made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" specials during the tournament on weekends, in which live coverage (which under the guidance of then-NBC Sports executive producer Don Ohlmeyer and associate producer Bob Basche, began in 1979 for the men's rounds and in 1982 for the women) started early in the morning (as the Eastern Time Zone in the United States is five hours behind the United Kingdom) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and patterned trousers are well known to tennis fans in the United States. Collins was fired by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, which holds the Wimbledon cable rights. For many years, NBC's primary host was Dick Enberg, who called his 28th and final Wimbledon in 2011.\n1980s.\nThe BBC began televising the French Open finals in 1981 (they continued to broadcast the event until 2011) and the finals of the US Open from 1977 until 1987. Channel Four broadcast the US Open finals in 1988. The event returned to UK screens in 1991 when coverage moved to Sky Sports, who broadcast the event for the next 25 years. the BBC televised the later stages of the 1989 Australian Open (they next covered the event in 1995).\nFrom 1980 to 1982, CBS televised the French Open (sandwiched in-between stints at NBC).\nIn 1982, CBS debuted \"Super Saturday\". The Men's Semifinals sandwiched the Women's Final, with the first semifinal match starting at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nFor the past few decades, the National Football League had always let CBS be the \"singleheader\" network during the week it televised the Men's US Open Tennis final at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time around the country (CBS has said that it could not justify putting the Men's US Open Final on Sunday night in terms of ratings; the women's final, broadcast on a Saturday night, often outrated the men's final by a considerable margin, except when at least one American plays in the men's final).\nAll the courts used by the U.S. Open are lighted, meaning that television coverage of the tournament can extend into prime time to attract higher ratings. This has recently been used to the advantage of the USA Network cable channel and especially for CBS, which used its influence to move the women's singles final to Saturday night to draw higher viewership.\nIn 1983, Beth Herr lost an epic match to Billie Jean King at Wimbledon 8–6 in the 3rd. Commentators on HBO Breakfast at Wimbledon made a very big deal out of her ability to hit numerous swinging volleys out of the air for winners. This was something that had not been done before especially by a female.\nBeginning in 1984, the USA Network served as the longtime American cable home of the US Open, which moved to ESPN2 and the Tennis Channel as of 2009. Universal HD provided the high definition simulcast of USA Network's coverage of the US Open tennis tournament in 2006 and 2007.\nOn September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set in anger just before a remote broadcast of the \"CBS Evening News\" when it appeared that CBS's coverage of a U.S. Open semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to run into time allotted for the network news program. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II, who began a rare U.S. tour. The tennis match ended at 6:32 p.m. Eastern Time, however Rather was nowhere to be found. Over 100 affiliates broadcast the six minutes of dead air that followed before he returned to the broadcast position. Rather later suggested that he intended to force the sports division to fill up the entire half-hour so that he would not have to truncate the elaborately-planned coverage of the papal visit. The next day, Rather, anchoring from New Orleans, apologized for leaving the anchor desk.\nEurosport began broadcasting the French Open in 1989. The Roland Garros event has continued to be broadcast on Eurosport until the present day.\n1990s.\nAs the 1980s ended and the 1990s began, for the first time the three Grand Slam tournaments held outside of the UK were televised in the UK with daily coverage from day one onwards thanks to satellite broadcasting. Sky Sports began their long association with US Open broadcasting in 1991 (Sky merged with BSB in November 1990. BSB had broadcast 1990 US Open on their sports channel). Sky also broadcast the Australian Open from 1991 to 1994. Eurosport broadcast the Australian Open in 1990 and from 1995 onwards. The BBC covered Australian Open finals live from 1995 to 2015, but from 2016 have shown highlights only. The BBC covered the final two days of the 1992 US Open.\nBy 1991, the men had their first television package to broadcast 19 tournaments. Coming online with their first website in 1995, this was followed by a multi-year agreement with Mercedes-Benz. Lawsuits in 2008, around virtually the same issues, resulted in a restructured tour.\nFrom 1994–2001 (before ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic took over), USA was the American cable home of the French Open.\nWhile attending the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York City in September 1995, Jane Bronstein, who is rather large and disfigured from childhood polio and a thyroid condition, was pictured in CBS file footage from the tournament. Although the footage was never intended to be shown to the public, a few seconds of it was shown during a segment on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". The footage showed Bronstein devouring a peach in a matter of seconds and then handing the peach pit to a man seated beside her with a horrified look on his face. Although the audience and Letterman's fans found the clip hilarious, Bronstein and her attorney Harvey Rothberg were not amused and sued for damages in February 1996. The case was settled in March 1997 for undisclosed terms.\nNBC Sports first switched to digital on-screen graphics in 1995, although in a very limited, text-based form. A modernized graphics package for the telecasts rolled out in 1999, based around translucent black rectangles, with beveled gold bars at the top and bottom, with blue accents for most sports (green for golf, purple for Wimbledon, and orange for the tennis French Open).\n2000s.\nFrom 2000-2002, TNT alongside CNN Sports Illustrated (and CNNfn in 2002 due to the former shutting down operations earlier in the year) broadcast same day, weekday coverage (approximately 89 hours of programming with TNT covering about 61 hours in prime time) of Wimbledon, replacing sister network HBO.\nIn 2001, the Tennis Channel was founded by Steve Bellamy, who soon hired Bruce Rider to head up programming and marketing. A group known as the \"Viacom Mafia\"—a group that includes Viacom's former CEOs, Philippe Dauman and Frank Biondi, and current CEO, Thomas E. Dooley—became involved in the founding of the channel. This group invested and rounded up additional investors, Bain Capital Ventures, J.P. Morgan Partners, Battery Ventures, Columbia Capital, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who as a group invested about $100 million. These founders felt with other single sports channel like the Golf Channel succeeding with a mostly male demographic and tennis having viewer of both sexes and of a desirable high-end demographic that a tennis channel would draw in advertisers. The channel was launched in early-2003, with its first live event being a Fed Cup tie in Lowell, Massachusetts in April.Barry MacKay was one of the original Commentators.\nIn 2004 and 2006, Bravo carried overnight and morning coverage of the Olympic Games from NBC Sports. In 2008, the channel did not carry any coverage, as NBCUniversal had acquired Oxygen, allowing Bravo to continue to carry its regular entertainment programming schedule during NBC's coverage of the Games. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, NBC Sports announced that Bravo would serve as the home of Olympic tennis events, providing 56 hours of coverage.\nCBS was the first network to use the MacCam (a system of slow-motion cameras developed by FastCAM Replay LLC and DEL Imaging Systems LLC used during tennis matches to replay close or controversial line calls) widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts. The MacCam was first used at the 2004 US Open to demonstrate several poor calls by chair umpires. In Serena Williams' controversial quarterfinal loss to Jennifer Capriati, several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous.\nScoring bugs were still not a permanent feature on NBC, as they disappeared during plays until 2005, when the network introduced horizontal scorebars for its coverage of college football and hockey, which did not match the other graphics. The graphics, which still did not have any animation, were modified in 2002 to feature rounded edges, and the translucent color was changed from black to the color of the accents, which also replaced gold as the border color.\nIn 2005, Tennis Channel acquired the ATP Tour's Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic in Scottsdale (which it had held the television rights to) from IMG, and moved it to Las Vegas as the Tennis Channel Open in 2006. Tennis Channel moved the open to Las Vegas for 2006, and announced plans to hold women's and junior events alongside it.\nAlso in 2005, after struggling viewership (having only reached a subscriber base of 5 million by 2006), credited to a lack of coverage of high-profile tournaments (such as the Grand Slam, the channel's management was replaced by a new team led by Ken Solomon. As the channel had not broadcast any of the four Grand Slam tournaments by then. The subscriber base was only 5 million in 2006. On February 1, 2006, Tennis Channel became a charter member of the new Association of Independent Programming Networks. Tennis Channel's senior vice president of distribution Randy Brown was a co-founder of the group, alongside The American Channel's Doron Gorshein.\nOutbidding ESPN by double, Tennis Channel acquired cable rights to the French Open in 2006. The network sub-licensed approximately half of the package to ESPN, at a lower cost than ESPN would have paid for the entire tournament. In 2008, Tennis Channel sold the Tennis Channel Open event back to the ATP, citing growth of its core businesses tied to its rapid acquisitions of Grand Slam tournament rights; beginning 2009, Tennis Channel also split cable rights to the US Open with ESPN.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal Wimbledon coverage until after the conclusion of \"Today\" at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the Eastern Time Zone and using tape-delay in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in 2009, ESPN2's coverage of the Tommy Haas-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous Ivo Karlović-Roger Federer quarterfinal in full.\nOccasionally, \"The Late Late Show\" was split into 15- and 45-minute segments in order to allow CBS to air a daily late-night highlight show for the US Open tennis tournament (as well as the Masters and other PGA Tour events whose broadcast rights are held by CBS). The tournament highlights were broadcast in-between the monologue and the guest segments. However, in mid-2007, the highlights show began airing first, with the full hour of \"The Late Late Show\" airing on a delay.\nOn September 14, 2009, Juan Martín del Potro upset Roger Federer to win the Men's U.S. Open Championship. Dick Enberg hosted the post-match ceremony during which a victorious Del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request saying that he was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate-sponsored prizes that Del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, Del Potro made the same request again and only then Enberg relented saying \"Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina\". An emotional Del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.\nThe BBC has exclusive free to air TV rights for 8 singles matches from the ATP World Tour Finals which includes the semi-final and the final. The BBC covered the event originally between 2009 and 2011, followed by an extension for 2012 and 2013. This was extended again in 2013 through to 2015. It was extended again in 2016 for another 2 years before another deal was announced in 2017 and will run until 2020. with Sky Sports, showing one afternoon match per day including one semi-final and the final which are usually shown on BBC Two.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, CBS broadcast the U.S. Open in 3D on DirecTV N3D.\nIn 2011, ITV Sport won the rights from the BBC to show the French Open and showed the event for the first time in 2012. The bulk of the daily coverage was broadcast on ITV4 although both singles finals plus other weekend matches are shown on ITV. However, controversy reigned in 2014 when the main ITV channel stopped coverage of the men's final with four points left and sent the match to ITV4 thus denying viewers recording the match the chance to watch later and those with Freeview in some rural areas (where ITV4 may not be available on Freeview) the chance to see Rafael Nadal win an historic title. This did not deter ITV from immediately renewing its deal to show the tournament and ITV Sport continued to show the French Open until 2021, after which Eurosport will have exclusive coverage of the event in the UK.\nThe 2011 Wimbledon tournament marked the 43rd and final year of NBC's coverage. NBC issued a statement saying it had been outbid for the rights to future broadcasts, and beginning with the 2012 tournament, all live coverage moved exclusively to ESPN. Wimbledon became the second tennis Grand Slam event (after the Australian Open) to air live coverage in the United States exclusively on pay television, although replays of the tournament finals, and since 2022, live Middle Weekend matches have aired on broadcast network ABC.\nOn September 4, 2011, during the US Open, Tennis Channel pulled its signal from Verizon FiOS, Cablevision, Suddenlink Communications, Mediacom, WOW!, Knology and General Communication Inc. systems after the providers declined to accept a new agreement that the Tennis Channel made with the National Cable Television Cooperative (a group which the seven providers are members). Along with a fee increase, the agreement also required that the Tennis Channel be moved from their optional sports package to their digital basic tiers. Tennis Channel returned to Verizon FiOS on January 17, 2012.\nIn July 2012, the Federal Communications Commission ruled in favor of Tennis Channel following a three-year dispute between the network and Comcast over placement on extra-fee sports tier. As a result of the ruling, Comcast was prompted to remove Tennis Channel from its sports package tier, available to customers via an extra charge, and carry the network on the same basic cable tier as Comcast-owned Golf Channel and NBCSN. The FCC found Comcast's previous handling of the network to be discriminatory. This marked the first time that a cable distributor was found to have violated federal anti-discrimination rules. Comcast successfully disputed the ruling in 2013, continuing to carry Tennis Channel on its sports package. The company appealed to the Supreme Court, but was denied a hearing.\nIn August 2012, CBS Sports Network began to offer additional coverage of the US Open, including replays of classic matches, coverage of qualifying matches, a pre-match show, and coverage of third- and fourth-round matches not shown by CBS.\nOn August 5, 2012, NBC announced it had extended its broadcast agreement through 2024. Under the terms of this new deal, NBC would broadcast an additional ten hours of live coverage, including matches on Memorial Day and the women's semifinals. With the United States Tennis Association (USTA) agreeing to an eleven-year deal with ESPN for exclusive broadcast rights to the US Open, the French Open will be the only tennis tournament on American network television.\nIn January 2013, BT Sport signed a deal with the WTA to show 21 live tournaments from the women's tennis tour. The coverage can consist of up to 800 live hours of coverage every year until 2016, each season ending with the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships.\nIn April 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network was speculated as expressing interest in purchasing the channel to complement beIN Sports, though nothing came of this. The channel opened an online store selling professional and lifestyle golfing merchandise and gear on August 14, 2013. The store is operated by Delivery Agent under the Shop TV brand.\nOn May 17, 2013, ESPN signed a contract (an 11-year deal at $770 million; about $250 million more than CBS was willing to pay) with the United States Tennis Association that would give it the rights to broadcast the U.S. Open starting in 2015, ending CBS's role in covering the tournament after 47 years. At the end of their 2014 coverage, CBS for their closing credits montage, highlighting the greatest moments during their 47-year run with the US Open, used Alicia Keys's \"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\". Without the US Open, CBS's SEC college football coverage was now allowed to start on Labor Day weekend and their National Football League coverage to have a doubleheader in Week 1 of regular season.\nESPN uses ESPN and ESPN2 for US Open broadcasts, while putting outer court coverage on ESPN+.\nIn 2013, Tennis Channel launched its TV Everywhere service Tennis Channel Everywhere. On May 25, 2014, the network also launched Tennis Channel Plus, a new direct-to-consumer subscription service including coverage of additional events not seen on television, also including digital rights to the French Open outside of the finals. Tennis Channel carriers receive a cut of profits from the service.\nFor nearly 25 years, Sky Sports was the main broadcaster of the US Open until 2015 but decided not to renew its contract to broadcast this event in 2016. Sky also previously covered Davis Cup tennis but these rights moved to the BBC and Eurosport. Sky was the broadcaster of ATP Tour events from 2002 until 2018, when Amazon Prime Video became the exclusive UK broadcaster. Amazon Prime also cover the US Open.\nIn 2015, Tennis Channel acquired rights to the Citi Open, an ATP World Tour 500 and WTA International tournament in Washington, D.C., under a four-year contract. The event was formerly part of the US Open Series, but withdrew due to frustration over ESPN (rightsholder of the series due to its new contract to be exclusive broadcaster of the US Open proper) only promising a limited amount of television coverage.\nIn Europe, the Australian Open tournament is broadcast on Eurosport. Other broadcasters in the region have included the BBC in the United Kingdom, SRG in Switzerland, NOS in Netherlands and RTS in Serbia. In the United Kingdom, the BBC dropped its live coverage of the 2016 tournament just a month before the start due to budget cuts, leaving Eurosport as the exclusive live broadcaster.\nElsewhere, beIN Sports broadcasts it into the Middle East and Northern Africa, and SuperSport in Sub-Sahara Africa. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast on ESPN2, ESPN3 and the Tennis Channel. The championship matches are televised live on ESPN. While it is broadcast on ESPN International in Central and Latin America. It is broadcast on TSN in Canada.\nIn Asia-Pacific region, the tournament is broadcast on five television networks in China, including national broadcaster CCTV, provincial networks Beijing TV, Shanghai TV and Guangdong TV and English language Star Sports, as well as online on IQIYI Sports. Elsewhere in the region, it is broadcast in Japan by national broadcaster NHK, and pay-TV network WOWOW. In the Indian Sub-continent, Sony Six has broadcast since 2015 and, in the rest of Asia, it is broadcast on Fox Sports Asia through 2021.\nFrance Télévisions and Eurosport held the broadcast rights to the French Open in 2016.\nThe BBC has a joint deal with Eurosport to show all of Britain's Davis Cup matches for three years to 2017, with coverage predominately broadcast on BBC Two and the Red Button.\nAs of January 2017, BT Sport have the rights to show 52 WTA tournaments every year until 2019. Coverage is introduced by Annabel Croft with Martina Navratilova and commentary comes from Chris Bradnam, David Law, Sam Smith, Jo Durie and Anne Keothavong.\nIn France, beIN Sports airs the Wimbledon Championships, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP World Tour 500, ATP World Tour Finals, and some ATP World Tour 250 and WTA Tour tournaments.\nbeIN Sports will be the exclusive broadcaster of WTA Tour in the United States, Spain, Australia, the Middle East, and North Africa from 2017 to 2021.\nFollowing on the trial which commenced with 2018 World Cup the BBC broadcast all Centre Court matches from the 2018 Wimbledon Championships in 4K UHD via iPlayer.\nCommentators include John McEnroe, Boris Becker, John Lloyd, Andy Roddick, Martina Navratilova, Nick Mullins, Jonathan Overend, Anne Keothavong, Virginia Wade, Sam Smith, Tracy Austin, Tim Henman, Andrew Castle, Lindsay Davenport, Pat Cash, John Inverdale, Chris Bradnam, Jamie Baker, Dan Lobb, Guy McCrea, Mark Petchey, Simon Reed, Matt Chilton, Peter Fleming, Elizabeth Smylie, Jo Durie, Louise Pleming, Andrew Cotter, Ronald McIntosh and Alison Mitchell. Regular tournament weather updates are provided by Carol Kirkwood.\nBeginning with the 2018 tournament, an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing BBC Sport.\nIn October 2018, it was announced that Tennis Channel had acquired rights to the 46 overseas events of the WTA Tour under a five-year deal beginning in 2019, replacing beIN Sports. beIN had acquired the WTA Tour rights as part of a larger deal covering 30 countries, but the deal faced criticism from U.S. viewers due to the network's narrow carriage (only serving half as many households as Tennis Channel, with several top providers having also dropped the channel that August), as well as scheduling conflicts that favored international soccer matches—giving WTA events inconsistent and intermittent coverage.\nIn 2019, Tennis Channel reached a five-year extension of its rights to the Citi Open. The tournament also re-joined the US Open Series under new ownership.\n2020s.\nIn 2021, Channel 4 made a last-minute deal with rights-holder Amazon Prime to show live coverage of the final of the 2021 US Open – Women's Singles after Britain’s Emma Raducanu reaches the final. This is the first time since the late 1980s that tennis has been shown on Channel 4.\nIn September 2021, Eurosport became the exclusive broadcast of the Laver Cup, and will show the event until 2030.\nIn 2023 Sky Sports decided to return to tennis when it took over as rights holder to the US Open - Amazon Prime had shown the tournament for the previous few years.\nLater in 2023, Sky announced that it would be resuming its coverage of the ATP Tour events - it had previously been the rights holder between 2002 and 2018, when Amazon Prime Video became the exclusive UK broadcaster. Sky's deal will see them provide coverage of both the men's and women's events of more than 80 events each year until 2028. The events covered will include the Nitto ATP Finals and WTA Finals, all ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 events, 500s and 250 events (excluding domestic events) and the Next Gen ATP Finals. Gigi Salmon will present the coverage with Tim Henman and Laura Robson being the main pundits. The level of coverage of tennis that Sky now shows has resulted in the launch of a full time channel for the sport - Sky Sports Tennis - which went on air in February 2024."

The Huskies were led by second-year head coach Kevin Ollie. The Huskies split their home games between the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on the UConn campus in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies were members of the American Athletic Conference. One year after being banned from postseason play for sanctions, the Huskies returned to the Final Four, where they defeated the Florida Gators in the national semifinal round and the Kentucky Wildcats in the 2014 National Championship Game. Shabazz Napier was named the tournament's MOP. The next day, the UConn Huskies women's team won the women's NCAA basketball tournament, only the second time that a school has won both the men's and women's Division I national basketball championships in the same year; UConn first accomplished this in 2004.\nPrevious season.\nThe Huskies finished the 2012–13 season with a record of 20-10 overall, including 10–8 in Big East play. However, due to sanctions resulting in penalties stemming from years of very poor APR ratings, the Huskies were ineligible for all the postseason tournaments, including the 2013 Big East men's basketball tournament, the NCAA tournament and the NIT.\nPreseason outlook.\nThe Huskies were selected to finish 2nd in their new conference, the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Coach Kevin Ollie would serve his second season with key players Shabazz Napier, Ryan Boatright, DeAndre Daniels, and Omar Calhoun returned.

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Courtney Walsh",
        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of 2014 only 42 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Courtney Walsh, a former cricketer, who represented the West Indies cricket team from 1984 to 2001, took 23 five-wicket hauls in international cricket. He played 132 Tests and 205 One Day Internationals (ODIs), and took 519 and 227 wickets respectively. A right-arm fast bowler, Walsh took 22 five-wicket hauls in Tests and 1 in ODIs. In 1987, when he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year, the cricket almanack \"Wisden\" noted his \"three distinct speeds, all delivered with the same action\", and his \"sparing use of the bouncer, his shorter deliveries generally threatening the batsman's rib-cage, a tactic which, allied to change of pace, produced many catches in the short-leg area off splice or glove.\" He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in October 2010.\nWalsh made his Test debut in November 1984 against Australia at the WACA Ground, Perth, a match West Indies won by an innings and 112 runs. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 1987 against New Zealand at the Eden Park, Auckland; the match was won by West Indies by 10 wickets. His career-best bowling figures for an innings were 7 wickets for 37 runs against the same team at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, in February 1995. He took another 6 wickets in the next innings, accumulating 13 wickets for 55 runs in the match—his solitary pair of five-wicket hauls. West Indies won the match by an innings and 322 runs, and his performance earned him a man of the match award. Walsh took more five-wicket hauls against England than any other nation: five. He took ten or more wickets in a match on three occasions.\nWalsh made his ODI debut during the 1984–85 World Series Cup against Sri Lanka at the Tasmania Cricket Association Ground, Hobart. His solitary ODI five-wicket haul came against the same team in December 1986, a match which West Indies won at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, Sharjah by 193 runs. He took five wickets conceding one run in the match. ESPNcricinfo declared that it was the \"cheapest\" five-wicket haul in the history of international cricket. As of 2014, he is sixteenth among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

It was essentially a third new team for Haith, who has less than 40 percent of his scoring, rebounding, assists and steals back from the previous season. However the addition of a Top 20 recruiting class, the returning experience of players like seniors Earnest Ross and Tony Criswell and the gained services of heralded transfer Jordan Clarkson had excitement buzzing around Mizzou Arena as the Tigers began their second tour as members of a much improved Southeastern Conference.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| Exhibition \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D;\"| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D;\"| NIT\nSource:"

Voronov was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, selected in the eighth round (206th overall).\nCareer.\nVoronov started his career with HC Dynamo Moscow, playing three years with the club before being drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. Voronov attended Pittsburgh Penguins training camp and was initially assigned to the Penguins' IHL affiliate in Cleveland, but after two games with the Lumberjacks he was reassigned to the Penguins' ECHL affiliate in Hampton Roads. After a solid rookie season where Voronov led all Admirals' defensemen with a +24, Voronov quickly fell out of favor with the Admirals, with assistant coach Al MacIssac calling Voronov \"the squad's weakest link\" and that \"he may have cost us the game.\" Voronov was scratched for game 2 of the Renegades/Admirals series and only returned to the lineup for one additional game during the series.\nDespite a poor playoff series against the Renegades during his rookie season, Voronov was reassigned to the Penguins to the Las Vegas Thunder of the International Hockey League to replace Kevin Dahl, who had been recently recalled by the Phoenix Coyotes and were the primary affiliate of the Thunder. General Manager Bob Strumm said he liked the addition of Voronov, saying that he added a \"hacking and whacking element that had been missing since the trade of Jeff Ricciardi.\" While assigned to the Thunder, Voronov was reunited with former Dynamo teammate Alexei Yashin, who were on the same team during the 1992-93 season. Voronov remained with the Thunder for the remainder of the season, scoring six points in 40 games but did not play any games in the postseason. After two seasons in the North American minor leagues, Voronov returned to Russia.\nVoronov spent the next 10 out of his 11 seasons in Russia, including four seasons in the Russian Superleague, where he won a championship with the Metallurg Magnitogorsk during the 2000-01 season. He joined Titan Klin of the VHL in 2004 and remained with the team until his retirement in 2008.\nSince his retirement, Voronov became an assistant coach with HC MVD and later became head coach of Buran Voronezh."

        "text": "The 2014 Little League World Series, held in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, started on August 14 and ended on August 24, 2014. Eight teams from the United States, and eight from the rest of the world, competed in the 68th edition of the tournament. This was the first LLWS to feature entire rosters of players born in the 21st century.\nAll games took place at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium. ESPN again broadcast the games. Seoul Little League of Seoul, South Korea, defeated Jackie Robinson West Little League of Chicago, Illinois, 8–4, to win the championship.\nOn February 11, 2015, Jackie Robinson West had all of its tournament wins forfeited after it was found that the team used ineligible players from outside the Chicago area. Mountain Ridge Little League of Las Vegas, Nevada, was named the official U.S. champion.\nResults.\nThe draw to determine the opening round pairings took place on June 11, 2014.\nAfter the tournament, Jackie Robinson West Little League had all of their wins, including the U.S. Championship, forfeited. Any of their wins are officially considered a 6–0 loss. The scores of their games, \"as played during the tournament\", were as follows:\nCrossover games.\nTeams that lost their first two games played a crossover game against a team from the other side of the bracket that also lost its first two games. These games were labeled Game A and Game B. This provided teams who were already eliminated the opportunity to play a third game.\nConsolation game.\nThe consolation game is played between the loser of the United States championship and the loser of the International championship.\nJackie Robinson West.\nTeam Jackie Robinson West was the first all black team to compete in the tournament in several decades. Hailing from the Washington Heights area of Chicago, the team made it all the way to the World Championship before ultimately falling to a team from South Korea.\nAs the team rose to prominence, Evergreen Park, Illinois, Little League official Chris Janes began to investigate personal information pertaining to players of the Jackie Robinson West team, finding that multiple players on the team lived outside the team's designated boundary region. He later discovered that the team had used a falsified boundary map which covered a wider area than other teams in the region had agreed to. On February 11, 2015, based on Chris Janes' findings, the team's wins and U.S. titles were forfeited for its use of ineligible players. The U.S. title was retroactively awarded to Mountain Ridge Little League of Las Vegas. The Great Lakes title was also stripped from Jackie Robinson West, and given to the team they beat in the championship, New Albany, Indiana."

        "title": "World Baseball Softball Confederation",
        "text": "The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) is the world governing body for the sports of baseball, softball, and Baseball5. It was established in 2013 by the merger of the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and International Softball Federation (ISF). Under the WBSC's organizational structure, the IBAF and ISF now serve as the confederation's baseball and softball divisions, respectively. Each division is governed by an executive committee, while the WBSC is governed by an executive board.\nThe WBSC has 208 National Federation members in 141 countries and territories across Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. Professional baseball organizations as well as youth organizations are also included and form an arm of the WBSC as associate members. Headquartered in Pully, Switzerland, the WBSC was granted recognition as the sole competent global authority for both the sports of baseball and softball by the International Olympic Committee in 2013.\nAs the recognised governing body of baseball, softball, and Baseball5, the WBSC is charged with overseeing all international competitions. It holds the exclusive rights of all competitions, tournaments and world championships featuring national teams, including the Olympic Games, and WBSC-associated federations hold the right to organize and select national teams\nDiscussions to merge the two separate world governing bodies for the sports of baseball and softball were sparked by a Memorandum of Understanding that saw baseball and softball leaders agree to form a joint bid to be added to the 2020 Olympic Games sports program. Baseball and softball were dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic program and were scheduled to be reinstated for the 2020 Olympics, but the 2020 Olympics were delayed due to the COVID-19 international pandemic. In August 2021, the International Olympic Committee announced that baseball and softball would not be part of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Baseball5 is still set to feature in the 2026 Youth Olympics.\nHistory.\nFollowing its exclusion of baseball and softball from the Summer Olympics in 2005, the IOC reclassified baseball and softball as two disciplines of the same sport. As the IOC's guidance indicated the necessity for baseball and softball to be jointly considered for reinstatement in the Olympic programme, the two independent International Federations set out on a path toward a full and complete merger.\nIn 2012, the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and the International Softball Federation (ISF) laid out the essential ground rules for partnership and began working on a constitution that would guide the merger and provide a framework for governance, ethics and operations. At a historic IBAF Congress in Tokyo in April 2013, the Constitution was ratified and since it had already been approved by an ISF working group empowered to do so, the WBSC was officially formalized and empowered.\nThe creation of a single federation allowed for the permanent alignment, merger and management of baseball and softball at the world level. The merger resulted in an immediate boost to the governance, universality and gender equality of baseball and softball, criteria for an Olympic sport that are heavily valued by the IOC.\nAt the first-ever World Baseball Softball Congress—in Hammamet, Tunisia—Italy's Fraccari was elected to a seven-year term as the first president of WBSC, along with a fully elected Executive Board.\nCreation of Baseball5.\nIn 2017, the WBSC introduced a third discipline to be played at an international level, Baseball5 (B5), which is a five-on-five, five-inning game designed to be played with only a rubber ball on a small field. It is targeted at underserved communities, as well as offering a low-cost and fast-paced entry point to baseball and softball in new places around the world. The WBSC introduced it to aid its ultimate goal of having a billion-strong baseball-softball community by 2030. A major difference between B5 and baseball/softball is that the game is played without a pitcher, with the batter starting each play with the ball. It was inspired by various Latin American street games, such as \"cuatro esquinas\" (\"four corners\") in Cuba, and has been played in some international tournaments in the Americas and Europe, as well as having been implemented in some schools in various countries. It is due to feature in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games, and has two World Cups for youth and senior players alternating each year starting in 2022, with both of these international events being played in a mixed-gender format. The WBSC is also planning to, as part of its general push into E-Sports, introduce a video game version of Baseball5 in the near future.\nCoed slow pitch softball.\nThe first official WBSC Coed Slow Pitch World Cup would be greenlit on 9 June during a meeting by the WBSC Executive Board in Pully, Switzerland. It was to be held in Guadalajara, Mexico in December 2023, but it was cancelled in October 2023 due to logistical challenges.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe WBSC is governed by the executive board, which consists of fourteen members: president, secretary general, two vice presidents, baseball executive vice president, softball executive vice president, treasurer, four members at large, athlete representative for baseball, athlete representative for softball, and global ambassador.\nThe Baseball Division is governed by an executive committee, which has thirteen members: president, secretary general, 2nd vice president, 3rd vice president, treasurer, three members at large, four continental vice presidents (one each for Africa, Americas, Europe, and Oceania), and executive director.\nThe Softball Division is governed by an executive committee that has twenty-three members: president, secretary general, 1st vice president, 2nd vice president, treasurer, twelve vice presidents (two each for Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Oceania, and one each for North America and English-speaking Caribbean), two at-large members, two athlete representatives, immediate past president, and executive director.\nThe WBSC has four departments: media, finance, tournaments, and marketing. It also has several commissions.\nMembers.\nBesides its worldwide institutions, there are five regional governing bodies that oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world.\nIn total, WBSC recognizes 198 national associations, with 132 national baseball teams as well as 122 women's national teams.\nUnlike the ICC, the WBSC identifies associate members as those who particularly endorse international baseball and softball with their own leagues in partnership with the WBSC. These leagues support baseball and softball to the extent that they are major sports in their respective countries. The table to the right has all leagues along with the country hosted:"

        "title": "2006 Wales rugby union tour of Argentina",
        "text": "In June 2006, the Wales national rugby union team travelled to Argentina for a two-test series against the Argentina national team. The first test was played on 11 June in Puerto Madryn, a city in the heart of the former Welsh colony in Patagonia, founded by Welsh settlers in 1865. The second test was played in Buenos Aires a week later. They were Wales' first matches under the management of new head coach Gareth Jenkins, who had been appointed to replace Mike Ruddock in April 2006. The test series was thrown into doubt earlier in the year after 60 Argentine players threatened to retire from international duty due to a dispute with the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR), but this was resolved at the end of May 2006. Argentina won both tests, claiming a 27–25 victory in Puerto Madryn before a more convincing 45–27 win in Buenos Aires.\nBackground.\nThis was Wales' fourth tour to Argentina, and the third for which they awarded caps. The first tour took place in 1968, when Argentina won the first match and drew the second. Wales won both matches in the first capped series in 1999, while the two sides won a test each in 2004.\nSquad.\nThe first test was coach Gareth Jenkins' first in charge of Wales, having been appointed to the role six weeks earlier following the resignation of 2005 Grand Slam-winning coach Mike Ruddock. Jenkins named a 28-man squad for the tour on 10 May 2006. Several senior players were left out due to injury or to allow them a period of rest after the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand the previous summer and ahead of the 2007 Rugby World Cup the following year. Ospreys prop Duncan Jones was named as captain for the tour. Five uncapped players – Ian Evans, Richard Hibbard, James Hook, Alun Wyn Jones and Rhys M. Thomas – were included in the squad.\nOspreys centre Gavin Henson was the first to withdraw from the original squad due to fitness concerns. Although Jenkins initially said that a specialist inside centre would be called up to replace Henson, Nathan Brew of the Dragons was called up two weeks later to fill the vacant berth. Prop Gethin Jenkins and back row Dafydd Jones both withdrew with shoulder injuries before the end of May, replaced by Blues prop John Yapp and Dragons flanker Jamie Ringer respectively. Centre Hal Luscombe was the final withdrawal, having suffered a rib injury in the Dragons' Heineken Cup play-off against Overmach Parma, and replaced by Blues utility back Nick Macleod.\nResults.\nFirst test.\nThe first test was played in Puerto Madryn, a city founded by Welsh settlers in Patagonia in 1865. Despite the large Welsh-speaking population in the area, this was the Wales national team's first visit there. The game was originally scheduled for 10 June 2006, but was put back to 11 June to avoid a clash with Argentina's opening match at the 2006 FIFA World Cup against the Ivory Coast.\nIan Evans and Alun Wyn Jones started the match to earn their first caps for Wales, while Richard Hibbard and James Hook were named on the bench. Evans scored a 45-metre interception try to put Wales in front after Juan Manuel Leguizamón had controversially cancelled out Mark Jones' third-minute opening score; after Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe charged down a clearing kick from Mike Phillips, referee Alain Rolland deemed Leguizamón to have grounded the ball before it reached the dead ball line, although video replays gave evidence to the contrary. José María Núñez Piossek's try and a pair of penalties from Federico Todeschini meant the home side took a 20–12 lead into half-time, helped by the sin-binnings of Wales back-row forwards Gavin Thomas for dissent and Alix Popham for collapsing an Argentina maul. Two penalties from Nicky Robinson reduced the margin to two points, but Francisco Leonelli put Argentina 27–18 up with three minutes of the game to go. Hook scored a try in injury time, converted by Robinson, but it proved mere consolation.\nSecond test.\nThe second test was played in Buenos Aires six days later. Argentina fly-half Federico Todeschini opened the scoring with a penalty after Ian Evans was sin-binned for killing the ball. Inside centre Felipe Contepomi returned to the starting line-up after completing his medical exams in Ireland – one of three changes to the home side's starting line-up – and was involved in the first try, charging down a clearance kick from James Hook to present midfield partner Gonzalo Tiesi with a simple try. Todeschini converted the try and kicked two more penalties in the first half, while two from Hook meant Argentina led 16–6 at half-time. The home side added to their lead shortly after the break, when Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe burst through a tackle from Gavin Thomas to score a try, which Todeschini converted before kicking a further two penalties. Hook was sin-binned for a high tackle on Todeschini shortly before the hour mark, while Rhys Thomas came on for Adam Jones to make his international debut. The numbers were levelled soon after, when Martín Scelzo was yellow-carded for foul play, and Wales took advantage through Gareth Delve's first international try; however, two more Todeschini penalties sandwiched Tiesi's second try, which the fly-half also converted from out wide. Wales completed the scoring with tries from Shane Williams and Lee Byrne, while Hook and Nicky Robinson chipped in with the conversions, reducing the losing margin to 18 points. With five minutes to go, Argentina hooker Pablo Gambarini came on to make his international debut. Wales coach Gareth Jenkins blamed the loss on their inability to create a strong platform through the forwards. Despite losing the series 2–0, assistant coach Nigel Davies said the tour was a success in terms of having been able to expand the nation's player pool with five new caps. Shane Williams said the young players would have to adapt physically and improve their discipline in order to make a successful transition to the international level. Ian Evans was later cited for a late charge on Argentina captain Agustín Pichot that was not punished with a card during the game; he was banned for six weeks, beginning in August 2006, ruling him out of the Ospreys' pre-season programme and the start of the Celtic League season."

        "text": "The 2006 South Africa rugby union tour of Ireland and England was a series of matches played in November and December 2006 in Ireland and England by South Africa national rugby union team.\nThe Springboks, coached by Jake White lost the test with Ireland, drew the series (1–1) to England and won against a World XV selection.\nResults.\nFirst test in Dublin.\nA bad defeat against Ireland, that had never before scored four tries against Springboks in a century. In the first half, Irish, made three tries that exposed the poor defence of Pierre Spies in particular and Bryan Habana out of position at 13. Spies was twice caught charging out of the line and the Irish swiftly punished that opening each time. The Springboks, fielding a largely experimental side, fought hard as Habana and debutant Francois Steyn dotted down in the second half. That comeback was roundly ended by Horgan after O'Driscoll expertly put him away to seal the game.\nThe match celebrate the centenary of the first Springboks tour and South Africa played in the kit worn by the 1906 touring squad, which was captained by Paul Roos.\nSecond test with England.\nNext up was a two test encounter against England at fortress Twickenham. The Springboks had not beaten England since the Spring Tour of 2000 where the Boks won 18–13. England exacted revenge a week later and had built a period of dominance spanning six years. Even more disconcerting was that the Boks had not won at Twickenham since 1997; this leaving the Boks with a nine-year hoodoo to break. The Boks dominated England for much of the first test and seemed certain of victory until a late try by Phil Vickery gave England the result. A key turning point in the game was the injury to Butch James. His replacement, André Pretorius failed to deliver the steadiness Butch provided and missed an important penalty.\nThe revenge with England.\nThe final analysis was that this was a year of growth as much as it was a disappointing lost opportunity. Injuries to Schalk Burger (broken neck), Bakkies Botha (calf surgery), Jean De Villiers (cracked rib), Bryan Habana (cracked rib), Butch James (groin and knee), André Pretorius (groin), Joe Van Niekerk (C5 &amp; C6 vertebrae), Jacques Cronje (cracked rib), Danie Rossouw (hamstring), Juan Smith (left quadriceps), Eddie Andrews (back), BJ Botha (back surgery), CJ Van Der Linde (Leg), Gurthro Steenkamp (broken hand), Pedrie Wannenburg (wrist surgery), Marius Joubert (fractured hand) amongst other lesser injuries stretched the Bok's depth to its limit. The blessing was that it allowed the Boks to break their reliance on certain individuals and expand their depth in blooding new players and testing new combinations. Francois Steyn was undoubtedly the find of the season alongside the elusive Ruan Pienaar. Jake also found depth in Wynand Olivier and Pierre Spies; the former being used extensively in plugging gaps left by injuries in the backline. Jake lamented the many lost opportunities of this campaign but was optimistic about the various changes they made to their defensive patterns and saw it as an important learning cuve ahead of the World Cup the following year"

        "text": "The World Surf League Australasia (WSL Australasia) is the governing body for professional surfers in Australasia and is dedicated to showcasing the continent's best talent in a variety of progressive formats. It is one of seven regions of the World Surf League.\nHistory.\nCreation of the WSL.\nFounded in 1989, the WSL Australasia was formed to promote professional surfing in Australasia. Its objective is to equally benefit Australasian surfers, sponsors and event promoters alike.\nWSL Membership.\nMembership to the WSL is only available to individuals.\nRules.\nJudging.\nIn contests surfers will be scored on a scale of 0.1 to 10.0, these scores will be broken up into increments of one-tenth.\nThe following scale can be use in order to relate descriptions with the score:\nJudging criteria.\nJudges will base the previous score on how successfully surfers display these following elements in each wave:\nSome of these elements may be more or less important base on the surfing conditions and the surfing area. This criterion is also different then in longboarding competition. All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events.\nThe events themselves are previously declared QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. QS 1,000 - QS 3,000 Qualifying Series events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A QS 4,000 - QS 6,000 Qualifying Series event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At QS 5,000 - QS 10,000 Qualifying Series events there are only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world championship events. All events also require an WSL approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results.\nRules.\nThere are many rules out in the water which all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer which has the inside position then interference will be called and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.\nA surfer can also be found guilty of inference if they catch more than their maximum number of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor's paddling and maneuvering for a wave.\nThe rules of right-a-way vary slightly with the type of break. Point Breaks will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is the person further up the line will have right-away. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then the surfer who stood up first will get the right-a-way. On a multi peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together, when they do the surfer who stood up first has right-a-way and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer.\nIn a one-on-one competition priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddles for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person and will only lose their priority if they catch a wave.\nA surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a wave maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized.\nInterference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interferences are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored then one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored then 50% of the second best scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area."

        "text": "Brandon Duc Allen (born September 5, 1992) is an American football quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Arkansas and was their starting quarterback from 2013 to 2015. He was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft and has also previously been a member of the Los Angeles Rams, Denver Broncos, and Cincinnati Bengals.\nEarly years.\nAllen attended Fayetteville High School in Fayetteville, Arkansas. As a senior, he threw for 3,408 yards and 38 touchdowns. He was ranked by Rivals.com as the fifth-best pro-style quarterback recruit.\nCollege career.\nAllen was redshirted as a freshman in 2011. In 2012, he was the backup to Tyler Wilson. He appeared in five games and started one game after Wilson missed a game because of injury. He finished the season completing 21 of 49 passes for 186 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions.\nIn 2013, Allen took over as the starting quarterback. He passed for 1,552 yards, completing 49.6 percent of his throws, and threw for 13 touchdowns and 10 interceptions for a team that finished 3–9 under first year head coach Bret Bielema.\nAs a junior in 2014, Allen had 2,285 passing yards, 20 touchdowns and five interceptions. He was the offensive MVP of the 2014 Texas Bowl, a 31–7 victory against the Texas Longhorns. Allen threw two touchdowns in the game, and Arkansas finished with a 7–6 record.\nDuring his senior year in 2015, Allen threw a then-school record six touchdown passes, and ran in the game winning 2 point conversion in a 53–52 overtime win over Ole Miss. He broke the record two weeks later with seven touchdowns in a 51–50 loss to Mississippi State. He also broke Arkansas' record for career passing touchdowns against Mississippi State. He finished the year with 3,440 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and eight interceptions for a team that finished 8–5, and beat Kansas State in the 2016 Liberty Bowl, 45–23.\nAllen finished his career with 7,463 passing yards, 64 passing touchdowns, and 26 interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nAllen was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round with the 201st overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. On May 5, 2016, Allen signed a 4-year $2.48 million contract, which included a $147,687 signing bonus. Allen was the Jaguars third-string quarterback his rookie season behind Blake Bortles and Chad Henne. He was waived by the Jaguars on September 3, 2017, following final roster cuts for the 2017 season.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nOn September 4, 2017, Allen was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Rams. He was inactive for every game of the season as the Rams' third-string quarterback behind Jared Goff and Sean Mannion. He was placed on injured reserve on December 20, 2017.\nOn September 18, 2018, Allen was waived by the Rams and was re-signed to the practice squad the next day.\nAllen signed a reserve/future contract with the Rams on February 7, 2019. On August 30, 2019, Allen was released as part of final roster cuts.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn September 1, 2019, Allen was claimed off waivers by the Denver Broncos. After an injury to starting quarterback Joe Flacco in Week 8 of the 2019 season, Allen stepped in as the starting quarterback. Allen made his first start in Week 9 against the Cleveland Browns. In the game, Allen threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns in the 24–19 win.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn August 1, 2020, Allen was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals. He was released on September 5, 2020, and signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on November 23, 2020, after starting quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending injury. On November 25, 2020, the team announced that Allen would start for the Bengals during their Week 12 game against the New York Giants in place of the injured Joe Burrow. In Week 16, against the Houston Texans, he had 371 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 37–31 victory. Allen started the final game for the season against the Baltimore Ravens, where he completed six of 21 passes for 48 yards, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 0.0 as the Bengals lost 38–3.\nOn March 10, 2021, Allen signed a one-year contract extension with the Bengals.\nAllen played his first game of the 2021 season against the Detroit Lions in Week 6.

Allen would appear in the Bengals' next game against the Ravens, recording no stats in the 41–17 victory. In Week 9, with the game out of reach for the Bengals, Allen would go 1 for 2 for 6 yards passing, while rushing once in the 41–16 loss to the Browns. In Week 12, Allen would once again see playing time, this time against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Allen threw an incomplete pass on his only passing attempt, and lost a yard on his only rush attempt of the game. Allen started the season finale against the Browns where he threw for 136 yards and a touchdown in the 21–16 loss.\nAllen re-signed with the Bengals on a one-year contract on March 18, 2022. On August 31, the Bengals cut Allen. He re–signed with the Bengals the following day. Allen was subbed in at the end of the Week 9 game against the Carolina Panthers due to the Bengals resting their starters for the majority of the fourth quarter. Allen completed all three of his pass attempts for a total of 22 yards.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn May 8, 2023, Allen was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He served as the team's third-string quarterback behind Brock Purdy and Sam Darnold in 2023.\nOn March 13, 2024, Allen re-signed with the 49ers.\nPersonal life.\nHis father, Bobby Allen, is the Razorbacks' director of high school and NFL relations. He has a younger brother, Austin Allen, who became the starting quarterback for the Razorbacks after Brandon completed his college eligibility. Austin signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent following the 2018 NFL Draft. Brandon Allen graduated in 2014 with a degree in recreation and sport management."

        "title": "List of NCAA men's volleyball programs",
        "text": "This is a list of colleges and universities with National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) – sanctioned men's indoor volleyball teams that compete for either the NCAA National Collegiate Men's Volleyball Championship or the NCAA Division III Men's Volleyball Championship.\nStructure.\nThe competition structure of men's volleyball dramatically differs from that of most sports sponsored by the NCAA. In most sports, teams are divided into three divisions:\nBefore the 2011–12 school year (2012 championship), men's volleyball did not have an official divisional structure; even now, that structure is truncated. The National Collegiate Championship remains as the NCAA's top-level championship, but Division III members now have their own championship, officially known as the NCAA Division III Men's Volleyball Championship.\nWith the introduction of an official Division III championship, schools in that division are no longer eligible for the National Collegiate Championship. The last exception, Rutgers–Newark, had been a grandfathered scholarship program in men's volleyball and could compete for the National Collegiate Championship through the 2014 edition. After that season, Rutgers–Newark completed a transition to D-III men's volleyball.\nThis structure differs from that of the NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship, in which separate tournaments are conducted for all three divisions, mainly because there are far more NCAA member schools offering women's volleyball than the men's game. All schools that sponsor men's volleyball and are members of either Division I or II are allowed to offer financial aid for the sport that is equivalent to a maximum of 4.5 full scholarships.\nBefore the creation of the NCAA Division III championship in 2012, an unofficial men's volleyball championship tournament was conducted that was open only to Division III men's volleyball programs. For sponsorship reasons, it was known as the \"Molten Division III Men's Invitational Volleyball Championship Tournament (Final Four)\". Though it never occurred, an NCAA Division III school could, before 2012, qualify for the at-large bid to the National Collegiate Championship. Only NCAA Division III teams from the EIVA were able to earn an automatic bid.\nHistorically, there have been three general regions for men's volleyball: \"West\", \"Mid-West\", and \"East\". Before the Big West Conference became the first Division I all-sports conference to sponsor men's volleyball in the 2017–18 school year (2018 season), each region was represented by one \"major\" conference (defined here as a league that includes full Division I member schools)—respectively the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA), and Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA).\nThe East Region is also represented by Conference Carolinas, a Division II all-sports conference that was the first all-sports league in either Division I or II to sponsor men's volleyball. It received an automatic berth in the National Collegiate Championship for the first time in 2014, when the championship expanded from four teams to six.\nWhen the Big West established its men's volleyball league, it took six teams from the MPSF men's volleyball league—half of that conference's pre-2017 men's volleyball membership. However, because the MPSF retained six teams, it kept its automatic NCAA bid, and soon announced it would add two more teams for the 2018 season. With pre-split member California Baptist dropping the sport after the 2017 season, the MPSF now has seven teams. Two conferences from the \"West\" now earn bids.\nThe Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC), a Division II league made up almost exclusively of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), originally planned to start men's volleyball competition in the 2021 season with six members, all HBCUs. COVID-19 issues led the SIAC to delay the start of men's volleyball play to the 2022 season, by which time the conference had lost one of its intended six programs but added a replacement.\nMore recently, the Division I Northeast Conference (NEC) announced that it would start men's volleyball competition in the 2023 season, making it the second D-I all-sports conference to sponsor men's volleyball. The NEC initially announced that its new league would feature six programs, all representing full NEC members. Fairleigh Dickinson and LIU started competition in the 2022 season as independents; transitional D-I member Merrimack would start a new varsity program in 2023; and Sacred Heart, St. Francis Brooklyn, and Saint Francis (PA) moved from the EIVA. The EIVA retained six members and with it its automatic NCAA tournament bid. Shortly after the end of the 2022 season, the NEC announced that two D-II schools that had previously played as independents, Daemen and D'Youville (the latter then a transitional D-II member), would become single-sport NEC associates.\nIn May 2023, the Division II East Coast Conference announced it would add men's volleyball and play its first season in 2024. Full members Roberts Wesleyan and St. Thomas Aquinas were joined by associates American International and Dominican (NY). Alliance had been announced as an associate member, but the university closed immediately before the start of the 2023–24 school year. All of the inaugural ECC men's volleyball members started new men's volleyball programs except for American International, which competed as an independent in 2023.\nAnother Division II conference, the Great Lakes Valley Conference, plans to add men's volleyball in the 2026 season. Five full GLVC members are playing men's volleyball in the 2024 season, with Lewis, McKendree, and Quincy in the MIVA and Maryville and Missouri S&amp;T as independents. Rockhurst will become the sixth GLVC member to sponsor the sport in the 2025 season. \nIn Division III, the conference alignment radically changed with the creation of that division's NCAA championship. Before the 2012 season, the majority of the Division III schools with men's volleyball programs were members of the North East Collegiate Volleyball Association (NECVA). Other Division III schools were members of other leagues, among them the New England Collegiate Conference, and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Teams from the ECAC were members of the NECVA. After the NCAA announced the creation of the D-III championship, the NECVA disbanded after the 2011 season. Two all-sports conferences whose men's volleyball programs had previously formed NECVA divisions—the CUNY Athletic Conference and Great Northeast Athletic Conference—began officially sponsoring the sport. Two other D-III all sports conferences, the United East Conference (then known as the North Eastern Athletic Conference) and Skyline Conference, also started sponsoring men's volleyball. The volleyball-only United Volleyball Conference was founded in 2010 in advance of the establishment of the NCAA D-III championship; another volleyball-only circuit, the Continental Volleyball Conference (CVC), was formed the following year. In 2014, the CVC amicably split along regional lines, with the Eastern members retaining the conference name (plus their automatic bid to the D-III championship) and the Midwestern members forming the new Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League. The Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference, Middle Atlantic Conference, and Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference all began sponsoring men's volleyball in the 2018 season. The New Jersey Athletic Conference added the sport in the 2019 season, but did not sponsor it beyond that season after all of its men's volleyball members moved that sport to other leagues. The College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin and Colonial States Athletic Conference started men's volleyball competition in the 2020 season; the latter conference would merge with the United East Conference after the 2023 season, with the merged league operating under the United East banner. The Old Dominion Athletic Conference and Presidents' Athletic Conference will add men's volleyball in the 2024–25 season.\nMembers of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), a separate athletics governing body whose members are primarily smaller institutions, regularly play matches against NCAA teams.\nBecause of the historic lack of an official divisional structure in men's volleyball, four of the five major conferences have member schools that normally participate in NCAA Division II. This was also true for the other major conference until the 2021 season.\nThe sizes of the conferences have fluctuated over the years as new men's volleyball programs arise and other programs are dropped from their schools. The creation of the men's Division III national championship led to several D-III schools leaving the EIVA.\nThrough 2013, each of the three major conferences of that day (MPSF, MIVA, and EIVA) received an automatic bid to the Final Four with one additional at-large bid. The remaining bid was an at-large bid that could be awarded to any team in Division I or II (which included Rutgers–Newark through the 2014 season). With Conference Carolinas receiving its first automatic berth in the 2014 season, the tournament expanded to six teams—the four conference champions, plus two at-large teams. The top two seeds received byes into the Final Four and the remaining four teams played for places in the Final Four. The tournament expanded further to seven teams for the 2018 season, coinciding with the Big West adding men's volleyball. The Big West receives an automatic bid, and two at-large teams continue to earn tournament entries. The 2018 National Collegiate tournament introduced a \"play-in\" match involving the two lowest seeds in the field; from that point, the tournament format was identical to the one used from 2014 to 2017. In 2024, the tournament expanded to eight teams, coinciding with the SIAC receiving its first automatic bid. All teams now participate at a single site in a pure knockout format. Generally, the best teams not receiving an automatic bid (usually from one of the now four major conferences) receive the at-large bids.\nCurrent programs.\nAll affiliations are current for the ongoing 2024 NCAA men's volleyball season. All years listed refer to men's volleyball seasons; since NCAA men's volleyball is a spring sport, any team listed as joining a new conference in the future will actually join in the calendar year before beginning competition in the new league.\nNational Collegiate (Divisions I &amp; II) programs.\n+=1 bid vacated by NCAA"

Both UConn players started all six games. Hartley was the leading scorer for the USA team with 13.5 points per game, while Mosqueda-Lewis was a close second with 13.0 points per game. Mosqueda-Lewis was the leading rebounder for the team with 41 for an average of almost seven per game.\nIn the gold medal game against the host, Russia, Hartley was the leading scorer with 17 points on 6-for-7 shooting from the field. Mosqueda-Lewis scored 15 points.\nThree UConn players were selected to be on the USA U19 (Under-19) team:\nTuck was selected to be the team captain.\nThe team traveled to the Canary Islands to take part in a preliminary event, the Lanzarote International Invitational Title, which included other teams also headed to the U19 world championship. In the opening game against Australia, the Aussies held a lead at halftime, which was extended to seven points in the second half, until Morgan Tuck helped lead a comeback, resulting in a close win. The team then defeated the host team, Spain, to win the Lanzarote International Invitational title.\nFollowing the preliminary event, the team traveled to Klaipėda and Panevėžys, Lithuania for the World Championship. All three UConn players were starters in every game, except one game missed by Jefferson due to injury. The USA team won their first five games easily, then had a close, six point victory over France. In the medal rounds, the USA team beat Japan easily in the quarterfinals, then faced Australia, the team that had played them close in the Canary islands. The game started out quite close, with Australia leading on some occasions, and held a three-point lead with six minutes to go in the first half. Stewart then scored nine consecutive points to start a 21–0 run to take over the game. The USA team won, to advance to the gold medal game against France, the team they had played earlier in a close game. The first half was close, with the USA holding a seven-point lead at halftime, but the second half was all USA, who held France to only eight more points. The USA won the gold medal by a score of 61–28.\nStewart set a U19 scoring record with 152 points, surpassing the record previously held by Maya Moore. Stewart was also honored as the MVP of the tournament.\nRoster changes.\nThree seniors departed from the prior team:\nFaris was selected 11th overall in the 2013 WNBA draft by the Connecticut Sun.\nThe team added a single freshman:\nChong is a 5' 9\" guard who averaged over 30 points per game with two games over 55 points. She also had almost ten assists and five steals per game as a junior at Ossining High School in New York. In her senior season, she scored 928 points, setting a single season record for scoring in the state of New York. She helped lead her high school team to the state championship in 2013, the first ever in the history of the high school. In a regular season game, Ossining faced Hamilton, who were 12–0 at the time. Hamilton led late in the game, but Chong scored 24 points in the fourth quarter to lead her team to an 88–79 victory. That performance earned her a spot as the Sports Illustrated national Player of the Week.\nChong was recognized by \"Parade\" magazine as their national Girls Basketball Player of the Year. She was also honored by the National High School Coaches Association as the girls basketball National Player of the Year.\nUConn added two walk-ons to the roster. Briana Pulido is a sophomore from Florida who was on the track and field team, but will drop that sport to concentrate on basketball. She will join the team as a 5' 7\" guard. Tierney Lawlor is a freshman from Ansonia High school, who will also play as a guard. Lawlor was captain of her high school team as a junior and senior.\nGame results.\nPre-season.\nConnecticut opened the season against NCAA Division II Gannon University. The Gannon Golden Knights were ranked second in the nation in the Division II pre-season poll. The Huskies had little difficulty, led by Stewart's 21 points, to help win the game 101–35. The second exhibition game was against Division II Philadelphia University. The Lady Rams were over-matched, and UConn won the game 93–28. Philadelphia held an early lead at 3–2, but did not score again for eleven minutes. Every UConn player had double-digit minutes.\nRegular season.\n2013.\nConnecticut opened the regular season against the Hartford Hawks. The Hawks are coached by Jennifer Rizzotti who played for UConn under Auriemma. This game marked the 39th game between an Auriemma coached team and a team whose coach or assistant coach had previously played for him or served as an assistant coach. The teams coached by Auriemma have won all 39 games. This game was no exception, with UConn prevailing 89–34.\nThe game between UConn and Stanford matched up the #1 and #3 ranked teams in the nation. The game result, though was over-shadowed by an injury to Mosqueda-Lewis, who fell hard to the floor, landing on her right arm, and filled the arena with her cries. She left the game. A report a few days later indicated she would be out three to five weeks. Stokes player more minutes than she might have otherwise, and ended with a double-double (ten points and twelve rebounds). The game was played at Gampel Pavilion, the first match-up between UConn and Stanford at the on-campus location since 1993. UConn won the game, 75–57.\nUConn traveled to Maryland below full strength. In addition the Mosqueda-Lewis, who was injured in the prior game and out indefinitely, Tuck underwent knee surgery which was expected to keep her out for four to six weeks. Early ant he game, the score was tied at seven apiece, with UConn's Stewart scoring seven and Maryland's Alyssa Thomas scoring seven. UConn held a five-point lead at intermission, which Maryland quickly countered in the beginning of the second half, tying the game at 43 points each. However, UConn then scored the next eight points. Thomas scored to stop the run and Dolson picked up a fourth foul but UConn went on a 9–2 run to take a commanding lead. Thomas scored 20 points for Maryland, but Stewart had 26, which helped UConn win 72–55, in front of 15,327 fans in the arena.\nHartley entered the game against Penn State in a shooting slump from beyond the three-point line, having missed eleven consecutive attempts in her prior game. She did not shake it off in the beginning of the Penn State game, missing two shots having making one. She went over to teammate Mosqueda-Lewis, sitting on the bench with an injury, but a player who led the nation in three points shooting the prior year. She decided to rub hands with Mosqueda-Lewis for luck, and promptly hit her next three consecutive three-point attempts. Penn State hung with UConn early, but UConn broke a ten-all tie starting with a three-pointer by Chong which began a twelve-point run by the Huskies. Although Penn State would cut a 23-point lead down to nine points at one time, helped by 18 points from Penn State's Maggie Lucas, Hartley responded with eight consecutive points of her own to rebuild the lead. UConn won their third consecutive game over a ranked opponent by a score of 71–52.\nUConn's next game was against Oregon, a team averaging just under 110 points per game. Oregon is coached by Paul Westhead, who has coached NBA, WNBA and NCAA men's teams. A team would score over 110 points, but it was the Huskies, who won 114–68. Late in the game, the UConn staff realized that Stefanie Dolson was close to a triple-double, so she returned to the floor, and earned an assist to complete the accomplishment. She ended the game with 26 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, only the second UConn Husky to complete the feat in UConn women's basketball history. Laura Lishness had the prior triple-double in 1989 against Providence college, with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.\nUConn served as a host school for the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame Women's Challenge. The event included eight teams, four of whom played November 22–24 at UConn locations, and four of whom played the same dates at Ohio State University. All eight teams then played on December 1 at the MassMutual Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, located near the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. UConn opened the event against BU, held at Gampel Pavilion. The game started out ragged, with BU leading for almost the first four minutes, and UConn not breaking into double digits until after six minutes had been played. Then UConn went on a 21–0 run against the Terriers to open up a large lead. Dolson had 23 points, which, coupled with her 20-point production in the prior game represented the first time she has scored 20 or more in back-to-back games.UConn went on to win 96–38. UConn faced Monmouth University in the second game, also held at Gampel Pavilion. The score was tied at seven points each early, but UConn then went on a 34–6 run, which included a stretch of 21 consecutive points scored by the Huskies, to put the game out of reach. UConn went on to win 100–46.\nUConn played for the third time in three days and the fourth times in five days against St. Bonadventure, to end the first phase of the Hall of Fame Classic. This game was played at the XL Center in Hartford. Kiah Stokes led the term in scoring for the first time in her career, putting up a career-high 19 points, along with eight rebounds and four blocked shots. She helped the Huskies win the game 88–39.\nAfter a week off, UConn played Ohio State in the final game of the Hall of Fame Classic. All eight teams in the Classic participated in a dinner, held at the Hall of Fame the day before all teams participated in the final game of the event on Sunday December 1. The team shows signs of the layoff, committing 16 turnovers, including eight be Dolson. Hartley led the team with 17 points, helping the team to a 70–49 win. The win represented the 53rd consecutive victory in an in-season tournament for the Huskies.\nUConn started the season with a relatively small lineup of seven scholarship players, supplemented by two walk-ons. Injuries to Mosqueda-Lewis and Tuck reduced that lineup even further, and as the team prepared for the University of California-Davis, Stokes turned an ankle and was unavailable for practice and the game. While the limited roster forced adjustments to practice routines, it seemed to have little effect on the availability of the team to play effectively. UConn won the game by sixty points 97–37. Hartley led the team in points with 25, while freshman Chong added ten points and Jefferson recorded a season high eight assists.\nAfter a twelve-day layoff for exams, UConn's next game was against Duke, ranked number 2 in the nation. This game would be the first game for Mosqueda-Lewis since her injury in the Stanford game. She wore a protective sleeve, and the coaching staff had no idea how she would fare, even to the point of preparing a game plan in case she was ineffective, but her return was solid. She hit seven three-pointers, a career high, helping the Huskies defeat Duke 83–61. Teammate Stewart contributed 24 points as the Huskies extended their record to 11–0.\nUConn then traveled to Madison Square Garden to participate in the Maggie Dixon classic, and annual event honoring the Army coach. Stewart had 29 points, matching a career high, along with ten rebounds to help the Huskies to a win over number 20 ranked California. Stewart scored more points in the first half than the entire Bears team.\nThe last game of the calendar year, December 29, against Cincinnati, featured a ceremony to honor the national championship team of 2003 and 2003. Several members of those teams were in attendance for the game and the ceremony. UConn scored the first 16 points of the game but then the Bearcats outscored the Huskies 20–17 over the rest of the half. The Huskies regained their footing in the second half, ending with a 67–34 victory.\n2014.\nThe Huskies opened the new year in Florida, at the University of Central Florida, on New Year's Day. The Knights held a lead to the first media timeout, but the Huskies then opened up a lead they would never relinquish. USF's Briahanna Jackson scored 28 points to lead all scorers, but UConn as a team outscored the Knights to win 77–49. UConn started slow against Memphis three days later, holding only a three-point margin six minutes into the game. The Huskies then outscored the Tigers by 30 points over the rest of the first half. UConn won easily, 90–49.\nUConn's next game was at home against Houston, the last place team in the AAC, whose head coach left the team before Christmas. Houston has not won since, and would not this day, as the Huskies win 90–40 behind 24 points from Stewart and 19 from Tuck. UConn then played at Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport. Although the Huskies had played in the arena in post-season NCAA games, this was the first-ever regular season in the arena. The attendance was 9,274, a sellout, which tied a record attendance for the location. Temple, coach by former UConn assistant coach Tonya Cardoza, took an early lead but could not sustain it. Four UConn players had double-digit points, helping to secure a victory, 80–36.\nThe following game was against seventh ranked Baylor on Baylor's home court, where the Bears had a 69-game home winning streak. The streak began March 7, 2010, which meant no player on the current Bears team had ever lost a game at home. After five minutes, the score was even at ten points apiece.UConn scored the next seven to open up a small lead. The Huskies maintained the lead into the second half. Nine minutes into the second half, the Bears cut the lead to 50–49, but that would be as close as they would get. The Huskies went on to win 66–55, ending the Baylor home win streak.\nWith Rutgers moving to the Big Ten Conference next season, the UConn game at the RAC is the last scheduled league game at that arena. UConn scored first, and never gave up the lead, as Hartley scored 30 points, representing a career high. The Huskies won 94–64. Mosqueda-Lewis failed to hit a three in the game against Rutgers, only the seventh time in her career without a three in a game, but responded with five three-pointers in the following game against Memphis. Jefferson had nine steals, only one off the school record held jointly by Cathy Bochain (1980) and Jennifer Rizzotti (1996). The Huskies won 83–49 to improve to 20–0.\nUConn started the season with nine scholarship players plus two walk-ons, but has had to play with fewer on several occasions. In the game against USF, Tuck was unavailable (out for the season), Banks was unavailable (ankle injury) and Chong dressed, but had stomach issues and was unable to play. This left the five starters and one scholarship player. Opposing coaches are not showing much sympathy, as the short bench has not contributed to a loss. Against USF, Stewart scored 29 to help lead the Huskies to an 81–53 win. The game against Temple on January 28 was held at McGonigle Hall an arena familiar to head coach Auriemma, as it is just six miles from where he grew up, but it was the first time he had ever coached a game there. Stewart hit 15 of 19 shot attempts, ending with a career-high 37 points. She helped lead the Huskies to a 93–56 victory.\nWhen UConn played Cincinnati in December, the Bearcats held UConn to 67 points, their lowest scoring total of the year to that point. (South Florida would hold UConn to 63 in February.) In their second match-up of the season, defense would again be the key theme, but not by Cincinnati. The Huskies scored 86, while holding the Bearcats to just 29 points. UConn won easily, extending their season record to 23–0.\nOn February 4, UConn faced SMU at their campus home, Gampel. The Huskies scored the first 19 points of the game; all five starters ended with double-digit scoring. The final score in favor of UConn was 102–41. UConn next faced Louisville, in a rematch of the 2013 National Championship game. Louisville was ranked No. 4 in the country, and came in with only a single loss on the season, winners of their last 16 games, the longest winning streak in school history. The game was reasonably close early, with UConn holding only a five-point lead late in the first half. Then Stewart hit consecutive three-pointers to open up the lead before the sellout crowd. The Huskies held Louisville's leading scorer Shoni Schimmel, to nine points and won 81–64.\nUConn returned to Florida to play South Florida. Despite the final score of 63–38, USF head coach Jose Fernandez had reasons for optimism. His team held UConn to the lowest points total of the season, as well as the fewest made field goals. Mosqueda-Lewis was unable to play due to mononucleosis, so Saniya Chong was a first time starter. While she did not score, she played 37 minutes and earned praise from her coach.\nAAC tournament.\nUConn had a bye for the first session of the tournament and played their first game on Saturday, March 7 against Cincinnati, the number 8 seed and winner of the 8/9 match-up with Central Florida. The Huskies never trailed, but the Bearcats stayed close early in the game, only four points behind at 17–13. However, UConn then extended the lead to 20 points by halftime, and won the game by 30 with a score of 72–42.\nIn the semifinal match-up with Rutgers, UConn opened the scoring early, scoring 13 points before the Scarlet Knights got on the board. Despite leading 30–9 midway through the first half, the Huskies were not relaxing. Rutgers Betnijah Laney stole the ball near mid-court and headed to her basket for a layup. Stewart started near the paint, but sprinted at top speed and managed a crowd-pleasing block. She then went to the other end of the court and drained a three-pointer to extend the lead. UConn went to win, 83–57.\nThe finals of the first-ever AAC tournament featured the top two seeds in the tournament, UConn and Louisville. UConn scored the first eight points of the game, and extended the lead to 27–10. The Cardinals came back with a run of their own, scoring ten of the next eleven points but UConn came back with a 12–2 run and held a 40–22 lead at halftime. UConn won 72–52 to win the conference tournament championship. Hartley, Mosqueda-Lewis and Dolson were named to the All-tournament team, while Stewart was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nNCAA tournament.\nWith the overall top seed in the NCAA tournament, UConn drew the weakest of the qualifying teams, Prairie View A&amp;M University, who started the year losing their first eleven games, and ended the regular season with a losing record. However, they prevailed in their conference tournament, so were eligible for the NCAA tournament. The Huskies scored the first fifteen points of the game, and were never tested. UConn held a 44–12 lead at the half and coasted to an 83–43 final result.\nUConn faced St. Joseph's in the second round. The first two rounds were hosted by UConn, so this game presented the final game in Gampel Arena for the seniors on the team. As has been the sequence in recent games, UConn opened the scoring with a run, scoring the first eight points of the game before the Hawks scored. The Huskies won 91–52, with Mosqueda-Lewis scoring 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, to record only the third triple-double in UConn history.\nThe Huskies played their third-round game in Lincoln, Nebraska against Brigham Young. In 1,440 minutes of play prior to this game, the UConn team had trailed for under 39 minutes in total, with zero seconds occurring in five post-season games. UConn trailed for several minutes in the first half, and although taking a one-point lead at halftime, gave up the lead and trailed in the second half for the first time this season. Hartley hit a three almost three minutes into the second half to give UConn a lead, then after BYU's Morgan Bailey tied the game, Stewart scored to give UConn a lead they would not relinquish. UConn gradually extended the lead, and won 70–51.\nThe second game in the Lincoln Regional was against Texas A&amp;M. UConn scored the first basket, but the Aggies responded with eleven of the next thirteen points to take an 11–4 lead, the largest deficit UConn had faced this season. 81 seconds later, UConn tied the game on a three by Mosqueda-Lewis. Texas A&amp;M would tie the game at 13 and 15 points each, but would never take another lead. The Aggies cut an eleven-point halftime lead to three points in the second half, but would get no closer. The final score, in favor of UConn, was 69–54.\nMosqueda-Lewis earned the regional Most Outstanding Player award. Dolson made her 150th start, which tied an NCAA record.\nConnecticut faced Stanford in the semifinal game. The Huskies scored twice before the Cardinal scored, but Stanford not only took the lead at 9–8, but extended the lead to 16–10. The two teams played evenly for some time, and with just under six minutes to go in the first half, the Cardinal still held a six-point lead, 22–16. UConn pulled out to a four-point lead by halftime, although Mosqueda-Lewis had not yet scored. She would make up for that in the second half with 15 points, one of five players in double digits. In the second half, Stanford had an early three-point shot to cut the lead to three, but they would not score again for over five minutes, by which time the margin reach 17 points at 44–27. UConn would go on to win by 19 points, 75–56.\nThe win by UConn in the semifinal game, coupled with the win by Notre Dame over Maryland in the other semifinal set up the Championship game between two undefeated teams, a theme that has been repeated in the media. \"Sports Illustrated\" summed it up by calling it \"one of the most anticipated games in the sport's history\". It is the first time in NCAA history that two unbeaten teams met in the championship game. The two teams are not unfamiliar with each other; both teams were in the Big East Conference until UConn joined the AAC and Notre Dame joined the ACC. The teams played each other 16 times since the 2009–10 season; in many cases, with much on the line. Most of the games affected conference standings, were conference title games or NCAA Final Four games. Three of the game went to overtime. Because the two teams were now in different conferences, it was the first time in many years the two teams had not met in the regular season.\nUConn would take an early lead in the game. Notre Dame's best post player, Natalie Achonwa, was not playing due to an ACL injury, so UConn pushed the ball inside. They would end up with a 52–22 points in the paint advantage, the \"most dominating post performance women's basketball has witnessed in a title game\". After pulling out to a 14-point lead midway through the first half, the Irish responded to cut the lead to seven by halftime. However, \"Sports Illustrated\"s Richard Deitsch warned in a pre-game write-up \"...UConn has always been a team of runs (\"spurtability,\" as Clark Kellogg would say) especially early in the second half\". The second half opened with the teams trading baskets, but over the next seven minutes, UConn scored 16 of the next 18 points, to extend the lead from seven to 21 points. UConn would go on to win their ninth National Championship game by the same margin 79–58. The 40 wins tied an NCAA record set by Baylor two years ago.\nSchedule.\nThis is the first year that UConn is in the new American Athletic Conference. In addition to a home-and-home with the nine other members in the conference. The out of conference schedule includes two out of three of the other Final Four participants from the prior year, as well as games against Baylor and Stanford. UConn will be part of the Hall of Fame classic, which includes a game in Springfield against Ohio State. In December, Connecticut will travel to Durham, North Carolina to play Duke in the Jimmy V Classic.\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#002868; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Exhibition\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Regular Season\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#808080;\"|2014 AAC tournament\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#0064A8;\"|2014 NCAA tournament\nFirst Night.\nFor many years, the NCAA earliest-allowable date for formal practice was the same day for all basketball teams, both men and women. This led to some teams celebrating the start of the season with an event, often called Midnight Madness. The start time was changed from midnight, and schools adopted various names. In recent years, the NCAA has changed the way the date of initial practice is determined, with slightly different rules for men and women, so the first date can vary by school. Some school still plan a pre-season event, even though that event no longer coincides with the first date of practice.\nAt UConn the event is called \"First Night\". In 2013, at Gampel Pavilion, it included player introductions with dance routines. The players from both the men's teams and women's team were assigned to two teams, one coached by women's coach Geno Auriemma and the other coached by men's coach Kevin Ollie. After competing against each other in trivia games where they had to identify cartoon characters drawn by three-year-olds, they played a five-on-five scrimmage, generally with three males and two females on each team. It was a lighthearted affair, with little actual defense, and many dunks. Team Geno won with a late three-pointer by Omar Calhoun. The arena was close to full, with an estimated 10,000 fans in attendance.\nWNBA draft.\nDolsen and Hartley were selected in the first round of the draft in consecutive picks. Dolson was chosen 6th, by the Washington Mystics. Hartley was the next player chosen, initially by the Seattle Storm, but traded an hour later to Washington, so the teammates continue to be teammates."

        "text": "The Women's time trial of the 2013 UCI Road World Championships took place on 24 September 2013 in the region of Tuscany, Italy. The course of the race was 22.05 km from Parco delle Cascine to the Nelson Mandela Forum in Florence.\nEllen van Dijk from the Netherlands lived up her expectations as main favourite and won the time trial by dominating the race, beating perennial podium finisher Linda Villumsen and the surprising American Carmen Small.\nQualification.\nAll National Federations may enter 4 riders of whom 2 may start.

German Trixi Worrack, the first of the final 10 riders to finish, took over the lead after finishing in a time of 28' 19\". The main favourites started last and showed some fast intermediate times at the two intermediate time points after and . The Dutch Ellen van Dijk was the fastest from the start by riding 20 second faster than Linda Villumsen and 24 seconds faster than Carmen Small at the first time point. At the second split the gaps were 25 and 28 seconds respectively. Van Dijk lost one second to Villumsen in the final five kilometres but her margin was large enough to win her second world title of the championship after winning the team time trial with her squad on Sunday. For Villumsen it was her fifth consecutive time on the world championship time trial podium, but never won the rainbow jersey.\nMedalists reactions.\nVan Dijk lived up the expectations as main favourite and won the time trial by dominating the race.\n\"I'm super happy. It's difficult to describe how I feel now\", she said after the race. \"I'm so excited because I dreamt so long of this one and the pressure was high to finish it off. It's great to have won. My intention was to start fast but I wanted to keep going a bit longer than I did. I maybe got over excited and a went too fast, but I maintained the time difference and so it was all ok.\" This race was the seasons' main goal for Van Dijk. She had been tested on her time trial position during the season and found a better position which she was able to maintain for almost half an hour. Van Dijk told she practiced the course twice in August at 5:00am to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course to get to know the turns. She had watched the video over and over again until she could dream it.\nVillumsen rode the New Zealand National Time Trial Championships in January before backing off until June. She rode the Giro Rosa and won La Route de France and the time trial at the Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche before heading to World Championships. \"It was a different year for me but a good year.\" She said in an interview. \"I started late and with a different approach. I trained more at home and then did race after race. I enjoyed it. I was still there on the podium so I can thank my team for helping me this far.\" Villumsen, a former a Danish national road race champion, switched her nationality in 2010 from Danish to New Zealand. It was her fifth straight podium at the world championships in the time trial. She took her first bronze in 2009, 2010 and 2012, and won silver in her former home country in 2011. \"It's not bad luck.\" Villumsen said. \"If someone is better, they deserve to win. Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year, she has won all kinds of time trials, short ones, long ones. She really deserved to win. A place on the podium is still nice. I go close every year but something is missing. I'll try to work it out and go all the way to the top perhaps next year.\"\nSmall, American national time trial champions, considered retirement in 2012 before signing by . She won her first medal at the World Championships.\n\"I’m pretty surprised, I didn’t expect to actually podium. I thought top five would be a really good ride for me. Jim Miller (USA Cycling vice president of athletics) and I met before and I really wanted Jim in the car talking to me because he was in the car at Nationals with me when I won. I just buried myself in the last 500 meters. I knew it was going to hurt, but it hurts for everyone. With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit, but I did one more click down on my gears and I just counted the pedal strokes to get me to the finish. This hurt worse than I’ve ever hurt before.\" She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds. \"It's a very bittersweet feeling for me. Evelyn is a good friend, a teammate and a fellow countryman. We've spent a lot of time together this season and it's hard to have been beaten and have it be so close\".\nFinal classification.\nOf the 48 riders on the starting list, 3 riders did not start.\nDNS = did not start"

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Curtly Ambrose",
        "text": "Curtly Ambrose, a former West Indian cricketer, took 26 five-wicket hauls at international level. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 41 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Ambrose played 98 Tests and 176 One Day Internationals (ODIs), and took 405 and 225 wickets respectively. A right-arm fast bowler who represented the West Indies from 1988 to 2000, he took 22 five-wicket hauls in Tests and 4 in ODIs. The cricket almanack \"Wisden\" noted his \"smooth, leggy run-up, fast arm action and accuracy\", apart from \"lethal yorker[s]\" and \"nasty bouncer[s]\", and named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1992. Upon his induction into the International Cricket Council Cricket Hall of Fame in September 2011, ESPNcricinfo described Ambrose as \"one of the finest bowlers of all time\", and as of 2013 he is tenth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers.\nAmbrose made his Test debut in 1988 against Pakistan at the Bourda, Georgetown, a match the West Indies lost by 9 wickets. His first five-wicket haul came eight months later against Australia at the WACA Ground, Perth; West Indies won the match by 169 runs. His career-best bowling figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 45 runs against England at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, in April 1990 where his match-winning performance earned him a man of the match award. Ambrose took his solitary pair of five-wicket hauls in a Test match—5 wickets for 60 runs and 6 wickets for 24 runs—against the same opponents at the Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, in March 1994, his best bowling performance in a Test match. Ambrose achieved his 22 five-wicket hauls at 12 different grounds, including 11 at 9 different venues outside the West Indies. He was most successful against Australia and England taking eight five-wicket hauls each. He took ten or more wickets in a match on three occasions.\nAmbrose made his ODI debut against Pakistan at the Sabina Park, Kingston, in March 1988. His first five-wicket haul in this format came later that year against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where he took 5 wickets for 17 runs in the match, his best performance in ODI matches. Ambrose took three of his four one-day five-wicket hauls against Australia and one against Pakistan. As of 2013, he is joint tenth—with Dale Steyn—overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

In 2014, Guamanian sprinter Raquel Walker credited Alicto's advice for helping her progress towards her pursuit of Pollara Cobb's 100m record set at the previous Worlds, saying \"Ever since I’ve been training with (Alicto) I’ve been feeling really good, my speed’s been getting better, and hopefully by the end of the season you’ll see something awesome.\""

        "text": "The Bowling Iron Works was an iron working complex established around 1780 in the district of East Bowling part of the township and manor of Bowling, now in the southeast of Bradford in Yorkshire, England. The operation included mining coal and iron ore, smelting, refining, casting and forging to create finished products.\nMineral deposits.\nIron is said to have been worked in the vicinity of Bradford in Roman times. \nThe monks of Rievaulx Abbey to the east were working iron on land owned by their monastery in 1150, and forgemen are mentioned in 1358.\nSurface coal was being extracted from outcrops and shallow pits by 1360, and coal mines were worked by 1502.\nThe Bowling Ironworks were established in the 1780s to smelt and forge iron from the Black Bed ironstone deposits using coal from the Better Bed seam, both of which lay under the site.\nThe ironstone yields about 32% iron.\nThe Better Bed coal is free of sulfur, making it ideal for furnaces used in smelting, puddling and forging.\nThe Black Bed coal, nearer to the surface, could be sold or used for firing boilers and other purposes.\nMining began in Jeremiah Rawson's estate, then extended into nearby estates as the deposits became exhausted, always mining the same beds of minerals.\nIn 1794 the company purchased from Sir Francis Wood (owner of Bowling Hall and Lord of the Manor) the rights to 90 acres of coal and iron stone in Hall Lane, Broomfields. In 1806 the company purchased additional mineral rights to parts of Sir Francis' Bowling Hall estate.\nThe rights to other land was purchased in later years, often after extensive negotiation.\nIn 1816 the company purchased from Sir Francis all his remaining lands and mineral rights in Bowling and in 1821 purchased from him the Lordship of the Manor.\nThe same seams of ironstone and coal were exploited by the Low Moor Iron Company, founded in 1788, and then by the Bierley Iron Company from around 1810.\nFoundation.\nThe first foundry was established at Bowling around 1784 by a group of businessmen including John Sturges, an ironmaster with works at Wakefield, and Richard Paley (1746-1808), an iron merchant of Leeds.\nThe other partners were John Sturges junior, William Sturges and John Ewell. Ewell left the partnership in 1792.\nThe company took the name of John Sturges &amp; Company.\nIron was brought to the foundry from Wakefield in the early years.\nThe first products were items for domestic use such as laundry irons, ovens, boilers, window sash weights and clock weights.\nThe smelting plant was established in 1788, producing pig iron that was used in the boiler plates for the first steam engine at the Low Moor works. \nAs late as 1792 pig iron was delivered to Wakefield and wrought iron received in exchange.\nIn 1804 the partnership was extended, bringing in George Paley (1779-1865) and John Green Paley (1774-1860) - respectively the son and nephew of Richard Paley - plus Thomas Mason and the Reverend John Simons.\nHistory.\nThe Bowling works were selling large quantities of guns, shot and shells to the British government before 1790. Cast iron was used for guns before the invention of wrought iron, and the cast iron guns were subject to rigorous production controls and quality tests.\nOn 27 July 1796 the partners signed an agreement with Matthew Boulton and James Watt to pay royalties on the two steam engines in use at the works, and to be allowed to make additional steam engines at the works, paying royalties.\nWhen Sir William Armstrong invented wrought-iron guns, some of the first coils he used were Bowling iron. \nBowling iron, or Best Yorkshire, became well known around the world.\nSteam hammers were installed at the Bowling Ironworks where the steam cylinder was bolted to the back of the hammer, \nthus reducing the height of the machine.\nThese were designed by John Charles Pearce, who took out a patent for his steam hammer design several years before James Nasmyth's patent expired.\nOn 14 November 1848 a new partnership was created with the name of Bowling Iron Co., confirmed by act of parliament in August 1849. \nThe company was incorporated and registered in 1870.\nAn 1891 description said the ironworks lay in,\nThe plant at that time included blast furnaces and refineries used in the first stages of iron manufacture, puddling and ball furnaces with high brick or iron chimneys, a shed housing the steam hammers, steelworks, a large machine shop, boiler works, a large foundry and other workshops and buildings. A narrow gauge railway was used to move material within the works, and a line to the Great Northern Railway was used to ship the products.\nA network of tramways brought minerals from the pits to the works, with wagons pulled by wire ropes powered by stationary engines.\nFour large pumps were being used to keep the mines dry, with some of the water used in the ironworks.\nThe Bowling Iron Company went into liquidation in 1898.\nIn 1903 the company was reorganized as The Bowling Iron Company. It was liquidated in 1921.\nConditions.\nBy 1840 Bradford was known for having some of the most smoke-filled air in Britain.\nAs early as 1803 an act had stated that, \"Engine chimneys are to be erected of sufficient height as not to create a nuisance by the emission of smoke. All owners of engines etc. are to construct fireplaces thereof in such a manner as most effectually to destroy and consume the smoke arising therefrom.\" However, little was done to enforce the laws. \nThere was a general feeling that the factories provided work, so should not be pushed too hard to reduce pollution.\nAn 1841 account said, \"The condition of Bradford is dreadful. Lowmoor iron-forges most extensively spread their suffocating exhalations on the one side ... On the other side, Bowling Iron \"Hell\" (for it is one truly) casts a still denser atmosphere and sulphurous stench...\"\nThe Bowling Iron Company was fined on 12 December 1874, but only for £5 with £9. 10s. costs for ten offences.\nThe population suffered high levels of respiratory diseases, peaking in 1890 during an influenza epidemic.\nThe method of paying the men led them into temptation of intemperance and extravagance:\nAccording to H. Hartopp, manager of the Bowling Works,\nThe company built St. John's Church, Bowling, at its own expense of £5,000. The church was consecrated on 8 February 1842.\nIt is built in the Lancet-Gothic style and is in size, with a spire.\nThe church was the first to be built in England of iron and stone, with only the rafters made of wood.\nIn April 1847 St. John's school in Bowling was visited. The Bowling Iron company had erected the building, but did not contribute much to its expenses. There were on average 150 children at the school, of whom 12 were factory workers.\nOnly seven children had reached aged 13. The schoolroom had poor lighting and ventilation, and there was no mistress to instruct the older children.\nIn the mines, hurrier-boys would drag carriages along tracks to the miners,\nthen drag the filled carriages back to the pit shaft and hook them to a chain so they could be pulled up.\nAn 1843 inquiry into child labor said of Jabez Scott, aged fifteen, a worker at the Bowling Iron Works: \"Work is very hard; sleeps well sometimes, sometimes is very ill tired and cannot sleep so weel [sic].\"\nAn 1847 report noted that there was considerable temptation to employ boys in the mines when they were below the legal age, then ten years of age.\n\"Managers, &amp;c., of mines, complain that the work required of boys in seams of coal not more than 18 inches to two feet thick, is done at a disadvantage, unless they are brought to it from their earliest years.\"\nIn 1875 there was an explosion in the Bowling Iron Company's Crosses Pit mine, where 40 men and boys were working. Four ironstone getters and hurriers were killed, and others injured. The cause seems to have been accidental ignition of gunpowder being used to break up large pieces of scale that contained the ironstone.\nA select committee of the House of Commons in 1877 heard that in West Yorkshire, including the Bowling Iron Works, the colliers employed boys as assistants, rather the boys being employed by the company, although the boys had their names entered and were subject to the colliery rules. At that time Bowling employed about 2,000 workmen in the collieries, and it was estimated that about two men died each year. Accident rates were higher in the iron works, despite employment being lower.\nBoys were employed in various capacities in the ironworks, such as wheeling hot lumps of puddled iron to the hammers.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations\nSources"

The school's team currently competes in the Atlantic Sun Conference.\nIn 2002, Florida Gulf Coast became an independent member of NCAA Division II. Florida Gulf Coast also started its men's basketball team, with Dave Balza as head coach from the inaugural 2002–03 to the 2010–11 season. In 2006, Florida Gulf Coast applied for NCAA Division I status and became a transitory Division I effective in the 2007–08 season. Florida Gulf Coast became a full Division I member on August 11, 2011.\nHistory.\nThe university charter was signed 1991, but students did not begin attending classes until 1997. The athletic programs began as members of the NAIA. The school hired Karl Smesko while the school was still in the NAIA, but his first year coincided with the transfer to NCAA Division II in 2002. In his first year, the basketball facilities were not yet completed at the beginning of the season, so players began individual workouts on outdoor courts. His first office was in a trailer. Despite having no experience as a team, the Eagles opened their season against Ohio Dominican and won. Then they won their next game, and the next, and continued winning until they faced St. Francis of Indiana, who beat the Eagles to give them their first loss. That would be the last loss of the season, as they went on to a thirty win season, with a 30–1 record.\nThe team continued to pile up winning records, and went on to post a 29–2 record in and earn an invitation to the DII post-season tournament in 2006. The team would advance as far as the Regional semi-final. After reaching a national DII ranking of eleven, the team faced ninth ranked Rollins, and won 48–46. The team then faced seventh ranked Delta State who ended the Eagles season with a 57–48 win.\nFGCU then joined the Atlantic Sun Conference, although they would be provisional members until 2011. The finished in second place in the conference in both 2008, and 2010. The 2009 team did finish first in the conference during the regular season but due to the transition to Division I and the Atlantic Sun Conference, was not eligible for conference or NCAA Tournament play. The team earned invitations to the post-season WNIT tournament, advancing to the second round in 2008 and 2009. In 2011, the team would go 28–4 overall, with a 17–3 record in conference. That record was the best in conference, resulting in the first regular season conference title for the Eagles. The team would not become a full member of the conference until August of that year, so was not part of the conference post-season tournament. They did participate in the 2011 WNIT, beating Drexel in the first round before losing to Florida in the second round.\nIn 2012, their first year of eligibility for the Atlantic Sun post-season tournament, they went undefeated in conference play, with an 18–0 as part of an overall 29–3 record. They won the conference tournament, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament. They took on St. Bonaventure in their first NCAA game and took the Bonnies to overtime, before succumbing 72–65.\nThe following year, the team also went undefeated in regular season conference play, but ended up with a loss to Stetson in the conference championship game. Although the team had lost eight players from the year before, they had won all their conference games by double digits. They held a double-digit lead in the conference final, but then went on a long scoreless streak, allowing the Hatters to get back into the game and win, 70–64. The Eagles earned an invitation to the WNIT but lost in the first round.\n2012 Paradise Jam.\nFGCU participated at the Paradise Jam in St. Thomas. The four teams invited to the Reef Division of tournament were:\nThe teams played in a round-robin format over the Thanksgiving weekend. In their game against DePaul, the Eagles fell behind early, down as much as 12 points in the first half. They came back to cut the deficit to a single point at halftime. After taking a brief, one-point lead early in the second half, the Blue Demons took back the lead, and extended it to nine points with under eight minutes to go. The lead was still eight points with just over two minutes left, when Taylor Gradinjan was fouled on a three-point attempt, and hit all three free throws. Katie Meador hit a basket with 23 seconds remaining, and Sarah Hansen scored with eight seconds left, but DePaul held on for a two-point victory.\n2013 Academic award.\nIn the 2012–13 season, the team achieved a GPA of 3.621, which was high enough to be in fourth place among Division I teams, and earned a position on the WBCA Academic honor roll.\nCoaching staff.\nThe head coach, Karl Smesko, became the head coach at FGCU after previous coaching experience at Walsh University, Maryland, and IPFW. He was the first head coach of the women's basketball program at FGCU. He has many awards, including the Kay Yow Award in 2012.

The Titans, led by first year head coach Dedrique Taylor, played their home games at Titan Gym as members of the Big West Conference. The Titans brought in a whole new coaching staff this season with Josh Smith, Robert Spence, and Danny Sprinkle joining Taylor as first-year assistant coaches. They finished the season 11–20, 6–10 in Big West play to finish in a tie for sixth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big West Conference tournament to Long Beach State.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nCal State Fullerton announced the hiring of former Arizona State associate head coach Dedrique Taylor as the program's 10th head coach on April 3, 2013. Taylor replaced Andy Newman, who spent one season as the Titans' interim head coach. Taylor had been with Arizona State since 2006, serving as an assistant for four seasons and spending the past three years as an associate head coach. He had spent time as an assistant at UC Davis, Loyola Marymount, Portland State, and Nevada prior.\nTaylor completed his first recruiting class as the head man for the Titans on May 8, 2013, with the announcement of the signing of forward Joe Boyd. Boyd, a forward from Scottsdale, Arizona, joined guard Sheldon Blackwell (from Rancho Cucamonga, California) as the second and final member of the Titans' 2013 recruiting class.\nThe Titans completed their coaching staff on May 17, 2013. All three of Cal State Fullerton's assistants from the season prior had left, and Taylor replaced them with John Smith, Danny Sprinkle, and Robert Spence.

        "title": "Perth Cricket Club",
        "text": "Perth Cricket Club is a cricket team based in Perth, Western Australia. The club competes in the Western Australian Grade Cricket (Premier cricket) competition.\nHistory.\nThe club was officially formed on May 23, 1862. at a meeting held at the Freemason's Hotel, on the corner of St Georges Tce and William St. Mr James B. Roe (son of John Septimus Roe) was the first Chairman and Captain of the Club.\nThe club is a founding member in the formation of Western Australian Cricket Association in 1885.\nThere is some evidence of games being played prior to 1862. Newspaper articles speak of members of the Perth Cricket club meeting in 1839, each Saturday at The Flats, near where the Supreme Court Gardens are to this day. On Easter Eve 1839 the Perth Cricket Club defeated Guildford in a ‘stirring struggle’ by 40 runs. Games were held in 1846 between the Tradesmen of Perth v Perth Club.\nIn 1871 the Weld Club was established in Perth by ‘members of the establishment of Perth’. Many of the members of the Weld Club were also members of the Metropolitan’s Cricket Club and matches would be held between the ‘Weld Club’ versus the ‘World’. Sir Walter James was a prominent figure of the time being Premier of WA, President of the Weld Club in the early 1930s and he also served as President of the East Perth (Perth) cricket club for two seasons from 1908 to 1910.\nIn March 1878, a meeting was held to approve the merger of the Perth and Metropolitans Clubs. Strong consideration was given to using the name Perth Cricket Club, but the name Metropolitans was decided to be the name of the club going forward. Mr J.C.H. James moved a motion (that was subsequently withdrawn) that whatever name is used, the club should be generally referred to as the “Perth Club”. Mr J.H. Thomas was elected chairman and Mr James the club captain.\nThe WA Cricket Association was formed in November 1885. The Metropolitans club was mainly instrumental in its formation. George Parker, captain of Metropolitans, was chairman of the first W.A.C.A. committee. P.L. (Percy) Hussey of Metropolitans would serve as Secretary of the committee. Metropolitans win the inaugural first grade premiership, under the leadership of club President George Randell.\nNotable office bearers in the early days include Sir Stephen Parker Chief Justice WA and his brother George (of Parker and Parker law firm), who both serve as President of the Club. Sir John Forrest and Septimus Burt both occupied a time as the club vice president. Another prominent politician, Sir Walter Kingsmill, was president for four seasons.\nWith the introduction of electorate cricket in 1899, the Metropolitans/Perth club became the East Perth Cricket Club in the new seven team competition. At the turn of the 20th century, the leading batsman in WA cricket was undoubtedly Ernie Parker. Several of his records remain to this day, including his 246 at the WACA against East Fremantle in 1903. He still holds the club 2nd and 3rd wicket partnership records.\nEast Perth won numerous Premierships in its early years. It won the first grade premiership on nine occasions from 1899 to 1925, which was the final year of a hat-trick of flags. Its final premiership under the East Perth name was in the 1948–49 season under Captain Keith Carmody. In 1955, the club changed name from East Perth back to the original Perth name, whilst still playing home matches at the WACA Ground. In 1958, with Sheffield Shield cricket now restricting playing access to the WACA, the club moved to Lathlain Park.\nIn 1968 the club relocated to its current ground, Fletcher Park in Carlisle. Perth played its first A grade game at Fletcher Park on 12 October versus North Perth. In 2018, the club marks 50 years of Western Australian Grade Cricket played at Fletcher Park.\nAustralian Test match representatives, whilst playing at Perth, are Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh and Adam Gilchrist\nTeam of the century.\nIn November 2012, the club recognised its 150th year since formation.

        "title": "Derrick Green (American football)",
        "text": "Derrick Shaqueill Green (born February 21, 1994) is a former American football running back. He was rated by Rivals.com and Scout.com as the No. 1 running back in the country and by Rivals.com as the No. 8 overall player in the Class of 2013. He played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 2013 to 2015, gaining 898 yards and scoring seven touchdowns on 212 rushing carries. In January 2016, Michigan granted a transfer release to Green, allowing him to play for another program after graduating in the spring of 2016.\nHigh school career.\nGreen was born in February 1994 and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He played high school football at Hermitage High School. He began his football career as a \"chunky high school freshman\" and a 268-pound, 5 foot, 8 inch lineman. Over the next two years, he shed more than 50 pounds working on his diet along with his parents, Chris and Fran Green. By his junior year in 2011, Green had become one of the leading running backs in the country, rushing for over 1,500 yards and 20 touchdowns. Interviewed by ESPN in May 2012, Green described his running style as follows:\"I was always downhill. If you look at my film, I'm not really a bounce guy. I'm a one-cut-and-go, real straight, north-south runner and I have the speed to kick it up in sixth gear. All that bouncing and shaking, I wouldn't say that was me. If you're in the way, I'm going to blow you up. I'm not going to try to shake you. At my school, they call me 'The Freight Train.' I like that a lot. I'm going to run you over and let you know I'm here. I'm coming.\"\nAs a senior, he rushed for 1,350 yards and 21 touchdowns.\nRecruiting.\nGreen was one of the most highly recruited players in the Class of 2013 – the group of players graduating high school and entering college in the year 2013. Green was rated by Rivals.com and Scout.com as the No. 1 running back in the country and by Rivals.com as the No. 8 overall player in the Class of 2013. Rival.com recruiting analyst Josh Helmholt described Green as \"a downhill runner, a between-the-tackles guy.\"\nIn July 2012, Green attended The Opening (Nike Combine) in Beaverton, Oregon. By that time, he had received scholarship offers from 40 universities and had narrowed his list to 13 schools: Tennessee, Michigan, Oregon, Ohio State, Ole Miss, Virginia Tech, Auburn, Clemson, Alabama, Miami, Pitt, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma.\nIn mid-January 2013, Green announced that he had narrowed his choice to three schools – Auburn, Michigan and Tennessee. When Green called a press conference in late January 2013, it was web cast live by the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\". At the press conference, Green announced that he had verbally committed to play for the University of Michigan. He initially reached for a Michigan hat, then a Tennessee hat, and finally flipped a switch which prompted a screen to reveal a Michigan Wolverines football jersey.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nGreen was the highest-rated running back signed by Michigan since 2006. Tom Luginbill on ESPN called Green's commitment \"a defining moment for Michigan,\" noting that he \"fits with what Brady Hoke and the staff want not only the identity of the offense to be but the identity of their program – physical, grind it out, pound away at you over the course of four quarters, wear you down. Derrick Green can wear down an opponent. He is physical. He's explosive. ... This is a guy they can build what they want their offense to be about.\"\n2013 season.\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2013 season, ESPN rated Green as one of its five Big Ten Conference first-year players to watch, one its Top 10 future college football stars, and the running back on its pre-season freshman All-American team. Commentator Phil Steele even picked Green as his pre-season All-Big Ten running back. Others raised doubts as to whether Michigan head coach Brady Hoke would bench veteran Fitzgerald Toussaint in order to get Green into the lineup.\nDuring pre-season practice in August 2013, Green reported to camp at 240 pounds, raising questions about a 20-pound weight gain since his senior season in high school. Running backs coach Fred Jackson predicted he would be down to 230 pounds by the time the season started. Jackson dismissed concerns about Green's weight: \"He's going to be as advertised. ... He's a big guy. Look at him from the back and the side, he's a huge human being.\"\nAfter being held out of practice for a week following an undisclosed injury, Green found himself in competition with Fitzgerald Toussaint for the role as Michigan's No. 1 running back. Michigan offensive coordinator Al Borges described his approach to using Green: \"Teach him the run game and then teach him the pass game in pieces so you can then be functional as you go. You can play a freshman running back as long as you don't inundate him with so much information that it becomes disinformation, you know. But I've had a bunch of tailbacks come in and play as freshmen and didn't give them too much. But by the fifth, sixth game of the season, they could handle all of it. Very few could handle it in game one.\"\n2014 season.\nPrior to the start of the 2014 season, Green was in competition with De'Veon Smith to become the Wolverines' starter at running back.\nIn the opening game of the 2014 season, a 52–14 victory over Appalachian State, Green carried the ball 15 times for 170 yards, an average of 11.3 yards per carry. He also scored a touchdown and had a career-long run of 62 yards. De'Veon Smith also rushed for 115 yards in the game, as Green and Smith became the first pair of Michigan running backs to rush for over 100 yards in the same game since 2007.\nDuring the second week of the 2014 season, Green was held to 25 yards on 13 carries (1.9 yards per carry) in a 31–0 loss to Notre Dame. He rebounded in the third week of the season with 137 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries (6.2 yards per carry) in a 34–10 victory over Miami (Ohio). On October 4, 2014, in a game against Rutgers, Green broke his clavicle in the fourth quarter.\n2015 season.\nIn 12 games during the 2015 season, Green had 47 carries for 157 yards and two touchdowns. On January 15, 2016, Michigan announced that it had granted a transfer release to Green, allowing him to play for another program after graduating in the spring of 2016.\n2016 season.\nGreen transferred to TCU for the 2016 season. He played in 10 games, rushing 38 times for 141 yards and two touchdowns."

        "text": "Affiliated to the EHA, London GD Handball Club currently has 3 men's and 2 women's competitive handball teams in both the English National and Regional leagues, as well as a Youth Development Programme in place to generate Junior squads. The club which was formerly known as London Great Dane was founded in 1976.\nClub history.\nLondon GD Handball Club was previously known as Great Dane Handball Club, and was founded by Anne-Marie Thrysoe and Andrew Ferguson. Established in 1976 by a group of Danish girls involved with the Anglo-Danish Society Students Club, thereof the name of the club, \"Great Dane\".\nThroughout the years, the club established itself firmly on the English handball scene, and has become much more than a club with mainly Danish players. In 2010, in a bid to reflect this, the club changed its name to London GD Handball Club and at the same time registered as a limited company. The East London-based club currently has over 100 registered players from at least 20 different countries, and many more people training with the club regularly.\nThe club started playing handball as a women's team only, with men occasionally coming to practice. They started training two days a week at Ruislip Eagles Sport Centre but soon moved to the new (at the time) Wapping Sport Centre in East London. London GD's main home ground is now the Olympic Handball Arena, also known as \"Copper Box\", although Leyton Score Centre remains as training venue for developing teams.\nFrom 1976 to 1986, the club was heavily involved in the development of Handball in London with at one stage two sub venues spun off including Croydon and West London. The club also merged with another club at one stage run by Paul Bray.\nAround 1980, members of the club formed the Greater London &amp; South East Handball Association together with Ashford Tanners, Ruislip, Ipswich and other clubs in East London. The association is no longer active, but London GD is a member of the newly established London Handball Association that was set up in 2010.\nIn 2000, the back then called Great Danes started to get some success in both women's and men's handball and from then on the club has always been among the top three clubs in the country.\nIn 2005 the club participated in its first official European Competition by playing in round 2 of the men's Challenge Cup. Since then, London GD have participated every year.\nIn 2010, after winning their third Double (League and Cup Champions), the club's women's 1st team entered the Challenge Cup for the first time, managing an historic win against A.S. Aris Thessalonikis from Greece.\nThe 2010/11 season resulted in both league and cup victory for the men's team. This past September 2011 they have made history by winning their round 2 group in Malta to go through round 3 in Greece for the first time.\nFor the 2011/2012 season we entered two-second teams in the development leagues, both men and women, with the former winning the South Regional Championship.\nAfter the London 2012 Olympic Games, London GD men 1st team participated in the new EHF Cup against a giant Danish Club, KIF Kolding Kopenhagen, playing their two games at foreign ground.\nThis past season 2012/2013 London GD ladies won the EHA Cup against Thames Handball Club, and the club's men 1st team won the Super 8 English National League without losing any single game, giving them the unique slot for EHF Cup again, which saw them playing against a Turkish team from Ankara in September 2013.\nIndividual players' achievements.\nGreater-London and South-East Select Men's Team 1981.\nThorkild Hove and Paul Bray"

Also, the World Series Pre-Qualifier, which was a 12-team tournament contested as part of the 2013 Hong Kong Sevens, was folded into the Core Team Qualifier, which involved 12 teams and was entirely contested at the Hong Kong Sevens. The bottom-placed core team at the end of the season will now be automatically relegated, with no opportunity to retain core status.\nThe remaining three core teams for 2013–14 were determined in a two-stage qualifying process:\nStandings.\nThe final standings after completion of the nine tournaments of the series are shown in the table below.\nThe points awarded to teams at each tournament, as well as the overall season totals, are shown.

        "text": "The 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships was the seventh IPC Swimming World Championships, an international swimming competition, the biggest meet for athletes with a disability since the 2012 Summer Paralympics. It was held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and lasted from 12 to 18 August. Around 530 athletes competed from 57 different countries. The event was held in the Parc Jean Drapeau Aquatic Complex located at the Parc Jean-Drapeau in Montreal. 172 events were contested with 43 new world records set.\nVenue.\nThe Championship was staged at the Parc Jean Drapeau Aquatic Complex in the Parc Jean-Drapeau located in the east of Montreal. The complex contains three outdoor swimming pools, all renovated shortly before the staging of the competition.\nCoverage.\nAs with the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships, the IPC will continue to show live streaming of the evening finals on ParalympicSport.TV. In the United Kingdom Channel 4 continued their commitment to parasport with their own live streaming Paralympics website with pool-side commentary and a daily one-hour highlights television show the following morning on Channel 4. In Brazil coverage was provided by Globo-Sport TV while some European Broadcasting Union countries would also air the championships.\nEvents.\nClassification.\nAthletes are allocated a classification for each event based upon their disability to allow fairer competition between athletes of similar ability. The classifications for swimming are:\nClassifications run from S1 (severely disabled) to S10 (minimally disabled) for athletes with physical disabilities, and S11 (totally blind) to S13 (legally blind) for visually impaired athletes. Blind athletes must use blackened goggles.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table at the end of the championship.\nMultiple medallists.\nMany competitors won multiple medals at the 2013 Championships. The following athletes won five gold medals or more.\nHighlights.\nDay 1 (12 August).\nThe first medal of the 2013 World Championships was won by Ireland's Darragh McDonald who took gold in the 400m freestyle S6 class. The first world record of the games came much earlier in the day when at 9:18AM on only the fourth heat of the championships, Konstantin Lisenkov of Russia recorded a time of 1:04.12 to beat his own record set three years earlier in Eindhoven in the 100m backstroke S8. This was one of three world records to fall in the morning heats, the others going to Nely Miranda Herrera (Mexico) in the 50m Women's freestyle S4 and Olga Sviderska (Ukraine) in the Women's 200m freestyle S3.\nThe afternoon session witnessed five new world records. Ihar Boki of Belarus, one of the stand-out athletes of the championships, broke the world record in the final of the SM13 200m individual medley. Then within the hour two more records fell as Lisenkov's record in the 100m backstroke S8, set in the morning, failed to last a day as he took 0.70 seconds of his own time to secure gold; while Britain's Josef Craig added the World title of the 400m freestyle S7 to his Paralympic title with a winning time of 4:39.13. The final two new world records were set in the last three races of the day. New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe swam 1:00.15 in the 100m freestyle S10 while British athlete Jessica-Jane Applegate recorded a time of 2:09.88 in the 200m freestyle to just freeze out Ireland's Bethany Firth.\nOf the other medals, several of the big stars of the games took their first gold medals on the first day. Ukraine's Dmytro Vynohradets took the first of his seven gold medals with success in the Men's 200m freestyle S3, while his teammate Olga Sviderska took the equivalent title in the women's race but well outside her morning's record finish. Australia's Matthew Cowdrey picked up the first of five championship golds in the 100m freestyle S9 while the women's race Stephanie Millward of Britain secured the first of her four golds. New Zealand saw further success on Day one when Mary Fisher started her rung of gold medals with a win in the 100m backstroke S11. Brazil's Andre Brasil became a double Paralympic and World Champion taking the 100m Freestyle S10, a title he has held in those two world championships since 2008 in Beijing. The USA also achieved success on day one, collecting three medals from Roy Perkins (50m butterfly S5), Rebecca Anne Meyers (200m medley SM13) and Cortney Jordan (400m freestyle S7), though it was the Ukraine who topped the medal table at the day with six golds.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who agreed to participate in the Championships and the requested number of athlete places for each."

        "text": "The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi will be televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services will produce the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well, while in Australia, the 2014 Games were offered individually after all three major networks were unable to reach a deal for both.\nBroadcasters.\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a US$4.38 billion contract with NBC Sports, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020 (with broadcast rights to Sochi valued at US$775 million alone). As it did during the 2012 Summer Olympics (which brought strong viewership, and ultimately turned a profit of $88 million, unlike the previous Winter Olympics, which resulted in a loss of US$223 million), NBC offered live and tape-delayed coverage of events on television across its free-to-air network and a number of pay TV channels, and provided streaming of all events online and on mobile platforms to those who subscribe to the channels. ESPN and Fox Sports made competing bids for 2014 and 2016 Games only, but were outbid by NBC.\nIn Europe, sports marketing agency Sportfive replaced the European Broadcasting Union as the sales agency of broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics in 40 European countries. The IOC still separately negotiated broadcast rights in larger European countries such as the United Kingdom, where after uncertainty over whether rights to the Games could be picked up by a pay television broadcaster such as Sky Sports (but shared with a free-to-air broadcaster to comply with the laws forbidding certain major sporting events from being exclusively broadcast on pay channels), the BBC announced prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics that it would maintain exclusive rights to the Games through 2020.\nIn Australia, after several major commercial networks (among the only entities which can hold the rights due to similar anti-siphoning laws) pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns (which included Nine Network, who had lost AUD$22 million on its joint coverage of the 2012 Games with Foxtel, and Seven Network, whose bid was rejected for being lower than what Nine/Foxtel paid), the IOC awarded broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for AUD$20 million; a fraction of the amount paid by Nine and Foxtel for their own coverage.\nIn Canada, where the 2010 and 2012 Games were broadcast by a consortium of Bell Media and Rogers Media properties, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation announced in August 2012 that it had acquired the Canadian broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games, returning the Olympics to CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé for the first time since 2008. While financial details were not announced, the CBC did state that it was a \"financially and fiscally responsible bid\", which would carry on the organization's 60-year history of Olympic broadcasting. The CBC sub-licensed pay TV rights to TSN and Sportsnet (who served as the primary channels for pay TV coverage during the previous arrangement) in English, along with Réseau des sports and TVA Sports in French.\nIMG acquired the rights for in-flight and in-ship markets.\nNotes"

        "text": "Club Ferro Carril Oeste Basquet, or Ferro Basquet, is a professional basketball team based in Caballito, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is a part of the sports club Club Ferro Carril Oeste.\nThe club currently plays in Liga Nacional de Básquet, the top division of the Argentine basketball system. Ferro was the competition's first winner in 1985, with a total of 3 league titles won to date. It was also the first team to win two consecutive titles (1985–86), and the first Argentine team to become South American champion (in 1981). Besides, Ferro Carril Oeste is one of the three Argentine clubs to have played a final of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup (1986).\nHistory.\nThe club affiliated to Federación Argentina in 1921, playing in youth divisions. The first senior squad was formed in 1933, playing its first international v Uruguayan side Atenas de Montevideo. Ferro disaffiliated from the FAB in 1941, switching to recently founded \"Asociación Argentina de Básquet\" (AAB). Under the AAB, Ferro was runner-up in the 1956 Metropolitano, playing the final at Estadio Luna Park-\nIn 1968, Ferro was promoted to the first division of the Buenos Aires Basketball Association. In 1971 the club inaugurated its arena, \"Estadio Héctor Etchart\". In 1974, the two federations operating in Buenos Aires merged to form \"Federación Única\". By those times Ferro developed a strong rivalry with Obras Sanitarias. Coach León Najnudel arrived to the club in 1976. Under his leading and helped by notable players such as Miguel Cortijo, Ferro Carril Oeste achieved its first professional success, winning Torneo Metropolitano, Torneo Apertura and Torneo Oficial. The team also won the Campeonato Argentino de Clubes in 1981.\nFerro also became the first Argentine team to win the Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes (South American Club Championship) in 1981 and 1982, with the second title after beating Obras Sanitarias in the final. Najnudel left the club to coach Spanish team CB Zaragoza, being replaced by former player Luis Martínez. The international success continued in 1987, with Ferro winning another edition of the Sudamericano.\nWhen the top Liga Nacional de Básquet began in 1985, Ferro's main rival became Atenas de Córdoba. Ferro won the Argentine League championship in 1985 and 1986, finished 2nd in 1987, and also won it 1989. They also competed at the Club World Cup in 1981, 1986, and 1987, and they were that competition's runner-up in 1986.\nAt the end of 2003–04 season, Ferro was relegated to the Argentine second division, the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA). The team played there until 2015, when Ferro returned to LNB after Ciclista Juninense was relegated to TNA."

        "text": "Kim Min-goo (born June 24, 1991) is a South Korea retired professional basketball player. He previously played for Jeonju KCC Egis, Wonju DB Promy and Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus and represented South Korea at the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. At the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship in Manila, he was named to the tournament's All-Star Team.\nEarly life.\nA graduate of in Suwon, Kim was schoolmates with Lee Dae-sung and they led the team to success at the 2008 National High School Basketball Championship. During the final, Kim notably scored 14 points in the first quarter alone and then was sent-off later in the game for accumulated fouls.\nCollege career.\nKim was admitted into Kyung Hee University. Together with his contemporaries Kim Jong-kyu and future KBL MVP Doo Kyung-min, the trio led Kyung Hee to back-to-back sweeps of the regular season title, championship and MBC Cup and breaking the dominance of the traditional \"big three\" of college basketball (Yonsei University, Korea University and Chung-Ang University). He was named U League regular season MVP twice.\nKim became the team's starting guard leading his team to the championship finals of the newly-established U-League. As a sophomore during the 2011 season Kim averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 assists and 8.4 rebounds, often cited as the best guard in the college league. He was named the Regular Season MVP and helped his team win the national championship. As a junior during the 2012 season Kim averaged 22.6 points, 5.8 assists and 6.1 rebounds. He was named the Regular Season MVP for the second year in a row and helped his team win its second national championship. That season, he set the record for the most assists in a U-League game, with 17; the record was only broken in April 2021.\nProfessional career.\nJeonju KCC Egis (2013–2019).\nKim was the second overall pick in the 2013 KBL rookie draft while his Kyung Hee teammates Kim Jong-kyu and Doo Kyung-min were first and third, marking a rare occasion when the first three picks of the rookie draft were all from the same university and not from one of the \"big three\" college basketball programs. Having been dubbed the \"second Hur Jae\" in college, Kim was drafted by Jeonju KCC Egis, then coached by Hur. He made his league debut on October 26 against Seoul Samsung Thunders, putting up 12 points and 6 assists. Despite being a rookie, he quickly established himself as a main player in his team and averaged 13.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists.\nKim was injured in a car accident during the off-season, while with the national team, and he was in rehabilitation for over a year. Due to his absence, Jeonju KCC Egis signed another guard Kim Ji-hoo during the 2014 rookie draft to fill Kim's void. By the time Kim was able to return, he was regarded as surplus and sent to the D-League reserve team. Kim Ji-hoo establishing himself in the team and the signing of veteran guard Lee Jung-hyun in 2017 further limited his appearances. At the end of the 2018-19 season, he became a free agent but the lack of interest from other teams forced him to renegotiate his contract for a lowered salary. He was then traded to Wonju DB Promy for Park Ji-hoon.\nWonju DB Promy (2019–2020).\nKim joined Wonju DB Promy for the 2019-20 season, along with his university teammate Kim Jong-kyu. With Doo Kyung-min's discharge from the military in January, the former Kyung Hee University teammates were reunited in the same professional team for the first time.\nKim was expected to be a bench player but was given more playing time as the main shooting guards Heo Ung and were both injured. When Heo returned from injury, Kim formed a partnership with him as Wonju DB Promy topped the league rankings. Unfortunately, the 2019-20 season ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the results were forfeited.\nUlsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus (2020–2021).\nIn 2020 Kim signed a two-year contract with Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus, coached by Yoo Jae-hak whom he played under in the national team. At the end of the 2020-21 season, it was announced that he and the team mutually agreed to end his contract. While his physical condition was never the same after the 2014 accident, the announcement came as a surprise as he was still regarded as an important substitute player and expected to see out his contract. He revealed that his knee had \"reached its limit\", prompting him to consider retiring earlier than expected.\nNational team career.\nIn August 2011, Kim was selected for the South Korean collegiate national team to compete in the 2011 Summer Universiade. As a senior in 2013 Kim was selected for the South Korean national team to compete in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. During the competition Kim served as the backup shooting guard, manning the position when starter Cho Sung-Min was not in the game. However, Kim averaged 12.7 points, 2.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds in only 19.9 minutes per game, and topped the entire tournament with 25 three-point field goals made in nine games. Although Team Korea failed to win the championship. losing to the Philippines in the semifinal game, they clinched the slot for next year's FIBA World Cup defeating Chinese Taipei 75-57 in the third place game. In the semifinal game against the Philippines, Kim scored 27 points on 9-of-15 shooting overall and 5-of-11 from the three-point range. In the third-place game against Chinese Taipei, Kim led Team Korea with a game-high 21 points and shot 5-of-10 from the three-point range.\nControversy.\nOn June 7, 2014, Kim was injured in a car accident as a result of drunk driving. As his blood alcohol level was over the legal limit, his driving license was suspended. Additionally, the severity of his injuries meant that he was unable to participate in the Asian Games and World Cup and missed the entire 2014-15 season and much of the 2015-16 season. In September 2015, the KBL announced that since his playing career was still in limbo, he was given a warning instead of a suspension and ordered to complete 120 hours of community service. The news, coupled by Jeonju KCC Egis' lack of an official statement or apology, caused an uproar among sports fans who labeled his punishment as \"light\" compared to athletes from other sports who had committed the same offence, although conceding that his physical injuries was already a punishment itself. Nonetheless, Jeonju KCC Egis's management still faced criticism for failing to adequately address the issue."

        "text": "Charles Edward Cleveland (April 25, 1951 – December 22, 2012) was an American college basketball player, known for his standout career at the University of Alabama, where he was a three-time first team all-Southeastern Conference pick and led the Crimson Tide to the program's first NCAA tournament appearance.\nCleveland was a three sport star at Bibb County High School in Brent, Alabama. He was turned down an offer to play baseball from the Cincinnati Reds to pursue basketball at the University of Alabama. He played at Alabama for coach CM Newton, who would start five black players in a time of racial turbulence and progress. Center Leon Douglas said, \"We knew Coach Newton (signed us) because he wanted to win. He wasn't trying to be a trailblazer. You have to respect a man for putting five black starters on the court when others said it was a no-no.\" On December 28, 1973, in a 65-55 win at Louisville Cardinals men's basketball, Newton started Douglas, Charles \"Boonie\" Russell, Cleveland, T.R. Dunn and Ray Odums for the first all-black starting line-up in SEC history, and a team that would win the SEC season title.\nFor the Crimson Tide, Cleveland was a starter all three of his varsity seasons (freshmen were not eligible at this time). For his career, he became the first Alabama player in program history to be named first team all conference three times. In his senior season, Cleveland teamed with Leon Douglas and T. R. Dunn to lead the Tide to their first NCAA tournament berth.

Eaton's expected rival was defending champion and Eaton's Olympic runner up, American teammate Trey Hardee, who suffered from leg cramps and was only able to take slow, half-hearted attempts at the High Jump eventually no-heighting and dropping out.\nThe second day opened with Eaton beating the field in the 110 hurdles, opening up over 100 points on Nixon. Nixon's personal best was no match for Michael Schrader's personal best in the Discus as Schrader moved into second, with his German teammate Rico Freimuth and Damian Warner battling for third. Nixon fell out of contention. Eaton extended his lead with the third best pole vault of the day. Schrader scored big with his personal best in his lone attempt in the Javelin, but Eaton came through on his final throw to almost keep pace. Warner separated himself into a solid third with a personal best while Freimuth struggled with the poorest mark in the B group. The places were decided before the 1500, and in 80 percent humidity, there were no surprises.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\n100 metres.\nWind:Heat 1: -0.5 m/s, Heat 2: +0.1 m/s, Heat 3: -0.1 m/s, Heat 4: -0.5 m/s\n110 metres hurdles.\nWind:Heat 1: -0.2 m/s, Heat 2: 0 m/s, Heat 3: -0.1 m/s, Heat 4: +0.4 m/s\nFinal standings.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)"

By the time Natasha Hastings broke, she had a clear lead of more than 10 meters over the Tatyana Firova from Russia in second place. But after a 49.88 lap by Hastings (Firova obviously much faster than that), the Russian team had pulled even at the handoff. Kseniya Ryzhova went around the outside of Ashley Spencer and into the lead. Ryzhova opened up as much as a 2-meter lead, but by the home stretch, Spencer had gained that back and passed Ryzhova on the inside. But Ryzhova fought back to a slight lead. With the American team in second place coming off the turn, Francena McCorory was waiting in lane 2. Spencer had to cross behind Ryzhova to hand off. It was 400-meter bronze medalist Antonina Krivoshapka against 6th placer Francena McCorory, with Great Britain anchored by gold medalist Christine Ohuruogu a distant third. Krivoshapka opened up about a 5-meter lead on the back stretch, but McCorory looked to run within herself and came back to pass Krivoshapka on the home stretch. But Krivoshapka fought back, retaking the lead and holding it across the finish. Ohuruogu found herself challenged by Floria Gueï on the backstretch but ran away from her on the home stretch for a clear third place.\nIn 2016, Russia's anchor runner Antonina Krivoshapka's samples from the 2012 Olympics were retested and found to contain turinabol. In 2017 she was given a two-year ban including this race and Russia was disqualified. All teams advanced one place. The IAAF conducted the medal ceremony at the 2017 World Championships.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 2 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:30."

The British team seemed to be keeping up with the leaders, passing efficiently. At the second handoff, English Gardner seemed to leave even with Schillonie Calvert, while Alexandria Anderson had not arrived with the baton yet. Gardner had to come to a complete stop at the end of the zone to wait for the baton, finally resuming with a legal handoff in dead last place. Inside of USA, France was having similar difficulties with the baton. By the final handoff, Jamaica had an 8-meter lead on the second place Russian team, Gold medalist Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce on the anchor pulling away and victory assured. Jamaica dominated the race finishing with a championship record 41.29. Coming down the straight, Britain's Hayley Jones was swallowed up by France's Stella Akakpo, Germany's Verena Sailer and American Octavious Freeman speeding from the back trying to make up lost ground. Freeman was able to pass three teams in the last few steps but France beat USA to the line. The French relay team members were duly presented their silver medals during the medal ceremony. After the medal ceremony, the British team filed a protest against the French team, claiming that the latter had an out-of-zone baton handover between Ayodelé Ikuesan and Myriam Soumaré. More than two hours after the race, the French relay team was officially disqualified. The French delegation appealed against their disqualification, but it was in vain. Consequently, the American team was upgraded to the silver medal and the British team received the bronze medal. Bernard Amsalem, the president of the Fédération française d'athlétisme, called the French team's disqualification \"an outrage\". He explained that normally the decision to disqualify a team had to be made before the medal ceremony and teams had to file protests within thirty minutes from the end of the race. With this 4 × 100 m victory, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce became the first woman to win the sprint triple (100, 200, 4 × 100) at the World Athletics Championships\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 2 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18:10."

Saladuha's former Ukrainian teammate Hanna Knyazyeva-Minenko, now competing for Israel, suffered through two fouls before popping the No. 3 qualifier on her last attempt.\nIn the final, Saladuha took the first round lead, with Knyazyeva-Minenko leading a crowd of four hovering around 14.30. In the second round, the event was decided. First the home team's Ekaterina Koneva put one out at 14.81 to take the lead. Two jumps later, Ibargüen improved on her world leading jump of the year by going 14.85, just 4 cm further. Two jumps after that, Saladuha improved out to 14.65. That turned out to be it, but nobody knew it. Ibargüen continued with a 14.83 in the fourth round, which turned out to be the second best of the competition and watched nervously as Koneva tickled her best with a 14.79 in the fifth. But the lead held up and Ibargüen took home Colombia's first World Championship gold medal to go along with the bronzes she and racewalker Luis Lopez earned in Daegu.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 14.30 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 19:40."

In the final, six competitors cleared 1.97, world leader and Olympic silver medalist Brigetta Barrett, Olympic gold medalist and defending champion Anna Chicherova, and European indoor champion Ruth Beitia still perfect. But at 2.00, only Barrett and Olympic bronze medalist Svetlana Shkolina made it, both on the first attempt, giving Barrett the lead and leaving Chicherova and Beitia tied for bronze. At 2.03, Shkolina reversed that position with a first attempt clearance. Barrett had no answer.\nThe answer came in February 2019 when Shkolina was handed a four-year ban for doping, retroactive to 2012, disqualifying her gold medal.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 1.95 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18:00."

He is known for his college career at Georgetown University, where he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine after helping the Hoyas to the 1984 NCAA championship.\nGraham, a 6'9\" power forward from Spingarn High School in Washington, D.C., signed with future Hall of Fame coach John Thompson at Georgetown. As a freshman in 1983–84, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas. He provided rugged defense and rebounding, appearing in all but two of the team's 37 games – starting 17. While his regular season statistics were pedestrian, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas in their quest for a national championship. In the 1984 Final Four, Graham scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and led the Hoyas to a victory over the Houston Cougars for the national championship. In the championship game, Graham scored 14 points on 7–9 shooting and was one of two Georgetown players to be named to the All-Final Four team along with Most Outstanding Player Patrick Ewing. Following the championship win, Graham – whose fiery demeanor and shaved head were seen as personifying the Hoyas' aggressive playing style – appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine.\nFollowing the championship season, Graham had academic difficulties and was suspended from the Georgetown team. He ultimately transferred to the University of the District of Columbia in an attempt to play Division II basketball, but ultimately declared for the 1986 NBA draft without playing a game for the Firebirds.\nGraham was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the fourth round of the draft (76th pick overall), but did not make the Sonics' final roster. He played several seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), for the Albany Patroons, Charleston Gunners, Wyoming Wildcatters, Rochester Flyers, Tulsa Fast Breakers and Columbus Horizon. In his four CBA seasons, Graham averaged 7.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. Graham also played in Europe and South America."

Before becoming the head coach at Canisius, he was the head coach at Niagara from 2002–2004, and an assistant at several NCAA Division I programs from 1996–2001.\nMcRae attended Division III Colby College in Waterville, Maine. He played four seasons of baseball and one season of ice hockey for the Mules.\nCoaching career.\nDivision I assistant.\nAfter starting a club baseball team at Brock University in Ontario, Canada and coaching it for the 1995 season, McRae got his first NCAA coaching job as an assistant at Niagara. He coached there from 1996–1997, and Niagara won a MAAC North Division championship in his second season. In 1998, he was an assistant at Winthrop in Rock Hill, South Carolina, before returning to the northeast to become an assistant at Maine from 1999–2001.\nNiagara.\nOn July 3, 2001, McRae was named head coach at Niagara, where he attended graduate school. In comments on his reasons for accepting the job, McRae said, \"One, my aspirations to become a head coach, and there aren't that many Division I openings that come up each year. Also, it's near home and it gives me a chance to see friends and family again. And my wife is from that area as well.\"\nMcRae was the head coach at Niagara for three seasons (2002–2004). In his first season, the team finished in 8th place in the MAAC. In both his second and third, Niagara qualified for the MAAC tournament by finishing the regular season in the top four of the conference. Both teams won 16 conference games, then a program record. In 2003, McRae was named the MAAC Coach of the Year.\nCanisius.\nFollowing the 2004 season, McRae became the head coach at Canisius. In the three seasons prior to McRae's hiring (2002–2004), Canisius's record was 12–119.\nIn his first two seasons, Canisius finished with a sub-.500 conference winning percentage and did not qualify for the postseason. In 2007, the team finished fourth in the MAAC to qualify for the program's first MAAC tournament since 1994. It went 0–2 in the tournament.\nIn 2008, Canisius went 41–13 and finished tied for first in the MAAC. The team finished third at the MAAC Tournament, but got the program's first postseason win, 16–7 over Manhattan in an elimination game. McRae won his second MAAC Coach of the Year Award. After finishing second in 2009, the team won the MAAC outright in 2010. The team lost in the MAAC championship game, and McRae won his third MAAC Coach of the Year Award. Canisius qualified for the 2011 and 2012 MAAC Tournaments, and it lost in the championship round again in 2012. It started the tournament with two wins, but lost two extra-inning games to Manhattan in the championship round.\nIn the 2013 season, McRae's team set a program record for wins by going 42–17. McRae won his 300th game as a head coach on March 16, when Canisius defeated Ohio, 16–8. The team finished tied for third in the MAAC to qualify for its seventh consecutive MAAC Tournament. As the third seed in the tournament, Canisius started off 2–0 by defeating second-seeded Marist, 2–1, and first-seeded Rider, 18–7. In the championship round, the team defeated fourth-seeded Siena, 12–11, to advance to the 2013 NCAA tournament. Canisius was seeded fourth in the Chapel Hill Regional, hosted by #1 national seed North Carolina. The team went 0–2 in the regional, losing 6–3 to North Carolina in the opening game and 14–6 to second-seeded Florida Atlantic in an elimination game.\nIn 2014, Canisius finished the season 40–16 and won the MAAC regular season title. In the MAAC Tournament, the team won its first two games but lost twice to Siena in the championship round.\nSeven of McRae's players at Canisius have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, most recently Garrett Cortright in 2013. Sean Jamieson, taken in the 17th round in 2011, is Canisius's highest overall pick under McRae.\nVCU.\nMcRae was named an assistant baseball coach at Virginia Commonwealth University on September 1, 2017.\nWilliam &amp; Mary.\nMcRae was named as the 53rd head coach in William &amp; Mary's history by athletic director Brian Mann on the afternoon of October 27, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nMcRae has two teenage children, Madison and Mason.

        "title": "World Bowling Singles Championships",
        "text": "The World Bowling Singles Championships is a Ten-pin bowling event open to members of World Bowling. This gives World Bowling a World Championship event every year, filling a void left from previous years. Each member federation can send up to two men and two women to compete. The event is split up into two separate tournaments, one for men and one for women.\nEvent Details and history.\nThe first WB Singles Championships was held on September 18–26, 2012 in Limassol, Cyprus at the Galactica Bowling Center and subsequently will be held every four years. The second edition was held December 2–9, 2016 at Qatar Bowling Center in Doha. The third edition was to be held at South Point Tournament Bowling Plaza in Las Vegas, United States in 2020. On March 9, 2020, World Bowling and QubicaAMF announced a merger of the World Singles Championships and the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup into one annual event, to be continued to be called the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup from 2020 onwards\nFormat.\nIn the 2012 WB Singles Championships, each bowler (men and women) bowled 12 games of qualifying split into two six game blocks. The top 24 men and women, by total pinfall, advanced to single-elimination match play. The first round of match play consisted of bowlers who qualified 9th to 24th. The second round of match play consisted of the first round winners and bowlers who qualified 1st to 8th who received a first round bye. Quarterfinals consisted of second round winners. First round, second round, and quarterfinals were best of five game matches. Quarterfinal winners advanced to the semi-finals, which were one game matches. Semi-final winners advanced to the finals, while semifinal losers receive a bronze medal. The finals is a one-game match to determine the gold medalist and the silver medalist for both the men and women.\nFor the 2016 WB Singles Championships, WB announced changes to the qualifying round and the final rounds. The qualifying rounds are still 12 games, but now split into three four game blocks. The top 32 men and women, by total pinfall, advanced to the next round. Instead of single-elimination match play, the next round has 32 bowlers (men and women) divided into four groups of eight bowlers bowling eight games starting from scratch. Each of the eight games is a match between all the bowlers in the group, with the bowler who had the highest score receiving seven points, second highest score receiving six points all the way to zero points for the lowest score in the game. The two bowlers with the highest number of points after eight games from each of the four groups will advance to play in one group of eight bowlers with a similar format from the previous round. After eight games in the final group, the top 4 point scorers will advance to the semi-finals. The semi-finals are one-game matches, no. 1 point scorer vs no. 4 point scorer and no. 2 point scorer vs no. 3 point scorer. The semi-final winners advance to the final, while the semi-final losers receive a bronze medal. The finals, also one-game matches, determines the gold and silver medalists.\nLane Pattern.\nAll games in WB Singles Championships are played on one lane condition. In 2012, a medium pattern of 41 feet was used. In 2016, a medium pattern of 40 feet was chosen."

        "title": "Super Bowl LII",
        "text": "Super Bowl LII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) and defending Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots, 41–33, to win their first Super Bowl and their first NFL title since 1960, and make the NFC East the first and currently only division where every team has won a Super Bowl. The game was played on February 4, 2018, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This was the second time that a Super Bowl was played in Minneapolis, the northernmost city to ever host the event, after Super Bowl XXVI at the Metrodome during the 1991 season. It was also the sixth Super Bowl held in a cold-weather city, although the stadium is indoors.\nNew England finished the regular season with an AFC-best 13–3 record, then extended their record Super Bowl appearances to ten, their third in four years, and their eighth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and MVP quarterback Tom Brady. Philadelphia also finished the regular season with an NFC-best 13–3 record but entered the playoffs as underdogs after starting quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a season-ending injury late in the regular season; prior to his injury, Wentz was the media and fan favorite to win MVP after leading his team to an 11–2 start. Backup quarterback Nick Foles was the Eagles' starting quarterback for the rest of the season. With Foles, the Eagles advanced to their third Super Bowl appearance, having previously lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV and to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX.\nSeveral records were set during Super Bowl LII, including most yards gained in any NFL game by both teams combined (1,151) and fewest punts from both teams in a Super Bowl (one). The game was settled after the Eagles converted a fumble recovery deep within Patriots territory to a field goal with 1:05 remaining to extend their lead to eight points, and Brady's Hail Mary pass fell incomplete as time expired. Foles, who completed 28 of 43 pass attempts for 373 yards and three touchdowns with one interception, and also caught a one-yard touchdown pass on a trick play, was named Super Bowl MVP. Foles' touchdown catch later became known as the Philly Special and joined NFL lore alongside his unexpected performance.\nWith the loss, the Patriots became the fifth defending Super Bowl champions to lose in the following year's title game, after the 1978 Dallas Cowboys, the 1983 Washington Redskins, the 1997 Green Bay Packers, and the 2014 Seattle Seahawks. They would later be joined by the 2020 Kansas City Chiefs.\nThe broadcast of the game on NBC had the smallest Super Bowl audience in nine years, with an average of 103.4 million viewers. Average television viewership for the halftime show, headlined by Justin Timberlake, was 106.6 million American television viewers, 9 percent less than the previous year. This was the most recent Super Bowl to date where both teams attained at least one score each quarter until 2023, a Super Bowl which also involved the Eagles. The game is also considered one of the greatest Super Bowl games of all time.\nEagles head coach Doug Pederson's game plan, which was filled with over a dozen short-yardage plays, led to the Eagles going two-for-two on fourth down conversions and is regarded as highly influential in professional football. Fourth down conversion attempts in the NFL increased as a whole nearly 64% from 2017 to 2021.\nBackground.\nHost-city selection.\nOn October 8, 2013, the league announced that three venues were vying to host Super Bowl LII:\nOn May 20, 2014, the league's owners picked Minneapolis at their meeting in Atlanta, Georgia.\nTeams.\nThe NFC was represented by the number-one playoff seed Philadelphia Eagles, while the AFC was represented by the number-one playoff seed New England Patriots, marking the fourth time in the previous five years that the Super Bowl had featured the top team from each conference.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nThe Eagles finished the regular season with a record of 13–3, the same as New England, Minnesota, and Pittsburgh, but the various tie-breaking provisions gave them the NFC's top seed in the 2017–18 NFL playoffs. It was a substantial improvement for the team under second-year head coach Doug Pederson; the Eagles finished the previous season with a 7–9 record. In the 2017 season, the team scored 457 points (third in the NFL), while giving up just 295 (fourth) points.\nThe offense was led by Pro Bowl quarterback Carson Wentz. In just his second season, he recorded a passer rating of 101.9, throwing for 3,296 yards and 33 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions. His top target was Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz, who caught 74 passes for 824 yards and eight touchdowns. Other contributors were two receivers acquired from off-season free agency: Alshon Jeffery, who caught 57 passes for 789 yards and nine scores; and Torrey Smith, who had 36 receptions for 430 yards. Meanwhile, third-year receiver Nelson Agholor had the best season of his career, hauling in 62 passes for 768 yards and eight touchdowns, a higher total in each category than in his previous two seasons combined. The Eagles rushing attack also benefited from two recently acquired players, LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi. Blount, an off-season signing who won a Super Bowl with the Patriots, gained 776 rushing yards and two touchdowns, while Ajayi, picked up by a mid-season trade with the Miami Dolphins, rushed for 873 yards and caught 24 passes for 154 yards combined with the two teams. Philadelphia also had a superb offensive line, led by two Pro Bowl selections: Tackle Lane Johnson and Guard Brandon Brooks, along with all pro center Jason Kelce.\nThe Eagles defense allowed the fourth-fewest yards in the league (4,904). Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox made the Pro Bowl for the third time in his career, recording 5 sacks and two fumble recoveries, and he had plenty of help around him, such as former Patriots defensive end Chris Long, who had five sacks and forced four fumbles, and defensive end Brandon Graham, who led the team with 9 sacks. Middle linebacker Nigel Bradham led the team in combined tackles with 88. The Eagles secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Malcolm Jenkins, who had 76 combined tackles and two interceptions, along with cornerback Patrick Robinson, who led the team with four interceptions.\nPhiladelphia had stormed to the top of the NFC by winning 10 of their first 12 games, but suffered a major setback on December 10, when Wentz went down with a season-ending ACL tear and was replaced by journeyman backup quarterback Nick Foles, who was playing for his third team in as many years and his second stint with the Eagles. After Wentz's injury, many analysts wrote off the remainder of the Eagles' season as they believed they would not recover from his loss. Surprising analysts, Foles was able to lead the team to victory in that game, as well as the next two. The Eagles rested Foles and were led by third-string quarterback Nate Sudfeld for their meaningless game against the Cowboys in Week 17, a game they lost, but in the Eagles' two playoff games, Foles threw for a combined total of 598 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, replicating the excellent performance of Wentz to carry the Eagles to the NFC title. The Eagles were not favored to win in any of their 2018 playoff games including Super Bowl LII, and became the first number one seed to be an underdog in a Divisional Playoff game since seeding began in 1975. The team embraced their role as underdogs and were frequently seen wearing dog masks after each playoff victory as were their fans.\nNew England Patriots.\nThe Patriots entered the 2017 NFL season as defending Super Bowl champions. For the 16th time in their 18 seasons under head coach Bill Belichick, they recorded a double-digit win season, finishing the regular season with a record of 13–3 and, by virtue of tie-breaking procedures, earning the AFC's number one overall seed. The previous season's top wide receiver Julian Edelman went down in the preseason with a season-ending injury. Early season defensive struggles left the team with a 2–2 record after four weeks, and the worst overall defense in the league at that point. The defense came together as a unit, and tightened up over the rest of the season however, with the Patriots going 11–1 after week 4. Their sole loss in the latter part of the season came in Week 14 to the Miami Dolphins, a division rival, though they were without star tight end Rob Gronkowski due to a one-game suspension for an unnecessary roughness call the prior week. The Patriots' defense was improved by several late-season free-agent signings, including Eric Lee, a defensive end, previously from the Buffalo Bills, whom the Patriots signed in Week 12, and James Harrison, a perennial All-Pro for the Pittsburgh Steelers, whom the Patriots picked up off waivers after Christmas. In just six games for New England, Lee recorded 3 sacks, a safety, and an interception. In his only regular season game with the Patriots, Harrison recorded two sacks.\nDuring the regular season, New England's offense led the league in yards gained (6,307) and ranked second in points scored (458). The 40-year-old Brady finished his 18th season with a league-leading 4,577 passing yards, 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions, earning him his 13th selection to the Pro Bowl and his third league MVP award. One change that helped make up for the loss of Edelman was the acquisition of receiver Brandin Cooks, who caught 65 passes for 1,082 yards and seven touchdowns. Brady was also aided by the healthy return of Gronkowski, who had played just eight games in the previous season, finishing this year with 69 catches for 1,084 yards and eight scores. Receiver Danny Amendola added 61 receptions for 659 yards, as well as another 240 yards returning punts. With the loss of their previous season's rushing leader LeGarrette Blount to free agency, Dion Lewis stepped up to take the lead, rushing for 896 yards and six touchdowns despite starting only eight games. He also caught 32 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns and added 570 yards and another touchdown returning kickoffs. Rex Burkhead chipped in 518 all-purpose yards, 30 receptions, and eight touchdowns. In passing situations, the team relied heavily on running back James White, who caught 56 passes for 429 yards and rushed for 171 on the ground. These backs were aided by the blocking of fullback James Develin, who earned his first Pro Bowl selection. On special teams, kicker Stephen Gostkowski ranked second in the NFL with 156 points and fourth in field goals made with 37, while veteran special team ace Matthew Slater earned his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl selection.\nThe Patriots' defense ranked only 29th in yards allowed (5,856), but ranked fifth in fewest points, giving up only 296. Defensive end Trey Flowers led the team with 6 sacks while also forcing two fumbles. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy had 73 tackles and 5 sacks. The Patriots also had a superb secondary, led by cornerbacks Malcolm Butler (two interceptions, three forced fumbles) and Stephon Gilmore (two interceptions, 47 solo tackles), as well as safeties Devin McCourty (97 combined tackles, one interception, one fumble recovery), Patrick Chung (84 tackles, one interception, two fumble recoveries) and Duron Harmon (four interceptions).\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, the Patriots earned a first-round bye and home-field advantage due to their status as the AFC's first overall seed. In the divisional round, they defeated the Tennessee Titans 35–14, as Brady passed for 337 yards and three touchdowns. In that game, the defense amassed eight quarterback sacks of Marcus Mariota and held the Titans' running game to 65 yards rushing. They then defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 24–20 in the AFC Championship Game, rallying from behind to win the game after the Jaguars jumped out to an early 14–3 lead and whose league-best defense stymied Brady and the rest of the offense for most of the first half. Down 20–10 in the fourth quarter, the Patriots' comeback was sealed by two Brady-led drives, both resulting in touchdown passes to Danny Amendola, as well as a key defensive stop by Stephon Gilmore, whose acrobatic block of a Blake Bortles pass ended Jacksonville's last chance to score. Rob Gronkowski was injured in the game with a concussion, leaving his status for the Super Bowl in doubt. Amendola was the breakout star for the Patriots during their two playoff wins, leading the team with 196 receiving yards, and serving as Brady's primary target.\nPhiladelphia also earned a first-round bye and home-field advantage as the NFC's first overall seed. They started off the divisional round by narrowly defeating the Atlanta Falcons 15–10, stopping the Falcons on four consecutive plays after the Falcons had a first-down-and-goal situation on the Eagles' 9-yard line during their final drive. They then soundly defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38–7 in the NFC Championship Game. Despite the Vikings scoring on their opening drive, the Eagles' defense held them to three punts, two turnovers on downs, two interceptions, and one lost fumble in their remaining drives of the game. Meanwhile, Foles had a great game, in which he completed 26 of 33 passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns.\nPre-game notes.\nThis game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX. Only one player, Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady, remained on either roster from that contest. Bill Belichick, the Patriots' head coach in that contest, also remained in that position. Two Eagles, running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive lineman Chris Long, had been Patriots in 2017's Super Bowl LI. The Eagles were 1–4 against the Brady/Belichick era Patriots prior to this game (preseason notwithstanding), including Super Bowl XXXIX, their one win being a 35–28 win at Gillette Stadium in December during their relatively weak 2015 season, where after falling behind 14–0, they proceeded to rally for 35 points and hold them down to only two more touchdowns on their end to win, allowing them to finally get their first revenge for eleven years prior.\nThe Patriots were the designated home team for Super Bowl LII, because the AFC team is the designated home team in even-numbered years and the NFC team in odd-numbered years. As the designated home team, the Patriots chose to wear their road white jerseys with navy blue pants, becoming the sixth team to wear their white jerseys as the home team and the third team to wear white in back-to-back Super Bowls, following the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls XII and XIII and again in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII. The Eagles therefore wore their standard home uniform of midnight green jerseys with white pants; the same two uniforms were worn when they faced off in Super Bowl XXXIX, but with the Eagles as the \"home\" team. Twelve of the previous 13 Super Bowls had been won by teams wearing white jerseys. The last team to win a Super Bowl while wearing their home uniforms was the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV (who, coincidentally, had also worn green jerseys).\nGambling establishments had the Patriots as 5 ½ point favorites and projected 47 ½ points scored.\nOperations.\nTo coordinate the game and 10 days of events, the National Football League temporarily operated an events office within the Minnesota Vikings office building next to U.S. Bank Stadium. More than 150,000 visitors were expected to attend events associated with the Super Bowl over ten days. Among them were some 5,000-plus media members; media day events and press conferences were held at The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.\nNo sales tax was collected on admission tickets to the game and related events, including parking.\nTo increase security around U.S. Bank Stadium, the stadium's light rail station was shut down for 48 hours before the game, and a nearby homeless shelter was temporarily moved beyond the security perimeter. The Blue Line of the light rail system was only open to ticketholders and passengers with a Gameday Pass, while the Green Line only ran to Stadium Village station on the University of Minnesota campus before continuing on with restricted access. Metro Transit ran shuttle buses between light rail stations, as well as regular bus service was moved for several weeks due to street closures. Thirty activist groups organized a rally and protest against police brutality, corporate greed, and racist practices. 17 people blocked the Green Line train for 90 minutes before the game, and 200 protesters blocked an entrance to the stadium's security perimeter.\nUnder a 1998 agreement, the Patriots and Eagles owners split the tickets, and the league controlled the game presentation and entertainment in the stadium. The Patriots practiced at the Minnesota Vikings facilities in Eden Prairie while the Eagles used the University of Minnesota. The Eagles got the Vikings' locker room and sideline. The Vikings had advanced to the NFC Championship Game before losing to the Eagles; until that point, the possibility of the Vikings advancing to the Super Bowl and thus becoming the first team to play the game in its home stadium was plausible. Had that happened, the Vikings would have used their own locker rooms and training facilities, while the AFC champion would have used the University of Minnesota.\nAssociated events.\nThe Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee presented \"Super Bowl Live\" on Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis. This ten-day free festival and concert series featured Sheila E., The Revolution, Morris Day and The Time, and The New Power Generation, musicians from Minnesota who collaborated with Prince, a Minneapolis native. Produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"Super Bowl Live\" also included performances by Idina Menzel, Soul Asylum, the Suburbs, Bob Mould, Sounds of Blackness, Dessa, VocalEssence, Mint Condition, and the Jets. In addition to the concert series, \"Super Bowl Live\" featured a American Birkebeiner International Bridge on Nicollet Mall to showcase cross-country skiing, skijoring, fat-tire bicycle racing, and snow tubing demonstrations. There was also a snowmobile stunt show on February 3.\nThe NFL presented the \"Super Bowl Experience\" at the Minneapolis Convention Center from January 27 to February 3 with an entrance fee. Kelly Clarkson performed at the Minneapolis Armory and a U.S. Bank Stadium lounge on the day of the Super Bowl.\nThe Minneapolis Armory also hosted Jennifer Lopez, Imagine Dragons, and Pink concerts close to U.S. Bank Stadium. Pink also performed the national anthem before the Super Bowl. Halftime performer Justin Timberlake held a ticketed \"listening session\" of his newest album at Prince's Paisley Park. Dave Matthews Band performed at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community's Mystic Lake Casino hosted Gwen Stefani, the Chainsmokers, Florida Georgia Line, and Kygo. Planners originally scheduled a traveling nightclub for 9500 people, but cancelled, moving its concerts into the main casino. Ellie Goulding's appearance with Kygo was cancelled at the same time. The Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake, Minnesota, has the second-largest hotel in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and Prior Lake hosted Super Bowl-week events including winter activities, a hotdish competition, and fundraisers.\nOther events were held at the Mall of America (including Radio Row as a home for national shows), Saint Paul's RiverCentre and Xcel Energy Center, the Minnesota Vikings' Winter Park location in Eden Prairie, and the University of Minnesota. \"Taste of the NFL\" is a fundraiser for food banks and was held in Saint Paul. Minneapolis also offered a temporary zip-line across the Mississippi River near downtown. The Luminary Loppet around Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis featured fire dancing, an ice pyramid, and luminary candles at night.\nThe 2018 Saint Paul Winter Carnival took place leading up to, during and after the Super Bowl. Carnival organizers built a large ice palace to coincide with the Super Bowl festivities, as with Super Bowl XXVI in 1992. The ice palace was planned, cancelled for lack of funds, then re-announced with sponsors. Events in Saint Paul also included an extreme sports demonstration, a \"giant slide\", and a block party. Officials in the capital city hoped to attract Minneapolis Super Bowl visitors. The Minneapolis Institute of Art had a free , ice maze.\nThe Great Northern was a winter festival in the Twin Cities from January 25 to February 4 that included the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, an ice bar, and an \"urban ski competition\".\nESPN broadcast its studio programming from the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis, while Golf Channel (a sister network of Super Bowl LII broadcaster NBC) aired two live episodes of David Feherty's eponymous interview show from the State Theatre.\nNative American communities of Minnesota performed nightly drum ceremonies. Various drumlines from around the state performed at different locations throughout the day.\nMarketing.\nThe slogan \"Bold North\" was developed by the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee to promote Super Bowl LII and its surrounding festivities. The slogan was intended to represent an embrace of the region's climate as part of its identity, and was used on merchandise and by the host committee's official sponsors. The NFL unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LII (a cerulean-colored version of a standardized design) prior to Super Bowl LI, and the official branding elements and secondary logo in October 2017—featuring blue and purple aurora motifs.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nNBC broadcast Super Bowl LII as part of an annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. This would be the first time NBC aired the Super Bowl in the same year that it aired the Winter Olympics. The network was then scheduled to broadcast Super Bowl LV in February 2021, their next scheduled Super Bowl at the time, but NBC eventually traded its broadcasting rights to CBS in exchange for February 2022's Super Bowl LVI to avoid having NBC Olympic broadcasts become Super Bowl counterprogramming. The NFL then assigned all subsequent Super Bowls in Winter Olympics years to NBC or any network that airs the Winter Olympics.\nPlay-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color analyst Cris Collinsworth called the game. Dan Patrick and Liam McHugh served as the lead hosts for NBC's pre-game coverage. Mike Tirico, who replaced the retiring Bob Costas in 2017 as NBC's lead studio host for both the NFL and the Olympic Games, did not participate in coverage of Super Bowl LII due to his commitments to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea (which opened on the Friday following the game).\nNBC employed 73 cameras within the stadium, and introduced \"volumetric-AR\" graphics featuring 3D body scanning of players, and a new on-air graphics package to be used exclusively for \"Sunday Night Football\" going forward.\nSister cable network Universo carried a full Spanish language broadcast produced by Telemundo Deportes, with Edgar Lopez and Rene Giraldo. The Universo Spanish audio was also available on NBC through the SAP channel, where available.\nAs NBC Sports Regional Networks operates regional sports networks in the markets of both teams which participated, the NBC Sports Boston and NBC Sports Philadelphia channels were used to provide additional coverage of the game from a local perspective. Both networks aired coverage from Minneapolis, including specials focusing on their respective teams, and a jointly-produced pre-game show aired by both channels.\nNielsen reported a 47.4/70% overnight rating in metered markets, peaking at 52.2/74 during the fourth quarter. These numbers are about 3% lower than early numbers from Super Bowl LI, and the lowest since Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.\nAdvertising.\nDan Lovinger, NBC Sports Group executive vice president of ad sales, stated to \"Variety\" in July 2017 that the network was seeking a price \"north of $5 million\" (the price set for the previous two Super Bowls) for a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LII. As they began five days after the Super Bowl, NBC offered advertising packages that covered both Super Bowl LII and the 2018 Winter Olympics (which marked the first time since 1992 that a single broadcast network had aired both the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics in the same year); the network estimated that it would bring in at least $1 billion in advertising revenue from the two events. During the second quarter, an equipment failure caused NBC's broadcast to experience dead air for 30 seconds during a commercial break. No actual commercial time was lost.\nAdvertisements for Tide detergent featuring David Harbour of Stranger Things created a recurring theme, appearing in each quarter, often disguised as well-known commercials for other products, with Harbour eventually declaring \"It's a Tide ad.\" Anheuser-Busch has, as it has done in previous Super Bowls, purchased multiple commercials in the game, advertising Bud Light, Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra. For the first time since Super Bowl VIII, the company reduced the appearances of the Budweiser Clydesdales in a Super Bowl commercial, with the 60-second Budweiser commercial for this event instead focusing on a Budweiser factory plant in Georgia distributing water, referencing the beer maker's efforts to distribute water to families of victims affected by natural disasters, such as wildfires and hurricanes. However, a Clydesdale was featured in a commercial for Tide detergent and the Budweiser Clydesdales only appeared in a five-second Budweiser commercial to remind viewers of the \"ClydesdaleCam\" livestream event. Other signed advertisers included The Coca-Cola Company and Avocados from Mexico. Cellphone carrier T-Mobile aired a minute long ad with actress Kerry Washington narrating, featuring babies of various ethnic backgrounds. The commercial also features Nirvana's song \"All Apologies\" played as a lullaby. In the ad, Washington talks about the babies being born with natural instincts of love and not racism calling them \"unstoppable\" and that they will demand fair and equal pay. T-Mobile CEO John Legere posted to his Twitter account afterwards saying, \"This year, we wanted to use our #SuperBowl airtime to share that @TMobile believes we all started in the same place. We are more alike than different. And we are unstoppable.\"\nFiat Chrysler subsidiary Ram Trucks was met with criticism over its ad \"Built to Serve\", which featured an excerpt from Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Drum Major Instinct\" sermon on the virtues of serving others (February 4, 2018, was also the 50th anniversary of the sermon). The ad was considered an exploitation of King's words to sell a product, with media outlets noting that the sermon in the ad went on to specifically criticize advertisers (including automobile manufacturers) for being \"gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion\".\nLead-out programs.\nNBC's lead-out program was an episode of \"This Is Us\", titled \"Super Bowl Sunday\", alongside a special episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" from Minneapolis' Orpheum Theatre, with halftime performer Justin Timberlake, Dwayne Johnson, Chris Stapleton and the cast of \"This Is Us\" as guests.\nIn a surprise move, Netflix used its advertising time to announce that \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" — the third film in the \"Cloverfield\" series — would be available for streaming on the service immediately after the game, potentially undercutting viewership of the lucrative post-game slot on NBC.\nStreaming.\nOnline streams of the NBC broadcast were available on NBCSports.com, the NBC Sports app for mobile devices, tablets, connected-TV devices, and NBC.com without any required login. The Spanish-language broadcast was available on the Telemundo Deportes En Vivo app and TelemundoDeportes.com for desktop devices, connected TV devices, and tablets but not mobile devices.\nUnder new digital rights deals that began with the 2017–18 playoffs, Verizon still offered mobile streaming of games, but no longer held exclusive rights to stream NFL games on smartphones or make them exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers. Instead, Verizon elected to use the deal to bolster its recent acquisition of Yahoo!; on January 9, 2018, Verizon announced that it would host streams of playoff games through the Yahoo! Sports and go90 app, including Super Bowl LII. As a result of the deal, the online stream was available to viewers on all Internet devices for the first time, regardless of network (because of Verizon's previous exclusive rights deal, non-Verizon phones had previously been blocked from receiving any NFL telecasts, regardless of source). The game was also available through the NFL Mobile app with the aforementioned change to viewing through the app now being allowed on all mobile carriers.\nRadio.\nThis was the last game in Westwood One's national radio contract with the NFL before a quiet renewal on undermined terms after the season and Cumulus exited a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing made just before the Super Bowl. Each participating team's flagship station (the Patriots Radio Network's WBZ-FM/Boston, and the Eagles Radio Network's WIP-FM/Philadelphia, along with WEMG/Camden, New Jersey for Spanish play-by-play) carried the game with local announcers. For the second consecutive year, none of the local flagships were clear-channel stations, and thus the local commentators were only audible for free within each respective team's immediate metropolitan area; listeners outside the flagship stations' broadcast ranges were required to subscribe to Sirius XM Radio or TuneIn Premium to access the local broadcasts. Under the terms of the Westwood One contract, any radio station that was not a local flagship, if it carried the game, was required to utilize the Westwood One feed. It was the first title win called by Eagles play-by-play announcer Merrill Reese, who has been the primary radio voice of the team since 1977.\nEntertainment.\nPre-game.\nThe Super Bowl flyover was a unique combination of airplanes – and a first for the Super Bowl. It was the first time the Heritage Flight team conducted a flyover for a Super Bowl. \nThe U.S. Air Force Heritage Flight performed a flawless execution perfectly timed with Pink's National Anthem. It consisted of one F-16 Fighting Falcon, two A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, and one P-51 Mustang flying in formation over U.S. Bank Stadium.\nPink performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", while Leslie Odom Jr. sang \"America the Beautiful\". Coincidentally, both Pink and Odom are from the Philadelphia area. Pink spit out a throat lozenge shortly before singing the anthem, later verified after many commentators thought she had spit out a piece of gum. She reported being ill with flu symptoms during her performance. No players were observed kneeling during the national anthem, in contrast to the protests that happened earlier in the 2016 and 2017 seasons.\nFifteen Medal of Honor recipients participated in the coin toss ceremony. World War II hero Hershel W. Williams was the honorary captain and had the honors of flipping the coin.\nHalftime show.\nJustin Timberlake headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show, along with his band \"The Tennessee Kids\" and featuring the University of Minnesota Marching Band. Timberlake performed in two previous Super Bowls: Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 as a member of NSYNC, and Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 with Janet Jackson.\nTimberlake's performance drew criticism for not being \"spectacular\", looking to be safe and avoid incidents such as the infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" encountered during his performance with Jackson, and for incorporating a video of Prince, who opposed performances combining the dead and the living.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nThe New England Patriots won the opening coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. The Patriots kicked off to the Eagles, who opened the game with a 14-play, 67-yard drive that took 7:05 off the clock and resulted in a 25-yard Jake Elliott field goal, giving the Eagles a 3–0 lead. The drive was controlled by the arm of Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, who completed 6 of 9 passes to five different receivers for 61 yards, with a few short runs by LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi mixed in. Foles also made two critical completions on third down plays, hitting Alshon Jeffery for a 17-yard gain on third-and-4, and later found Torrey Smith for a 15-yard completion on third-and-12. The Patriots responded with a drive of their own, almost with exactly the same results; quarterback Tom Brady completed 6 of 8 passes for 60 yards to four different receivers, the longest a 28-yard strike to Chris Hogan. The drive stalled out on the Eagles 8-yard line, where they had to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 26-yard field goal, which tied the game at 3–3. The game's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles on the next drive, taking only three plays: a short pass from Foles to Nelson Agholor, a 36-yard run up the middle by Blount, and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Foles to Jeffery to the left side of the field. The ensuing extra point attempt from Elliott was missed wide right, which made the score 9–3 in favor of the Eagles. The Patriots responded by advancing the ball to the Philadelphia 11-yard line on their next drive, which was set up by a 50-yard completion from Brady to Danny Amendola, where the quarter ended.\nWith the second quarter under way, the Patriots came away empty-handed on the drive, as Gostkowski missed a 26-yard field goal attempt after holder Ryan Allen mishandled the snap. New England's defense forced the game's only punt on the next drive. On the following drive, Brady completed a 23-yard pass to Brandin Cooks, but a hard hit by defender Malcolm Jenkins knocked the receiver out of the game with a concussion. On third down from near mid-field, the Patriots attempted a trick play that involved two handoffs and a pass downfield to Tom Brady. Brady was open but dropped the throw from Amendola. They went for it on fourth down, and a pass intended for tight end Rob Gronkowski fell incomplete, giving the Eagles the ball on their own 35-yard line on a turnover-on-downs. The Eagles capitalized on a drive featuring two key completions, a 19-yard catch by Zach Ertz on third-and-7, and a 22-yard reception by Jeffery on the Patriots 21-yard line. On the next play, a 21-yard rumble by Blount gave the Eagles another touchdown. They attempted a two-point conversion, which failed, making the score 15–3. The Patriots quickly struck back, as Brady completed a 46-yard pass to Rex Burkhead on the first play after the kickoff. But the team could only gain two more yards, resulting in Gostkowski's 45-yard field goal that got the score to 15–6.\nThe Eagles got the ball back with 7:24 on the clock and looked poised to score another touchdown after a 26-yard run by Ajayi gave them a first down on the Patriots 43-yard line. But on the next play, Foles threw a pass that bounced off Jeffery as he tried to make a one-handed catch and went into the hands of Patriots safety Duron Harmon for an interception, which he returned eight yards to the 10-yard line. The Patriots took advantage of the turnover with a seven-play, 90-yard drive, featuring a 43-yard completion from Brady to Hogan. On the next play, James White scored with a 26-yard touchdown run. Gostkowski missed the ensuing extra point, but the score was now 15–12. Eagles running back Kenjon Barner returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to his own 30-yard line as time ran down to the two-minute warning. Two plays later, on third-and-3, Foles completed a short pass to running back Corey Clement, who took off for a 55-yard gain to the New England 8-yard line. Clement then ran the ball six yards to the two-yard line on the next play. Two plays later, Philadelphia faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line with 38 seconds left on the clock. Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a similar trick play to the one that had failed for the Patriots earlier, in what would become the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who then threw the ball perfectly to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22–12 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The play came to be known as the Philly Special.\nThe first half resulted in numerous Super Bowl records from both teams, including most total yards combined (673). This was also the first time two quarterbacks had thrown for over 200 yards in the first half of a Super Bowl, with Brady throwing for 276 yards and Foles 215.\nSecond half.\nThe Patriots received the second-half kickoff and Brady led New England 75 yards in eight plays. Gronkowski, who caught only one pass for nine yards in the first half, caught five passes for 68 yards on the drive, the last a 5-yard touchdown reception to make the score 22–19. The Eagles responded by moving the ball 85 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed less than five minutes and featured three critical third-down conversions by Foles. The first was a 17-yard pass to Agholor on third-and-6 from the Eagles 19-yard line. Later in the drive, he threw a 14-yard completion to Ertz on third-and-1 from the New England 40-yard line. Finally, he finished the possession with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Clement on third-and-6. The touchdown was upheld upon replay review, as officials confirmed that Clement kept both feet inbounds and controlled the ball. An Elliott extra point brought the score to 29–19 in the Eagles' favor. Brady responded with a 10-play, 75-yard drive, completing all three of his passes for 61 yards, the last one a 26-yard touchdown pass to Hogan that brought the score to 29–26. The Eagles followed with an 8-play, 51-yard drive featuring a 24-yard completion from Foles to Agholor on the first play. By the end of the third quarter, the team had made it to the New England 16-yard line.\nThe Eagles opened the fourth quarter scoring with a Jake Elliott field goal to bring the score to 32–26. Brady then came back with another 75-yard drive featuring a 30-yard reception by Amendola and ending with a four-yard pass to Gronkowski, his second touchdown of the game, giving the Patriots their first lead of the game with the score at 33–32. On their next drive, the Eagles faced third-and-6 after two plays but were able to keep the ball with a 7-yard catch by Ertz. Eventually they faced a fourth-and-1 on their own 45-yard line with 5:39 left in the game. Deciding to go for the conversion rather than punt, Foles completed a 2-yard pass to Ertz that kept the drive alive. Then after a 1-yard Blount run, Foles picked up three consecutive first downs with three passes to Agholor for gains of 10, 18, and 10 yards, respectively, moving the ball to the New England 14-yard line. Following a 3-yard run by Ajayi, Foles threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Ertz with 2:21 remaining in the game. The play was held up on review; Ertz lost the ball after touching the ground in the end zone, but it was determined that he established himself as a runner and maintained control of the ball as he broke the plane of the goal line. A failed two-point conversion left the Eagles with a 38–33 lead.\nThe Patriots got the ball back on their own 25-yard line with the chance to mount a game-winning drive. However, on 2nd-and-2, defensive end Brandon Graham stripped the ball from Brady for the game's only sack, and defensive end Derek Barnett recovered the fumble, allowing the Eagles to run the clock down to 1:05 and force the Patriots to use all their remaining timeouts. Elliott then kicked a 46-yard field goal, putting Philadelphia ahead by eight points, 41–33. New England needed a touchdown and two-point conversion to tie the game and send it into overtime. After nine plays (one of them a 13-yard catch by Amendola on fourth-and-10), New England reached the 49-yard line, and with only nine seconds remaining, Brady threw a Hail Mary pass to the end zone as time expired. The pass was incomplete, and Philadelphia won their first Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history, and their first league championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles became just the second team to win a Super Bowl rematch after losing the first Super Bowl meeting with the same team, having lost to New England in Super Bowl XXXIX, and the first since the Washington Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII; the Miami Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. The Eagles also became the first Super Bowl champions since the 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers to defeat both Super Bowl participants from the previous year in the same postseason. Additionally, the NFC East became the first division where every team had won a Super Bowl.\nGame statistics.\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; it and this game marked only the second time in the game's history where the teams combined for 70+ points. The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason. The game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), and most yards gained by a team (613 for New England).\nNick Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception, and caught a touchdown pass. Clement, who caught only 10 passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns during the season, was the Eagles' leading receiver with four receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for eight yards. Agholor had nine receptions for 84 yards. Blount was the game's top rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown. Brady completed 28 of 48 passes for 505 yards and three touchdowns, breaking the record for most passing yards in a Super Bowl that he had set in the previous season. Amendola was his top target, with eight receptions for 152 yards, while Hogan had six for 128 yards and a touchdown and Gronkowski caught nine for 116 yards and two scores.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\n1Completions/attempts2Carries3Long gain4Receptions5Times targeted\nStarting lineups.\nSource:\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LII had seven officials.

Instead she made a quick exit, finishing sixth in her semifinal. The Olympic silver medalist from that close Olympic final is the returning champion Lashinda Demus, but having a bye, she has raced sparingly. She ran her season best to qualify in that same semi. The distant bronze medalist Zuzana Hejnová in 2012 was the 2013 world leader. She won the first semi, almost half a second faster than the other qualifiers.

It was Demus took off in lane 4 and was the leader down the back stretch, with training partner Dalilah Muhammad almost on the same pace. Both are trained by Demus' mom. Shakes-Drayton between them tried to keep up with the two Americans. Hejnová was gaining steadily on Demus and Muhammad through the turn. Demus, who still holds the American high school record in the 300 hurdles did that distance well, but Hejnová, who set the world best in that race just two weeks earlier, passed her over the 8th hurdle at 290 meters. Demus' arm carry noticeably dropped, she had played her best card and Hejnová had trumped it. Hejnová continued ahead to victory with Demus fighting to stay with her. Muhammad caught Demus with 10 meters to go for silver. Demus a step back for bronze. Shakes-Drayton disappeared back through the field, nobody else was in contention with the three clear winners. Hejnová's 52.83 is the Czech national record and makes her the number 12 performer of all time (Demus already number 3).\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:45."

        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, was the 19th Olympic Championship. The Czech Republic, which emerged from the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, won its first winter gold medal, becoming only the seventh nation to win Olympic ice hockey gold. The tournament, held from February 7 to February 22, was played at the Big Hat and Aqua Wing arenas.\nThis was the first Olympics in which the National Hockey League (NHL) took a break (17 days, from February 8 to February 24) allowing national teams to include NHL players from each country. Unlike basketball's Dream Team in 1992, where the players stayed in a hotel in Barcelona due to security concerns, NHL players stayed in the Olympic Village due to improved security measures.\nThe Canadian team, despite a strong start in the round robin, lost their semifinal match against the Czech Republic in a shootout. Team Finland defeated Canada in the bronze medal game. In the final, the Czech Republic beat Russia 1-0 to win the gold medal, as goaltender Dominik Hašek shutout the Russian squad.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+9).\"\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=\"Group A\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Group A\" /&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=\"Group B\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Group B\" /&gt;\nFirst round.\nGroup C.\n&lt;section begin=\"Group C\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Group C\" /&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;section begin=\"Group D\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Group D\" /&gt;\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam Canada was the oldest team in the tournament, with an average age of 30 years. Team Kazakhstan was the youngest, averaging 26 years and 11 months. The gold medal-winning Czech Republic team averaged 27 years and 2 months. The tournament average was 28 years and 1 month.\nMedal-winning rosters.\nSource:\nRoster notes.\nSeveral of general manager Bobby Clarke's selections for Team Canada were controversial. Eric Lindros was named captain over longtime leaders such as Wayne Gretzky, Steve Yzerman, and Ray Bourque (Clarke at the time was general manager of Lindros's NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers). Rob Zamuner was a surprise pick, while Mark Messier, Adam Oates, Ron Francis, Doug Gilmour and Scott Niedermayer were omitted. Japanese fans were disappointed when their adopted hero, Paul Kariya, a Canadian of Japanese heritage and one of Canada's best stars, failed to make the Games due to a head injury sustained from a crosscheck by Gary Suter during regular season NHL play.\nMemorably, during the shootout in their semifinal match against the Czech Republic, Canadian coach Marc Crawford opted to have defenceman Ray Bourque shoot in the shootout instead of high-scoring forwards Wayne Gretzky and Steve Yzerman. Hockey commentators alternatively criticized Crawford's decision (Bourque, like the other four Canadian shooters, failed to score) or praised it on the grounds that Bourque was one of hockey's most accurate shooters at the time and Gretzky had always been surprisingly mediocre on breakaways.\nControversy.\nSwedish player Ulf Samuelsson was discovered to have applied for American citizenship. Under Swedish law at the time, when one acquires a foreign passport, their citizenship is annulled. Samuelsson was ejected after having played the first game against Belarus, although Sweden kept their points from the win. The Czech National Olympic Committee felt that Sweden should lose the points and filed a protest with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which was rejected.\nThe United States team, loaded with 17 NHL stars, was eliminated in the first game of the knockout round, and responded by trashing their rooms in the Olympic Village. Three apartments were vandalized, ten chairs were broken and three fire extinguishers were emptied. Six of those chairs and one fire extinguisher were thrown down five stories into a courtyard."

Last year's surprise Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott, didn't make the final, nor did the returning bronze medalist Guillermo Martínez. The defending champion Matthias de Zordo did not return, nor did the Olympic silver medalist Oleksandr Pyatnytsya. Former two time Olympic gold medalist Andreas Thorkildsen was in danger of not qualifying, on his final attempt, he got into an automatic qualifier, one of only three, joining Ihab Abdelrahman El Sayed, who set the Egyptian national record at 83.62.\nFour throws into the final and Tero Pitkämäki took the early lead. Five throws later Vítězslav Veselý threw the winner 87.17. Two more throws and Roman Avramenko was sitting in third place after the first round. In the second round Pitkämäki improved, followed by world leader Dmitriy Tarabin taking over third place. Veselý's remaining throws wouldn't be enough to place in the top four. Pitkämäki improved again on his third attempt, falling just 10 cm short of Veselý. That mark would be good enough for silver.\nAt the same time as Kenyan women were in their customary position battling the Ethiopians in the women's 5000, Julius Yego's fifth round throw of 85.40 was a Kenyan national record, but more importantly, Kenya's first field event finalist was in third place in the world championships, with only one throw to go. Throwing before the home crowd, Tarabin's final effort of 86.23 took third place back for good, dashing Yego's hope for a medal.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 82.50 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18.35."

The event typically runs for four to five days—from Thursday to Sunday or Monday—and features WWE talent and alumni autograph signings, interviews, fan activities, memorabilia displays, meet-and-greets, and matches. WrestleMania Axxess was briefly discontinued from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was relaunched as WWE World at WrestleMania beginning with WrestleMania XL in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe first event happened in 1988, when the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) in association with The Trump Organization prepared a small festival to celebrate WrestleMania IV. It included autograph signings, a brunch, and a five kilometer run; the event was held again in 1989 for WrestleMania V. In 1992, a festival was held the day of WrestleMania VIII which included a WWF wrestler look-alike contest and a tournament for the \"WWF WrestleFest\" arcade game. In 1993, the WWF held a \"WrestleMania Brunch\" the day of WrestleMania IX at Caesars Palace, during the course of which Lex Luger attacked Bret Hart. In 1994, the WWF offered \"Fan Fest\" for the weekend of WrestleMania X, which allowed fans to step inside a WWF ring, participate in games, meet wrestlers, and purchase merchandise; the event was followed up in 1995 with another \"Fan Fest\" for WrestleMania XI. In 1999, the WWF held its first Saturday pre-WrestleMania event taking place on March 27, 1999. \"WrestleMania Rage Party\", as it was known, was televised live on the USA Network from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (EST). The event was to be held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The idea of the event was \"...to celebrate the final WrestleMania of the millennium...\"\nThe following year, the WWF held its first WrestleMania Axxess event at the Anaheim Convention Center expanding upon the party idea of \"WrestleMania Rage Party\". The event included autograph signings and mementos of inductees of the WWE Hall of Fame. There were also activities where fans could enter a wrestling ring and commentate a wrestling match. In 2001, WrestleMania Axxess was held at the Reliant Hall which expanded upon the event by adding numerous activities including areas where attendees could buy special merchandise, see a production truck, and check out special WWE vehicles. In 2002, WrestleMania Axxess was extended to a three-day event and was held at the Skydome (now Rogers Centre). The three-day event included similar activities to that of the one-day line-up. In 2007, WrestleMania Axxess went on tour around cities in both the United States and Canada. In recent years, Axxess has become a four-day event, with one session on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday, and three sessions on Saturday.\nSince 2013, NXT matches have been held at WrestleMania Axxess, and since 2017, matches from various independent promotions have been held, such as Insane Championship Wrestling, Progress Wrestling, and Evolve. In 2018, WWE held four invitational tournaments for NXT championship matches. The winners of the WWE United Kingdom Championship Invitational, NXT North American Championship Invitational, NXT Tag Team Championship Invitational, and NXT Women's Championship Invitational tournaments received matches for the respective titles on April 8.\nWWE cancelled the traditional WrestleMania Axxess events since 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently announced that the 2022 event during WrestleMania 38 weekend will be replaced by a Superstore Axxess shop with superstar panels and premium experiences. Unlike previous events, no live wrestling matches and only a limited amount of autograph signings were involved for the 2023 event.\nFor WrestleMania XL in April 2024, WWE relaunched the event under a new name of WWE World at WrestleMania, which was done in partnership with Fanatics Events and held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The event runs from Thursday, April 4 until Monday, April 8. The five-day event includes interview panel sessions with WWE wrestlers, a \"WWE 2K24\" gaming tournament, live podcast recordings, meet-and-greets with wrestlers, and a large merchandise store with various memorabilia honoring WrestleMania's 40-year history.\nWrestleMania Superstore.\nEvery year during the week leading up to WrestleMania, the WrestleMania Superstore is open at WrestleMania Axxess. The WrestleMania Superstore has \"the largest selection of WrestleMania and WWE merchandise under one roof\". It has over 700 items and includes exclusive Superstore-only merchandise. The store is open to the public, and no ticket is required.\nWWE Superstar statue.\nBeginning in 2013, WWE has honored a Legend Superstar by unveiling a real size statue at WrestleMania Axxess."

        "text": "The 2024 Copa América will be the 48th edition of the Copa América, the quadrennial international men's soccer championship organized by South America's soccer ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament will be held in the United States and co-organized by CONCACAF. The United States will host the tournament for the second time, having hosted the Copa América Centenario in 2016. The tournament will be held from June 20 to July 14, 2024, and the winner will later compete in the 2025 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions against the UEFA Euro 2024 winner.\nArgentina is the defending champion. The final will be played on July 14, 2024, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\nHost selection.\nThe 2024 Copa América had been expected to be hosted by Ecuador due to CONMEBOL's host rotation order. However, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez said Ecuador had been nominated but not yet chosen to organize the edition. In November 2022, the country declined to host the tournament. Peru and the United States had both expressed interest in organizing the tournament.\nOn January 27, 2023, it was announced that as part of CONCACAF and CONMEBOL's new strategic partnership, the United States would host the tournament with six CONCACAF guest teams qualifying through the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The tournament also acts as a prelude to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, of which the United States is a joint host along with Canada and Mexico.\nVenues.\nThe opening match will be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, while the final will be held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, both venues were announced on November 20, 2023. All other venues were selected and announced on December 4, 2023, two weeks after the opening and final venues were confirmed.\nTeams.\nThe tournament will include sixteen teams – ten from CONMEBOL and six from CONCACAF. All ten CONMEBOL national teams are eligible to enter.\nThe six CONCACAF participants will qualify through the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The teams will be the four League A quarter-final winners, and two play-in round winners between the four losing quarter-finalists. Unlike the Copa América Centenario, the United States did not qualify automatically despite being the hosts, but still secured a berth following a 4–2 aggregate win against Trinidad and Tobago.\nSquads.\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams will name a provisional squad of up to 55 players.\nDraw.\nThe group stage draw was held on December 7, 2023, at 19:30 EST () in the James L. Knight Center in Miami, Florida. The sixteen teams were drawn into four groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\nFor the draw, the four teams in Pot 1 were pre-seeded into their respective groups, determined as follows:\nThe remaining 12 teams were placed into Pots 2–4 according to their October 2023 World Rankings, with placeholders for the 2 CONCACAF participants yet to be determined at the time of the draw each being automatically placed into Pot 4.\nFor the draw, the competition rules state that no group can have more than three CONMEBOL teams or more than two CONCACAF teams. If this condition is not met during the draw, the team will move to the next available group in alphabetical order.\nSeeding.\nNotes\nKnockout stage.\nIn the final, if the scores are level after 90 minutes, two extra time periods of 15 minutes each will be played. If still level, the match will be decided by a penalty shootout. In all other knockout stage matches (quarter-finals, semi-finals, and third place play-off), no extra time will be played and any draws will be resolved via penalties.\nMarketing.\nThe Panini Group produced thematic stickers and a sticker album for this edition of the Copa América. Stickers were produced for all the Copa América teams, including Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago, the teams that did not qualify for the play offs. These stickers can be sold, collected or traded.\nSymbols.\nMascot.\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on December 7, 2023, during the group stage draw. It's an eagle named \"Capitán\", which is a Spanish word meaning captain. The inspiration for the choice of an eagle as the mascot for the CONMEBOL Copa América 2024, was born from the symbolism that this majestic animal has in various cultures of the Americas, illustrating strength, boldness, and excellence.\nMatch ball.\nThe match balls of this tournament will be provided by Puma for the first time after 20 years of partnership with Nike ended in 2023. The \"Puma Cumbre\" was unveiled during the draw for the Group Stage of the competition on December 7, 2023."

        "text": "Dog surfing is a type of surfing maneuver involving dogs that are trained to surf on surfboards, bodyboards, skimboards, windsurf boards or to bodysurf. Historically, surfing dogs have been documented as occurring as early as the 1920s in the United States. Competitions and exhibitions that feature surfing dogs have occurred in various coastal areas of the United States, such as Del Mar, California, Imperial Beach, California and Jupiter, Florida.\nOverview.\nDog surfing involves dogs that are trained to surf on surfboards or bodyboards, either alone or with a human on the board. Some dogs have been trained to ride a skimboard on the shore (after the board is initially skimmed by a human) and to windsurf with a human, and bodysurfing dogs have also been documented in surfing media.\nHistory.\nDog surfing has been documented as occurring in the 1920s in California and Hawaii. In the 1930s, a silent film titled \"On The Waves in Waikiki\" depicts Phillip K. Auna and Night Hawk, his terrier, surfing together on a wooden surfboard in Hawaii. The terrier was able to perform the hang ten surfing maneuver on the surfboard. In 1944, a full page image of a surfing dog named \"Rusty\" was published in \"National Geographic\" magazine. In the 1950s, UPI published a photograph of Joseph \"Scooter Boy\" Kaopuiki and his dog Sandy surfing in Hawaii, which was published in newspapers throughout the United States. During this time, they were also reported about on the television show \"You Asked For It!\". Dave Chalmers and his surfing terrier mix named Max, both from San Diego, California, were featured in several forms of media in the late 1970s through the 1980s, including surf movies and a television appearance on the show \"Amazing Animals\".\nA Labrador Retriever named Cam was documented in Honolulu, Hawaii surfing partially lying down while simultaneously drinking from a bottle of beer.\nCompetitions.\nIn dog surfing competitions, judging criteria may include the dog's overall certainty on the board, wave size and ride length.\nThe Loews Coronado Bay Resort Surf Dog Competition at Imperial Beach in California has been described as the largest dog surfing competition in the United States. The first competition was held in 2006. In 2011, over fifty dogs participated, and the competition categorized entries by small dogs, large dogs and tandem dogs. Tandem surfing involves two or more dogs surfing together on one surfboard, or a dog surfing with a human. In June 2012, fifty dogs participated, and three \"Guinness World Records\" were broken, including a new record of eighteen for the most dogs photographed on a surfboard. The Imperial Beach Dog Surf Competition is also a fundraiser event for the San Diego Humane Society.\nAn annual dog surfing competition titled \"Surf City Surf Dog competition\" is held in Huntington Beach, California in late September. The first competition occurred in October 2009. The event is free to attend. Besides the surf competitions, visitors can enjoy the surFUR expo.\nIn 2012, the Incredible Dog Challenge dog surfing competition was held in San Diego, California.\nSince 2012, the Noosa Festival of Surfing held each March in the Shire of Noosa has played host to the Surfing Dog Championship sponsored by local business VetShopAustralia.com.au. The event was formerly known as the Surfing Dog Spectacular and was renamed the Surfing Dog Championships in 2017 in recognition of the increased calibre of participants. The Noosa Surfing Dog Championships is an invitational event, where dogs and humans work together on stand up paddle boards (SUPs) with the prize chosen by surfing legends such as Layne Beachley, and given to the dog/person combination that catches the best wave.\nThe winner of the 2021 event, was a Pug called Pickles, surfing with Dan Bleicher. The 2022 event is slated for Saturday, 5 March at 2:30pm.\nIn July 2013, the Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Wellington, Florida presented its first \"Surfs Up, Dogs\" competition as a fundraiser for the non-profit organization. The competition was held in Jupiter, Florida.\nThe World Dog Surfing Championships, a Northern California event, have been held at Pacifica, California since 2016.\nIn September, 2019 , \"SUP for Pups Intracoastal Challenge\", a competitive 5K event took place at Pioneer Park in Deerfield Beach, Florida."

Originally founded in 2005, the promotion was in business for two years before going on hiatus, resuming operations in 2017. The company is founded, promoted and owned by Adrian Manera.\nHistory.\nThe first tour in 2005, titled \"International Assault\", visited three cities – Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle – in early October. In Melbourne the first WSW heavyweight champion was crowned in a one-off match between Rhino and Jeff Jarrett, with Rhino gaining the victory. Also on the same night the first of a three match series was contested between A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels with Styles winning a 30-minute iron man match 1 fall to none. Rhino successfully defended his title against Jarrett in Sydney while Daniels leveled the three match series in Sydney, but on the final night of the tour Jarrett defeated Rhino in Newcastle while Styles won the three match series. The 2005 International Assault Tour also featured the final wrestling matches of ex WWE star, Australia's Nathan Jones.\nThe second tour in 2007 was also titled International Assault and took place in early June – again visiting the same three cities. The WSW heavyweight title was vacant and another one-off match in Sydney was held to fill the vacancy. Bryan Danielson defeated Nigel McGuinness for the title in a match for the ages. Local Sydney promotion the Australasian Wrestling Federation allowed its Australasian title and tag team titles to be defended on the show, with then AWF champion TNT defending successfully against Billy Kidman. In Melbourne, Danielson successfully defended his title against McGuinness, but in Newcastle Danielson lost the title to Kidman in an amazing match the first and last time the two competed in a singles match. . The tour also featured Kid Kash and the Australian debut of Austin Aries.\nFollowing on from International Assault 2, the next tour which took place in August 2007, entitled Global Attack rocked a near sell out crowd in Adelaide's Thebarton Theatre which featured Billy Kidman successfully defending the Heavyweight Championship against Heidenreich, and the Australian return of Kid Kash as well as the Australian debut of Masato Tanaka.\nAfter a hiatus from promoting live events, World Series Wrestling planned to return with 3 live events planned for 2010 in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The tour was to feature Balls Mahoney, Tommy Dreamer, Daivari, Petey Williams, Heidenreich, Tajiri, Sonjay Dutt and more. Unfortunately as a result of the main sponsor pulling out only weeks prior to the tour, World Series Wrestling was left with no alternative but to cancel the planned event. WSW returned in November 2017 after a 10-year hiatus. Their first tour featured top independent wrestlers Ricochet, Austin Aries, Zack Sabre Jr., Tessa Blanchard, Joey Ryan and Brian Cage. On 25 November, Ricochet defeated Aries to become the new WSW Heavyweight Champion after the title had been vacant since mid-2007. During the following months, the promotion hosted more tours in Australia. On 17 March, The Young Bucks became the inaugural WSW Tag Team champions. On 10 March, Jordynne Grace defeat Kellyanne and Shazza McKenzie in a triple threat match to be crowned the inaugural WSW Women's Champion.\nCurrent champions.\nWSW Tag Team Championship.\nThe WSW Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling championship contested for in the tag team division of World Series Wrestling.\n!rowspan=2|\n!rowspan=2|Champion\n!colspan=3|Championship change\n!colspan=2|Reign statistics\n!rowspan=2|Notes\n!rowspan=2|\n!Date\n!Event\n!Location\n!Reign\n!Days\n!\n!\n!\n!"

If you can't kick with him, you go home. Semifinal 2 was a different story with a much faster pace all the time qualifiers came from this race, with several also rans left out with times faster than Kiprop.\nWith three Kenyans qualified, rumors were out that there would be a fast pace for the final. That wasn't the case, first Kiprop looked around for his teammates and they weren't there. On the second lap Nixon Chepseba took off into the lead, but all eyes were on Kiprop and nobody followed. Matthew Centrowitz took up the position directly behind Kiprop on the rail, Mekonnen Gebremedhin on his shoulder. For the next two laps Chipseba ran on his own, opening up as much as a 10-meter lead. But when the running got serious everybody jockeyed for position behind Kiprop, Chipseba acting more like a blockade. Kiprop didn't really unleash his kick until 90 meters from the finish. Centrowitz moved right with him following Kiprop to the line for silver, with Johan Cronje squeezing past Chipseba on the inside to take bronze.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 6 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 17:25."

        "text": "The men's 5000 metres at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Luzhniki Stadium on 13 and 16 August.\nFifteen qualified for the final. Of the ten automatic qualifiers, three each were from Kenya, Ethiopia and the United States. But all eyes were on the one from England, the defending champion, Olympic champion and 10000 winner from these championships all rolled up into one Mo Farah.\nThe first lap of the final started off at a jog for these world class competitors. On the second lap, the Kenyans as a group pushed the pace, but it didn't last long and the pack reformed. At such a leisurely pace, nobody was at risk of getting dropped. Instead confusion. Hagos Gebrhiwet literally a step behind Farah near the back of the pack, watching his every step. At 2000 meters, Farah decided to take a chance at the lead, but it was not to advance the pace but to slow it down. With Farah at the front the pace slowed to 68 seconds, then almost 70 seconds and the rest of the field obediently crowded up behind him, not willing to go out alone against the king. With 5 laps to go, Isiah Koech decided to make the break and took off. The race accelerated to 62-second laps with all the players covering each other's move and jockeying for position. For a lap Yenew Alamirew held the lead, accelerating as anyone looked to try to pass. With 650 to go, Farah made his move, successfully passing Alamirew he only gained a step on the field but that was enough, now he wouldn't let anybody pass him, the field stinging out behind him, the suitors dwindling. Through the final lap in 53 seconds, Koech made repeated attempts to get past Farah but each time Farah was able to go that much faster. Two steps behind at the beginning of the straight, Gebrhiwet weaved his way around the other two Kenyans and came flying down the outside as Koech let up in defeat, Gebrhiwet taking silver by one thousandth of a second after 5000 meters.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:45."

Olympic Champion Mo Farah dropped to last place in the early stages, later there occasions when he would go to the front of the pack, though he made no effort to quicken the pace from the lead. With the lead pack down to about 10, with a kilometer to go, American Dathan Ritzenhein charged around the pack and into the lead. That woke up the rest of the contenders, quickly swallowing up Ritzenhein's effort. After some jockeying by a host of contenders, Farah seized the lead just before the last lap. Down the backstretch, the remaining contenders, Ibrahim Jeilan, Paul Tanui and Galen Rupp sprinted to keep up with Farah and rounding the final turn, defending champion Jeilan seemed to be moving into position to repeat his sprint past Farah to the finish. But unlike 2011, Farah had an extra gear to hold off Jeilan, crossing the line holding his hands high, before doing his post race \"Mobot\" dance. The 27:21.71 sets a new Russian all comers record.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nFinal.\nThe race was started at 18:55."

Down the backstretch Tinsley asserted himself and by the fifth hurdle was clearly the leader with Cisneros the next in line. At the back were Bekrić and Sanchez. Through the turn Javier Culson then Jehue Gordon tried to make up ground on Tinsley. Gordon broke away and passed Tinsley over the last hurdle with the momentum. Going into the line it looked like Gordon had the step but Tinsley worked his way back into first. In one of the best dives of modern time, Gordon snatched the win, then one step later falling to the track.

With multiple Olympic and returning World Champion Ezekiel Kemboi, they were at the front with the rest of the field strung out behind them. For the first four laps, Conseslus Kipruto did the majority of the leading, with the rest of the Kenyans, then both Ugandans behind. Occasionally Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad would pass one of the Ugandan athletes. With three laps to go, things began to shake up. Paul Kipsiele Koech moved into the lead and at about the same time Noureddine Smaïl moved from the middle of the pack along the outside into third place. As the pace quickened, the Ugandans disappeared, replaced by the two Frenchmen and Evan Jager as contenders behind the Kenyan gauntlet. Over the next half lap, the pace quickened, Smai'l disappeared and Matthew Hughes of Canada emerged. Going into the last lap, Conseslus Kipruto and Koech were in the lead with Kemboi behind them followed by Mekhissi and Jager. Menkhissi moved along the outside, with about 200 meters to go, passed Kemboi, then Koech and was even with Kipruto. But behind him, Kemboi moved into a different gear. Taking the barrier at the end of the straight in full hurdle stride, in the next 50 meters before the water jump, Kemboi went around the outside and took the lead. Mekhissi was next over the water jump with Kipruto scrambling to make up ground. In full sprint, Kipruto went around Mekhissi but didn't negotiate the last barrier as well as Kemboi. Regaining his balance he again sprinted making up significant ground on his more experienced teammate, but it was not enough to get gold. Make that three straight for Kemboi, along with two Olympic gold medals unbeaten in the World Championships since he finished second to a different Kipruto in 2007. In all, three golds, three silvers and nothing worse in the World Championships since 2003. Mekhissi repeats his bronze medal.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 20:20."

        "text": "The 2013–14 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team represented Harvard University during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Crimson, led by seventh year head coach Tommy Amaker, played their home games at Lavietes Pavilion and were members of the Ivy League. They finished the season 27–5, 13–1 in Ivy League play to win the Ivy League championship and earn the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. In the NCAA Tournament, as a 12-seed, the Crimson upset 5-seed Cincinnati in the first round before losing in the second round to 4-seed Michigan State.\nPreseason.\nOn September 27, \"USA Today\" Scott Gleeson named Harvard the 31st best team in the country and projected the team to earn a number 8 seed in the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. When the preseason Coaches' Poll was released on October 17, three-time Ivy League defending champion Harvard received 28 points (the 32nd highest point total). When the preseason Associated Press poll was released, Harvard had 46 points (the 31st highest total). \"Sports Illustrated\" listed Harvard 20th in its College Basketball edition. Its support was largely based upon the return of 2013 Ivy Rookie of the Year Siyani Chambers and the 2013 Ivy League scoring champion Wesley Saunders as well as the return of Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, who had redshirtted the previous season due to the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal. Casey and Curry had been 2011–12 All-Ivy League first and second team selections, respectively.\nHarvard was the unanimous selection of the 17-member Ivy League media poll selection committee when it was released on October 23, 2013. Harvard was also the preseason selection of \"Athlon Sports\", \"Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook\", \"Lindy's Sports\" and NBCSports.com, but \"Sporting News\" selected them second to Princeton. Saunders was selected as the preseason Ivy League player of the year according to \"Athlon Sports\", \"Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook\", \"Lindy's Sports\", NBCSports.com and \"Sporting News\" and was a CollegeInsider.Com\nLou Henson Preseason Mid-Major All-America Team selection. Both Curry and Chambers were preseason Bob Cousy Award watchlist selections. The team selected Casey and Curry to be its co-captains.\nRecruits.\nClass of 2013.\nZena Edosomwan was a 4-star recruit and among the top 100 players in the class of 2012 according to multiple recruiting services. Harvard's recruitment of him has become controversial because he had substandard academic qualifications for Harvard. He had to take the SAT's multiple times and reclassify into the class of 2013 while pursuing a post-graduate year at Northfield Mount Hermon. Edosomwan declined basketball scholarships from UCLA, USC, California, Texas, Wake Forest, Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, Gonzaga, Notre Dame, San Francisco, Texas, Vanderbilt, and Washington to attend Harvard. He is the first player rated among the top 100 by Scout.com to ever commit to Harvard.\nClass of 2014.\nOn September 29, 2013 4-star recruit Chris Egi and 3-star recruit Andre Chatfield both made verbal commitments to Harvard. Egi is the second top 100 recruit in two years for Harvard.\nSchedule.\nHarvard opened its season on November 10 with a victory over in-state Greater Boston rival Holy Cross at the TD Garden. They then defeated Cambridge rival on November 12 in the home opener at Lavietes Pavilion. After scoring 14 points and adding 6 assists, 4 rebounds, 3 steals and 2 blocks while playing 37 minutes in the first game of the season, Curry missed the next three games due to a foot injury. After starting the season 4–0, the team lost its first game on the road against Pac-12 Conference Colorado on November 24. Curry re-aggravated his foot against Colorado and was described as out indefinitely by Amaker. In the 2013 Great Alaska Shootout, Harvard defeated Denver, Green Bay and TCU to win the November 27–30 tournament.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#991111; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#991111; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\nHonors.\nOn March 11 Saunders was named to the District I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT) team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Saunders was listed on The National Association of Basketball Coaches Division I All‐District 13 first team on March 12."

        "title": "Scotland at the UEFA European Championship",
        "text": "The UEFA European Championship is the main football competition of the men's national football teams governed by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). Held every four years since 1960, in the even-numbered year between World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the UEFA European Nations' Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form “Euro XXXX”. Prior to entering the tournament all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process.\nScotland have participated in three UEFA European Championship finals, mainly the 1992, 1996 and 2020 (played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) editions, with an upcoming fourth participation in 2024. They have played nine matches, winning two, drawing two and losing five. They have scored five goals and conceded ten, failing to advance past the group stage so far.\nHistory.\n1960s.\nScotland first participated in the European Championships in 1968, after not entering the first two tournaments. The 1966–67 and 1967–68 editions of the British Home Championship formed the results of their qualifying group, with Scotland finishing a point behind group winners England. Scotland's first qualifying match was a 1–1 draw in Cardiff against Wales on 22 October 1966, with Denis Law scoring an 86th-minute equaliser for the Scots. Scotland's first win came against Northern Ireland on 16 November 1966 at Hampden Park - they won 2–1. On 15 April 1967, Scotland became the first side to defeat England since their World Cup victory - a 3–2 win at Wembley gave Scotland the 1966–67 British Home Championship crown. Northern Ireland defeated Scotland 1–0 in Belfast on 21 October 1967, before a 3–2 victory against the Welsh on 22 November 1967. A 1–1 draw with England, on 24 February 1968, wasn't enough for Scotland to qualify from the group.\n1970s.\nScotland were drawn alongside Belgium, Denmark and Portugal in the qualification phase of UEFA Euro 1972. Scotland won all their home matches, but lost all their away games to finish third in the group. A 1–0 defeat to Denmark in Copenhagen on 9 June 1971 saw Scotland eliminated from qualifying. Belgium won the group to progress to the play-offs.\nUEFA Euro 1976 qualifying saw Scotland face Denmark, Romania and Spain. Scotland lost their opening match 2–1 to the Spaniards at Hampden, before drawing 1–1 in Valencia. Gordon McQueen scored a late equaliser to win Scotland a point away in Romania, before Joe Harper's goal saw Scotland beat Denmark 1–0 away from home. Scotland won the reverse fixture 3–1. Scotland's final match was at home to Romania, with Scotland requiring a two-goal win to win the group and qualify for the play-offs. Scotland took the lead through a Bruce Rioch goal, but Romania levelled the match with fifteen minutes to go to send Scotland out.\n1980s.\nScotland's qualifying group for Euro 1980 featured Austria, Belgium, Norway and Portugal. Defeats against Austria and Portugal in their opening three matches removed any chance of qualification for Scotland, with two wins over Norway and a 4–1 victory over Portugal at Hampden being the only victories in a disappointing qualifying campaign for the Scots, who finished fourth.\nBelgium, East Germany and Switzerland were Scotland's opponents in qualifying for UEFA Euro 1984. An opening game win over East Germany was the only victory of the campaign for the Scots, with home draws against Belgium and Switzerland being the only other points obtained in the campaign. Scotland lost all of their away matches to finish bottom of the group.\nScotland faced Belgium, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and the Republic of Ireland in qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988. Two 0–0 draws against Bulgaria and the Republic of Ireland was followed up with a 3–0 victory over minnows Luxembourg. Successive defeats against the Republic of Ireland (1–0) and Belgium (4–1) saw qualification fall out of reach, once again. Victories over Belgium (2–0) and Bulgaria (1–0) followed, before a disappointing 0–0 draw over Luxembourg, who obtained their first and only point of the campaign. The win against Bulgaria, who had only needed to draw the match to qualify, meant that Ireland qualified for their first major tournament.\n1990s.\nUnder the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992. Scotland were drawn into a qualifying group of Bulgaria, Romania, San Marino and Switzerland. A 1–0 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners by a single point. Scotland were drawn into a very difficult group, facing defending champions the Netherlands, the CIS (the successor of the Soviet Union team defeated in the 1988 final), and Germany, World Cup holders and semi-finalists in 1988. Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine 3–0 win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.\nAfter Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager. Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia, in a qualifying group also featuring Greece, Faroe Islands, Finland and San Marino. The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium. Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1–0 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored. The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.\n2000s.\nScotland finished second in their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2000. The Czech Republic won the group, after winning all their matches. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia and Lithuania all finished seven points behind Scotland, with the Faroe Islands bringing up the rear. Scotland were the third best second placed team, which qualified them for the play-offs. They were drawn against England. On 13 November 1999, England won the first leg 2–0 at Hampden Park, with Paul Scholes scoring both goals. Four days later, Scotland won the return leg at Wembley. Don Hutchison scored the winner for Scotland in a 1–0 win, which wasn't enough to prevent England qualifying for Euro 2000.\nScotland, once again, finished second in their qualifying group in qualification for Euro 2004. This time Germany were the group winners, with Iceland, Lithuania and the Faroe Islands finishing behind Scotland. On 7 June 2003, Scotland drew 1–1 with the Germans at Hampden with Kenny Miller scoring the equaliser. The second-place finish saw Scotland progress to the play-offs, where they were drawn against the Netherlands. On 15 November 2003, Scotland won the first leg 1–0, via a James McFadden goal. However, the Dutch won 6–0, four days later, in Amsterdam to knock Scotland out of the competition.\nScotland faced Italy and France, who had contested the 2006 World Cup final, in their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2008. A 6–0 victory over the Faroe Islands started the campaign strongly, before defeating Lithuania 2–1 in Kaunas. On 7 October 2006, Scotland moved to the top of their group with a surprise 1–0 victory over France at Hampden Park. Scotland were defeated 2–0 in Ukraine four days later to end Scotland's winning start to the campaign. On 24 March 2007, Scotland won 2–1 against Georgia with a late goal from Craig Beattie, before falling 2–0 to World Champions Italy in Bari. Despite the defeat Scotland were level on points at the top of the qualifying group with France and Ukraine; Italy were two points behind. Victories over the Faroe Islands and Lithuania followed, before another 1–0 victory against the French, this time in Paris. James McFadden scored the winning goal. A 3–1 victory over Ukraine on 13 October 2007 saw Scotland strengthen their position at the top of the group, but a 2–0 defeat to a youthful Georgia side saw the campaign turn. Scotland required a win over Italy in their final game to qualify for Euro 2008, but fell to a 2–1 defeat after a late Italian goal put the Scots out. Scotland finished their group in third place.\n2010s.\nScotland finished third in their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying group, behind World and European Champions Spain and the Czech Republic. On 3 September 2011, a stoppage time Czech penalty saw them steal a point from Hampden Park, which ultimately proved vital for Scotland's qualification chances. Scotland would have finished second in the group and reached the play-offs, with victory in that match.\nUEFA Euro 2016 saw eight additional teams qualify for the finals than was previously the case. This meant that the top two from each qualifying group would qualify, with the third placed team entering the play-offs. Scotland's 1–0 defeat against Georgia was the pivotal game of the group. A stoppage time equaliser from Poland on 8 October saw Scotland eliminated. Scotland finished fourth, behind Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.\n2020s.\nScotland hosted three group games and a last 16 match during UEFA Euro 2020, which was held at venues across Europe including Hampden Park, but was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team qualified for the tournament via the playoffs (based on finishing top of their mini-group in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League – they were third, outside the automatic places, in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group) by winning penalty shootouts against Israel and Serbia. Defeats by the Czech Republic and Croatia at Hampden, either side of a goalless draw with England at Wembley (all played with a limited number of spectators present due to COVID-19 restrictions) meant that Scotland finished bottom of Group D.\nA record-breaking winning run at the start of Euro 2024 qualifying, of five consecutive matches, meant that Scotland qualified for Euro 2024 with two matches to spare."

        "title": "World Triathlon Championship Series",
        "text": "The World Triathlon Championship Series is World Triathlon's annual series of triathlon events used to crown an annual world champion since 2008. There are multiple rounds of competitions culminating in a Grand Final race. Athletes compete head-to-head for points in these races that will determine the overall World Triathlon champion. The elite championship races are held, with one exception, over two distances, the standard or 'Olympic' distance (1.5 km swim, 40 km bike, 10 km run) and the sprint distance (750 m swim, 20 km bike, 5 km run). The ITU (the former name of World Triathlon) world champion between 1989 and 2008 had been decided in a single annual championship race.\nSince 2018 a mixed relay series has been run in tandem, where national teams compete in mixed team relays for prize money and Olympic qualifying points. From these races, one is denominated as the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships. \nSince 2021 the leg holding the Mixed Relay Championships has also included the reinstated World Triathlon Sprint Championships under the combined branding of World Triathlon Sprint &amp; Relay Championships. The stand-alone Sprint championship had previously been discontinued in 2011. Races in the sprint world championships are held over \"Super-sprint\" distances (300 m swim, 5 km bike, 2.5 km run) using a multi-race eliminator format which is unique to that leg.\nThe final leg of the series is marketed as the Grand Final, and has a greater points allocation, which must be included in the athletes final score ranking for the season along with the four best other results. In addition, the week of the Grand Final also sees age-grade World Championships in one-off races, including an under-23 title considered an elite event, as well as single-race para triathlon championship events.\nHistory.\nWith the establishment of the International Triathlon Union (ITU, now World Triathlon) in 1989 it was quickly established that the governing body should host a yearly world championship to establish the men's and women's world champion. With the creation and hosting of the first ITU Triathlon World Championship in 1989 the ITU had established itself and the sports premier event but the sport overall lacked cohesion with races of varying lengths and prize pools, which increased the difficulty for triathletes to train and plan for seasons ahead. So in 1991 the ITU created the ITU Triathlon World Cup a year long series of races all hosted by the ITU with regular distances and prize money. With a world championship and a regular season established the ITU's attention moved onto other issues including earning the sport a place at the Olympics.\nThen in 2008 the day after the 2008 men's Olympic triathlon race the ITU announced starting next year it would be replacing the single race world championship with a six-race World Championship points super series culminating in a Grand Final, it was to be called the World Championship Series (WCS). The ITU believed it would help grow the sport and increase the reach to the level of major sports whilst gaining a bigger TV audience. Most athletes and professional coaches were happy at the announcement believing it would help the sport become more popular and increase professionalism and pay for the top level athletes. However, there were major monetary concerns one week after the announcement as the ITUs main sponsor BG had pulled out of its nine-year sponsorship deal after only two years.\nBy its start in 2009 the series had gained a title sponsor in Dextro Energy in a $2 million deal allowing for each World Championship event to feature a $150,000 prize purse and for the Grand final to have $250,000, this also meant that $700,000 was available at the end of the series. This influx of cash meant that athletes would be to earn almost triple what they had previously helping to draw more into the sport. In 2011 the sprint distance world championship was incorporated into the series giving the same points and prize money as any other event, from this point on sprint distance events would make up a part of the series. In 2012 Dextro Energy ended their title sponsorship in tandem with the series rebranding itself as the World Triathlon Series. Then in 2013 the prize pool saw an increase to $2.25 million certifying the world triathlon series as the richest series in triathlon. In 2018 with the growing popularity of the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships and the disciplines' addition to the Olympic program it was decided that at three of the events on the 2018 calendar a mixed relay event would be held alongside the men's and women's competition; these three events would grant points towards Olympic qualification and constitute the new mixed relay series.\nOnly two triathletes succeeded in winning World Championships under both formats, Javier Gomez of Spain, and Helen Jenkins (née Tucker) of Great Britain and Wales. In 2020, in response to multiple race cancellations as a result of COVID-19 the Championship was once more decided on the basis of a single Championship race, won by Vincent Luis of France and Georgia Taylor-Brown of Great Britain and England. As Luis had already won a world title in 2019 under the now established season-long format, he in effect became only the third triathlete to win World Championships in both the single race and season-long formats.\nDuring the 2023 events, at least 57 participants fell ill after swimming off Roker Beach in Sunderland. An Environment Agency sample taken three days before the event indicated 3,900 \"E. coli\" colonies per 100ml, over 39 times higher than readings taken the previous month, but the results were not published until after the competition. Northumbrian Water reported that no discharges that would have affected water quality off Roker Beach were recorded since October 2021.\nDisciplines.\nCurrently there are three different distance disciplines:\nIn all instances the swim will be a mass start in open-water and the cycling will be draft-legal. There is an allowed leniency of 10% on each segment of courses route for the standard and sprint distances, with more discretion being allowed for the mixed relay. The standard distance was also known as the Olympic distance as it was the only distance competed for in the Olympics, however the World Triathlon has tried to enforce the use of the name standard distance saving the name Olympic on for official Olympic events.\nChampions.\nMen's championship.\n The athlete won his first title as World Champion under the old world championship system.\n The championship was restricted to a single race event due to COVID 19.\nWomen's championship.\n The athlete won the title of World Champion under the old world championship system.\n The championship was restricted to a single race event due to COVID 19.\nHosts.\nThe World Triathlon Series has visited 27 cities in 19 countries since its founding in 2009.\nWhere GF = Grand Final, MR = Mixed Relay event\nThe final race of each season is known as the grand final and has extra points, prize money and prestige associated with it, when a city bids to host the grand final it also bids to host many World Triathlon events such as the amateur Age-group world championships and the Paratriathlon world championship.\nITU Triathlon World Championship.\nThe world champion was formerly crowned in the ITU Triathlon World Championship, a single championship race that was held annually from 1989, the same year as the formation of the International Triathlon Union (ITU), to 2008."

Constructed in the early twentieth century, this post office features an unusual combination of distinctive architectural styles, and it has been named a historic site.\nArchitecture.\nBuilt in 1913 of brick with an asphalt roof, the post office features substantial amounts of sandstone. Its design, produced under the direction of Oscar Wenderoth, combines prominent elements of two common architectural styles of the early twentieth century. The arched windows display the influence of the Neo-Renaissance style, as do the side quoins and certain details of the portico. Meanwhile, the overall appearance of the facade is clearly Neoclassical, due to details in the portico, the architect's choice of smooth stone for the exterior walls, and the generally symmetrical appearance. One large window sits on either side of the main entrance, which is covered by a four-column portico; the pediment at the top of the portico features a central oculus. The main entrance features a fanlight, an iron frame, and elements in the Corinthian order.\nHistory.\nLocated in downtown Bowling Green, the post office lies at the northern end of the city's main commercial district. As Wood County's leading post office and only substantial federal building, the post office was for many years among the most prominent buildings in the city. The building is no longer used for postal purposes, as the Postal Service moved to another facility in the late 1970s. Since that time, it had served as the Wood County Senior Citizens Center, but even in this new use, it retained its place as a landmark for residents countywide: the Wood County Committee on Aging, which operates numerous centers countywide, used the building as its headquarters.\nIn 1979, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its distinctive historic architecture. It is one of five National Register-listed sites in the city, along with the Main Street Historic District a short distance to the south, the county courthouse downtown, Floral Hall in a city park, and the Boom Town Historic District on the west side.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the building would receive a significant change. Preparation for demolition of the building except for the facade began in December of 2021."

        "text": "The International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament was an international and prestigious junior golf tournament that was held from 1946 to 1968, excluding 1967. The tournament initially had a small field but slowly grew in popularity and competitiveness. Due to a lack of financing, the tournament was discontinued following the 1968 tournament.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nIn 1946, the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce – with encouragement from Herb Graffis, publisher of Golfing and Golfdom magazines – agreed to develop a golf program providing supervised competition for boys on a local, state and national level. Initially modest in significance, only 27 boys from seven states participated in the first International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament held in Spokane, Washington, which was won by Al Mengert. \nFor the second annual tournament, however, full-time personnel worked with local and state sports chairmen to organize and promote the tournament in an effort to raise it to national prominence. Over subsequent tournaments, the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament (known as the National Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament prior to 1953) grew in status and was rivaled only by the U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship and the Western Junior Championship in importance. Jack Nicklaus, the 1957 International Jaycee winner, remarked that \"No other tournament in junior golf forces the best from the young golfers and maintains the interest and enthusiasm as does the Jaycee International. The toughest of the world's junior golf tournaments.\" By 1958, approximately 35,000 boys competed for 220 spots at the 13th International Jaycee. \nEvolving format.\nThe format of the International Jaycee evolved over time. From 1946-1951, 36-hole medal play determined the “cut” for those players moving on to compete for the title under match play competition. Beginning in 1952, match play was eliminated and 72-hole medal play was instituted. A Class B Championship was established for players who did not make the 36-hole cut of the lowest 100 scores. States competed for team titles and a Junior Chamber International match was staged between the top entries of each of the countries entered. Participants qualified for the International Jaycee first though local and then state Jaycee competitions. The top four (some years five) players from each state competition were eligible to play at the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament with expenses paid by grants and sponsors. \nThe golfing talents of the International Jaycee competitors were among the best in the world with many players eventually turning professional. Among winners of the tournament, four players were elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame: Gene Littler, Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd and Ben Crenshaw.\nFinancial struggles.\nDespite the continued popularity of the tournament among players, financial backing of the International Jaycee became problematic. Unable to secure a sponsor in 1967, the tournament was not held (although local and state events continued). The tournament was conducted in 1968 but lack of sponsorship caused the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce to not hold the tournament for 1969. In years following, the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament was not renewed. "

The game featured a 105-yard run by Barlow, described as \"the longest ever seen on Ferry Field.\" Barlow returned a missed dropkick from five yards deep in Michigan's endzone. Almost tackled at the 40-yard line, Barlow was aided by his teammates' blocking and returned the ball all the way for a touchdown. The \"Detroit Free Press\" reported the length of Barlow's (described by the \"Free Press\" as \"little Al Barlow\") run as 110 yards and noted that \"2,000 Michigan rooters rose and cheered wildly as Barlow planted ball behind the enemy's goal, after his record run.\""

        "text": "The 2009 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on January 5 with the start of the 2009 ATP World Tour.\nYear's summary.\nQatar Open.\nNadal's first official ATP tour event for the year was the 250 series Qatar Open in Doha. After his first-round match with Fabrice Santoro, Nadal was awarded the 2008 ATP World Tour Champion trophy. Nadal eventually lost in the quarterfinals to Gaël Monfils. Nadal also entered and won the tournament's doubles event with partner Marc López, defeating the world No. 1 doubles team of Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić in the final. As noted by statistician Greg Sharko, this was the first time since 1990 the world No. 1 singles player had played the world No. 1 doubles player in a final.\nAustralian Open.\nAt the 2009 Australian Open, Nadal won his first five matches without dropping a set, before defeating compatriot Fernando Verdasco in the semifinals in the second longest match in Australian Open history at 5 hours and 14 minutes. This win set up a championship match with Roger Federer, their first meeting ever in a hard-court Grand Slam tournament and their nineteenth meeting overall. Nadal defeated Federer in five sets to earn his first hard-court Grand Slam singles title, making him the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open and the fourth male tennis player—after Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, and Andre Agassi—to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces. This win also made Nadal the first male tennis player to hold three Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces at the same time.\nABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament.\nAt the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, Nadal lost in the final to second-seeded Andy Murray in three sets. During the final, Nadal called a trainer to attend to a tendon problem with his right knee, which notably affected his play in the final set. Although this knee problem was not associated with Nadal's right knee tendonitis, it was serious enough to cause him to withdraw from the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships a week later.\nDavis Cup.\nIn March, Nadal helped Spain defeat Serbia in a Davis Cup World Group first-round tie on clay in Benidorm, Spain. Nadal defeated Janko Tipsarević and Novak Djokovic. The win over world No. 3 Djokovic was Nadal's twelfth consecutive Davis Cup singles match win and boosted his career win–loss record against Djokovic to 11–4, including 6–0 on clay.\nIndian Wells.\nAt the 2009 Indian Wells Masters, Nadal won his thirteenth Masters 1000 series tournament. In the fourth round, Nadal saved five match points, before defeating David Nalbandian for the first time. Nadal defeated Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals and Andy Roddick in the semifinals, before defeating Murray in the final.\nMiami.\nThe next ATP tour event was the 2009 Miami Masters. Nadal advanced to the quarterfinals, where he again faced Argentinian del Potro, this time losing the match. This was the first time del Potro had defeated Nadal in five career matches.\nMonte Carlo.\nNadal began his European clay court season at the 2009 Monte Carlo Masters, where he won a record fifth consecutive singles title there. He defeated Novak Djokovic in the final for his fifth consecutive win, a record in the open era. Nadal is the first male player to win the same ATP Master series event for five consecutive years.\nBarcelona.\nNadal then competed in the ATP 500 event in Barcelona. He advanced to his fifth consecutive Barcelona final, where he faced David Ferrer. Nadal went on to beat Ferrer to record five consecutive Barcelona victories.\nRome.\nAt the Rome Masters, Nadal reached the final, where he defeated Novak Djokovic to improve his overall record to 13–4 and clay record to 8–0 against the Serb. He became the first player to win four Rome titles.\nAfter winning two clay-court Masters, he participated in the Madrid Open. He lost to Roger Federer in the final. This was the first time that Nadal had lost to Federer since the semifinals of the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup.\nOn 19 May, the ATP World Tour announced that Nadal was the first player out of eight to qualify for the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals, to be played at the O2 Arena in London.\nFrench Open.\nBy beating Lleyton Hewitt in the third round of 2009 French Open, Nadal (2005–09 French Open) set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros, beating the previous record of 28 by Björn Borg (1978–81 French Open). Nadal had won 32 consecutive sets at Roland Garros (since winning the last 2 sets at the 2007 French Open final against Federer), the second-longest winning streak in the tournament's history behind Björn Borg's record of 41 consecutive sets. This run came to an end on 31 May 2009, when Nadal lost to eventual runner-up, Robin Söderling in the 4th round in a massive upset. This was Nadal's first loss at the French Open.\nInjury.\nAfter his surprise defeat at Roland Garros, Nadal withdrew from the AEGON Championships. It was confirmed that Nadal was suffering from tendinitis in both of his knees. On 19 June, Nadal withdrew from the 2009 Wimbledon Championship, citing his recurring knee injury. He was the first champion not to defend the title since Goran Ivanišević in 2001. Roger Federer went on to win the title, and Nadal consequently dropped back to world No. 2 on 6 July 2009. Nadal later announced his withdrawal from the Davis Cup.\nReturn.\nOn 4 August, Nadal's uncle, Toni Nadal, confirmed that Nadal would return to play at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. There, in his first tournament since Roland Garros, Nadal lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Martín del Potro. With this loss, he relinquished the No. 2 spot to Andy Murray on 17 August 2009, ranking outside the top two for the first time since 25 July 2005.\nUS Open.\nIn the quarterfinals of the US Open he defeated Fernando González in a rain-delayed encounter. However, like his previous US Open campaign, he fell in the semifinals, this time losing to eventual champion Juan Martín del Potro. Despite the loss, he regained the No. 2 ranking after Andy Murray's early exit.\nWorld Tour Finals.\nAt the World Tour Finals, Nadal lost all three of his matches against Robin Söderling, Nikolay Davydenko, and Novak Djokovic respectively without winning a set.\nDavis Cup final.\nIn December, Nadal participated in the second Davis Cup final of his career. He defeated Tomáš Berdych in his first singles rubber to give the Spanish Davis Cup Team their first point in the tie. After the Spanish Davis Cup team had secured its fourth Davis Cup victory, Nadal defeated Jan Hájek in the first Davis Cup dead rubber of his career. The win gave Nadal his 14th consecutive singles victory at Davis Cup (his 13th on clay).\nYear end ranking.\nNadal finished the year as No. 2 for the fourth time in five years.\nAll matches.\nSingles.\nSource (ATP)\nDoubles.\nSource (ATP)"

As the Astros finished the 2013 season with the worst record, they had the first overall selection for the third consecutive year. In addition, the Toronto Blue Jays got the 11th pick, as compensation for failing to sign Phil Bickford, the 10th overall selection of the 2013 MLB Draft. The St. Louis Cardinals got bumped from #30 to #31 because although tied with the Boston Red Sox for most wins in the 2013 regular season, the Red Sox had fewer wins in 2012.\nKansas City Royals first round draft pick Brandon Finnegan made his Major League debut on September 6, 2014, the first player to reach the majors from the 2014 draft class, with Carlos Rodon the second. Rodon first appeared for the Chicago White Sox on April 21, 2015.

        "text": "The Texas–Arlington Mavericks volleyball team, historically one of the most nationally prominent teams on campus, is an NCAA Division I college volleyball team rejoined the Western Athletic Conference in July 2022. Home games are played at College Park Center, located on University of Texas at Arlington's campus in Arlington. The team has appeared in eight AIAW National Tournaments, eight NCAA Tournaments and one National Invitational Volleyball Championship Tournament, collecting 12 regular seasons titles and ten conference tournament titles along the way. The Mavericks are currently in their longest national post-season drought in program history, with the last appearance coming in the 2002 season.\nTeam history.\nThe Mavericks began competition in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, as the NCAA didn't sponsor women's sports until the early 1980s. UTA's first coach was Jody Conradt who was also the head coach for the basketball and softball teams. Right away, the Mavericks were competitors, appearing in the AIAW National Tournament eight out of a possible nine times, finishing as high as sixth nationally in 1981. They placed in the national tournament every year but one.\nWhen the NCAA began competition, the Mavericks moved over to the Southland Conference, where UTA was a founding member in 1963. The Mavericks immediately became the most dominant team in the conference winning the first nine regular season titles. UTA won the first conference tournament in 1982, but the NCAA structure didn't allow UTA to play in a postseason match. Second-seeded Lamar would win the conference tournament in 1983 and 1984 and again the Mavericks missed playing in the postseason. The Mavericks finally won the SLC tournament in 1985 under Head Coach Lisa Love and would also claim the next five after that. The Mavericks would establish themselves as national contenders as they made four Sweet Sixteen appearances, two Elite Eight's and a Final Four in 1989.\nThe Mavericks slipped in stature during the '90's after Coach Love took over the program at USC. They were no longer the perennial Southland Conference favorite, though they did win three regular season championships in the '90's and two tournament crowns.\nDespite having long been removed from the Southland, the volleyball team still is first in regular season championships and three more tournament titles than second place Texas State.\nUT Arlington would move from the Southland to the Western Athletic Conference in 2012, but would spend only one season in the WAC, moving from there to the Sun Belt Conference. After a later round of conference realignment in the early 2020s led to a major expansion of the Sun Belt's football side, UTA announced in January 2022 that it would return to the WAC that July.\nIn October 2015 against in-state Sun Belt rival Texas State, UTA's volleyball home attendance record was broken with 2,018 fans attending the match.\nFacilities.\nUntil 2012, the Mavericks played at Texas Hall, which is a 3,300-seat theater on the campus. The teams played on the stage, and fans could watch the game from either the theater seats or the bleacher section.\nA new arena called the College Park Center with a seating capacity of 7,000 opened for the 2012 season. The facility is located on the eastern side of the campus along with new housing, parking, and retail developments.\nCoaches.\nThe Mavericks have had 7 coaches, listed below, in their 40+ year history. J.T. Wenger, a former volleyball player at UCLA and former assistant coach at UCLA, Michigan State, and Colorado, is the current head coach. Wenger is also the first male coach in program history. "

He played in two NCAA Final Fours during his career at Butler, as well as professionally for Neptūnas.\nSmith grew up in the Indianapolis, Indiana, area. He attended Covenant Christian High School where he became a star basketball player. During his senior year, he led the state of Indiana in rebounding, was named All-City player of the year, and was selected as a National Christian Schools Athletic Association All-American. After high school, Smith accepted a scholarship offer to play basketball at Butler.\nAt Butler, Smith was a reserve during his freshman year. Despite playing just three minutes during the previous month, he came into Butler's Elite Eight game against Kansas State and played a significant role in helping the school to its first ever Final Four appearance. Smith became a starter shortly after the start of his sophomore year and his emergence as a starter helped Butler return to the Final Four. During Smith's junior year, he led the team in scoring and made more than 52% of his shot attempts. He also expanded his game to include 3-point shooting.\nAs a senior, Smith became a vocal leader for Butler and led the team in rebounding. Butler returned to the NCAA tournament where Smith recorded a career high and Butler tournament record 16 rebounds against Bucknell in a second-round match. Smith was selected as an Academic All-American and Senior CLASS Award recipient. He finished his college career with more than 1000 rebounds and 100 wins, one of just three Butler players to achieve the feat. He married his long-time girlfriend shortly after graduating from Butler with a degree in finance.\nAndrew Smith died from cancer at the age of 25.\nEarly life.\nAndrew Smith was born September 9, 1990, in Washington, D.C. Even at birth, Smith was big, measuring long, about above average. Smith's father, Curt, worked for Senator Dan Coats at the time before returning to his native Indiana when Andrew was a young boy. Curt was a high school basketball player for Pike High School, and was involved with basketball throughout Andrew's youth.\nAndrew Smith grew up in Zionsville, Indiana. By the time he started high school at Covenant Christian, a small school of 300 students in Indianapolis, he stood at . His coach, Scott Flatt, called Smith \"a freak\" of nature because he had enough mobility to guard multiple positions despite his size. During his junior year, he averaged 14.5 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 2.8 blocked shots per game. Over the summer, he scored 28 points in game against top-tier AAU team The Family. Afterwards, recruiting picked up dramatically. Smith accepted an offer from Butler, where his mother was working at the time. He said that as soon as Butler became interested in him, he knew that was where he was going to play his college basketball. \"It's like a perfect fit for me,\" he said.\nDuring his senior year, Smith missed half the season with a stress fracture. Even so, he was named Indianapolis Star All-City Player of the Year and was named to the National Christian Schools Athletic Association (NCSAA) Super Regional Team. He led Covenant Christian to a Class 2A sectional championship, and led the state in rebounding (17.1 per game). He averaged 23.3 points, marking his third straight year of averaging a double-double, and blocked 2.3 shots per game. He was an honorable mention for the All-State team and was a second team NCSAA All-American.\nAfter his senior season, Smith was selected to participate in the Hoosier Basketball Top 60 Senior Boys Workout. He played in the North–South Indiana All-Star Classic and the Hoosiers' Reunion All-Star Classic.\nCollege.\nSmith attended Butler for college. During the 2009–10 season, his freshman year, he was a reserve, playing in 24 games. In an Elite Eight match against Kansas State, Smith was inserted into the lineup when Matt Howard got into early foul trouble. He played five minutes in the first half, helping Butler build an 18–10 lead. Smith also played in the second half, finishing with a season-high 12 minutes. Over the previous month, he had played just three minutes in total. With Smith's help, Butler advanced to the school's first ever Final Four, which happened to be in Indianapolis. At the end of his Butler career, Smith said the Kansas State game was his favorite memory of Butler. Butler ended up making it the NCAA Championship Game.\nDuring his sophomore year, Smith played in all 38 games, starting 32. After Butler got off to a mediocre 3–2 start, Smith was added to the starting lineup. Against Cleveland State, he scored a career-high 22 points and collected 10 rebounds to get his first collegiate double-double. In the final game of the regular season, he played a career-high 36 minutes and recorded 11 rebounds, 3 steals, and 3 blocks, all career highs. Thanks in large part to Smith's emergence as a starter, Butler returned to the NCAA Tournament. During the round of 32, Smith hit a go-ahead basket with less than 3 seconds on the clock to help Butler beat top seeded Pittsburgh. In Butler's sweet 16 match against Wisconsin, Smith hurt his ankle and left the game. However, he returned before the game's end, collecting eight points and six rebounds as Butler advanced to the regional final. Butler again advanced to the Championship game. Smith led the team in rebounding in the regional final against Florida and in the National Championship game against Connecticut. He finished the year as the team's second-leading rebounder (5.6 per game) and third-leading scorer (8.5). He made 59.3% of his field goal attempts and 67.3% of his free throws.\nFollowing the graduation of Howard and the early departure of Shelvin Mack to play in the NBA, Butler struggled during Smith's junior year. Smith, however, continued to put up solid numbers. He recorded two double-doubles, one against Chattanooga and one against Oakland City, and had a game-winning tip-in shot against Purdue. At Loyola, he grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds. At Milwaukee, he recorded four assists and four steals, both career highs. In the first round of the Horizon League tournament, Smith scored a career high 25 points, hitting a career best 12 of 14 free throws, and recording 7 rebounds. Butler failed to make the NCAA Tournament, instead playing in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI). In the semi-finals of the CBI, Smith scored 19 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. For the season, he led the team in scoring with 10.9 points per game. He emerged as a 3-point field goal threat, making 19 of 54 attempts after attempting just one 3-pointer the previous year. Overall, Smith made 52.5% of his field goal attempts and 64.3% of his free throws.\nDuring the off-season, head coach Brad Stevens asked Smith to take on a new role – vocal leader. The role did not fit Smith's natural personality, but he embraced it nonetheless. Entering the 2012–13 season, Smith was the only active college player who had played in two Final Fours. He started 35 games during the year, sitting out one game with an injury. Facing reigning Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the year, St. Joseph's C. J. Aiken, Smith scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. He also recorded double-doubles at Northwestern and at Massachusetts. For the week of January 14, he was named as the Atlantic 10 Player of the Week for his part in back-to-back road victories. At Massachusetts on March 7, Smith became the 11th player in Butler history to surpass 1,000 points and 600 rebounds. In the lone game he missed, Butler was upset at home by Charlotte, underscoring Smith's importance to the team. Butler returned to the NCAA tournament, and Smith recorded 14 points and 16 rebounds against Bucknell in the round of 64. The 16 rebounds represented both a career-high for Smith and a Butler tournament record. In the round of 32, he scored 17 and grabbed a game-high eight rebounds. With Butler trailing by two in the final seconds, Smith got the ball to attempt a game winning three but stumbled and did not get off a good shot.\nSmith led the team in rebounding for the season (6.1 per game) and led Butler in rebounding 13 times. He was second in scoring, averaging 11.3 points. He made 49.6% of his shot attempts and 71.8% of his free throws. Defensively, Smith had strong games against future NBA players Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, and Mike Muscala. He was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Academic Team, and was selected as a second team Academic All-American. He was also a second team Senior CLASS Award selection, recognizing his achievement in athletic competition, character, academics, and community involvement.\nSmith finished his Butler career 5th all-time on the schools list of games played (134), 12th in rebounding (648), and 25th in points scored (1,147). He played in 11 NCAA tournament games, tied for 6th on Butler's all-time list. He scored 73 points in those games, good enough for fifth place all-time, and grabbed 65 rebounds, the second most ever. Smith is just one of three Butler players, along with Howard and Joel Cornette, to amass more than 100 wins and more than 1,000 points in his career. Smith called his Butler experience \"as good as it gets\" and remarked \"I know that I've received a great education to help me in the future and obviously I've had a great basketball career with the success that we've had. It's kind of been a win-win for me and I really have a lot of great opportunities coming out of school.\" He added that the experience prepared him well for a pro career: \"we played just about every single good team you can in my four years there. We contended with just about all of them. [So, ] I know I can play\".\nSmith had finished his Butler classes by February 2013. In between finishing classes and graduation in May, he interned at the Butler Business Accelerator, consulting with pharmaceutical and financial service businesses. Previously, he interned with a venture capital firm during the summer of 2012. Smith graduated in May with a degree in finance.\nProfessional career.\nSmith participated in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, a post-season tournament for NBA prospects, Smith averaged 5.3 points and 6.7 rebounds. Prior to the NBA draft, Smith trained at the St. Vincent Sports Performance Center in Indianapolis, working with former teammates Matt Howard and Gordon Hayward. He said he was concentrating on improving his mid-range game, which he rarely used in college.\nSmith worked out for six NBA teams, including the Indiana Pacers twice. He was not expected to be drafted, but received offers to play for the Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder teams. When he was not drafted, he took the Thunder's offer, playing on their 2013 Summer team.\nOn September 1, 2013, the Lithuanian club Neptūnas announced that they had signed Smith for the 2013–14 season.\nSkill set.\nSmith was listed as tall, weighing . He was a competent 3-point shooter and rarely dunked the ball, both rare traits for a center.\nPersonal life.\nCancer and death.\nSmith's basketball career prematurely ended in January 2014. After noticing a suspicious bump on his neck, he began having increasing difficulty breathing. Initially, it was determined that he did not have cancer, but a later MRI scan revealed a suspected cancerous tumor in one of his lungs, and he returned to the U.S. Doctors in Indianapolis initially determined he was suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and soon made a more specific diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This type of cancer, normally found in children, has a 50-50 survival rate for that age group, but is less survivable for adults. He immediately went on a chemotherapy regimen that had to be specially calibrated for his unusually large frame. While undergoing treatment, he took a job with a leasing and financing company owned by family friends.\nOn July 31, 2014, on his third day on the job, Smith collapsed at his office in a building next to Indianapolis International Airport and went into cardiac arrest for more than 22 minutes before being revived and rushed to a nearby hospital. He was immediately placed into a medically induced coma, and awoke four days later. While doctors would not officially link the cardiac arrest with his cancer battle, both Smith's wife and father believe the two were related. By December of that year, he had completed his final chemotherapy treatment, and went under what is called \"maintenance\" treatment, in which he continued to take several medications. While he had yet to fully regain his strength, he had not suffered any apparent neurological damage from his prolonged cardiac arrest. In a 2015 article on Smith's struggles, CBS Sports journalist Matt Norlander said, \"The fact Andrew left the hospital with full control of his faculties barely a week later – and has not suffered any setbacks – is supernatural.\"\nHe received a bone marrow transplant in November 2015, but his condition worsened; his wife reported in a December 2015 post to their blog that the lymphoma had become an aggressive leukemia. He remained hospitalized until shortly before Christmas, when he was released to spend the holiday at home. Smith's condition worsened again in early January 2016 and he was readmitted to the hospital. Stevens, now the head coach of the Boston Celtics, missed a January 7 game against the Chicago Bulls to visit with Smith, who was reportedly scheduled to receive a second bone marrow transplant that day. Three days later, Smith's wife posted on their blog that he was near death, saying, \"The doctors tell me death is imminent and that Andrew is going to die from this disease. There are no treatments, no clinical trials...there is nothing left to do.\" Smith died in his sleep on January 12, 2016, at the age of 25.\nFollowing his death, the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) named him and his widow as recipients of the 2016 men's version of its Most Courageous Award. The USBWA specifically cited their public battle with cancer and advocacy for bone marrow registry; during his memorial service, the Smith family set up a table in the church lobby to sign up marrow donors.\nFamily.\nSmith's father, Curt, is the president of the Indiana Family Institute. Smith's mother, Debbie, worked as an administrative assistant for Butler University before retiring. Andrew Smith has three siblings: an older brother, Stephen, an older sister Julie, and a younger sister Kimberly. He is distantly related to former Butler player Pete Campbell. Smith's best friend in high school, soccer player Blake Leyden, was his roommate at Butler.\nOn May 18, 2013, Smith married his longtime girlfriend Samantha (née Stage). Stage met Smith through her best friend and Smith's sister, Kimberly. Like Smith, she has a competitive personality and is involved in sports. She played volleyball and tennis in high school. Stage is just tall, leading to numerous funny photo opportunities. For example, at prom, Smith danced with Stage on his knees. While Smith was at Butler, Stage worked as a nanny and took online classes in psychology.\nSmith was called a \"goofball\" and was a self-described introvert. \"He is constantly making me laugh,\" said Stage. Smith said that would have liked to have six children if he and his wife became financially stable.\nFollowing his health crisis in 2014, Smith's coach at Butler, Brad Stevens, said about Smith and his wife,\nIt's miraculous. It's an absolute miracle. There is no other way to interpret this. They've been through more in a 20-month marriage than a lot of people go through in the first 20 years. I was amazed. He amazes me every time I talk to him. When he got to Butler he was a really bright guy trying to find his way playing basketball. He became one of the most confident, toughest, hardest-working players I've ever coached. And Sam is an absolute rock.\nSmith then returned to the job he held before his cardiac arrest, and coached in a church-based youth basketball league. In Norlander's piece, he also briefly discussed his Christian faith, saying,\nI'm not on this earth to go out and play basketball games. I'm on this earth to share a story people can hear ... Our faith gives everything that happened last year a purpose. ... If I was going to bring one person back from a dark place, and we've had hundreds and hundreds of letters, then this entire year was worth it."

        "text": "The 1980 World Championships in Athletics () was the second global, international athletics competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Hosted from 14 to 16 August 1980 at the De Baandert in Sittard, Netherlands, it featured two events: the women's 400 metres hurdles and the women's 3000 metres run. West Germany's Birgit Friedmann took the first women's world title in the 3000 m, while her East German counterpart Bärbel Broschat became the first women's 400 m hurdles world champion.\nSummary.\nHistorically, the IAAF and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed that the Athletics at the Summer Olympics served as the world championship event for the sport. The IAAF began to expand its programme of approved events for women and this conflicted with the Olympic athletics programme. The 400 m hurdles was recently introduced event for female athletes while the 3000 m marked the increasing popularity of long-distance running events among women. Neither event was contested at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The boycott of those Olympics and the presence of the Liberty Bell Classic (an alternative event for the boycotting nations) gave the IAAF additional incentive to hold its own competition; although the Soviet Union withdrew, the events in Sittard attracted entries from countries on both sides of the Western and Eastern divide.\nA total of 42 women from 21 nations entered the competition – there were 18 participants in the 3000 m and 24 athletes in the 400 m hurdles. The hurdles format had four heats of six athletes, two semi-finals of eight athletes, then an \"A\" and a \"B\" final. The 3000 m run had two stages: two heats of nine athletes each, followed by a final of twelve athletes.\nThe tournament followed the 1976 World Championships in Athletics, which featured just one event – the men's 50 kilometres walk – and was organised by the IAAF in reaction to the IOC dropping that event for the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 1980 World Championships preceded the launch of the IAAF's independent global event, with the inaugural 1983 World Championships in Athletics taking place three years later with a programme of 41 events.\nOne athlete, Spain's Rosa Colorado, later had her results at the championships disqualified for doping offences.\n400 metres hurdles results.\nHeats.\nQualifying rule: the first three athletes in each heat (Q) plus the four fastest non-qualifiers (q) progressed to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nQualifying rule: the first four athletes in each semi-final (Q) progressed to the \"A\" final. The remaining non-qualifiers were entered into the \"B\" final.\n3000 metres results.\nHeats.\nQualifying rule: the first five athletes in each heat (Q) plus the two fastest non-qualifiers (q) progressed to the final.\n10,000 metres results.\nHeld alongside the men's international Netherlands vs Ireland vs Wales match, the event saw some invitation events for women which are not considered part of the World Championships. Nevertheless, the 10,000 metres appear in IAAF statistics as it was not part of the Olympic programme at the time."

It is administered by the Fédération Guinéenne de Basket-Ball (FGBB).\nGuinea has played at the AfroBasket six times, with its best performance being a fourth place in 1962.\nHistory.\nEstablishment as an African pioneer (1962).\nGuinea was one of five countries that participated at the African Championship 1962 in Cairo, Egypt.\nGuinea's fourth place finish there remains its best result at the AfroBasket. \nThree Afrobasket qualifications in 50 years (1964–2015).\nAfter the inauguration tournament, Guinea almost completely disappeared from the Afrobasket.\nThe only exception was the time 1980–1985 where the team qualified for the Afrobasket on 3 out of 4 occasions.\nCedric Mansare becomes the leading player (2017–2020).\nFor the AfroBasket 2017 qualification, Cedric Mansare made his debut for the team. The 35-year-old guard has become the go-to player for Guinea ever since.\nAfter a surprising Qualifiers campaign, in which they beat former champion and medal contender Senegal, Guinea finished the regional play-off tied with Mali (3–3) in second place, but the Guineans fell short of automatic qualification for the Final Round due to a lower goal-average. Senegal and Mali secured automatic, Cape Verde was eliminated, but Guinea was awarded a wild card – along with Rwanda.\nThe FIBA AfroBasket 2017 marked Guinea's first appearance in the tournament in more than 32 years.\nUnexpected success (2021).\nAt the AfroBasket 2021 qualification, with Guinea needing to beat Equatorial Guinea in the final day of the Qualifiers, Cedric Mansare made four of his eight three-pointers attempts to finish with a team-high 18 points in the 80–71 victory.\nThroughout the campaign, Mansare averaged 11.5 points per game. Joining Mansare as Guinea central players, were power forward Ousmane Dramé, who contributed 8.2 rebounds in six games, and guard Ahmed Doumbia. \nAhmed Doumbia only played the last three games of the Qualifiers, but he was immense for Guinea, averaging 13 points and 5.7 assists. With Guinea on the brink of elimination, Doumbia explained why he didn't want to miss such opportunity. \"We want to bring our flag to the AfroBasket, putting our country on the basketball map. This is my main motivation.\"\nŽeljko Zečević takes over (2021–present).\nIn 2021, the team qualified again. This was accomplished under the Serbian head coach Željko Zečević who replaced Frenchman Michel Perrin at the helm ahead of the decisive last window of the Qualifiers in February 2021. \nAs of 2021, Zečević had coaching experience not only as head coach of Egypt at the AfroBasket 2009 but he had also managed a number of African clubs.\nSome of his coaching highlights in African included a Second-Place in the 2019 FIBA AfroLeague at the helm of Morocco's AS Sale. Zečević had further led US Monastir to the Third-Place of the 2017 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup.\nAt the AfroBasket 2021 in Kigali, Guinea was drawn in Group B alongside Central African Republic, Egypt and Tunisia, which are three former AfroBasket champions.\nGuinea entered as the lowest-ranked of the 16-team AfroBasket 2021 line-up.\nYet, they finished 8th out of 16, Guinea's best placement in almost 60 years.\nPerformance at AfroBasket.\nGuinea has played at the AfroBasket (formerly the FIBA Africa Championship) six times, with its first appearance during the inaugural season in 1962. Its first appearance was its best one as the team finished in fourth place. After 18 years of absence, Guinea returned to the tournament in 1980 and later played in the 1983 and 1985 editions. After another 22 years of absence, the team returned in 2017. In the 2021 tournament, which Guinea qualified for through a wild card, they reached the quarter-finals for the first time.\n Fourth place  \nPerformance at AfroCan.\n Fourth place  \nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the AfroBasket 2021.\nPast rosters.\nRoster for the AfroBasket 2017.\nAt the 2015 Afrobasket qualification:\nUnder-18 team.\nAt the 2020 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship in Cairo, Egypt, the Guineans finished fourth.

        "title": "1963–64 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1963–64 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team represented the University of Michigan in college ice hockey. In its seventh year under head coach Al Renfrew, the team compiled a 24–4–1 record (12–2 against Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) opponents) and outscored all opponents 217 to 80. The Wolverines advanced to the 1964 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. They defeated the Providence Friars in the first round of the Frozen Four and then defeated the Denver Pioneers by a 6–3 score in the national championship game in Denver, Colorado.\nGoalie Bob Gray was chosen as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament. He had four shutouts and a .914 save percentage for the season. The team's leading scorer was junior forward Gary Butler with 38 goals, 30 assists, and 68 total points. Team captain Gordon Wilkie followed with 16 goals, 51 assists, and 67 total points. The team set a new program record with 24 wins, eclipsing the old record of 23 set in the 1949–50 season.\nSeason.\nMichigan was looking for redemption after an abysmal season the year before where they finished dead-last in the WCHA and went winless in the Big Ten. The team was fairly young, with only four seniors on the roster (Gary Butler, Ron Coristine, Bob Gray and team captain Gordon Wilkie) but this year's sophomore class turned out to be one of the best.\nThe Wolverines opened at home against Queen's, winning both games 9–5 and piling up 141 shots in the two contests. After a weekend off the maize and Blue played host to Toronto and split the series. The second game provided Michigan with their first shutout since December 1960, coincidentally that was also against the Varsity Blues.\nThe team closed up shop during the winter break and returned to the ice a week before the spring semester began with a trip to Minnesota where they played a pair of series against the Golden Gophers and Minnesota–Duluth. After dominating the Bulldogs Michigan opened their conference schedule with a 5–1 win against Minnesota before their Big Ten rival repaid the favor with a 6–5 victory. The Wolverine's offense was firing on all cylinders at this time with the team averaging 7 goals per game. Gary Butler was leading in all three scoring categories (15 goals, 12 assists, 27 points) while the top line of Butler-Wilkie-Cole had combined to nearly equal all their opponent's goal totals (26 vs. 28). As the second semester began the team welcomed a new addition in Mel Wakabayashi. The Wolverines celebrated by thoroughly dominating visiting Loyola in two games, outscoring their opponents 26-3 in the series. Eleven different players scored goals against the Warriors but it was sophomore Wilf Martin who led the way with 5 goals and 4 assists over the weekend. With Michigan having built their record to 8–2 head coach Al Renfrew thought his team had a chance to be better than his third-place squad two years earlier but it still had work to do.\nThe following weekend Michigan Tech arrived in town and though they were having a relatively poor season the Huskies had typically given Michigan a good showing. In the first game the Wolverines were the better team from the start, winning 6–2 with some heroics from Bob Gray in the middle frame. The second game was a much tighter affair with Gray and Tech netminder Garry Bauman keeping everyone off of the scoresheet until 3 seconds remained in the second when Wilf Martin broke the tie. The floodgates opened in the third with MTU and Michigan exchanging goals 6 times before sophomore Barry MacDonald salted the game away and the Wolverines skated off with a 5–3 victory.\nAfter downing a bad Colorado College team in two home games, Michigan went on the road to play two Ohio teams for the first time in program history. In the game against Ohio Michigan got off to a fast start and never looked back, scoring seven times in the opening frame. The Bobcats responded in the second, upping their play and coming close to scoring several times but Bob Gray kept everything out of the net. The extra effort seemed to sap Ohio who were outshot 21–2 in the third period and allowed a further 6 goals. Gray's shutout was his third of the season and set a new team record. The following night Michigan took on football rival Ohio State in the Buckeyes' first season on the ice. Because Ohio State was hampered by injuries the teams agreed to play with a running clock but that still didn't prevent Michigan from establishing several new program records. Michigan scored 21 goals to set both a program record and an NCAA record (since tournament play began) not only for the most goals scored in a game but for the largest margin of victory. The offensive outburst also raised Michigan's production to more than 9 goals per game. Backup goaltender Bill Bieber was in net and recorded the first shutout of his varsity career while Bob Gray played center and scored the first goals of his college career, including the 18th marker of the game that broke the previous program record.\nThe Wolverines returned to Michigan and began a home-and-home series against arch-rival Michigan State. The Maize and Blue won the first game 2–0 with bob Gray earning his fourth shutout of the season, increasing his program record and establishing a mark that wouldn't be broken until 1996. The win was also the third consecutive shutout for Michigan, a record that still stands (as of 2018). In the second Game Michigan scored early and shortly thereafter MSU's starting netminder, Harry Woolf, had to be removed due to back spasms. Backup Alex Terpay stopped several breakaways but the Spartans were outmatched and Michigan scored the next four goals before MSU could answer. State's first goal, at 16:12 in the second, ended a 232 and 18 second shutout streak for the Wolverines that had begun two weeks earlier against Colorado College; It is by far the longest such period in team history.\nMichigan continued their Big Ten and WCHA dominance the following week with a pair of wins against Minnesota before hitting the road again and heading to Houghton. Michigan suffered only their third loss of the season in a fight-filled affair with Tech while Bauman held Michigan to a season-low 1 goal. With Bieber in net for the second game Michigan rebounded to earn a split while Michigan Tech lost Scott Watson for the season with a broken leg. Michigan finished out their schedule with a second home-and-home series against MSU, winning both games easily to finish atop both the Big Ten and WCHA standings. It was the Wolverines third Big Ten title and their first WCHA crown since the league had reformed in 1959.\nBecause of the peculiarities of the WCHA schedule requirement, Michigan had not played either Denver or North Dakota during the season. While the Fighting Sioux had a relatively poor season, Denver had finished second in the league and likely would have put up much tougher competition that the Wolverines had faced to that point. In any event the Wolverines used their top billing to host Michigan Tech in the WCHA first round series. While Renfrew didn't think his team played particularly well the Wolverines skated away with a narrow 4–3 victory in the first game with Wilf Martin recording the game-winner. With only a 1-goal lead to work with Michigan had to scramble when Tech opened the scoring with a goal in the first. The Wolverines tied the game before the frame ended but MTU got their second lead early in the middle period. Michigan responded with two goals of their own before exchanging a pair late to enter the third with Michigan up 4–3. Tech refused to quit and opened a barrage on Bob Gray, scoring twice to take the lead 5–4. While Michigan Tech was ahead after 60 minutes the series was now tied at 8 goals apiece and Michigan played in its first overtime game of the season. It took two extra periods to decide the series but in the end it was Blue's Jack Cole who sent Michigan to the WCHA title game.\nMichigan welcomed Denver into Ann Arbor and, despite hiving to travel from Colorado after having played the night before, the Pioneers were the team with live legs. Denver scored twice in the first five minutes of the game and while Michigan halved their lead the Wolverines were uncharacteristically lethargic after their double overtime victory. Michigan had several chances to score but could only find the back of the net twice while DU was able to put six behind Bob Gray on only 16 shots.\nDespite the unsatisfying finish to the conference tournament, Michigan's runner-up finish and WCHA regular season title earned them the second western seed and the Wolverines headed to Denver to participate in their 12th NCAA championship. Michigan opened against ECAC Hockey champion Providence and squeaked by the Friars 3–2 to set up a rematch with Denver for the NCAA championship. Playing in their home building, the Pioneers started the game by firing 15 shots on goal in the first but Bob Gray turned everything away, allowing Wilf Martin to open the scoring with just under 2 minutes left. Wakabayashi increased the Wolverines' lead with a power play marker early in the second and was followed soon thereafter by Jack Cole to build the Michigan lead to 3–0. Denver was able to close the gap with two goals in the final 15 minutes of the period but when Cole scored his second of the night early in the third Michigan put the pressure on the Pioneers. Future NHLer Wayne Smith cut the lead to 1 just before the half-way point of the period but Michigan's offense took over and scored twice more to take revenge on Denver and win their seventh National championship, the first under Renfrew.\nWilkie, Polanic and Gray were named to All-Tournament first team while MacDonald and Wakabayashi made it onto the second team. Gray received the tournament MOP for his stellar play.\nAfter the season Wilkie and Polanic were named as AHCA All-Americans and were joined by Butler on the All-WCHA First Team. Renfrew received the WCHA Coach of the Year while Polanic was awarded the WCHA Sophomore of the Year. For the only time in league history (as of 2018) the WCHA did not name a Most Valuable Player.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season, Michigan compiled a 24–4–1. Its schedule was as follows.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n1964 championship game.\nThe 1964 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was held at University of Denver Arena in Denver, Colorado, on March 20 and 21, 1964. The teams invited to participate in the Frozen Four were the Providence Friars and the RPI Engineers from the East and Michigan and the Denver Pioneers from the West.\nOn March 20, 1964, Michigan defeated Providence by a 3–2 score in a semifinal game. Michigan trailed, 2–1, but tied the game on a goal by Ron Coristine at 12:33 of the third period. Gary Butler scored the winning goal on a pass from Gordon Wilkie at 15:23 of the third period.\nOn March 21, 1964, the Wolverines faced the Denver Pioneers in the championship game. Michigan had lost to Denver by a 6–2 score in the finals of the WCHA Tournament one week earlier in Ann Arbor. In the NCAA championship game, Michigan took a 1–0 lead after 18 minutes of play on a goal by Wilf Martin. The Wolverines increased the lead to 2–0 with a goal by center Mel Wakabayashi at 2:19 of the second period. One minute later, they extended the lead to 3–0 on a goal by Jack Cole. Denver closed the score to 4–3 in the third period. Michigan scored twice in the final four minutes. Center Mel Wakabayashi and Jack Cole each scored two goals for Michigan."

        "text": "Peter George Derek Robbins (21 September 193325 March 1987), also known as P. G. D. Robbins, was an international rugby union player who earned 19 caps playing for England.\nLife.\nRobbins was born in Coventry on 21 September 1933, with his twin David, the eighth and ninth children of twelve by Charles and Jessamine Robbins. He was educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, with National Service in the Royal Air Force Regiment in between. After university, he took a position as a French and Latin teacher at King Edward's School, Birmingham from 1958 to 1968, before going into commerce. After several employments he eventually set up his own company, West Midlands Cleaning Services in 1979. He was also a public speaker and a writer, being Rugby correspondent for the Financial Times.\nHe married Eileen Lemon, whom he met while she was still at school, in September 1958 and they had two children, Richard and Helen.\nAlong with many other rugby players he was a keen golfer, and it became his main sporting activity after he finished playing rugby. He liked jazz music and played the double bass.\nHe died 25 March 1987 in the Priory Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham of a cerebral haemorrhage.\nOn 2 March 1988 a match between Penguin International RFC and Oxford University RFC was played as the P G D Robbins memorial match.\nSporting career.\nRobbins played the position then known as wing forward in the back row, firstly for Coventry and Oxford University where he earned 4 “blues” and was captain of his final match. He played in the combined Oxford and Cambridge team's international tours in 1955, 1956 and 1957. It was while still a student that he played for England the first time on 21 January 1956, against Wales. He went on to play for England a total of 19 times, the last being 17 March 1962 against Scotland.\nAfter leaving university he joined Moseley Rugby Football Club, which he captained, then later went back to Coventry, which he also captained. He also played 12 games for the Barbarians rugby team, including captain in 1959, and was player-manager for the 1963 Oxford and Cambridge rugby tour of East and South Africa.\nHe was selected for the British Lions tour of New Zealand in 1959, but broke his leg in a Barbarians match, and thus never had this sporting honour.\nOn the field, he was known for his speed, and according to fellow team player M. J. K. Smith \"I never saw him commit a foul in his life.\"\nThe Rugby Football Union barred Robbins from any activity associated with the national amateur game (playing, coaching etc.), when he started contributing to the Financial Times on rugby matters, counting him as a professional.\nQuotation.\n“What is rugby? It is a strong drink to be sipped slowly and in the company of true friends”"

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Ladies' singles",
        "text": "The ladies' single skating competition of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia. The short program took place on 19 February 2014, and the free skating took place on 20 February. Adelina Sotnikova of Russia won the gold medal, generating much controversy over the partiality of the judges and the new scoring system.\nResult and subsequent debate.\nWith an overall score of 224.59 points, seventeen-year-old Adelina Sotnikova became one of the youngest figure-skating Olympic champions, edging out silver-medalist and defending-champion Yuna Kim and bronze-medalist Carolina Kostner.\nAfter the short program, Kim was in first place, .28 points ahead of Sotnikova. In the free-skate program, Sotnikova performed, in terms of base points, a more challenging routine than Kim, giving her more opportunities for points. In addition to more triple jumps and more difficult footwork (as determined by the caller), Sotnikova performed a double Axel-triple toe loop, challenging combination that Kim did not attempt. However, Sotnikova's routine also featured a relatively significant error—she stepped out of a jumping combination— while Kim's program was executed without any glaring missteps. The judges assessed Kim's free-skate program as having demonstrated greater artistry; her component score was .09 points higher than Sotnikova's. But Sotnikova's base technical score (a measurement of the difficulty of executed moves) was 3.94 points higher than Kim's, and her grade of execution score (based on the average technical evaluation of each element, examining whether the proper edge was used, the speed carried into and out of a jump, jump positioning, and more) was scored 1.91 points higher.\nThe result sparked a debate over the judges' objectivity, spurred in part by the composition of the judging panel, which included judges from four former Soviet bloc nations, including Russia. The Russian judge, Alla Shekhovtsova, was one of several people Sotnikova embraced prior to the flower ceremony. Over 1.7 million people signed a Change.org petition calling for an investigation into the outcome. That petition attracted a million signatures faster than any previous Change.org petition; at one point, it was attracting 100,000 new signatures every 15 minutes, with 90% of signatures coming from inside Korea.\nSeveral commentators attributed the result to the revised scoring system that had been adopted in 2006, a system generally thought to \"favor mathematics at the expense of artistry\": Alice Park, writing for \"Time\", suggested that, contrary to popular belief, Sotnikova's surprising win was a consequence of objectivity rather than subjectivity: specifically, she argued, the redesigned scoring system heavily rewarded technical difficulty, giving a substantial advantage to those with more challenging starting programs, while de-emphasizing the judge's impression of performers. Bryan Armen Graham, writing for \"The Atlantic\", contended that the polarized reaction to the result was due to a generational gap brought about by the changed scoring system, saying, \"Those who came up watching figure skating under the old 6.0 system are probably accustomed to more leeway in the judging.\" Some in the skating community also seemed to take this view: While noting that she \"personally enjoyed Yuna Kim's performance more,\" Michelle Kwan, two-time Olympic medalist and five-time World champion, stated, \"Under the scoring system, hands down, Adelina won.\" Four-time men's champion Kurt Browning said that \"Yuna Kim outskated [Sotnikova], but it's not just a skating competition anymore—it's math.\" And Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said that, while Sotnikova's skating was not as aesthetically pleasing as Kim's, her athletic style \"check[ed] off every box\" and \"d[id] everything the judges are looking for.\"\nBeyond the scoring system, the results seemed to divide former professional skaters:\nKatarina Witt, a two-time Olympic champion, said, \"I am stunned by this result, I don't understand the scoring.\" Two-time bronze medalist Michael Weiss attributed Sotnikova's scores to \"home-field inflation.\" But three-time world champion and two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko said that the result \"was totally fair,\" as \"Kim didn't have enough technical ammunition.\" And Alexei Mishin, the Russian 1969 world medalist and coach to three Olympic champions, said that \"Sotnikova's victory [was] absolutely natural and objective,\" and claimed that \"some are [simply] jealous of Sotnikova's success.\"\nOfficial responses.\nOn 21 February 2014, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement which asserted all rules and procedures were applied during the competition and declared confidence \"in the high quality and integrity of the ISU judging system\", noting \"judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges\" and that all nine judges on the free skating panel were from different nations.\nOn 10 April, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) and the Korean Skating Union (KSU) filed an official complaint with the ISU Disciplinary Commission (DC) concerning judging. The complaint was regarding \"the wrongful constitution of the panel of judges and the unjust outcome of the competition\". It requested that the DC conduct a thorough investigation, \"take appropriate disciplinary actions against the concerned individuals\", and institute corrective actions. On 14 April, the DC ruled the complaint inadmissible because a general request for investigation is not within DC's jurisdiction and the complaint was not addressed at an individual or federation as required.\nOn 30 April, the KOC and KSU filed a second official complaint with the DC. This time the complaint was against Russian judge Alla Shekhovtsova and the Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR), specifically citing a hug Shekhovtsova shared with Sotnikova and Shekhovtsova's marriage to the current Director General of the FSFR. On 30 May, the DC dismissed the complaint. It ruled Shekhovtsova \"is not responsible for the judging panel's composition\", her marriage did not create a conflict of interest, and, since Sotnikova initiated the hug, Shekhovtsova did not break any rules by responding.\nRecords.\nFor complete list of figure skating records, see list of highest scores in figure skating.\nThe following ISU season best scores (2013–2014) were set during this competition:\nResults.\nShort program.\nThe short program (SP) took place on 19 February 2014.\nFree skating.\nThe Free skating took place on 20 February 2014.\nOverall.\nThe skaters are ranked according to their overall score.\nJudges and officials.\nShort Program judges\nJudge 1: Robert Rosenbluth\nJudge 2: Karen Howard\nJudge 3: Franco Benini\nJudge 4: Birgit Föll\nJudge 5: Diana Stevens\nJudge 6: Nobuhiko Yoshioka\nJudge 7: Katarina Henriksson\nJudge 8: Adriana Domanska\nJudge 9: Koh Sung-Hee\nFree Skating judges\nJudge 1: Birgit Föll\nJudge 2: Yuri Balkov\nJudge 3: Franco Benini\nJudge 4: Zanna Kulik\nJudge 5: Nobuhiko Yoshioka\nJudge 6: Alla Shekhovtsova\nJudge 7: Hélène Cucuphat\nJudge 8: Karen Howard\nJudge 9: Adriana Domanska"

He opened an art studio in New Hampshire where he created physical artwork on canvas. Johnson also ventured into the new and fast-growing medium of NFTs. He sold multiple pieces in early 2020, selling one NFT in April for six Ethereum or approximately $940. His works frequently depicted black children in an inspirational or encouraging light.\nIn partnership with a blockchain-based art platform, Johnson unveiled a new piece called \"'sä-v(ə-)rən-tē:\" on October 28, 2020. The inspiration stems from overhearing his then 4-year-old nephew ask his mother, \"Can astronauts be Black?\" Johnson's stated mission was to take two black youths who faced adversity and give them \"sovereignty\" or in other words empower them. The scene features two boys on one side of a door with an astronaut on the other. Every year on the boys’ birthdays, a QR code will pop up over the original artwork asking for Bitcoin donation. The door that is standing between them will open more each year, for eleven years, until they are face to face. This will happen on the boys 18th birthday. The boys becoming face-to-face with the astronaut is meant to symbolize them becoming adults and finally able to pursue their dreams while having options, due to the donations of the viewers.\n\"'sä-v(ə-)rən-tē:\" was made available to purchase on October 29, 2020. After a period of bidding, it was sold for $117,278. At the time it was the second highest sale price for an NFT art piece, right behind \"Block 21\" which sold at Christie's for $130K.\nPersonal life.\nDuring the 2014 season, Johnson took online classes through Indiana University to finish his degree. Along with his baseball career, he is also an artist and posts many of his works on his Instagram page. He intends to go to law school after his playing career, with the goal of becoming an MLB general manager."

        "title": "St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton",
        "text": "St Michael and All Angels is a Grade I listed church on the estate of the Duke of Beaufort in the village of Great Badminton, Gloucestershire, England. Attached to the Duke of Beaufort's residence, Badminton House, it is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Gloucester. Although within the grounds of the Badminton Estate, the church is owned, and its upkeep met, by the Badminton's Parochial Church Council, rather than the Ducal estate. There is a smaller church of the same name in the neighbouring hamlet of Little Badminton.\nBuilding.\nThe current church was built in 1785 by Charles Evans in the style of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, in miniature, but with a plain tower. The medieval predecessor church, which was then demolished, lay slightly further to the west.\nThe nave of the church has a tunnel-vault with ornamental panelled plasterwork and classical four-bay arcades and aisles with four small saucer domes. The chancel and apse were added in 1875 to accommodate the elaborate monument to Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort by Grinling Gibbons. The 1st Duke was buried alongside his ancestors in the Beaufort Chapel in St George's Chapel, Windsor, but the monument was moved to Badminton in 1878.\nWithin the church, the pulpit and box pews date from 1785, while the organ case, choir stalls, reredos and communion rail were made by Temple Moore in 1908. The eight windows for the aisles, four on each side, have stained glass of 1846-1847 by Thomas Willement with heraldic designs, blue borders, and badges in the yellow of the Beaufort livery.\nSomerset family tombs.\nSt Michael and All Angels serves as the principal burial place of the Somerset family of Badminton House. Until about 1910, the Dukes and Duchesses of Beaufort and distinguished relatives were buried in a vault under the church. The later Dukes and Duchesses were interred in the tiny churchyard.\nWithin the church, the monument to the 1st Duke of Beaufort (1629–1700) by Grinling Gibbons is now on the north side of the chancel, and consists of an effigy of the Duke in Garter robes, reclining on a sarcophagus and a plinth with relief of St George and the Dragon. There are twin Corinthian columns with embossed shafts, acanthus frieze, cornice with flaming urns, and the Duke's arms and supporters. At the top, 25 ft from the ground, is a tasselled cushion supporting a coronet; on the plinth are full-length female figures of Justice and Truth. Above the Duke's effigy, parted curtains show the heavenly host with palms and crowns. The Latin inscription displays the names of his family and the many offices he held. Two of his successors, the 2nd Duke (1684–1714) and the 3rd Duke (1707–1745), are commemorated in the East end of the north aisle by a splendid monument by John Michael Rysbrack, signed and dated 1754. The two dukes are depicted in Roman costume, one standing, the other seated on the sarcophagus and holding a medallion. Decorative, asymmetrical drapery hangs down over the sarcophagus.\nBurials of members of the Somerset family in and near the church include:"

        "text": "David Boyle (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He played for the Canberra Raiders in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition and for the Bradford Bulls in the Super League. Boyle played in the backs, chiefly at . He is the father of Morgan Boyle and Millie Boyle.\nPlaying career.\nCanberra.\nBoyle was graded by the Raiders during the 1990 season. He made his first grade debut from the bench in his sides' 20–18 win over the Gold Coast Seagulls at Bruce Stadium in round 4 of the 1991 season. Boyle also scored his first try in his debut match. He was one of the Raiders' shining prospects when the club was forced to release several star players due to salary cap problems at the end of the 1991 season. Most of the Raiders players (including Boyle himself) agreed to take a pay cut to keep the side together. The Raiders missed the finals for the first time since 1986 when they finished twelfth in the 1992 season.\nThe Raiders came back strongly in 1993, with their international stars Mal Meninga, Ricky Stuart, Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde and Steve Walters, alongside tryscoring Fijian sensation Noa Nadruku (22 tries for the season) leading the way. Canberra finished third after the regular season, and were premiership favorites until their fateful round 21 match with the hapless Parramatta at Bruce Stadium. Halfback Ricky Stuart badly broke and dislocated his right ankle in the second half and despite a club record 68–0 win, without their chief playmaker, the Raiders fell apart. They lost their last regular season game to the Canterbury Bulldogs 32–8, before meekly going out in straight sets in the finals with losses to eventual Grand Finalists St. George Dragons and premiers the Brisbane Broncos.\nIn the 1994 season, the Raiders once again finished third in the regular season, and went on to win their third premiership title. In the 1994 Grand Final against the Canterbury Bulldogs in which the Raiders won 36–12, Boyle, along with Jason Death were both listed on the four-man interchange bench, but were not used in the game. In the 1995 season, the Raiders finished second after losing only two matches in the regular season, and once again looked like title contenders. They lost in the preliminary final to the Canterbury Bulldogs 25–6. In the 1998 season, his final season at the Raiders, Boyle had his best season, after playing in 22 of their 26 games, he finished the season with 11 tries second only to Mark McLinden. Boyle left the Raiders at the conclusion of the 1998 season.\nBradford Bulls.\nIn 1999, Boyle joined English Super League side Bradford. After playing 56 games and scoring 17 tries for the Bulls, Boyle decided to retire at the end of the 2000 Super League season.\nCountry.\nAfter he retired from Super League, Boyle served as captain-coach of Narooma Devils in the Group 16 competition, leading them to the Clayton Cup in 2003."

Senanayake had warned Buttler twice before in the same game about moving out of his crease, before he removed his bails and appealed to umpire Michael Gough. Speaking after the game, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews defended the decision by saying \"what we did was completely within the rules.\" England coach Peter Moores said he was \"disappointed\" in Mathew's decision. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said it was \"no way to play the game\", but another former captain, Michael Atherton, defended the decision saying \"You see a lot of batsmen wandering aimlessly out of their ground. It's a good lesson for him – don't be dozy and keep your bat in your crease\". Australian captain Michael Clarke said that \"I think as long as the player's warned, it's in the rules so you can make whatever decision you want\". Buttler's dismissal by Senanayake was the first instance of Mankading in international cricket since Peter Kirsten's innings was ended by Kapil Dev during an ODI between South Africa and India in 1992."

        "text": "Jeff Heath (born May 14, 1991) is a former American football safety. He played college football at Saginaw Valley State University. Heath signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2013. He also played for the Las Vegas Raiders and New Orleans Saints.\nEarly years.\nHeath attended Lake Orion High School where he practiced football and soccer. He was selected as the Big Play Player of the Year for kicking a game-winning 49 yard field goal to give Lake Orion a playoff victory and regional title over Sterling Heights Stevenson. The team advanced to the Michigan Division 1 state championship game in 2008 before falling to Rockford High School.\nAs a senior, he started as a defensive back, wide out, kicker and punter, voted team captain and received All-North conference honors.\nCollege career.\nHeath accepted a football scholarship from Saginaw Valley State University, an NCAA Division II program and a member of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. He was not heavily recruited out of high school, and was only offered a partial scholarship with SVSU. As a freshman, he appeared in 5 games (one start), tallying 13 tackles (4 solo), one interception, one tackle for a loss, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and one pass defensed.\nAs a sophomore, he appeared in 8 games (7 starts), tallying 49 tackles (3.5 for loss), one interception and 2 fumble recoveries. As a junior, he started all 11 games, registering 81 tackles (9 for loss), one sack, 3 passes defended, one interception, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\nAs a senior, he started all games, recording 77 tackles (3 for loss), 5 interceptions, 7 passes defended, one forced fumble and 2 fumble recoveries. He finished his college career after starting 30-of-35 games, posting 219 tackles (16.5 for loss), 7 interceptions, 4 forced fumbles and 4 fumble recoveries.\nHeath majored in criminal science at Saginaw Valley State.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nHeath didn't receive an invitation to perform at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. On March 11, 2013, Heath participated at the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's pro day. Team representatives and scouts from a few teams attended Heath's pro day, including the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Heath was projected to be a seventh round pick or priority undrafted free agent by NFL draft experts. He was ranked as the 27th best strong safety prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2013 season.\nOn April 27, 2013, the Cowboys signed Heath to a three-year, $1.48 million contract with a signing bonus of $2,000 after he went undrafted in the 2013 NFL Draft. The Cowboys were the first team to call Heath and extend a contract offer.\nThroughout training camp, Heath competed for a roster spot as a backup safety and special teams player against Brandon Underwood, Matt Johnson, Micah Pellerin, Jakar Hamilton, and Eric Frampton. He impressed coaches with his preseason performance and made a total of 16 combined tackles (11 solo) and a forced fumble in five preseason games. Heath made the active roster as the fifth safety on the Cowboys' depth chart and special teams player after Johnson was placed on injured reserve due to a foot injury. Head coach Jason Garrett named Heath a backup free safety to start the regular season, behind Barry Church and Danny McCray.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Cowboys' season-opener against the New York Giants and assisted on one tackle during their 36–31 victory. On October 27, 2013, Heath earned his first career start after J. J. Wilcox was inactive and missed three games (8-10) due to a knee injury. Heath finished the Cowboys' 31–30 loss at the Detroit Lions with a season-high nine combined tackles and a forced fumble, but was also part of a highlight reel reception, when he lost a jump ball to Calvin Johnson. The next two games proved to be difficult, with Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson running over him for a touchdown and being beaten for 3 touchdowns while playing against the New Orleans Saints.\nIn Week 12, although Wilcox returned from injury, Heath remained the starter, making six combined tackles and returned a fumble recovery for his first career touchdown in the Cowboys' 24–21 win at the Giants. Heath recovered a fumble by wide receiver Victor Cruz and returned it for a 50-yard touchdown after it was stripped by teammate Orlando Scandrick during the second quarter. On December 22, 2013, he recorded five combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first career interception during a 24–23 victory at the Washington Redskins in Week 16. Heath made his first career interception off a pass by Redskins' quarterback Kirk Cousins, that was originally intended for wide receiver Santana Moss, in the second quarter. \nHe finished his rookie season in 2013 with 60 combined tackles (47 solo), three pass deflections, an interception, a fumble recovery, a touchdown and 13 special teams tackles (led the team) in 16 games with nine starts. Heath also led the Cowboys with 13 combined tackles on special teams. Heath's rookie season was largely seen as a disappointment due to issues he had in pass coverage. He was repeatedly targeted and gave up multiple receptions during the 2013 season.\n2014 season.\nOn January 28, 2014, the Cowboys promoted defensive line coach Rod Marinelli to defensive coordinator after they opted to transition former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin to assistant head coach/defense. They chose to make the change after the Cowboys finished last in the league in defense and allowed the most yards in franchise history. Heath competed against J.J. Wilcox, Matt Johnson, and Jakar Hamilton for the job as the starting free safety during training camp. Garrett named Heath the backup strong safety, behind J.J. Wilcox, to start the regular season.\nIn Week 7, Heath collected a season-high five combined tackles in the Cowboys' 31–21 win against the Giants. On November 23, 2014, Heath made three solo tackles before fracturing his thumb during a 31–21 victory at the New York Giants. He was sidelined for the next two games (Weeks 13–14) due to his thumb injury. Heath finished the 2014 season with 16 combined tackles (10 solo) and 8 special teams tackles (fourth on the team) in 14 games with zero starts.\nThe Cowboys finished first in the National Football Conference (NFC) East with a 12–4 record, earning a playoff berth. On January 4, 2015, Heath appeared in his first career playoff game and made two solo tackles during a 24–20 victory against the Lions in NFC Wildcard Game. The following week, he recorded seven solo tackles and deflected a pass attempt during a two-point conversion after replacing Barry Church in the second half of the Cowboys' 26–21 loss at the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Round.\n2015 season.\nGarrett named Heath the backup free safety to start the regular season in 2015, behind starter J. J. Wilcox. On November 1, 2015, Heath was involved in a violent collision with Seahawks' wide receiver Ricardo Lockette during the second quarter of a 13–12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 8. The incident happened while Heath was on punt coverage and Lockette a gunner and running downfield as Heath delivered a block to Lockette who was unaware of the impending blow. Lockette was immediately rendered unconscious and was carted off the field and transported to the hospital. Heath received a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness and Lockette was diagnosed with a severe concussion and underwent surgery to stabilize ligaments in his neck. The collision and injury effectively ended Lockette's career and forced him into retirement. In Week 9, he collected a season-high six combined tackles during a 33–27 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. \nOn November 15, 2015, Heath recorded two solo tackles, two pass deflections, and two interceptions in the Cowboys' 10–6 loss at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 10. Heath made his first interception of his career off a pass by quarterback Jameis Winston, that was originally intended for tight end Brandon Myers, in the second quarter. He finished the 2015 season with 25 combined tackles (20 solo), two pass deflections, two interceptions, and a forced fumble in 16 games and one start. He primarily played on special teams during the season and tied teammates Kyle Wilber and Damien Wilson with nine special teams tackles.\n2016 season.\nDuring training camp, Heath competed to be a backup safety against J. J. Wilcox and Kavon Frazier. Garrett named Heath the backup safety behind Byron Jones to start the regular season in 2016. In Week 15, he recorded one tackle, deflected a pass, and made an interception during a 26–20 victory against Buccaneers in Week 15. On January 1, 2017, Heath collected a season-high four combined tackles in the Cowboys' 27–13 loss at the Eagles. \nHe finished the 2016 season with 20 combined tackles (14 solo), two pass deflections, an interception and 7 special teams tackles (third on the team) in 16 games with no starts. He tied for the team lead in special teams tackles with seven, along with Byron Jones and Kyle Wilber. Pro Football Focus gave Heath an overall grade of 76.4.\nThe Cowboys finished first in the NFC East with a 13–3 record and earned a first round bye. On January 15, 2017, he had one of his best games in the 34–31 loss against the Packers in the NFC Divisional Round, recording three solo tackles, one deflected pass, one interception (a second one was called back because of a penalty), his first career sack, one quarterback hurry and one special teams tackle.\n2017 season.\nThroughout training camp, Heath competed against Robert Blanton to be the starting strong safety. The role was left vacant after Barry Church and J. J. Wilcox departed during free agency. Garrett named Heath the starter, alongside free safety Byron Jones.\nIn Week 7, Heath filled in as the emergency kicker, following an injury to kicker Dan Bailey. He was tasked with kickoffs and extra points and converted two of three extra point attempts during the Cowboys' 40–10 victory at the San Francisco 49ers. This made him the first non-kicker or punter to make multiple extra points in game since Houston Oilers linebacker Ted Thompson went 4 out of 4 in 1980.\nIn a Week 9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, Heath intercepted quarterback Alex Smith for the first interception of Smith’s season.\nHeath was inactive for the Cowboys' Week 11 loss to the Eagles due to a concussion.

Pro Football Focus gave him an overall grade of 80.8, which ranked 35th among all qualifying safeties in 2017.\n2018 season.\nHeath started all 16 contests for the first time in his career, registering a career-best 84 tackles (third-best on a top-10 defense), four tackles for losses (tied for third on the team), 6 pass breakups, one interception, one quarterback pressure and 9 special teams tackles (third on the team).\nHe made 9 tackles and one pass defensed in a 19-16 overtime loss to the Houston Texans in Week 5. He followed that big performance in the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with an interception returned 47 yards off of quarterback Blake Bortles. He had a team-best 9 tackles in the Divisional Playoff Game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n2019 season.\nHeath started 13 games, missing 3 with a shoulder injury that required offseason surgery. He posted 63 tackles (sixth on the team), 3 quarterback hurries, 9 passes defensed and did not have an interception for the second time in his career. \nHe had 9 tackles and 2 passes defensed in the season opener against the Giants. He made 7 tackles and 2 passes defensed in the season finale against the Redskins.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn March 27, 2020, Heath signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Las Vegas Raiders, reuniting with assistant coach Rod Marinelli, who was his defensive coordinator with the Cowboys.

While on injured reserve, Raiders defensive backs coach Jim O’Neil and assistant Taver Johnson were ruled out of a game against the Miami Dolphins due to COVID-19 protocols, and Heath was pressed into service as a defensive backs coach along with general manager Mike Mayock. Heath was activated from injured reserve on January 2, 2021. He finished with 34 tackles, 3 interceptions (led the team), 4 passes defensed and 3 special teams tackles in 13 games with 5 starts.\nOn May 5, 2021, he was released after the Raiders selected three safeties in the 2021 NFL Draft.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn August 21, 2021, he signed as a free agent with the Saints.

        "text": "The 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships was the biggest track and field competition for athletes with a disability since the 2012 Summer Paralympics. It was held in Lyon, France, and lasted from 20 to 28 July. Around 1,100 athletes competed, from 94 different countries. The event was held in the Stade du Rhône located at the Parc de Parilly in Vénissieux, in Lyon Metropolis.\nVenue.\nThe Championship was staged at the Stade du Rhône in the Parc de Parilly. The stadium, previously known as the Stade Parilly, was refurbished in 2012 and officially reopened and renamed on 3 September 2012.\nFormat.\nThe 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships was an invitational tournament taking in track and field events. No combined sports were included in the 2013 Championships, with the pentathlon dropped. A total of 1,300 places were made available to all IPC affiliated countries, with 94 countries accepting the invitation and 1,073 athletes reaching the sporting criteria requested. Of the 1,300 available places, 900 were made available for male athletes and 400 for female athlete. No country could send more than 55 male athletes and 25 female athletes, and only three athletes per event, apart from the marathons where six were allowed, or multi-classification events (such as F54/55/56 javelin) where five athletes could be entered. All events, apart from the marathons, took place within the Stade du Rhône. Not all events were open to all classifications, with several throwing and jumping events being contested between classifications, which were then decided on a points system. The men's 100m relay was the only event to use mixed classifications as a team, with each leg of the relay contested by a different classification athlete. There were no women's relay events. In total there were 207 events held over 17 disciplines.\nAthletes finishing in first place are awarded the gold medal, second place the silver medal and third place the bronze. If only three competitors are available to challenge for an event then no bronze medal is awarded.\nCoverage.\nThe International Paralympic Committee provided live video coverage on its website, as well as live coverage, videos of events and interviews on its ParalympicSportTV channel on YouTube.\nIn the host country, France, the television channel France 4 broadcast two hours daily in the evening. This followed criticism that French television had given insufficient coverage to the 2012 Summer Paralympics.\nIn the United Kingdom, Channel 4's sister channel More4 aired over five hours of live coverage daily throughout the Championship. This continued Channel 4's commitment to broadcasting disability sport until at least 2016.\nEvents.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held at Stade du Rhone on Friday 19 July. The spectators were entertained by a celebration of Lyon's cultural heritage with an historic re-enactment, followed by a parade of athletes representing the 90 participating nations filed into the stadium.\nSpeeches were made by Gérard Masson, President of the Organisation Committee and Sir Philip Craven, IPC President. Before the host nation national anthem played, master corporal Thomas Brun, a wounded veteran of the Afghanistan war, passed on the Tricolour to French athletes of the 2014 Winter Paralympics.\nClassification.\nTo ensure competition is as fair and balanced as possible, athletes are classified dependent on how their disability impacts on their chosen event/s. Thus athletes may compete in an event against competitors with a different disability to themselves. Where there are more than one classification in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a points system is used to determine the winner.\nResults.\nFull results\nMedal table.\nThe medal table at the end of Day 9 (28 July).\nMultiple medallists.\n161 competitors won multiple medals at the 2013 Championships. The following six athletes won four gold medals or more.\nHighlights.\nDay 1 (20 July).\nAfter failing to show up at the final of the T11 5,000m at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Brazil's Odair Santos took the world title, beating fellow South American and Paralympic champion Cristian Valenzuela by over 11 seconds. In the T12 class of the 5,000m, Morocco's El Amin Chentouf set a competition record of 14:32.27. The Ukraine team started the games strongly with three gold medals, Andrii Holivets in the F12 shot put, Andriy Onufriyenko in the T37/38 long jump and Roman Pavlyk who broke the T36 long jump world record with a distance of 5.44m. Maciej Lepiato won the first gold of the Championships for Poland when he broke his own world record in the T44 high jump with a height of 2.13m. Other world records fell in the throwing events when Mohsen Kaedi (Iran) took the F34/35 Javelin while Aled Davies (Great Britain) won the F42 shot put.\nMarcel Hug of Switzerland started a strong personal Championship with his first medal of the tournament, the 10,000m gold in the T54 classification, his third consecutive World medal at this distance. Although the team failed to take a gold medal on day one, the USA showed strength in the qualifiers with Tatyana McFadden winning both her T54 heats, setting a personal best in the 200m and a championship record in 5000m. Fellow countryman Jarryd Wallace set a world record of 22.32 in the T44 200m sprint qualifier. Liu Fuliang of China, who took gold in the T46 triple jump and silver in the T42-46 4 × 100 m relay in the London Paralympics, showed his versatility by winning the T46 long jump. Another Paralympic winner to take gold in Lyon was Britain's Hannah Cockroft who won the T34 200m sprint.\nDay 2 (21 July).\nOn day two the USA converted their strong qualifying results into medals, taking five golds. Two from Tatyana McFadden, in the T54 200m and 5000m, Jeremy Campbell in the F44 discus, Raymond Martin with a Championship record in the T52 800m and Jarryd Wallace who beat his world record, set the day before, by running 22.08 in the T44 200m. Luis Felipe Gutiérrez won the first gold of the Championship for Cuba taking the T13 long jump, while his compatriot Leonardo Diaz doubled their tally with a world record in F54/55/56 discus throw. Japan's Atsushi Yamamoto gave his country their first top podium finish, in the T42 long jump.\nThe Ukraine continued their first day success by collecting three more golds, including two wins in the throwing disciplines, Mykola Zhabnyak in the F37/38 discus and Mariia Pomazan in the F35/36, who set a new World record with a distance of 12.35m. The Ukraine's trio of gold medals was completed by Oxana Boturchuk in the T12 200m sprint. Poland saw double success, with golds from Bartosz Tyszkowski in the F41 shot put and Mateusz Michalski on the track, where he set a Championship record in the T12 200ms.\nWorld records were set in the F51/52/53 women's discus throw, set by Britain's Josie Pearson, and in the T37 800m race Michael McKillop of the Republic of Ireland who added the world title to his Paralympic gold.&lt;ref name=\"McKillop/Smith\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland added to this success when Jason Smyth equaled his own world record in the T13 200m final. World records also fell in the qualifying rounds, with the host nation's own Mandy Francois-Elie recording a time of 28.35s in the T37 200m semi-final. Tunisia's Walid Ktila qualified for the final of the T34 200m with a record time of 27.61s. One of the most significant wins of the day came late in the schedule when Brazil's parasport poster-boy Alan Oliveira secured the T43 200m title by running a world record time of 20.66s.\nDay 3 (22 July).\nHost nation France secured their first gold medal of the Championships when Mandy Francois-Elie won the T37 200m final. Further success from Russia pushes the country into second place on the medal table, with gold medals for five athletes. Of the five gold medal winning athletes, four broke the world record in their discipline: Andrey Vdovin, (100m T37), Evgenii Shvetcov (100m T36), Maria Bogacheva (shot put F54) and Egor Sharov (800m T12). Their fifth winning athlete was Alexey Ashapatov who set a Championship record of 58.39m in the F57/58 discus. Germany also saw one of its athletes break a world record as Sebastian Dietz took the F35/36 in the men's discus.\nAlgeria continued to build on the achievements set by Samir Nouioua on the first day, with two gold medals in the men's events, Abdellatif Baka in the T13 800m and a world record for Mohamed Berrahal in the F51/52/53 discus. In the two long jump finals of the day Karolina Kucharczyk of Poland recorded a World record of 6.09m in the T20 while Martina Caironi of Italy took the title in the women's T42. Italy added a third gold on day 3 when Oxana Corso won the 100m T35 with a world record time. Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli gave Malaysia their first medal of the competition with a gold in the F20 shot put. Finland also added to their tally with a gold in the T51 100m sprint from Toni Piispanen and a silver from Henry Manni in the T34 200m, high returns from a small but competitive team.\n2016 Summer Paralympics host nation Brazil continued to impress with two more track golds, one from Verônica Hipólito in a hotly contested T38 200m final, and the second by Yohansson Nascimento in the T46 200m. The previous Paralympic host's Great Britain also kept up their challenge for the top of the medal table with Hannah Cockroft taking her second gold with victory in the T34 100m, Hollie Arnold winning the F46 javelin and Paul Blake achieving gold success in the T36 800m final. In the T44 100m qualifiers, world record holder Jonnie Peacock of Britain qualified for the finals with a season's best only to see American rival Richard Browne beat his world record by 0.02 seconds to set up an exciting day 4 showdown.\nDay 4 (23 July).\nIn the shot put, Aigars Apinis of Latvia equaled the world record in the F43/43 classification, while Nikita Prokhorov took a centimeter off his own world record in the F46 class. Germany had further success in the throwing events with gold for Marianne Buggenhagen in the F54/55/56 discus and Birgit Kober in the F33/34 javelin. Other notable wins went to Aled Davies (Britain) in the F42 discus, Anibal Bello who won Venezuela's first gold of the Championship in the F11 javelin and Estela Salas in the F52/53 javelin, a second win for Mexico.\nIn the jumping events, Iris Pruysen of the Netherlands won the T44 long jump, her country's first in Lyon, Nikol Rodomakina (Russia) recorded a personal best to win the T46 long jump and another gold went to the Ukraine as Dmytro Prudinkov took the T20 long jump title.\nOn the track, Russia took the first team event when they won the Men's 4 × 100 m Relay in the T11-13 class, pushing the USA and France into second and third place. The USA were not without success on day four, with Tatyana McFadden securing her third out of a possible six gold medals with a world record time of 1.44:44 in T54 800m final. This was followed by a win by Raymond Martin in the T52 100m sprint. The highly anticipated contest between Peacock and Browne in the T44 final went to Peacock who took the gold with just 0.02seconds between the rivals. The contest was not so close between Oliveira and his American rival Blake Leeper, with the Brazilian winning his second gold of the Championship in style in the T43 100m. There were more gold medals for Brazil on the track, for Odair Santos in the T11 800m and Terezinha Guilhermina in the T11 100m. Other wins went to Min Jae Jeon of South Korea in the T36 200m and China's Zhou Hongzhuan added to her Beijing and London success with the T53 800m title.\nDay 5 (24 July).\nRussia continued their steady accumulation of podium wins with success on the track. Evgenii Shvetcov won the T36 200m and Andrey Vdovin broke the world record in the T37 200m. Not to be outdone, teammate Atrem Arefyev also broke a world record, in the 1500m in the T36 classification. Other track success was claimed by Australia's Evan O'Hanlon, whose gold in the T38 200m sprint was his second of the competition. O'Hanlon's two wins, Australia's only top podium success of the Championships so far, hide a team heavy in medal success but unable to convert silver and bronze to gold.\nFrance broke into the top twenty of the medal table with three podium finishes, two of them gold. Mandy Francois-Elie who secured her second win of the Championship with the T37 100m title was joined by Tony Falelavaki who threw 54.39m in the F44 Javelin. Other multiple medal winners included Marcel Hug (Switzerland), whose domination of the T54 distance racing continued as he added the 5000m title to his 400 and 10,000m golds. Ireland's Michael McKillop collected his second gold by setting a championship record in the T38 1500m, while Walid Ktila of Tunisia won the T34 100m, the second of a possible four medals in his sights. Another athlete aiming at four medals was T53 wheelchair racer Brent Lakatos of Canada, who, with a silver already in the 800m and a gold in the 400m, took the 200m title with a championship record time.\nWorld records continued to be broken, with Markus Rehm of Germany setting a distance of 7.95m in the T44 men's long jump. In the T38 100m, 16-year-old British sprinter Sophie Hahn gained revenge over her rival Verônica Hipólito, who had beaten her in the 200m, by posting a record time of 13.10s. Two world records were also set in the women's throwing events, in the club throw Maroua Ibrahmi recorded a distance of 24.15 on her way to a points victory, while Assunta Legnente out threw her nearest rival by a massive five metres to win the T11 shot put for Italy.\nDay 6 (25 July).\nDay 6 started with Michelle Stilwell of Canada collecting her country's third gold of the games with a world record time of 2:14.79 in the T52 800 metres. Iran brought their medal tally up to six when Peyman Nasiri Bazanjani won his country's first track medal of the championships with victory in the T20 1500 m race. Algeria collected two gold medals on the track, both at 1500 m distance, Samir Nouioua in the T46 classification and Abdellatif Baka in the T13. These wins gave Nouioua and Baka their second gold medals of the competition. This was bettered by Odair Santos who won his third gold of the games when he secured the T12 1500 m, though the Brazilian could not compete with Tatyana McFadden who successfully claimed her fourth and fifth golds of the games when she won the T54 100 m and 1500 m. In the T54 1500m race, despite the distance of the race, Japan's Wakako Tsuchida and Switzerland's Edith Wolf crossed the finish line in a rare dead-heat and were both awarded the silver medal. Other multiple gold medal winners on the track included a third for Tunisia's Walid Ktila (T34 800 m), a second for China's Huang Lisha (T53 100 m) and a second for Ireland's Jason Smyth (T13 100 m).\nIn the throwing events, four new world records were set. Hania Aidi of Tunisia recorded a distance of 18.32 m in the F54/55/56 javelin. Lahouari Bahlaz of Algeria secured gold with a record in the men's F31/32/51 club throw, while Ukrainian Mariia Pomazan threw 31.42 m in the F35/36 discus throw. Fifteen-year-old British athlete Scott Jones beat his closest rival by 59 cm in the F34 shot put to set the last world record of the day.\nBoth jumping events held on day six were in the women's long jump. Isle Hayes from South Africa set a championship record of 5.76 m to win the T13. Another championship record fell in the T12 classification of the long jump when Oksana Zubkovska of the Ukraine recorded a distance of 6.51 m.\nDay 7 (26 June).\nTwo world records were broken and one equaled on day 7, two in throwing events and one on the track. Vladimir Sviridov of Russia equaled the world record in the F36 shot put in his very first throw with a distance of 14.70m. Fellow Russian Chermen Kobesov added a gold medal to his silver from the long jump with a world record in the T37 400m. The final record of the day was achieved in the F53/53 javelin where Alphanso Cunningham gave Jamaica their first gold of the Championships.\nJamaica were one of five countries to collect their first gold medal of the games on Day 7. Syria won a gold in the F56/57 shot put, awarded to Mohamed Mohamed, the sole representative of his country. Ihar Fartunau of Belarus reached a height of 1.93 to win the T13 high jump, while Chiang Chih-Chung of Chinese Taipei threw 59.29m in the F12/13 javelin. The fifth country to gain their first gold in Lyon was Austria, won in the T46 400m by Gunther Matzinger.\nMarcel Hug continued to stamp his mark on the competition with his third gold of the Championships, winning the T54 1,500m. Birgit Kober of Germany became a double gold medal winner adding the F32/33/34 shot put to her javelin title won three days earlier. Xia Dong of China put behind the disappointment of failing to clinch the gold in the F37/38 discus by setting a Championship record in the F37 shot put. While Australia began to hit the top spot with gold winning achievements for Evan O'Hanlon (T38 400m), and after an appeal by the Australian team Scott Reardon shared the T42 100m title with German rival Heinrich Popow. Initially Popow had been declared the winner by a few thousandths of a second, but later the two men shared the podium together after one of the most contested races of the games.\nDay 8 (27 June).\nAmerican wheelchair racer Tatyana McFadden sealed her position as the most successful athlete of the Championships when she won her sixth gold medal by taking the 400m T54. The United States also celebrated a fifth gold medal from Raymond Martin who like McFadden also won every event he entered, finishing with the T52 400m. Other gold medals for the United States came from Elexis Gillette in the T11 long jump, Cassie Mitchell, who added the F53/53 shot put to her silver and two bronzes won on the track, and a team medal in the men's 4 x 100 metres relay T42-46 setting a new world record. The other relay finals were won by Canada in the men's 4 x 400 metres T53/54 and Russia in the men's 4 x 100 metres T35-38.\nAs well as the relay, Russia finished the Championship with more gold medal success. Nikita Prokhorov won the F46 discus and Evgeniya Trushnikova won the T37 400m, both setting tournament records. Russia finished Day 8 with golds for Egor Sharov in the T12 400m, Elena Pautova in the T12 1,500m and two new world records for Marta Prokofyeva in the F12 shot put and Dmitrii Safronov in the T35 200m. Two further world records were broken on the penultimate day, both by Algerian athletes. Nassima Saifi threw a distance of 42.05m in the F57/58 women's discus while her countryman Lahouari Bahlaz, also a discus thrower, recorded 22.75 in the joint F32/33/34 event.\nAzerbaijan secured their first gold medal of the Championships when Vladimir Zayets won the T12 triple jump, a feat equaled by Namibia who took their sixth medal of the games with a top podium finish for Nambala Johannes in the T13 400m. Walid Ktila struck again for a fourth gold medal, this time in the T34 400m, while there were second gold medals for China's Zhou Hongzhuan (T53 400m), the Netherlands Marlou van Rhijn (T44 200m) and Italian duo Martina Caironi (T42 100m) and Oxana Corso (T35 200m). The final track medal of the day went to Michelle Stilwell of Canada who added the T52 200m event to her 100m and 800m titles.\nDay 9 (28 July).\nThe final day of the Championships took in five events all in the marathon. There was only one women's race, the T54 classification, with ten competitors from six different nations. The three medal winners all crossed the finish line within a second of each other, with eventual winner Switzerland's Manuela Schär recording a final time of 1:49.45. Switzerland made it a double in the T54 marathon when Marcel Hug dominated the men's race to win by over three minutes to collect his fifth gold medal of the games.\nChile gained its first gold medal of the Championship when Cristian Valenzuela won the T11 marathon. With two silver medals already to his name; in the 1,500 and 5,000m, Valenzuela made Chile the most successful nation in proportion to the size of their team, being his country's only competitor. The T46 marathon was a limited field with only four challengers for the title. Italy's Alessandro Di Lello took gold, beating his nearest rival by almost 15 minutes. The T12 marathon saw Paralympic champion El Amin Chentouf of Morocco finishing close to the Championship record to cement his dominance in his classification.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who agreed to participate in the Championships and the requested number of athlete places for each."

        "title": "Gary Wilson (snooker player)",
        "text": "Gary Wilson (born 11 August 1985) is an English professional snooker player from Wallsend in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear.\nAfter showing promise from a young age, Wilson won the IBSF World U-21 Championship before turning professional in 2004. He dropped off the tour in 2006, however, and did not regain his professional status until 2013. During his second period as an amateur, Wilson won the English Amateur Championship in 2012 and reached the final of the World Amateur Championship the same year.\nNoted for his cue ball control and break-building ability, Wilson has won three ranking titles, the Scottish Open in 2022 and 2023, and the 2024 Welsh Open. He was also runner-up at the 2015 China Open and the 2021 British Open, as well as reaching the semi-final of the 2019 World Championship as a qualifier.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nWilson started playing snooker aged three and soon started showing promise. At the age of 8 he had already been put into a team performing in the local league, despite some clubs refusing to allow a child to play. Aged 9, he made his first century, and appeared for the first time at the BBC1's snooker game show series \"Junior Big Break: Stars of the Future\" (he would make two more appearances on the show). He played exhibition matches with John Parrott and Willie Thorne, and defeated Jimmy White and Ronnie O'Sullivan in level matches. Wilson went on to win a number of national titles, including the UK Under-18 championship twice, and was widely regarded as one of the most promising junior players in the country.\nIn 2003, Wilson made his international debut at the European U-19's Championship in Latvia. The same year he started his professional career by playing Challenge Tour, the second-level professional tour at the time, and won the fourth event in 2004 to finish fourth in the rankings and secure his place on the main tour for 2004–05 season. Wilson's biggest achievement that year, however, was the victory at the World Under-21 Snooker Championship in Ireland. Having won all seven of his round robin matches while dropping only two frames, he went all the way to the final, defeating the likes of Pankaj Advani, Aditya Mehta and Liang Wenbo. In the final Wilson saw off Kobkit Palajin with breaks of 142 and 135 to win 11–5.\nIn his debut season Wilson reached the last 48 of the Irish Masters and last 64 of the China Open. These results were just enough to ensure that he would remain on tour for another year. The next season, Wilson reached the last 64 stage twice, but the rest of his performances were unsuccessful, and following defeat to James Tatton in the World Championship qualifying, he fell off the tour. In 2013 Wilson commented: \"At the end of it, when you looked at the rankings it was only by one match and I was gutted. The thing is, at the time, and this is not an excuse, the game was nowhere near as popular as now. It was going through a really bad patch and there were only six tournaments in all compared to now when there are 20–25 tournaments per season. It meant if you had two bad tournaments and you were not doing too well you did not have much time to recover. It is so different now.\"\nAmateur years and return to main tour.\nWilson was to spend the next four years attempting to regain his tour place via the PIOS tour, having come close to finishing inside the top 8 on several occasions. He was forced to start working as a taxi driver at the time to make a living.\nFollowing the introduction of the Q School, Wilson again came close to winning a tour card, reaching the fourth round twice in 2011 and once in 2012. He also took part in the 2012 IBSF World Championship in Bulgaria, having finished top of the English amateur rankings. He reached the final but lost 8–10 to Muhammad Asif. During the 2011–12 season Wilson entered a number of PTC events, defeating the likes of Peter Ebdon and Marco Fu, and reaching the last 32 twice. The next season was even better, as he performed consistently and reached the last 16 of Scottish Open; as a result he finished third among the amateur players on the Order of Merit, and finally regained his tour place after seven years. Wilson said, \"I knew if I went quite far in that last event I would be able to turn professional off that, so losing the world amateur final did not end my dreams\".\n2013–14.\nWilson had one of the strongest starts to the season among the new players on tour. In the first tournament, the Wuxi Classic, he defeated James Wattana to qualify for his second ever venue appearance; there he would lose in a deciding frame to David Morris.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter failing to qualify for both the Australian Open and the Shanghai Masters, Wilson had his best result to date at the inaugural Indian Open, defeating Jimmy White, Dominic Dale and Marco Fu on the way to the last 16, where he lost again in the deciding frame, this time to Michael White. Following his first round defeat at the International Championship to Wattana, Wilson went on to reach the last 32 of both the UK Championship and the German Masters. During the qualifying match for the latter tournament against Ricky Walden in December, Wilson made his first maximum break in professional competition. He also performed successfully at the European Tour events, winning his first round matches at every tournament. The highlight was his first ever semi-final at the Rotterdam Open where he was leading eventual tournament winner Mark Williams 3–1 but lost 4–3. Thanks to these performances, Wilson finished 24th on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals, where he was whitewashed 4–0 by Fu. Wilson's season came to a disappointing end as he was beaten 10–4 by James Cahill in the opening round of World Championship qualifying. However, he had made enough money during the year to give up his taxi driver job and concentrate on playing snooker full-time in the future.\n2014–15.\nWilson qualified for the 2014 Wuxi Classic, the opening ranking event of the season, where he lost 5–3 to Alan McManus in the first round.\nHe couldn't regain his momentum from last year as he failed to progress beyond the last 64 stage of any tournament in the first half of the season.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's breakthrough came in February at the Welsh Open, as he defeated Zhang Anda, John Astley and Joe Perry. He then knocked out Neil Robertson 4–2 to reach his first major quarter-final, stating afterwards that he had proven that he could handle the big occasions. Wilson took an early 2–1 lead against Ben Woollaston, but lost four frames in a row to be beaten 5–2. In the opening round of the Indian Open, Wilson was edged out 4–3 by Adam Duffy.\nAt the China Open, Wilson eliminated Liang Wenbo 5–3, Ricky Walden 5–2 and Dechawat Poomjaeng 5–1 to play in his second ranking event quarter-final in under two months. Despite defeating Barry Hawkins 5–3, Wilson said that he was struggling with his game but hoped to find his form in the semi-finals against home favourite and reigning champion Ding Junhui. He fell 3–1 down, but moved 5–3 ahead with four breaks of 50 or above. Ding took the match into a deciding frame in which Wilson made a 72 to set up a meeting with reigning world champion Mark Selby in the final, in which Wilson was heavily beaten 10–2. Wilson said later that he didn't feel the occasion got to him, but simply missed the majority of chances that came his way and cued across the ball many times. His last match of the season was a 10–7 loss to Li Hang in the second round of World Championship qualifying. Wilson's successful year resulted in him increasing his ranking by 34 places in 12 months to end the season as 34th in the world.\n2015–16.\nWilson could not build on last year's exploits during the 2015–16 season. He lost in the qualifiers for the first three ranking events. He beat Martin O'Donnell 6–3 at the UK Championship, before being defeated 6–4 by Martin Gould in the second round. Wilson reached the same stage of the Welsh Open, but lost 4–1 to Liang Wenbo. He qualified for the China Open, but he was knocked out 5–3 by Stephen Maguire in the opening round.\n2016–17.\nAt the Indian Open, Wilson overcame Zhao Xintong 4–1 and Anthony Hamilton 4–2, but lost 4–2 to Akani Songsermsawad. His only last 16 appearance of the season came at the Northern Ireland Open, courtesy of knocking out Peter Lines 4–0, Andrew Higginson 4–3 and Sam Baird 4–3, before he was defeated 4–3 by Mark Allen. Wilson qualified for the China Open and beat Graeme Dott 5–3, but then was beaten 5–1 by Shaun Murphy.\nWilson qualified for the 2017 World Championship. Making his second 147 in the fourth frame of his first round qualifier against Josh Boileau, he edged through 10–9. In the second qualifying round he defeated Peter Lines 10–7, then Michael White 10–3. In his three matches he made eight centuries, more than double that of any other player. He rated the achievement of qualifying bigger than reaching the final of the China Open in 2015. On his debut in the event he played Ronnie O'Sullivan, and rallied from 5–1 to be down only 5–4 after the first session. He fell 9–5 behind, before winning two frames in a row, but O'Sullivan then got the frame he needed to progress 10–7. Wilson made two century breaks during the match.\n2017–18.\nWilson was a quarter-finalist at the 2017 Paul Hunter Classic, but lost 4–2 to Jamie Jones. In the second half of the season, he made it to the semi-finals of the 2018 Welsh Open, where he was defeated 6–2 by John Higgins.\n2018–19.\nEarly in the season, Wilson made two quarter-final appearances, at the non-ranking Haining Open, and right after that at the ranking World Open. At the 2019 Snooker World Championship Wilson defeated Luca Brecel, Mark Selby and Ali Carter before losing 17–11 to eventual winner Judd Trump in the semi-finals.\n2019–20.\nWilson reached a quarter- and a semi-final in both the first and the second half of the season. In August, in the quarter-final stage of the 2019 International Championship he faced Mark Selby, who narrowly knocked him out by the scoreline of 6–5. A month later, Wilson reached the semi-final of the 2019 Six-red World Championship, losing to Stephen Maguire 7–5. At the start of the next year, Wilson suffered another 6–5 defeat, this time by Zhou Yuelong, at the 2020 European Masters semi-final. Next month he exited the 2020 World Grand Prix at the quarter-finals, losing to Tom Ford 5–2.\n2020–21.\nAt the WST Pro Series, Wilson made his third career maximum break when he was playing against Liam Highfield in the group stage. This was the first maximum break in the history of the event.\n2021–22.\nWilson was a runner-up to Mark Williams at the 2021 British Open, losing by the scoreline of 4–6. This was Wilson's second ranking final appearance. At the 2021 UK Championship, he made his fourth maximum break in his first round match against Ian Burns.\n2022–23: First ranking title.\nWilson secured his first ranking title at the 2022 Scottish Open, defeating Joe O'Connor 9–2 in the final. He also made it to the quarter-finals of the 2023 Players Championship by beating Ding Junhui 6–3, but there he suffered a 1–6 loss to Kyren Wilson.\n2023–24: Second and third ranking titles.\nWilson successfully defended his title at the 2023 Scottish Open, with a 9–5 victory over Noppon Saengkham in the final, then went on and also won the last tournament in the Home Nations Series, the 2024 Welsh Open, beating Martin O'Donnell 9–4. This made him the third player, after Mark Selby and Judd Trump, to win two Home Nations events in one season. During the Welsh Open, Wilson made his fifth maximum break in the second frame of his semi-final match against John Higgins, after attempting a maximum in the first frame already.

        "text": "The Aalborg Golf Klub, in the Restrup meadows, is the second oldest golf club in Denmark. It was established in 1908, initially as a nine-hole course. At its present location, which is southwest of Aalborg, it has 27 holes. Many European and Danish championships have been held here as well as the European Challenge Tour in 2001.\nHistory.\nThe golf course was set up first in the eastern part of Aalborg. In 1929 the club was shifted to Sohangaarsholm. It was shifted again to its present location to the southwest of Aalborg to accommodate the establishment of the University of Aalborg. At this location a 9-hole course was established in 1968 upon the initiative of Graham Lockey, an active member of the club who enlisted the services of Commander John Harris for the purpose, later extended to 18 holes in 1976. Following the upgrading of the course done by Henrick Jaconson, in 2006 Chris Haspel upgraded it with the addition of another course of nine holes with assistance from the head game keeper. It was converted into a 27-hole course with three loops of nine holes.\nIn 2010, the club hosted the European Teams Girls Championships.\nFeatures.\nLocated on the highway south of Aalborg, the club has good training facilities. The Driving Range is large and has been well planned with a number of bays with simple spacers. The course is fairly flat and there are no blind spots, although the clearance hole is reported to be the real test at the course. The club house is a modern building with a restaurant."

Cycling pads were developed at the beginning of the 1900s and were exclusively made of deer leather up until the 1980s, when technical fabrics were introduced, and allowed for enhanced performance.\nThe first high-tech thermo molded cycling pads date back to the early 1990s; gel inserts also make their first appearance and are used in addition to polyurethane foams.\nIt is only in the year 2000 that the chamois is produced with an elastic technology, which allows the pad to move with the cyclist's body. This technology acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle. These few square inches are subject to the pressure of most of the body's weight. For this reason, it is essential for a cycling pad to be capable of protecting the body from the compression the body exerts in contact with the saddle and from chafing in the inner leg area.\nIn the 2000s chamois designers began to design female and male specific cycling pads. The male-specific cycling pads feature deeper channels, while the women specific cycling pads feature wider areas, taking into account the relative anatomical differences.\nThe cycling pad is the functional component of the entire cycling short. Its functions are:\nThere are different types of chamois that are intended for different purposes:\nFurthermore, there are specific pads designed for special cycling disciplines such as triathlon, mountain bike, cyclocross, crono time trial, and indoor cycling."

        "text": "Motocross Mania 3 is a motocross racing video game developed by British company Deibus Studios and was released in April 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was the third in the \"Motocross Mania\" series, and the first to be released for sixth-generation consoles. The Xbox version has Xbox Live, and top scores on a particular track are automatically posted.\nGameplay.\nThe game focuses on vehicular combat, and players can use various weapons such as baseball bats and ice picks to attack opponents. Players can also attack without weapons, which involves attacking while airborne, which the game considers as \"showing off and kicking ass at the same time\". There is a \"mania meter\", which slows down time similar to bullet time in order to get another opportunity to attack.\nOne of the modes available is the Championship, in which players compete in a series of races across 20 tracks and try to finish in the top 4 to advance. Before each race in the mode, players can challenge another driver to a best-of-three series, and if the player wins, they win the driver's bike. Another event in the Championship mode is the Battle Royal, in which the player with the most KOs win. Minigames are also present in the game, one of which involves a game of \"tag\", in which the player who's \"it\" has 30 seconds to tag another driver or else they explode.\nReception.\nThe game received \"unfavorable\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. David Clayman of IGN criticized the Xbox version's buggy gameplay and \"lack of variety\". Clayman also commented that there was a haze on the map, which TeamXbox's Matthew Fisher first called logical due to the first race taking place at dusk, but Fisher then noted that it appears in every level. Fisher also criticized the audio, stating that whenever the drivers crash, it sounds like a water bottle getting crushed, and as a result, called it the \"water bottle effect\". Brian Ekberg of GameSpot praised the Xbox Live implementation, along with amusing dialogue from characters, but criticized the graphics and poor physics engine."

They successfully defended their title, with the United States finishing second.\nClash between Cuban players and anti-Castro protestors.\nTension between Cuba and the United States had already been an issue with the selection of Indianapolis over Havana for the site of the games, and a Cuban boycott had been avoided only when Fidel Castro received a promise that the 1991 Pan American Games would be held in Havana. After the incident with a plane flying a banner urging Cuban athletes to defect in the opening ceremony, Cuban immigrants to the United States continued to use the games as a way to confront the Castro regime, using the Cuban athletes as a proxy. This games marked the first time since the Cuban Revolution that Cuban athletes had participated in the United States. At a baseball game in Bush Stadium between Cuba and the Netherlands Antilles the day after the opening ceremony, Cuban-American protestors taunted the Cuban players, threw flyers at them, and mocked them with offers of cash. A fight broke out, but only one bystander was injured and hospitalized after Indianapolis police broke up the fight by preventing the Cuban players from entering the stands. At a subsequent game against Puerto Rico, some Cuban players were able to enter the stands to chase protestors before being stopped."

The format was similar to that used for the World Super 6 Perth. The main difference was that the 6-hole matches were determined by stroke play rather than match play. It retained the 156-player field, with the cut being made at the top-60 and ties after 36 holes. After 54 holes, the field was cut to a fixed 24. Ties for 24th place were determined by a sudden-death playoff. There were then five six-hole knock-out rounds on the final day. The leading eight after 54 holes received a bye in the first round. The remaining 16 were randomly paired. The six holes used on the final day were 17, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 18. There were a number of other matches for the minor places.\nIn 2018, the event reverted to 72-hole stroke-play.\nThe 2020 event returned to the Challenge Tour as the Northern Ireland Open with backing from The R&amp;A."

        "text": "The 1951–52 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate basketball during the 1951–52 season. In their fourth season under head coach Ernie McCoy, the Wolverines team compiled a 7–15 record and finished in a tie for eighth place in the Big Ten Conference. Senior Jim Skala was the team captain, leading scorer and Most Valuable Player. The team was notable as the first racially integrated Michigan basketball team with Don Eaddy and John Codwell becoming the first two African-American players.\nSeason overview.\nThe 1951–52 team finished the season in a tie for eighth place in the Big Ten Conference with an overall record of 7–15 and 4–10 against conference opponents. Ernie McCoy was in his fourth and final year as the team's head coach.\nThe 1951–52 team was inexperienced with only one senior, Jim Skala, on the squad. The team narrowly averted a last place finish with a victory over Purdue in the final game of the season. The Wolverines' total of 787 points was the lowest in the Big Ten. The team also recorded the lowest field goal percentage (28.4%) and free throw percentage (59.2%) in the conference.\nJim Skala was both the team captain and the team's leading scorer. He totaled 258 points in 22 games (169 points in conference games) for an average of 11.7 points per game. At the end of the season, Skala was voted by his teammates as the team's Most Valuable Player. Skala later served as the head basketball coach at Eastern Michigan University (1954–1960) before returning to Michigan as an assistant basketball coach under Dave Strack from 1960 to 1966.\nThe team's second leading scorer was Milt Mead, a six-foot, seven-inch sophomore from Bay City, Michigan. Mead scored 238 points (10.8 points per game) over the course of the 1951–52 season. Mead also won the 1953 NCAA championship in the high jump.\nThe 1951–52 season was Michigan's second consecutive year at or near the bottom of the Big Ten basketball standings. In June 1952, McCoy resigned as Michigan's head basketball coach to accept a position as the athletic directors at Penn State. In July 1952, athletic director Fritz Crisler announced the hiring of 40-year-old William Perigo, previously the head coach at Western Michigan, as Michigan's new head basketball coach.\nRacial integration.\nThe 1951–52 team was notable as the first Michigan men's basketball team to be racially integrated. During the 1950–51 season, the Indiana Hoosiers became the first Big Ten basketball team to integrate with the addition of center Bill Garrett. On January 9, 1951, Garrett became the first African-American to play at Yost Field House where he was \"warmly applauded\" by the fans. In a letter to \"The Michigan Daily\", members of the Inter-Racial Association protested the lack of integration at Michigan. The letter said in part:\"Garrett is the first Negro to break the color line which exists in all Big Ten sports except football and track. ... Year after year Michigan has had top Negro football and track stars. ... Why has the University NEVER had a Negro on the basketball team? Why does this policy persist throughout the Big Ten? The answers are obvious. There is a deliberate and conscious policy of discrimination against Negro athletes. Or perhaps you will tell us where we err, Mr. Crisler?\"\nMichigan coach Ernie McCoy responded by denying the accusation of discrimination. McCoy noted that, in the prior 10 years, only one African-American, football star Len Ford, had tried out for the basketball team. McCoy opined that Ford could have been a good basketball player, but noted that his obligations to the football team kept him from reporting on time and added that Ford had developed bad habits playing unorganized ball which he did not have time to erase in practice.\nOn December 1, 1951, less than a year after the published criticism from Inter-Racial Association, Don Eaddy and John Codwell became the first African-American basketball players at Michigan. In the opening game of the 1951–52 season, Eaddy \"hit four long shots\" for eight points against Central Michigan University, the first points scored by an African-American basketball player at Michigan. Codwell also played in the opening game of the season and scored one point on a free throw.\nEaddy appeared in all 22 games for the Wolverines during the 1951–52 season and was the team's third leading scorer with 188 points. He went on to score over 1,000 points in four years for the Wolverines. He later played professional baseball for the Chicago Cubs.\nCodwell was reportedly able to slam dunk the basketball with ease, and although he saw limited action in the 1951–52 season, he became one of the team's leading scorers with an average of 10.5 points per game during the 1952–53 season. Although he was able to break the race barrier on the basketball court, Codwell was barred from speaking at the Detroit alumni group's annual meeting at the University Club after the group found out he was African-American. One member sought to justify the decision: \"It's not a question of being barred. It's just that the Club has never had any Negroes there before.\"\nSeason in detail.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1: at Central Michigan. Michigan opened the 1951–52 season on December 1, 1951, with a 60–43 loss to the Central Michigan Chippewas. The game was played before a crowd of 3,500 and marked the dedication of Central Michigan's newly completed field house at Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. Don Eaddy \"sunk four long set shots\" for eight points, marking the first points scored by an African-American basketball player at Michigan. Another African-American player, John Codwell, also appeared in the game and scored one point on a free throw. Team captain Jim Skala and starting center Dick \"Stick\" Williams both fouled out for Michigan, and head coach Ernie McCoy used a total of 14 players in the game. Milt Mead, playing as a forward, was the high scorer for Michigan with 16 points, and Eaddy's eight points was the second-highest total for the Wolverines. After the loss, \"The Michigan Daily\" wrote that the Wolverines had 16 days to recover from the \"humiliating\" defeat.\nGame 2: Butler. On December 17, 1951, the Wolverines lost their first home game of the season, falling to the Butler Bulldogs by a 63–53 score at Yost Field House. Butler jumped out to a 15–4 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Wolverines suffered from poor shooting, converting 20 of 73 field goal attempts (27%) and 13 of 26 free throws. Head coach Ernie McCoy experimented with multiple combinations, using 11 players in the game. Butler's Orvis Burdsall scored 29 points, breaking Mack Supronowicz's Yost Field House scoring record of 28 points. Senior captain Jim Skala scored 14 points for Michigan. Freshman forward Ralph Kaufman and center Dick \"Stick\" Williams also scored 12 points each.\nGame 3: Penn. On December 20, 1951, the Wolverines lost by a 68–63 score to the Penn Quakers at Yost Field House. The attendance at the game was estimated at 500. Michigan led 63–62 with two minutes left in the game, but the Quakers scored six straight points to take the lead and win the game. Michigan's high scorer in the game was center Dick \"Stick\" Williams with 19 points, followed by forward Jim Skala with 15 points and guard Don Eaddy with 12 points.\nGame 4: Colorado. The Wolverines won their first game of the season by a 58–55 score in a Christmas Eve match against the University of Colorado at Yost Field House. Starting center Dick Williams twisted an ankle and did not score. Sophomore Milt Mead, playing at the forward position, led Michigan with 17 points. Jim Skala scored 14 and Don Eaddy added 11 points.\nGame 5: Steel Bowl – Penn State. On December 27, 1951, Michigan lost to Penn State by a 62–60 score in the opening game of the first Steel Bowl basketball tournament. The tournament was hosted by the University of Pittsburgh at its new Memorial Field House. Michigan led 18–6 at the end of the first quarter and 32–28 at halftime. The third quarter ended with the game deadlocked at 48–48. Michigan was outscored in the fourth quarter 14–12 as the Wolverines missed eight free throws in the final quarter. Milt Mead was the high scorer for Michigan with 18 points on five field goals and eight of ten free throws. Dick Williams and Doug Lawrence each scored 10 points for Michigan. Don Eaddy hit one field goal and four of seven free throws for six points. John Codwell hit two field goals, but missed three free throws, for four points.\nGame 6: Steel Bowl – Virginia. On December 28, 1951, Michigan defeated Virginia by a 66–52 score in the consolation game of the Steel Bowl basketball tournament. The game was played at the Memorial Field House in Pittsburgh. Penn State defeated Pitt in the main game to win the Steel Bowl championship.\nGame 7: Princeton. On New Year's Day, January 1, 1952, the Wolverines defeated the Princeton Tigers by a 62–44 score at Yost Field House. The game had an estimated attendance of 400. The Princeton team was coached by Franklin Cappon, who had been a basketball player and coach at Michigan in the 1920s and 1930s. The game was the team's most convincing victory of the season, as Michigan led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter. Center Dick Williams led the Wolverines with 18 points. Jim Skala had 16 points, and Don Eaddy scored nine.\nGame 8: at Indiana. On January 5, 1952, the Wolverines lost by a 58–46 score to an Indiana Hoosiers team that had won seven consecutive games and was ranked No. 5 in the country.

The Spartans, led by 19th-year head coach Tom Izzo, played their home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference. MSU finished the season with a record of 29–9, 12–6 to finish in a tie for second place in Big Ten play. As the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans defeated Northwestern, Wisconsin, and Michigan (avenging to regular season losses to the Wolverines) to win the tournament championship. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, MSU's 17th straight trip. As the No. 4 seed in the East region, they defeated Delaware, Harvard, and No. 1-seeded Virginia to reach the Elite Eight where they lost to eventual National Champion, UConn. The loss marked the first time in Tom Izzo's career that a player who played four years for Izzo had failed to reach a Final Four.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2012–13 season with an overall record of 27–9, 13–5 to finish in second place in the Big Ten.

For the first time under Izzo, the team selected no captains.\nSeniors Adreian Payne (16.4 points and 7.3 rebounds per game) and Keith Appling (11.2 points and 4.5 assists per game), junior Branden Dawson (11.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game), and sophomore Gary Harris (16.7 points and 4.0 rebounds per game) led the Spartans as they looked to continue Izzo's Final Four streak.\nMSU started the preseason ranked No. 2 overall and, after beating No. 1 Kentucky in the Champions Classic, the Spartans moved to the No. 1 spot. The Spartans held the No. 1 spot for three weeks while beating Columbia, Portland, Virginia Tech, and Oklahoma to win the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. They surrendered the No. 1 ranking with a loss to North Carolina in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Spartans cruised through the remaining non-conference schedule, A win at Texas topped off an 11–1 non-conference record and left the Spartans ready to begin the Big Ten season ranked No. 5 in the country.\nThe Spartans won their first seven conference games with wins over Penn State, Indiana (twice), Minnesota, Northwestern, Illinois, and No. 3 Ohio State. Without Dawson and Payne due to injuries, MSU lost its first Big Ten game at home to No. 21 Michigan in East Lansing on a College Gameday game. The Spartans also lost to Georgetown in a non-conference game at Madison Square Garden on February 1. Due to injuries to Appling and further injuries to Payne and Dawson, MSU lost five of their last eight conference games to finish in a second-place tie with Wisconsin at 12–6. Michigan State finished the regular season at 23–8 overall and ranked No. 22 in the country.\nThe Spartans, finally healthy and at full strength, beat Northwestern, No. 12 Wisconsin, and No. 8 Michigan to capture the Big Ten tournament championship.

        "text": "John J. Astley (born 13 January 1989) is an English professional snooker player from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAstley first came into prominence in 2007 by winning the national Under-19 title (defeating Michael Georgiou in the final), however wins in the amateur PIOS tournaments proved hard to come by. His attempts to qualify for the main tour via Q School in 2011 and 2012 were unsuccessful as well. Nevertheless, Astley gained enough sponsorship to be able to enter all the PTC events in the 2012–13 season as an amateur. He reached the last 32 stage three times and finished fourth highest ranked amateur on the Order of Merit, winning a tour card for 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.\n2013/2014.\nAstley won his opening match of the season 5–2 against Mike Dunn to reach the main draw of the Wuxi Classic. In his first appearance in a ranking event Astley was whitewashed 5–0 by Robert Milkins.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won a match in a ranking event for the first time by edging out Ken Doherty 6–5 in the UK Championship, a performance he described afterwards as the best of his career. He lost 6–1 against Stuart Carrington in the next round. Astley also qualified for the China Open with a 5–2 success over Robbie Williams and then came through a wildcard round match once in China, before losing 5–1 to Ding Junhui. Astley beat Sam Baird 10–9 in the first round of World Championship qualifying, but his season ended in his next match with a heavy 10–2 loss to Jamie Cope. He finished his debut season on the tour ranked world number 98. Astley was awarded the Rookie of the Year Award at the World Snooker Annual Award Ceremony.\n2014/2015.\nAstley's 2014–15 season proved to be disappointing as he could not qualify for any ranking event, other than the UK Championship and Welsh Open for which he gained automatic entry. He lost in the first round of the UK 6–2 to Jamie Cope and beat David Gilbert 4–1 at the Welsh, before Gary Wilson knocked him out 4–3 in the second round. Astley played in all six of the minor-ranking European Tour events but could not win a match in any of them. After losing his first qualifying match for the World Championship to Dominic Dale, Astley was relegated from the tour as he was ranked 86th in the world.\n2016/2017.\nAstley entered the 2016 Q School and in the second event he beat Peter Lines 4–0 to secure a two-year tour card.\nAt the 2016 Riga Masters, Astley beat Joe Perry 4–1, Andy Hicks 4–2 and Jimmy Robertson 4–1 to play in the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the first time in his career, where he lost 4–1 to Mark Williams.&lt;ref name=\"2016/17\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also reached the third round of the Indian Open and Paul Hunter Classic and was defeated 4–2 by Nigel Bond and 4–1 by Zack Richardson. Astley qualified for the International Championship by overcoming Peter Ebdon 6–3 and then saw off Mark King 6–4 once in China, before losing 6–2 to Mark Selby. He recovered to win 5–4 from 4–0 down against Kyren Wilson to qualify for the German Masters, where he was edged out 5–4 by Ricky Walden in the opening round. Astley progressed through to the fourth round of the Gibraltar Open by 4–1 victories over Andreas Ploner, George Pragnall and Ben Woollaston and was eliminated 4–2 by Ryan Day. He finished his first year back on the tour ranked world number 76.\nOutside snooker.\nIn March 2016, Astley appeared on-stage at the Sheffield Crucible in Richard Bean's play, \"The Nap\", as the opponent of lead Jack O'Connell's character."

        "text": "Malcolm Marshall, a former right-arm fast bowler, represented the West Indies cricket team in 81 Tests between 1978 and 1992. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 41 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. In Test cricket, Marshall took 376 wickets, including 22 five-wicket hauls. The cricket almanack \"Wisden\" described him as \"one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time\", and named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1983. He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as an inaugural member in January 2009. Mark Nicholas, a cricket commentator, once wrote that former Pakistan captain, Imran Khan, \"calls Malcolm the greatest of all fast bowlers\".\nMarshall made his Test debut in December 1978 against India at the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, Bangalore. His first five-wicket haul came in March 1983 against the same team at the Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain; he took 5 wickets for 37 runs. In December 1984, against Australia at the Adelaide Oval, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat once more in his career, against India at the Queen's Park Oval in April 1989. Marshall's career-best bowling figures for an innings were 7 wickets for 22 runs against England at Old Trafford, Manchester, in June 1988. He took 9 wickets for 41 runs in the match; West Indies won the match by an innings and 156 runs, and he was awarded man of the match for his performance. Marshall was most successful against Australia taking seven five-wicket hauls. He took ten or more wickets in a match on four occasions.\nMarshall made his One Day International (ODI) debut against England at Headingley, Leeds, during the 1980 Prudential Trophy. He never took a five-wicket haul in ODIs; his career-best figures for an innings were 4 wickets for 18 runs against Australia in 1991, a match West Indies lost at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. As of 2013, Marshall is sixteenth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

        "text": "Thomas Cook’s amateur Rugby Football Club was founded in 1910 as part of a wider sports club established by the company in 1897, with the ground at Ravensbourne in Kent.\nThe first club president was Frank Henry Cook (1862-1940 -eldest grandson of the company founder), who had played his rugby at Mill Hill School.\nIt ceased playing during both World Wars, and like many ‘house’ rugby clubs it no longer exists. At its most popular the club ran two XV's until it closed in 1966. During its lifetime the club played against well over 100 different clubs in London and the South East. \nIt also established a regular Easter tour to the Netherlands in 1958 playing RC Hilversum. which helped to promote Dutch rugby during the 1960s. The original tour fixture was filmed for Dutch cinemas and television in front of crowd of over 2,600 at the AGOVV Apeldoorn stadium in Apeldoorn.\nThomas Cooks Sports Club.\nEstablished in 1897, initially known as the ‘Ludgate Circus Athletic Club’, (after the company's first London Head Office) when the existing football and swimming clubs amalgamated. The new club had four sections – football, swimming, cricket and tennis – and the playing facilities scattered across London. Despite having no ground, it proved popular and by 1902 the club was simply known as the ‘Ludgate Circus Club’. The company purchased land at Ravensbourne Kent and laid out a sports ground and erected a Pavilion. By 1905 it had become one of the finest private athletic grounds near London. By the summer of 1911 the sports club had over 600 members.\nThe rugby section was established in 1910 as the Ludgate Circus XV. After the First World War a new pavilion was built in 1922 opened by Thomas Cook's eldest grandson, the club's president Frank Henry Cook (1862-1931). The rugby club changed its name to Thos. Cook &amp; Son's RFC in 1926 after the company moved to its new London Head Office in Berkeley Street Mayfair. During this time the annual summer Sports Day was held at Ravensbourne which became a popular date in the company's social calendar.\nHonours Cap recipients.\nProbably an incomplete list, this was an established award to players for distinguished performance, discontinued after Second World War.\nLudgate Circus XV&lt;br&gt;\n1923–4, Copson, A., Johns, A.C., Murrell, E.D., Trend, W.G.\n1925–6, Coussens, R., Higgins, E.J.K.,\nThos.

The only club record appears in August 1926 when the Grafton Hotel Tottenham Court Road, hosted the dinner. Coussens and Higgins were awarded their honour caps. Post war this dinner became less formal and often held in a pub.\nClub Ground.\nThe club sports ground had been purchased and laid-out around 1903 and established in 1905, at Ravensbourne in Kent.&lt;br&gt;\nA new pavilion was built in 1922. In all internal communications the 'pavilion' was referred to as the 'club-house' by the rugby section.\nLocation: Ravensbourne Avenue, Beckenham, Kent Telephone: RAVensbourne 6713\nResident stewards: Annie &amp; William Dyer (1953–56), George &amp; Gladys Gladdy (1956–75)\nAfter the company moved its Head Office to Peterborough in 1977, the club was renamed Thomas Cook Sports and Social Club. The Ravensbourne playing fields and pavilion were purchased by the Goan Association and used as a sports facility until tragically the old Mock-Tudor clubhouse opened by the founder's grandson seventy-six years earlier, was burnt down in 1998 due to vandalism. It was then sold to Lewisham Council – now called Summerhouse Playing Fields as part of the wider Beckenham Place Park open space.\nDuring the war years (1939-1945) the ground was requisitioned by the army and the site used for anti-aircraft guns. Nearby at Crab Hill, a Prisoner of War Camp for Italians was established known as Summerhouse Camp 233, part of the Beckenham Place Park estate.\nRugby Club Officials.\nFirst Club President\nFrank Henry Cook (1862-1931) – Grandson of founder Thomas Cook (played his rugby at Mill Hill School)\nOriginal Club officials\nLudgate Circus XV: Hon.

        "text": "The Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League, or LCBL, was a collegiate summer baseball league comprising teams of the top college players from the St. Louis metropolitan area and beyond. Founded by Nicholas R. A. Mahrt in 2013, this upstart amateur baseball season runs from June through early August in the St. Louis metropolitan area. It is a non-profit organization and the charter member of the Commonwealth Leagues United a nationwide collection of baseball leagues that put the emphasis on student-athlete's summer work/study opportunities. Players are not paid, as to maintain their college eligibility and amateur status; their ages range from 18 to 23.\nAbout the League.\nPlayers choose to exclusively compete during the week or on the weekends; breaking the teams into two even conferences, the Lewis and the Clark. Teams are scheduled to play 36 games over an eight-week season, culminating in an early-August playoff. The playoffs consist of a best-of-three Discovery Cup Series, matching the two division winners in the Lewis Conference and the two in the Clark Conference. After the best of the weekend and weekday are crowned, these conference champions meet in a one-game, winner-take-all title game. The current league champions, the winners of the 2014 Corps of Discovery Cup, are the Voyagers.\nMiller Orthopedics serves as the platinum sponsor for the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League. As a former pupil of world-renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews, Dr. Mark Miller provides sports medicine support to the finest athletes in the region. Should the need arise, LCBL players will experience the same level of medical expertise as members of the St. Louis Rams and St. Louis Cardinals.\nThere are opportunities for individuals to seek sponsors, internal positions with the LCBL (field and gameday operations), and part-time employment/internships with local companies. Those that play exclusively on the weekend (Lewis Conference) can even maintain a 40-hour/week schedule and still play all their team's games.\nPlayer registration annually opens in November of the previous year; it triggers the official recruitment period, where student-athletes can commit to playing with a particular LCBL team. The league has grown from four teams to eight and will reach its peak expansion of 14 teams in 2016.\nIt was announced in early 2017 that the league folded.\nOrigin.\nIn the summer of 2012, Nicholas Mahrt then-assistant coach for Washington University in St. Louis coached in the St. Louis Metro League. His participation with that particular collegiate baseball organization left him dissatisfied with the local product that was being offered. Mahrt noticed the Metro League model lacked an opportunity for college players to pursue \"both\" aspects of their college experience. Due to a schedule that was loaded with games on weekdays \"and\" weekends, student-athletes were ultimately forced to choose between baseball and a summer job/internship. By playing in most summer leagues, young adults forgo a chance to enhance their post-collegiate careers. Declining an invitation, in order to gain knowledge and collect a summer paycheck, means college players forgo sharpening their baseball skills.\nWith that mindset, Mahrt set out to create a new product, to address a need for balance between sports league and continuing education:\nFor Mahrt, the level of talent that the Metro League attracts only widened the work/play disconnect. For nearly all league players, the finality of their senior year was also the end of their competitive playing days. Since a negligible percentage of student-athletes make a future living off playing baseball, most need their last collegiate summer months to build a resume. Mahrt never advocated that 20-year-olds \"give up\" baseball in lieu of work experience. In fact, he firmly stated that the summer \"should\" be used as an instructional period for all to reach their sports pinnacle. His new league simply sought a way to provide better balance to each player's offseason schedule.\nThe result was a brainstorming session about the creation of a new league. Mahrt and fellow Wash. U. assistant coach, W. Ross Clites, threw out ideas of a league that operates as two separate entities. One \"conference\" would play its games strictly on Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays. This would present players with an opportunity to commute to St. Louis, if need be, while maintaining the prototypical Monday through Friday (40-hour/week) job. Players could even take summer college courses wherever they call home.\nClites, who also worked as a golf operations manager at a local course with peak business demand on the weekends suggested there were ample local companies that also require full-time Friday through Sunday staffing. Creating a \"conference\" that operates solely on weekdays still gives players a chance to take part-time seasonal jobs, with weekend-based hours. This \"conference\" also doubles as the place for student-athletes to play if they have no desire to work or intern in the summer. Though not encouraged, if they simply come to the league to become a better baseball player, the weekday is for them.\nSimply freeing the schedule for players to pursue employment was not enough. Mahrt did not want potential recruits to have to \"go it alone.\" With a wide range of local business contacts in tow, the league actively pairs players with suitable employers. League officers spend as much time and energy placing student-athletes with companies matching each individual's area of study as they do placing them on teams. The LCBL's competitive advantage over other leagues is its network of companies; the Find Your Way Program. In its first year of existence, over 20 companies from the local St. Louis area had players from the LCBL either interning, job shadowing, fast-tracked for interviews, or otherwise employed. The league also employs several sports management, marketing, broadcasting, and journalism majors as player-interns for gameday operations.\nBranding.\nThe two-silhouette logo is inspired by, of all things, a highway sign. Mahrt was driving to a Metro League game in 2012 thinking out loud about his new league when he took special notice of the imagery used to demarcate the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. It is something he had seen countless times, as the signs appear every five miles along the Missouri River. But seen while dreaming about a future business venture, the sign took on a new life. The trail's triangular logo evolved into the circular centerpiece in the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League primary wordmark.\nMahrt desired a name that paid homage to the rich history that surrounds St. Louis. But with a lofty ambition to draw talent from coast-to-coast, the moniker also needed to carry national recognition. Too locally-responsive and it would not be approachable or understood by college players back east or out west. The trek of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark perfectly encapsulated that aspired versatility.\nEven in the 21st century, Lewis and Clark are still a point of pride and reverence in all of America, despite a current culture that is apathetic to its own history. Their iconic presence is still felt in elementary school curriculum, as well as products, businesses, and schools that carry their namesake. Any town that developed along their early-1800s route has a distinct Lewis and Clark identity or influence.\nThough the Lewis and Clark Expedition covered thousands of miles, it had just one symbolic starting point: eastern Missouri. For Mahrt, that was enough to tether the region to the league. It could be something St. Louisans embrace as their own; \"the\" local summer collegiate baseball league, without overtly using the city name or the typical Gateway Arch graphic. Since the area was the launch site for one historic journey, so too could it be the beginning of brilliant careers (baseball or otherwise) for other young men.\nThe ampersand that commonly links Lewis to Clark has become the iconic shorthand logo, with an epsilon version prominently displayed on the front of every team's hat. The league chose to showcase one unifying logo in this case, a punctuation mark instead of unique, team-specific fonts or graphics. The colors differentiate one team from all others. It can be an ambiguous conversation starter, but there is no denying that each team's New Era caps are clearly part of the same league. For this reason, the \"Amp[ersand] League\" is another colloquial nickname for the LCBL.\nPhilosophy.\nThe LCBL is a unique summer collegiate league for many reasons; most notably, the option players have to swing a bat made of wood \"or\" metal. Since Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball solely use wood bats, nearly all other top-tier summer leagues exclusively use wood.\nEven with new BBCOR standards to reduce batted ball exit speed, using the technology of composite bats is perceived to inflate offensive power and thus misrepresent statistics to pro scouts. Thus, Major League Baseball only sponsors, and partially funds, wood-bat leagues. They do so as a common denominator metric to judge, compare, and project the value of both hitters and pitchers to the professional game.\nDue to subtle differences in length-to-weight ratios, and the discernible feeling at contact, the potential exists for a difficult transition period from metal (college) to wood (pro). To avoid this steep learning curve, more and more collegiate athletes use the summer as acclimation time with the tools of their future trade. The unapologetic objective of premier leagues is to prepare their amateur players for the Major League First-Year Player Draft, using the summer as a professional proving ground. MLB seizes the logistical opportunity to get talent, professional-caliber equipment, and franchise representatives all in one place. The LCBL believes that such models compromise the spirit of the league's competitive nature; each game is too much like an audition or stepping stone. Professional baseball is not on the horizon for every college player, in need of a summer league.\nThis is not to say that the LCBL has no desire to get players drafted. The commissioner's office simply understands its rarity. Making everyone swing wood, just to accommodate the 9.7% that will play baseball at the next level, is painting with a broad stroke. For a player who rationally understands that he has hit his ceiling that upon the completion of his senior year he will never play competitive baseball again it makes all the sense in the world for him to swing a bat with collegiate specifications. Forcing such a player to limit their power, and spend a summer using tools they will not operate back on campus, is misguided. It can lead to a bigger re-adjustment period than not playing any offseason baseball at all.\nThe Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League is as elite as any rival wooden bat league, with a bigger onus on team success and without the MLB sponsorship. LCBL players stay in the moment and enjoy the summer for what it is: a competitive league with a coveted championship trophy, where players can swing what they do in college.\nThe \"Find Your Way\" motto encourages each individual to shape the league to fit their unique situation. Some players stubbornly see it as the ground floor for an unheralded pro career, and swing wood. Others tinker their swings, with the familiarity of metal, in an attempt to be the best collegiate player possible. There is no shame, or stigma, in either bat selection. Furthermore, success with composite materials stand as good of a chance to get professional attention. Those are the core beliefs of the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League's Barrel Up Initiative, encouraging players to swing what is comfortable.\nThe league is not blind to the fact that young adults get excited to be seen by pro scouts. For this reason, the LCBL is in the preliminary talks with members of the St. Louis Cardinals front office, in hopes they might expand their presence in 2014.\nAll these factors hark back to the decision to name the league after Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Their historical journey through the unknown epitomized the primary objective of the LCBL. For a college kid, post-baseball life is the great unknown. The league is tailored to the NCAA tagline: \"There are over 380,000 student-athletes, and most of us go pro in something other than sports.\" With ample internship opportunities to use their time in St. Louis as a networking, personal marketing, and resume-building experience players leave the summer having found their way in more than just baseball wins and losses.\nTeams.\nCurrently, there are ten teams in the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League; up from four in the inaugural season. A second expansion is set for 2015, bringing the final count to twelve. Teams are broken into two conferences Clark (weekdays) and Lewis (weekends) and evenly dispersed into four divisions. The divisions are named for the four major waterways in the St. Louis area: Mississippi River, Missouri River, Meramec River, and River Des Peres.\nThe names within the LCBL encompass the vast job descriptions of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Beyond exploring new lands, the two American heroes were both territorial governors, soldiers, and unrivaled natural historians. Their various titles are commemorated, as team nicknames, across the chest of each player's jersey.\nOne of the teams, in particular, subtly honors the accomplishments of the less-heralded William Clark. The Lieutenant's role in the expedition had always taken a historical backseat to that of Captain Meriwether Lewis. However, in 2001, president Bill Clinton promoted Clark to the military rank of Captain of the Regular Army; posthumously placing Clark on equal standing as Lewis. Recognizing this important gesture, the LCBL has a team called the Captains, fittingly in the Clark Conference.\nIn the first two seasons, none of the teams carried a specific location identifier, since all are the product of the St. Louis metropolitan area. Contrary to the industry standard, the LCBL preferred to have the teams be known by the nickname exclusively. In 2015, this changed in the Lewis Conference, as franchise ownership shifted from league-controlled to individual general management groups. For example, the Pioneers are now branded as the Alton Pioneers; referencing the town in Illinois where the team calls home.\nLewis Conference.\nDespite the goal of having both conferences up and running in 2013, the weekend league was the only one to take off in the inaugural season of the LCBL. Four teams played 28 games, exclusively on the weekends, in year number one. In a tongue-in-cheek tribute to Major League Baseball's National League, the Lewis Conference carries the nickname \"Senior Circuit\" for its longer existence; albeit only one year over the Clark Conference.\nIn 2014, the \"Founding Four\" original Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League franchises realigned and set out to fill six teams. The Pioneers and Explorers returned to the Lewis Conference, where they were always meant to play. With the stalled launch of weekday play, the two spent the 2013 in the Clark Conference to maintain the Lewis &amp; Clark motif.\nHowever, the Lewis Conference was only able to secure one of their two expansion teams, for 2014. The Governors played in the Lewis, but the Voyagers were needed in the Clark to restore competitive balance. The two met in the 2014 Corps of Discovery Cup Championship. According to preseason plans, these teams would have never matched up in an inter-conference title game. The Voyagers followed the same script as the Explorers the year before: play in the Clark Conference (on a one-year conditional basis), win the league championship, then switch conferences the very next season. One month after winning the Cup, the Voyagers officially became the sixth member of the Lewis Conference.\nWith two more expansion teams in 2015, the Lewis Conference is now up to its final size: eight franchises. They are broken into (2) four-team divisions, the Des Peres and the Meramec two lesser-known rivers in the area that feed into the Mississippi-Missouri Watershed.\nTeams in the Lewis Conference continue to play games exclusively on Friday evenings, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the course of an eight-week summer schedule, each team plays every other Lewis Conference team on multiple occasions. Those in the same division square off in (3) two-game series scattered throughout the season. In some instances, four of the games versus a common opponent could occur in the same weekend. Regardless, it amounts to six games, split evenly home and away, against the three divisional foes.\nThe schedule is then filled with games against the four teams in the other division. Lewis Conference teams never play regular-season games against Clark Conference opponents. Instead, they crossover to play four games each with all the inter-divisional opponents. The 18 divisional games, along with the 16 cross-division match-ups, give each team a total of 34 regular-season games.\nClark Conference.\nTeams in the Clark Conference are the relative newcomers to the LCBL, not starting play exclusively on weekdays until 2014. The conference \"did\" exist in 2013, but in name only. The label was simply used to differentiate between the original four teams; splitting the league in half solely for All-Star and playoff purposes. The Pioneers and Explorers played one conditional season in the Clark, with the Explorers incongruously capturing the Discovery Cup Championship for the conference (before it even launched). The official unveiling of the Clark Conference came a month later.\nThe first season of play was slated to introduce the Lookouts, Navigators, Captains, and Diplomats. When the Navigators announced they would need another year to become operational, the Voyagers a 2014 expansion team meant for the Lewis Conference moved over to fill the void. In 2015, one final realignment has returned all the teams to their originally-intended location. The Voyagers go back to the Lewis Conference; taking with them yet another league title. Strangely, the first two LCBL Champions now reside in the Lewis, but won the Cup while members of the Clark.\nWith some temporary modifications, the franchise model that Mahrt and Clites envisioned had been adhered to enough to proceed. The plan for each conference was for four teams in year one, six in year two, and eight by year three. By that third-year checkpoint, the goal was to transfer majority ownership of each team to groups/individuals. With a \"head start\" the Lewis Conference reached its eight in the first three seasons. Even though only three Clark franchises had players on the field in 2014, the LCBL business model pushed forward as if all four did. The four were joined by two new teams, in accordance to the expansion timeline. They are broken into (2) three-team divisions, the Mississippi and the Missouri – the two area rivers with a national reach.\nPlayers.\nThe talent level of the players who participate in the LCBL has always been tailored to the student-athlete. The largest representation among the various levels of collegiate baseball is that of the Division-III athlete. This is both the byproduct of an ample baseball programs in the St. Louis area (evidenced by an entire conference bearing \"St. Louis\" in its moniker) and also part of the original mission of the commissioner. As D-III coaches, Mahrt and Clites looked to take care of their own under-served market sector first.\nThe LCBL has a wider eligibility range than typical summer baseball programs. Rosters from the Prospect League, for instance, are composed exclusively of freshmen, sophomore, and junior class players from four-year affiliated institutions. Additionally, no more than four members of the same institution are permitted to play on the same summer team. The mindset is to give opportunities to those with proven collegiate ability and at least one year remaining in their college baseball careers.\nThe Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League certainly aims to follow this model, but the league is not MLB funded or NCAA sanctioned, so it can grant generous exemptions. If a high school senior has a letter of acceptance into an accredited college or university, and it is accompanied by a letter from the school's baseball coach confirming a mutual commitment, offered athletic scholarship(s), or general recruiting interest the individual is permitted to play in the LCBL during the summer before his first collegiate semester.\nFurthermore, the league also uniquely grants eligibility on the back-end of a college player's career. Academic seniors and graduate students are permitted to play one final summer of baseball, so long as their graduation day, most recent college baseball season, and final LCBL season all correspond in the same calendar year. This means that a player does not have to return to a college or university upon August's completion of the league schedule.\nRecruiting.\nTo ensure playing time, each team in the LCBL has a roster maximum of 23 players. These spots are specifically broken down position-by-position, with very little flexibility or deviation. Mahrt did not want a scenario where a college catcher joined a team that already had two. Players come to the LCBL to hone their skills at their primary positions, not platoon 33% of the time or get thrown into an unknown place on the field. Thus, each manager in the league is restricted in recruiting two catchers, three middle infielders, three corner infielders, five outfielders, seven (primary) pitchers, and one designated hitter. There is one bonus recruit: a utility piece with flexibility of playing in any of the previous position groups, even if it exceeds the limitations (e.g. a fourth middle infielder).\nAll LCBL managers are encouraged to personally recruit as many players as possible, based on positional needs of the team. Since most managers are also college assistant coaches, the recruiting process typically starts by filling the summer roster with student-athletes from their own conference or schools with prior affiliations. The only restriction: an NCAA coach cannot manage his own college player during the summer.\nTo provide continuity, managers must (at the very least) offer any eligible players a chance to return to their previous teams. If the returning player commits, it counts as a recruit towards the manager's total. Players sign letters of commitment upon registration, stating that the manager made an offer and the player will forgo the draft process by accepting.\nShould a player decline – either because he does not want to play for that same manager again, or he simply desires to play on a different team he holds the power to opt out, pending league approval. Returning players that decline an offer from their original team become restricted free agents and, if no other manager \"recruits\" them to switch teams, they go into the pool of draftable candidates. The one stipulation is that they cannot be drafted by the team they left.\nGateway Players.\nClites came up with a narrow-focus marketing plan that specifically targets out-of-state college baseball players with St. Louis ties. Rather than cast a wide net into the national talent pool, he compiled a database of nearly 40 recent graduates from local high schools that traveled extensive distances to play college baseball. The approach is to grant referral discounts to these players (in schools over 150 miles away) who house college friends that commit to play in the league.\nClites recognized that these journeying players need an incentive to come back to St. Louis for their summer months. Their parents likely prefer it, and the availability of a familiar job increases, but that is not enough. The convincing requirement for the student-athlete is whether their summer baseball experience will be top-notch. If Mahrt and Clites could make the domestic product equal or better than anywhere else, people would willingly come back home.\nTo achieve this standard of excellence, the LCBL put the quality of the league in the player's hands; enticing superior St. Louis-based talent to be their own promoters. If they come back home to play, and bring a skilled college teammate, it becomes a win-win for all. Clites coined them \"Gateway Players\" in a nod to the city's nickname and a play on the tell-a-friend marketing strategy. A vast majority of these players are former members of the St. Louis Gamers (a youth travel program where Clites and Mahrt both coached). Several are on scholarship at Division-I schools, which only adds to the credibility of the league.\nThe commissioner's office reviews the application for Gateway Players, verifying that the college teammate does not have prior St. Louis affiliations; no other options to stay in the city. Each applicant must also agree to play in a minimum number of games to qualify. If the request is approved, one registration fee is refunded and the two college teammates operate as a package deal. Both must play on the same team, like brothers in a Little League program. If any manager wants to claim one, they receive the other, but it costs the team two recruiting chips. If the Gateway Players go unsigned in the offseason, they will enter the draft, and must be selected in back-to-back rounds.\nThe Gateway Player program is yet another example of Lewis and Clark's spirit embodied. The league rewards those that blaze trails to new territory; in this case, the first St. Louis-area high school kids to ever play baseball at several prominent programs across the country. By coming back to the place where their journey started, they are creating two-way paths for others to follow in their footsteps just like Lewis and Clark. With this program in place, players from states such as California and Texas that had never before traveled to Missouri are now playing in the LCBL. Furthermore, they are doing so without having to pay $900 or stay in the house of complete strangers.\nDraft.\nOne logistical issue with a mission to have separate weekday and weekend players is the need for both conferences to have their own tryout and draft process. Players that are not recruited, or are not claimed in free agency, must first select which day of the week they would like to play. For 2014, the Lewis Conference requires a minimum of 138 total players; 92 for the inaugural Clark Conference season. These roster spots come in a random assortment of positions, as each team will have different position limits already reached. Brandon Fairbanks is the league's Director of Recruiting and is responsible for building the pool of un-recruited players. An open tryout is then held in mid-May.\nEven if a player has a limited window of participation either late to arrive to St. Louis or early to return to his campus signing a preseason commitment letter counts as recruitment. Each manager's first thirteen recruits operate as non-compensatory additions, meaning teams do not lose out on any draft picks to sign them. At the point of adding a fourteenth recruit, the coaching staff must weigh the value of that recruit over a pick in the first round in the draft. Sign a fifteenth player, and the decision also costs a team a second-round pick, and so on. If, for example, a team has 18 eligible returnees, and they all sign the mandated offer to come back, then the manager would not draft a player until the sixth round.\nThis measure ensures league-wide competitive balance and player buy-in with their previous team. The new, un-recruited talent goes to the weaker teams, while the championship-caliber teams where all the players are eager to return roll out a nearly identical roster to defend their success. A team could conceivably draft only emergency reserve players. Should they return a majority of the roster and complement the rest with new recruits, the 23 full-time roster spots could be filled well before Opening Day.\nAfter the conference-specific tryouts, the managers begin the draft. Like most major sports leagues, the order is assembled by the previous season's standings in reverse. Any expansion teams jump to the front of the line, with the first picks of each round. The draft commences until every player is selected, even if teams exceed their 23-player roster cap. The late-round draft picks those that occupy roster spots 24 and beyond are notified of their conditional team affiliation. Their registration fee is discounted, while their contact information is kept for emergency roster situations; roster vacancies via injuries, vacations, or those who must return to school in early August. Should they accept this reserve role, each has to sign a league document, stating they understand the possibility exists that they will not play all season.\nRoster Submission.\nManagers set and submit an active roster (with a maximum of 23 players) each week, operating like a fantasy sports league. Decisions pertaining a player's active status are final until the next week's roster submission. Even if a Clark Conference player is set to miss only one day, should the manager place him on the inactive list, he is not eligible to play any games during that week. If he is kept on the active roster, the team would play with 22 players during his one-game absence (unable to add a willing reserve midweek).\nUndrafted \"rental\" players \"are\" eligible to come in and out of the LCBL. Inevitably, a few young adults are late to hear of the LCBL, miss the draft, and/or can only play in a handful of games. With executive committee approval, and only with reserve status, they can still play. In other words, the original 23 players that are recruited or drafted have preferential treatment. If the full-time recruits and draftees are healthy and present, they must be on the active roster. This policy provides competitive balance; no manager can arbitrarily dress a talented \"rental\" player, who is in town for one week.\nThis is especially important in the postseason. A few LCBL players are dual-sport athletes and must leave at playoff time for the start of college football practices. In order to qualify for these voided spots, undrafted \"rental\" players must dress for 15% of their team's total games. Drafted reserves can play in the postseason without this restriction. Since all conference managers had a chance to evaluate (and draft) them before the start of the season, their diminished talents are known. Managers keep these players on-call for a reason; their opportunity to play just might come in the team's most important games. Both types of reserves must enter the roster while staying within the league's position-by-position limitations, filling a direct need at a particular place on the field.\nCollege Representation.\nStudents at the following institutions have played for teams in the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League:\nIn addition to this list, Chabot College has sent players to participate in the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League, but the two-year school is not a member of any of the associations shown above. In California, junior colleges have their own governing body the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA).\nManagers &amp; Coaches.\nThe \"Find Your Way\" motto has a host of different interpretations and applications. For Mahrt, the league was as much about the managers and coaches as the players themselves. The common denominator is the pursuit of future employment; the players can obtain it while participating in the league, the managers can obtain it \"by\" participating in the league. The LCBL is a resume-building experience for young talent in the ranks of collegiate assistant coaches.\nMahrt uses resources like the American Baseball Coaches Association to take chances on unknown volunteer assistants, to get them hooked on coaching as a feasible career path. While other leagues have veteran coaches for decades, the league is known for turning over a new crop of talent. It is not often that a coach in his twenties is given the top responsibilities of a college-level team. For this reason, college assistant coaches come from as far away as Colorado and Florida to be a part of the LCBL coaching ranks.\nA few St. Louis-based college assistants offer their employers' field as an LCBL host site. The many facets of familiarity, which come with the decision, give each a distinct advantage over those that travel to St. Louis. Even a former major leaguer, Jason Isringhausen, recognizes the convenience of the league setup. He can spend a few summer months, developing amateur ballplayers, on the same college field where he coaches from August to May.\nLCBL field managers are among the youngest in any summer college baseball league. This gives an unrivaled level of comfort to the players, being coached by a man who is closer to their age than their college head coach. However, youth or inexperience is not a viable excuse for not commanding the dugout. The interview process is thorough and each must take their leadership duties very seriously. Upon being hired, managers select their assistant coach and set aside at least one day a week for practice time.\nThe league's executive committee specifically targets coaches that get results with quiet respect instead of loud degradation. It is a point of extreme emphasis that coaches, who operate by means of intimidation, are not welcome. Believing it has no place in the game, Mahrt decided to use the league as a platform to send a small message on values to all levels of baseball. Thus, the LCBL managers are typically more approachable and relatable; a perfect fit with the casual, yet serious, atmosphere that comes with summer baseball.\nSince LCBL franchises do not have owners or general managers, human resource decisions come from the executive committee, with neutrality and the league's best interest in mind. Mahrt believes the quality of the coach is directly attributable to a team's wins and losses, especially since recruiting is a huge component to the job description. Thus, teams that continue to struggle will be subjected to league intervention. The manager may be relegated to assistant coach status, while a new field manager is given an opportunity.\nEven the perennially successful are asked to move into an administrative role or take a promotion in a place like the Northwoods League after a few seasons. With only twelve teams, the league is always looking for places to test the next wave of young talent. The goal of the LCBL is to have just as many famous alumni be coaches as players.\nDiscovery Series.\nThe Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League postseason operates like the major league model of the 1970s; no wild cards, just the four division winners. The difference is that those MLB series were the best-of-five and the LCBL variety can, at most, go three games.\nAt the culmination of the regular season, division-winning teams stay in St. Louis for one more week. In the Clark Conference, the Meramec champion plays the winner of the Des Peres division. In the Lewis Conference, the top team in the Mississippi standings meets up with the best of the three teams in the Missouri division. These conference finals are known as the Discovery Series the respective CCDS and LCDS.\nThey are so named for the group of enlisted men that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led on their 1804 expedition. The modern iteration of the Corps of Discovery is the group of 23 baseball players that can collectively \"find its way\" to a championship. In Mahrt's eyes, \"you discover a lot about yourself and your team in the playoffs.\"\nThe home team for each Discovery Series is determined by better win percentage, with head-to-head record as the primary tiebreaker. This is part of the reason why teams in the same conference, but opposite divisions, play each other an odd number (seven) of regular-season games. Something as important as postseason home-field advantage does not come down to run differential or a coin flip.\nThe potential three games are played on back-to-back days. The team with the better record actually begins postseason play as the visiting team, on the road. Game 2 occurs on the next day, with Game 3 (if necessary) to immediately follow. These latter games are played at the home stadium of the conference's top seed.\nThe team that is twice victorious is crowned the champion of more than just a conference; the Discovery Series winner has an entire portion of the calendar to stand for their greatness the \"Best of Weekday\" and the \"Best of the Weekend.\" These two teams then square off in the LCBL's version of the Super Bowl.\nSince moving to their rightful spot in the Lewis Conference, the Explorers are the only LCBL team that can ever win a championship in both conferences. Although they played exclusively on the weekends, the Explorers were the \"Best of the Weekday\" in 2013. They represented the Clark Conference in the first-ever [Corps of] Discovery Cup Championship and won the title. This unique situation is similar to the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball, switching leagues with a pennant won in its previously affiliated league.\nCorps of Discovery Cup.\nTo settle the dispute as to which conference is best, a championship game at Busch Stadium crowns league supremacy. It is the second of two games on the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League schedule played at the home of the St. Louis Cardinals. The first, the LCBL All-Star Game, allows the best individual players to share the same field as the pros. However, getting there a second time requires a total \"team\" effort. Mahrt and Clites decided to reward the conference winners with this championship opportunity, rather than another three- or five-game series at college fields.\nThe league believes that the players would gladly trade the fairness of a longer championship series for an opportunity to play a winner-take-all title game in a major league ballpark. It gives each player a goal that is both selfish and team-oriented: play in Busch Stadium twice in one year. The one-game finale also grants the league definitive closure. With student-athletes that need to return to campus in August, the conclusion of the season is set before the end of the previous calendar year.\nThe home team in the Discovery Cup Championship is also determined well before the night of. Giving it to the team with the higher regular-season winning percentage can be skewed by one conference's weaker competitors, and the lack of interleague play prevents head-to-head record deciding. For this reason despite its unpopularity among baseball fans, including most LCBL executives the winner of the league's All-Star Game dictates home-field advantage for that year's league championship.\nSince, in the words of Clites, \"we are all fans of pro ball, and imitation is the highest form of flattery,\" the LCBL takes as many pages from the Major League Baseball playbook as possible. Even if the policies are disliked, the league strives for continuity with the nuances of modern baseball. It helps the casual fans; no new quirks to learn, but rather the procedures of a major sports league to fall back on. Therefore, as long as the MLB All-Star Game determines the home team in the World Series, so shall it be for the LCBL.\nHistory of the Trophy.\nThe iconic Corps of Discovery Cup was graciously donated and re-purposed by The Highlands Golf &amp; Tennis Center, where Clites served as a golf operations manager. The cup and the base are actually separate pieces from two different tennis trophies. Both components have a unique, but revered, past.\nThe two-foot-tall stem belongs to a participation award given to, of all things, the Davis Cup tennis team from the nation of Ecuador. The clay courts at The Highlands hosted the 1961 Americas Zone semifinal matches of the world-famous Davis Cup, with Ecuador taking on the United States. Similar to modern soccer matches, the two sides exchanged gifts to express sportsmanship and welcome the visiting team. To commemorate the Latin American team on their final four appearance in their first-ever Davis Cup tournament St. Louis native, and star of the U.S. team, Chuck McKinley presented a brass cup to Ecuadorian captain Blas Uscocovich. The ornate top of the two-piece trophy traveled back to Ecuador, but its stand was temporary used only to keep the cup off the clay surface for photos. It was found in storage of the St. Louis Tennis Hall of Fame at The Highlands.\nThe crown of the Corps of Discovery Cup comes from a different, even older, clay court contest. From 1910 until 1927, The Highlands St. Louis Amateur Athletic Association (Triple \"A\") then known as the St. Louis Amateur Athletic Association (Triple \"A\") played host to a regional qualifier for the esteemed U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships.\nThe Triple \"A\" tennis club was, and still is, a member of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association. The governing body has evolved since then: subsequently dropping the \"National\" and then the \"Lawn\" from its name. Whatever the acronym, the organization has consistently overseen this national championship (and their qualifying tournaments) for over a century. Now under modern USTA control, the U.S. Clay Court Championship is a prestigious ATP Tour event in Houston, Texas.\nLike many governing bodies in sports, American tennis has always been broken into geographical regions. St. Louis currently operates in the USTA Missouri Valley chapter, but it was originally known as the USNLTA Gateway Section. Annually, amateur tennis players would come to The Highlands (St. Louis Triple \"A\") and play singles matches in a men's open tournament. The winner received a spot in the U.S. Clay Court Championship field, along with a cup with a \"G\" emblazoned, to represent the Gateway Section. At the end of each year's celebration, the player would advance to the national site (either Omaha, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, and even elsewhere in St. Louis), but the award was retained by the club for future winners.\nThe national tournament was not held in 1928 due to financial restructuring and a flu epidemic. When it returned the following year, Triple \"A\" was no longer a sectional site and has not been selected since. Until the LCBL refurbished the cup, it had been collecting dust in the Tennis Hall of Fame for 85 years.\nThe rich history of this patchwork trophy is now deeper, and more of a conversation piece, with the components combined. Thanks to the LCBL, forgotten moments of St. Louis' sports past have been resurrected. It was a two-way street of good fortune for a league that was going to purchase a trophy, with no lineage, in a store. Instead, the league stumbled upon something as storied as the Stanley Cup with the provenance of a famous portrait.\nPostseason Awards.\nDeviating slightly from all the other historical tributes to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League hopes to name awards for the league's best pitcher and best offensive player after two St. Louis Cardinals living legends; however, approval for use of those names is pending. Both men are esteemed members of the St. Louis community, and the LCBL hopes to make them honorary board members.\nEach individual award is given only to one recipient. There is not a Pitcher of the Year in the Lewis Conference \"and\" the Clark Conference, for instance. The best in each conference never get a chance to face each other in the regular season, so they must put up statistics that speak for themselves. The only flaw in this model is the assumption that the talent in both conferences is nearly identical.\nTop Pitcher Award.\nThe award is annually given to the LCBL player with the most distinguished pitching season, regardless of role. This is solely determined by Pitcher Rating, a statistical equation created by Ross Clites in 2010. The formula takes into consideration individual winning percentage, saves (if any), strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, and a pitcher's run support average per start. It takes the subjectivity out of performances that only come around once a week. This is especially essential for pitchers in a summer league, where there's not a sample size of 30+ games and 100+ at-bats to judge. No manager can see all the starts made by each ace, and there is no safety net for an off-day. Thus, No voting and highest PR value wins.\nOffensive MVP Award.\nThe award is annually given to the LCBL player with the most distinguished offensive season. It is an MVP award that can only be won by a position player; pitchers have their own accolades. Not nearly as complex to explain as the crowning of the Top Pitcher Award, the Top Position Player Award simply requires a traditional voting process. It does, however, mirror the pitching award by rejecting any statistics accumulated during the postseason.\nAll managers and top assistant coaches receive a ballot, along with the Commissioner's Office). All use game logs from the SportsEngine statistic software to better inform their decisions, especially with those who play in the other conference. The Top Position Player Award winner consistently has offensive numbers in the top ten of the entire league. The voting echoes that of Major League Baseball, with a seemingly arbitrary vector of 14 points for first-place votes, 9 for second, 8 for third, and so on.\nAll-Defensive Team.\nMuch like professional baseball leagues honor their best glove men, the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League annually lists a position-by-position all-defensive team. These nine athletes are voted on strictly by the commissioner's office, after looking over game logs of exceptional defensive plays and overall fielding percentage data. Players in both conferences are in competition for the same list.\nNew to Major League Baseball in 2011, and adapted for the LCBL, there are certain criterion regarding each position most notably that each winner only qualifies at his primary spot. Catchers must be behind the plate in at least half of his team's games. All infielders and outfielders have a 5% boost to this requirement. For a shortstop to qualify, for example, he must play the position (at least one full inning) in 55% of his team's total games. As for pitchers, they need to average an inning pitched for every total team game.\nAll-Star Game.\nThe annual Lewis &amp; Clark All-Star Game pits the best players in the Clark Conference against the best in the Lewis. It is played at the midpoint of the season in Busch Stadium, home of the St. Louis Cardinals. The event is also the league's Scout Day – a showcase for invited MLB personnel to evaluate the LCBL's greatest players.\nThe logo is a take on the MLB All-Star Game logo that the Cardinals used in 2009, when they hosted the 80th Midsummer Classic.\nThe league schedules the game during the week of July Fourth, giving all players a true week-long All-Star Break for family vacations. The event is obviously dependent on the Cardinals home schedule, but tends to fall on a Thursday night; a time when the odds for an empty Busch Stadium are increased by Major League Baseball's typical travel day. The 2014 All-Star Game will be held on Thursday, July 3 at 7:30 p.m.\nGeneral admission to the game is free, and the main concourse concessions are open, but there are several ways for fans to pay a ticket price for an upgraded experience. For the friends and family that want to get as close to the action as possible, the league sells admission to the Cardinals Club. The infamous green seats (typically off-limits during amateur games) provide a front-row viewing experience directly behind home plate. The all-inclusive ticket comes with the full amenities of any pro gameday. It grants access to an internal bar/restaurant, with a wide range of food and beverages that can be delivered to the guest's seats while they watch.\nAnother option for spectators is the Double Play Benefit. The event raises money for 100 Neediest Cases a subsidiary of the St. Louis United Way and takes place in two stunning locations. Prior to the game, Double Play guests join league executives for a cocktail hour inside the home bullpen. As the pregame festivities wind down, the gala moves up to the Champions Club (luxury suite) for dinner and a chance to meet Cardinals legend Lou Brock. Friends and family enjoy finer dining at tables next to St. Louis' 11 World Series trophies.\nBoth tickets offer All-Star Game goers unmatched vantage points in Busch Stadium at prices that are significantly discounted from the market value of a professional game. The opportunity to get an autograph from a Hall of Famer is a complimentary bonus. The irony is that Lou Brock was asked to participate in the event long before the connection was made between the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League and the St. Louis great's full name: Louis Clark Brock.\nThe players are hardly shortchanged on their experience; prior to moving up to the Champions Club, Lou Brock stops by both dugouts to meet the Clark Conference and Lewis Conference All-Stars. The on-field action features all the comforts of the major leaguers, too. Public address announcer, John Ulett, is on hand for player and coach introductions before the game. The voice of the Cardinals also calls their name as they walk to the plate or enter the game to pitch.\nThe scoreboard prominently displays the lineups as if LCBL players were called up the big leagues. Even the Fox Sports Midwest camera crew films the game as intently as a Cubs vs. Cardinals game. The telecast only \"airs\" inside the ballpark, but is shown complete with slow-motion replays on all televisions in the luxury boxes and concourses. St. Louis Cardinals Director of Amateur Games, Chris Breuer makes sure everything, shy of the 46,000 fans, looks and feels like a pro game.\nWhen it comes to player selection for the All-Star Game, the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League deviates from its typical following of Major League Baseball procedures. Both the LCBL and MLB use a position-by-position balloting process, but the difference comes in the pitching staff. The reigning pennant-winning major league managers hand-pick their pitchers. The LCBL groups the pitchers with all other players into one pool for voting.\nThose who cast the vote are different as well. Major League Baseball gives an unlimited number of ballots to each and every fan. The summer college league hardly has the developed fan base to pull off such a feat. Instead, the managers, league officials, and players come together to add their input.\nThe LCBL's vote is far more democratic; each elector only votes once. The 23 players on each team select their peers, with some stipulations. They cannot vote for members of the other conference. Put another way, no team is permitted to pick their opposition. This prevents one conference from stuffing the ballot with the weakest players in the other conference.\nAlso, players cannot select members of their own team. In essence, the players must look to the other teams in their conference and honestly select those that they trust in a pivotal game. Rather than a popularity contest or the staleness of players selecting only their own, LCBL voters must put some thought into the ballot. Receiving a peer vote is the ultimate sign of respect; a non-teammate selection recognizes a rival's talent enough to count on him to win the game. And that is where the voting format forces competitors to unify for a common purpose: team allegiances take a back seat to that of the conference. Players get tired of hearing that the weekend (or the weekday) is where the best talent in the league plays. The All-Star Game is the pinnacle bragging rights game, allowing players to settle it on the field. The winning conference sends a representative to the home dugout for the Discovery Cup Championship a month later.\nLCBL managers submit 12 All-Star candidates (C, 1B, 2B, SS, 3B, OF, OF, OF, DH, SP, SP, RP) to the league by mid-June. All the manager's selections are assembled into team-specific ballots. Players on the Travelers, for example, receive a paper ballot with 60 names: 12 members, arranged by position, from each of the five other Lewis Conference teams. Voters select one player in each positional category (three outfielders, three pitchers). With each team's entire roster, manager, assistant coach, and five members of the LCBL administrative staff all voting, a unanimous All-Star selection would receive 135 votes (5 teams x 23 players + 5 managers + 5 coaches + 5 executives).\nThe roster is filled to a maximum of 26 players, based on the ballot results. Each conference's top two vote-getters at catcher, first, second, short, third, and designated hitter serve as the respective starters and back-ups. Each roster takes six outfielders, with their rank and alignment up to the discretion of the All-Star manager. The same is true for the eight pitchers (regardless of role) with the highest vote totals. Keeping in line with major league formalities, the managers from the previous season's Discovery Cup Championship call the shots in the All-Star Game. All other league managers serve as bench coaches.\nMembers of the Travelers and Pathfinders combined to beat the all-stars from the Pioneers and Explorers, in their one-and-only conditional season affiliated with the Clark Conference. The Lewis Conference won the game in an astonishing 1–0 shutout fashion. The feat matched the outcome of the 1968 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Houston. Ten Lewis Conference pitchers combined to throw nine innings without giving up a run, surrendering just six hits.\nAdministrative Structure.\nMajor LCBL decisions pass through the league's executive committee. The five-person panel votes on all changes to the LCBL's rules and regulations section of the Player/Coach Code of Conduct handbook. Each member brings their unique expertise: business management, finance, marketing, and law. They have the authority with a majority vote to alter, suspend or modify any of the policies of the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League. The executive committee is also responsible for the appointing of new field managers, the creation of both conference schedules, the approval of the budget, the purchasing of equipment, and many other administrative tasks.\nThe actions of the president and all executives are accountable to the board members. These members meet annually to preside over the larger-scale direction of the league. The board is the community barometer; representing businesses and iconic personalities in the city of St. Louis, they present outsiders' perception of the league.\nThe league also has various senior directors that serve as the trusted advisory staff to the executive committee. Each presents a skill set that supplements the general promotion of the league, beyond the local area. Through website design, social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, or even word-of-mouth marketing in different regions, the advisory staff works hard to spread the brand to all corners of the country. They are also the key pieces in the fundraising efforts that take place throughout the calendar year. LCBL staff are friends and family of the executives, using their valuable time to volunteer to plan the Double Play Benefit during the All-Star Game. The league even organizes an annual Festivus party to thank everyone in the LCBL family for their dedicated work.\nUmpiring Association.\nNot just a stepping stone for players and coaches, the LCBL is also a developmental league for umpires. The Lewis &amp; Clark Umpiring Association (LCUA) was founded in 2013, at the culmination of the inaugural campaign. The initial player and coach feedback regarding the umpires who worked league games in year one was all positive, so Mahrt decided to lock them in for years to come. To effectively entice the area's best collegiate umpires take part, he created an association to provide them with consistent work and training. Built to rival the Greater St. Louis (GSL) Umpiring Association, the LCUA does for umpires what the LCBL sets out to do for its student-athletes: return a higher quality product to the college ranks in the Fall.\nThe association empowers each umpire with a stake in the success of the league and the security of administrative support. With \"Lewis &amp; Clark\" in the name of their association, an incentive is put in place for the umpires to take tremendous pride in their work. The familiar branding presents an opportunity for umpires to advance to the next tier of baseball as the league gains notoriety. In essence, the league belongs as much to the umpires as much about them \"finding their way\" as anyone.\nThe LCUA operates like a union, with veteran umpire Kyle Johnson serving as the president. is in charge of assigning games and locations to the umpires. If an umpiring vacancy occurs, he oversees the recruiting of a replacement to the crew. As an acting umpire in the league, is the highest-appointed crew chief the Director of On-Field Discipline and Umpiring. He has the power to settle rule disputes (in any game, on any field) that require league intervention. He represents all league umpires in meetings where issues like policy changes or contract negotiations need to be taken to the commissioner's office. Before the start of each season, leads the annual training sessions for all umpires in the league.\nThe association employs ten full-time umpires, paired up into five two-man crews. These umpires service the league as a whole; there are not separate umpiring crews for each conference. Depending on the flexibility of all ten umpires, the leagues does its best to rotate the game and location assignments. There are also temporary umpires that float in and out in a reserve role. Some of these umpires come from the ranks of Minor League Baseball and college's Big XII Conference, joining the league for a week or two while passing through the St. Louis area.\nThe league utilizes a four-man crew during the mid-season All-Star Game, as well as four umpires for both the Discovery Series (conference playoffs) and the Discovery Cup Championship.\nCorporate Sponsors &amp; Vendors.\nA large portion of the LCBL's operating expenses are covered by the registration fees. But with an expressed desire to continually lower the players' fees, the league requires alternative revenue streams to fill the void. One key piece to this economic model is the generous support of local companies. As the LCBL gains sponsors, the players reap the benefits.\nPrior to each season, many St. Louis-based companies are asked to take part in Find Your Way Program the hiring of LCBL players for the summer. Several participants go well beyond providing just an employment opportunity; working with the league to further assist the players they hire. By donating money to the LCBL, the companies indirectly lower the registration fee, and the players keep more of their hard-earned paycheck.\nWhile Rawlings served as the title sponsor in year one, Miller Orthopedics took over the primary sponsorship in 2014 and is its sports medicine caretaker. Additionally, the LCBL and the St. Louis Cardinals and Busch Stadium staff enjoy a thorough and close professional relationship. Penn Station provides players with sandwiches between double-headers.\nFor training and recovery, each LCBL team is equipped with Crossover Symmetry bands. The shoulder-strengthening exercises act as preventative medicine for pitchers especially. Teams also have access to All-Star Performance, an indoor facility run by former major leaguers Matt Whiteside and Scott Cooper. There, managers can work on defensive drills, batting practice, bullpen sessions, and weightlifting throughout the season.\nThe league uses St. Louis-based Spoke Marketing for their advertising plan, while the interactive LCBL website was created by Sports Ngin out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nLeague executives have gone as far as creating their own corporate sponsors. Mahrt and Clites have teamed up to launch several baseball business ventures since the formation of the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League. Each complementary revenue source serves the league, but also uses its notoriety to cross-market. Town Coopers Baseball is an all-encompassing brand, from apparel to baseball product development. In 2013, Town Coopers expanded onto the field with a youth travel program 15U, 16U, 17U, and 18U teams that will one day funnel their alumni into the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League.\nNeeding a channel to sell Town Coopers and LCBL merchandise, Mahrt looked to create an online marketplace. He launched Gourmet Baseball in August 2013. The boutique site is designed to exclusively carry premium baseball brands like Victory and 22Fresh. Mahrt desired an interface unlike the typical online sporting goods store; one that would operate more like CNET does for the computer industry. He would ask, \"when a retail chain shows a parent over 60 youth bats, how are they supposed to pick one?\" Countless new offerings inundate the consumer each year, so Gourmet Baseball aims to streamline the buying process with rankings based on user testing. Mahrt's site carries only the top-rated products, showcasing the niche brands, and never offers models from the previous year.\nThe league itself is a trade name for a parent company and overriding corporate sponsor. Mahrt created the Leagues of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2012 to stand for a series of summer college baseball leagues in the same portfolio. The Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League is its first d/b/a.\nRecord Book.\nPitching\nThe first year of the LCBL saw several outstanding individual performances, as well as the establishment of impressive single-season high-water marks. The pinnacle achievement was the first and only no-hitter in league history, thrown by Brandon Sarkissian on June 29, 2013. The Pathfinders won the game 2–0 over the eventual league-champion Explorers; Sarkissian's final line was 9.0 IP, 0 ER, 0 H, 2 BB, 8 SO.\nOn July 13, 2013, James Ball of the Pioneers set the league record for strikeouts in a single game. His 12 punch-outs against the Pathfinders came in seven innings of work a remarkable 57% of the outs recorded coming by way of strikeout. The 2013 Best Pitcher Award winner's 46 strikeouts tied the single-season record, matched by Drue Bravo of the Travelers.\nThe 2013 Explorers pace the league record book in all the major regular-season team stats: Wins (19), ERA (3.09), and SO (180).\nDefense\nThe longest defensive streak belongs to Connor Einertson of the Travelers. After committing his lone miscue in just the third inning of the entire season, he went on to set the LCBL record for 108 consecutive chances without an error. This is an active streak that will carry over to 2014. Einertson's .991 fielding percentage fell a mere .001 behind Lance Portwood for the single-season record (by a player with a minimum of 60 chances). Portwood contributed to the team record in the same defensive category; the 2013 Pioneers posted a .946 fielding percentage.\nOffense\nArguably, the league's best offensive game is property of Jesse Abel of the Explorers. On June 7, 2013, Abel went 3-for-5 with two home runs, a double, and a record six RBIs. He reached base four times and scored three runs in an 11–6 win over the Pathfinders. The home runs were two of Abel's league-leading five HRs. Not to be outdone, Lucas Doerhoff of the Pioneers matched Abel's multi-home-run feat on July 21, 2013. Doerhoff, too, went 3-for-5 on his banner day, but added a triple to go with his pair of home runs. His 11 total bases set an LCBL record for a single game; albeit in a 12–11 loss to the Explorers.\nHits\nA day after Jesse Abel produced his six RBI game, he became the first LCBL player to have a five-hit game. This record accomplishment was equaled on June 23, 2013, by two teammates in the same game. Jake Mavropolous and 2013 MVP Collin Henry, both of the Travelers, combined for ten hits (five singles, two doubles, and three triples) in a 13–7 victory. The fourth player to reach the five-hit milestone was yet another Travelers player, Mike Hardin, on July 27, 2013.\nThe record for hits by a team in a single game is 21, by the Travelers (6/23/13). That team also holds the record for total hits in a regular season (271) and batting average (.312).\nRuns\nThe record for runs scored by a team in a single game is 19 (Explorers over Pioneers - 6/1/14).\nOn six occasions a player in the league scored four runs in one game. Two of these instances occurred within a game where the team runs record was achieved. Brett Yasui of the Explorers scored four runs in the first 18-run game and Matt Polites of the Travelers matched the record in latter. Impressively, both players did so as the ninth hitters in their respective lineups.\nThe record for runs scored by a team in a regular season is 266, by the 2013 Explorers.\nWinning &amp; Losing Streaks\nThe Pioneers had the longest winning streak in the regular season five games. The Explorers ended the 2013 regular season as winners of four straight games, so they enter 2014 on a six-game win streak (counting the two-game sweep in the Discovery Series). The 2013 Pathfinders will go down in history for their futility. They finished the season as losers of 15 consecutive games.\nAll individual and team records were compiled using GameChanger software.\nFuture Expansion.\nThe league is continually on the lookout for college-quality baseball fields for each team to permanently call home. There are plenty of fields that can host a weekend here or there, but very few have enough summer schedule flexibility to accommodate a 37-game season. Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution is the creation of a new baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.\nThe interest in 12 separate fields stems from the league's desire to eventually turn over control of each ballclub's operations. The LCBL would look like a traditional sports league, with independent franchises that make their own personnel and marketing decisions. The prerequisite to this transition is a facility for each general manager; a stable single-occupant headquarters for the team to develop a \"home\" fan base and hold consistent practices. Each independent franchise would then be able to charge admission to generate revenue to reinvest.\nThe league has been instrumental in the re-purposing of Francis R. Slay Park and the refurbishing of Harris-Stowe State University's historic Hornets Field. Both are substandard college fields that hope to be top-tier facilities by 2016. These efforts have been spearheaded by Clites, who holds a Master of Architecture degree, in collaboration with city politicians, school officials, and local planning committees. He is in the developmental stage of incorporating Bat Flip, Inc. a company he created in college as a field renovation division of the LCBL.\nThe immediate growth potential for the league is with its Find Your Way Program. The LCBL is constantly working to build brand awareness within the business community of St. Louis. More internship opportunities for the student-athletes is the number one goal each offseason. This starts with greater internal hiring; compensating more players to update the website, compile stats, maintain the field, etc. The LCBL plans to stream radio broadcasts of their future games, employing sports journalism majors at local colleges.\nFor the fans, the LCBL created an organization for alumni, friends, and family to stay connected to their favorite LCBL team. The league charges a small, one-time fee for preferred fan status. Known as the Hadley's Quadrant Club in reference to the famous navigation tool of Lewis and Clark's expedition members receive T-shirts, hats, decals, and season tickets for their LCBL loyalty. To gain access at all admission gates, season pass holders will wear (or present) a Stand Up to Cancer wristband.\nIn time, the league hopes to join the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. With the NACSB comes all the pomp and financial support of being recognized by Major League Baseball. The eight members of the esteemed association are recognized as some of the best summer collegiate baseball leagues in the United States. Sanctioning the Lewis &amp; Clark Baseball League would fill a void in the heartland of the country; North Carolina is currently the westernmost state with a team in the NACSB.\nThe parent company of the LCBL the Leagues of Extraordinary Gentlemen has its next stop planned for Denver, Colorado. Mahrt plans to take the success of the St. Louis league back to the place where he attended law school (University of Denver). Branded as the Thin Air Baseball League, play is slated to begin in 2016.\nMahrt and Clites have ambitions of taking their baseball brand to Australia for a winter league, and to Prague, Czech Republic for a college recruiting showcase camp. Both endeavors plan to be operational by 2018."

The Highlanders are led by first year head coach Dennis Cutts and played their home games at the Student Recreation Center Arena as members of the Big West Conference. They finished the season 10–21, 5–11 in Big West play to finish in eighth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big West Conference tournament to UC Irvine.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nSam Finley was the only recruit that UC Riverside signed in their 2013-14 class, and the shooting guard from Corona, California, signed his Letter of Intent on November 16, 2012. The 6'2\", 180 pound guard was rated as a two-star prospect by ESPN.com. Finley averaged 19.4 points per game in his senior season for Centennial High School.\nOn July 10, 2013, Jim Wooldridge, who had been the Highlanders' head coach for the past six seasons, was named UC Riverside's interim athletic director, replacing Brian Wickstrom, who left to take the AD job at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Wooldridge had amassed 70 wins over six years as the Highlanders' head coach. Longtime assistant coach Dennis Cutts was named as Wooldridge's interim successor.\nCutts announced the team's complete season schedule on July 23, 2013. The Highlanders' notable games featured road match-ups against San Diego State, Southern Utah, Air Force, and North Texas. UC Riverside also announced that they would play host to teams such as Montana State, Pepperdine, and Northern Illinois. The Highlanders' 16-game conference slate included one home game and one away game against each of the other eight members of the Big West Conference.\nOn August 14, 2013, Cutts announced the hiring of 23 year coaching veteran Steven Sauers to fill the open assistant coaching spot left vacant when Cutts took the head coaching job. Sauers had previously served as the director of basketball operations for the Seton Hall Pirates, and also spent time as an assistant for Marist and Iona.\nThe Highlanders played one preseason exhibition on November 1, against Pomona-Pitzer, winning by a score of 83–73. Chris Patton led the Highlanders with 27 points in the exhibition victory.\nSchedule and results.\nSource: \n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9 style=| Conference games\n!colspan=9 style=| Big West tournament"

        "text": "The USA Rugby Women's Premier League (WPL or WPL Rugby) is the top annual American women's rugby union competition. It is player-run and operates in partnership with USA Rugby. It involves the top 10 clubs in the country. The league was founded in 2009.\nThe League initially began from 8 different Division 1 Women's Sides coming together in 2009. In 2017, the League grew to 10 clubs. In 2023, the League reduced their club numbers to 7. \nThe 2020 Season was canceled on June 1, 2020 due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The League started up again in 2022.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe WPL was founded in 2009 with 8 of the top Division 1 Women's Teams in the US. The organization was created with the leadership of Kathy Flores, USA Eagle and Head Coach of the USA Women's Team, and Alex Williams in order to grow the Women's game and develop more potential players for the Women's National Team.\nThe League began with 8 clubs: Beantown Rugby, Berkeley All Blues, New York Rugby Club, Washington DC Furies, Twin City Amazons, Keystone Rugby Club, Minnesota Valkyries, and Oregon Sports Union (ORSU).\nPromotion and relegation.\nIn 2010, the league began its promotion/relegation opportunities for Division 1 Teams to join the WPL in 2010, whereby the top-ranked Division 1 Team would challenge the bottom-ranked WPL Team for their position in the WPL. From the end of the 2016 Season until the 2019 season, the WPL stopped its relegation due to their expansion.\nExpansion and beyond.\nFor the 2017 Season, the WPL allowed for the Leagues first expansion, growing the League from 8 to 10 teams, adding Beantown RFC and Chicago North Shore Rugby into the competition. \nIn 2017, the WPL created their Inaugural All-Stars Team, composed of top players from the season who would compete in preparation for the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup. In 2018, the WPL decided to create two All-Star Teams, one for the Eastern Conference and one for the Western Conference, allowing more players to compete at the top level of competition.\nOn June 1, 2020, the 2020 Season was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The season was later cancelled on July 8, 2020 and the WPL has resumed in 2022.\nProfessionalism.\nIn 2023, the WPL changed their season schedule outline and moved forward towards a more professional structure. Unfortunately, this led to three teams, the San Diego Surfers, Atlanta Harlequins, and Oregon Sports Union, specifically, to leave the WPL to focus on their club teams. With that, the Conference structure that was in place throughout most of the WPL's timeline was left behind for a cohesive league structure.\nLeague champions.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year\n! colspan=\"3\" |Final\n!Champion\n!Score\n!Runner-up"

He attended Sullivan Upper School in Holywood, and represented Ulster Schools at both cricket and rugby. After leaving school he played for C.I.Y.M.S, before moving to Manchester, where he worked in insurance and played rugby for Sale as they returned to the First Division in 1994. He represented the Irish Exiles in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship from 1992 to 1994, after which he was approached by the selectors to represent Ulster. His eligibility to represent the province was initially denied by the IRFU, before being accepted on appeal. He played once for Ulster against Cardiff in the Heineken Cup in 1995, and once in a friendly against Edinburgh District the same year. The following season, Sale refused to release him to play for Ulster.\nHe was selected for the 1997 Ireland A rugby union tour of Oceania, and was one of the few Irish players to emerge from the tour with much credit. He won three senior caps for Ireland, against New Zealand, Canada and Italy, in the autumn of 1997, but fell out of favour after coach Brian Ashton left in 1998. He continued playing for Sale until he was forced to retire after the 1999–2000 season by a recurring groin injury. As of 2006 he was living in Cheshire with his wife and son, and working as an associate director for an insurance company. In 2012 former Sale lock Dave Baldwin named him at blindside flanker in his Sale \"dream team\"."

He also holds the record for the most five-wicket hauls (67) and ten-wicket hauls in a match (22); his 16 wickets for 220 runs against England in 1998 is the fifth-best bowling performance by a player in a match. Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is the fastest to cross the 300-wicket mark (in 54 Tests), while the late West Indian player Malcolm Marshall has the best bowling average (20.94) among those who have achieved the milestone. Fellow West Indian Lance Gibbs is the most economical player with 1.98 runs per over, while South African fast bowler Dale Steyn has the best strike rate of 42.3 balls per wicket. India's Anil Kumble has the second-best bowling figures in an innings (10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan in 1999); they are the second-best in the history of Test cricket after English off-spin bowler Jim Laker's 10 for 53 ().\nIn 1990, Richard Hadlee became the first bowler to take 400 Test wickets, whilst in 2001, Courtney Walsh was the first to reach 500 wicket mark. Shane Warne was the first to take both 600 and 700 Test wickets, in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Warne's haul of 96 wickets in 2005 is the highest total in a calendar year, ahead of the 90 wickets taken the following year by Muralidaran, although he played fewer innings."

        "text": "The Washington Huskies women's basketball team represents the University of Washington in NCAA Division I college basketball competing in the Pac-12 Conference. Their home games are played at Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, located in Seattle.\nAlaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.\nAlaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion is the home for the Husky men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball team and gymnastics squad. Originally completed in 1927, Hec Edmundson Pavilion underwent a $40 million, 19-month renovation between March 1999 and November 2000 to reconfigure its interior. The pavilion's name was also changed; originally slated to be \"Seafirst Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" when the deal was finalized in 1998, it became \"Bank of America Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" at the reopening, as B of A had eliminated the Seafirst brand in 2000. The ten-year sponsorship with the bank expired after the 2009–10 season and was not renewed; during the first half of the 2010–11 basketball season the venue was sponsorless and once again known simply as \"Hec Edmundson Pavilion.\" On January 20, 2011, the university approved Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as the new sponsor of Hec Ed.\nHistory.\nPrior to the formalisation of the contemporary Huskies team, women have been playing basketball at the University of Washington since as early as 1899, similar to the timing when men began to play the sport. \nThe modern women's basketball program began in 1974, with Christine Burkhart serving as coach. She led the Huskies to a .500 record in her only year as head coach. Kathie Neir was the coach for the next four years, with an overall record of 82–31, and a first place finish in the NWBL Coast Division. She was replaced by Pat Dobratz, who served for one year as an interim coach, with a 14–14 record. The Huskies would go on to have winning or .500 records every year from the inception of the program until the year 2000.\nSue Kruszewski took over the coaching reins in 1980, and after leading the team to a 19–12 record, she was nominated for coach of the year honors. While she did not win the top position, she was one of 20 contenders for the honor. After her departure, Joyce Sake took over as head coach. In her second year, the team achieved a record of 26–2, winning the Norpac conference regular season with a perfect 11–0 record, as well as the conference tournament. The team was invited to their first ever appearance in the NCAA Tournament. The team earned their first AP ranking, finishing the 185 season ranked 11th.\nIn 1985, Chris Gobrecht took over as head coach, and would remain in that position for 11 years. The Huskies exceeded 20 victories in eight of the 11 years. The team won the NorPac regular season outright in 1986, and finished first or tied for first in the 1988 and 1990 seasons. The team earned bids to the NCAA Tournament in nine of the 11 seasons, reaching the Sweet Sixteen in 1988 and the quarterfinals in 1990. The team earned top 25 rankings in the Coaches and AP polls in six of the 11 years, reaching a final season ranking of third place in 1990.\nJune Daugherty followed Gobrecht, also serving as head coach for 11 years. The Huskies had only one losing seasons in the 11-year period, exceeding 20 wins twice, once in 2001 when the team reached the NCAA quarterfinals. Tia Jackson replaced Daugherty, and remained for four years. Kevin McGuff was hired in 2011 and led the team to consecutive 20-win seasons, and two post-season WNIT bids. After McGuff was hired by Ohio State, assistant coach Mike Neighbors was named head coach for the 2013–14 season. While McGuff was head coach, he persuaded Adia Barnes, with college experience at Arizona and professional experience with the Houston Comets, Seattle Storm, Minnesota Lynx, and Sacramento Monarchs to become an assistant coach. She remained in that position under Neighbors until leaving for her alma mater—Arizona—in 2016. Neighbors left after the 2016-17 season to return to Arkansas, his alma mater.\nJody Wynn was named head coach on April 14, 2017 after serving as the head coach at Long Beach State for the previous eight seasons.\nYear by year results.\nSource\nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Huskies made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1. \nSchool records.\nSource\nActive players in \"italics\"."

        "text": "The MCKK Premier 7s is an annual under 18 rugby seven tournament between the premier and international schools rugby sevens teams. The tournament was first held in 2011.The winners are awarded the NJ Ryan Cup, named after the last foreigner headmaster that lift up the school rugby team in the past.\nThe tournament is administered by Malay College Kuala Kangsar and Malay College Old Boys Association with sub committee, All-Blacks Revival (ABR). The tournament is also on the verge of being recognized by International Rugby Board with help by Malaysian Rugby Union. Since 2014,the tagline for this tournament is \"\"Premiering Talent and Sportsmanship\".\"\nHistory.\nMCKK has always been passionate about rugby. It has been a major game for the school since it was first introduced by then Headmaster Mr. N.J. Ryan (later Dato') back in 1956. Naming the team the MCKK All-Blacks, taking after the legendary New Zealand national team, their fortunes have both waxed and waned over the years, yet they remain one of the most formidable rugby teams in the country.\nThe Tournament is the brainchild of the All Blacks Revival Committee (ABR), a group of the school rugby playing alumni who came together to revive and infuse new life into the proud tradition of rugby excellence at MCKK. Joint Organizing Committee Chairman Zain Yusoff said, Our participation in the sport during our school days played a key role in our development and growth as people, and we wanted the current students at the school to have the same experiences we did. We invited schools which had the same commitment to rugby as we did, and a history of excellence in the game to compete at what we hope will become the most prestigious tournament for 7-a-side rugby in the country.\nZain Yusoff added, Team sports like rugby fostered school spirit and respect for rivals, sportsmanship and fairplay. These values cannot be taught from textbooks but have to be lived to be understood. And we are delighted by the support we have been given by the Ministry of Education who bought into our point of view and have given us their whole-hearted support to raise the game under their \"One Student, One Sport program\".\nZain Yusoff concluded, \"This Tournament is more than just about playing a game. All of us from MCKK are looking forward to sharing our culture and hospitality with the participating schools. For many of us, it a way of giving back something to the younger generation. It about sharing values, learning through experience, and of course, enjoying the game we all love so much.\" After six tournaments, the NJ Ryan Cup have traveled to three countries (Malaysia, New Zealand and Hong Kong). Sekolah Sukan Tengku Mahkota Ismail of Malaysia have won the cup a record-three time followed by home team, MCKK, Scots College of New Zealand and Hong Kong Sports school (each once) .\nObjectives.\nThe objectives of this tournament are mainly to raise the standards of rugby amongst schools in Malaysia apart from fostering closer relations amongst participating teams and students.\nChampions and finalist.\nSekolah Sukan Tengku Mahkota Ismail have been a major force in this tournament, emerging winners 4 times (2011,2012, 2016, 2017) and runner-up twice. The host, Sekolah Menengah Sains Hulu Selangor, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sri Mersing, English College Johore Bahru, Scots College and Hong Kong Sports Schools have each lifted the cup once. \nHosting issues.\nAfter Scots College won the 2014 tournament, there is issues whether this tournament should include foreign participants which could lead to counter-productivity of the locals participant. Aziz Hassan, columnist of New Straits Times in his article said \"Maybe not when it happens once but if foreign teams become the tournament's champions perennially, one can imagine how the local boys would feel, having to settle for second best despite the best of efforts.\"Zain Yusoff, Chairman of AllBlacks Revival programme however debunked the statement and insisted it will help the locals to get the taste of high-level competitions. His statement were on par with tournament director Amrul Hazarin Hamidon statement which the organisers, in a bid to boost the quality of the event, are looking to bring at least six foreign teams for the tournament next season."

        "title": "Ghana at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nThis article is about the World Cup history of one of the leading nations in African football, Ghana. Ghana have appeared in the finals of the World Cup on four occasions, in 2006, 2010 where they reached the quarter-finals, 2014 and in 2022.\nFIFA World Cup record.\nGhana have qualified for four FIFA World Cup tournaments; 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2022.\nIn 2006 they were the only African side to advance to the Second round of 2006 FIFA World Cup and were the sixth nation in a row from Africa to progress beyond the group stages of the World Cup. Ghana had the youngest team in the FIFA World Cup 2006 with an average age of 23 years and 352 days, and were praised for their improving performance. FIFA ranked Ghana 13th out of the 32 countries who competed in the tournament.\nIn the 2010 World Cup, Ghana progressed beyond the group stages, and reached the quarter-finals where they were eliminated by Uruguay. Ghana was defeated by Uruguay on penalties after Luis Suárez controversially handballed on the goal line deep into extra time, denying Ghana an almost certain winning goal. Had Ghana won their quarter final, they would have become the first African nation to progress to the semi-finals of the world cup. Of the 32 countries that participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, FIFA ranked Ghana 7th.\nIn the 2014 and 2022 World Cup, Ghana was eliminated in the group stage.\nGermany 2006.\nHead coach: Ratomir Dujković\nCzech Republic vs Ghana.\nAsamoah Gyan opened the scoring with a low left footed shot to the net from the edge of the penalty area. Gyan then missed a penalty in the second half when he hit his shot against the post in the 66th minute. Sulley Muntari got the second goal for Ghana in the 82nd minute, finishing a move with a left footed shot to the roof of the net from inside the penalty area.\nGhana vs United States.\nGhana opened the scoring in the 22nd minute when Haminu Draman curled a low right footed shot past the goalkeeper from the left of the penalty area. The winning goal for Ghana was a penalty at the end of the first half which Stephen Appiah shot high right footed to the goalkeepers right.\nSouth Africa 2010.\nCoach: Milovan Rajevac\nSerbia vs Ghana.\nAsamoah Gyan scored only goal of the game came in the 85th minute from the penalty spot, shooting to the goalkeepers right after a handball offence by Zdravko Kuzmanovic.\nGhana vs Australia.\nAsamoah Gyan scored the equalizer for Ghana in the 25th minute from the penalty spot, shooting low to the goalkeepers left after a handball by Harry Kewell on the goal-line for which he was shown a straight red card.\nUnited States vs Ghana.\nUnited States vs Ghana was played on 26 June 2010 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. The match was watched by 19 million Americans, making it the most watched association football match in American television history. The match was won by Ghana in extra time, after Asamoah Gyan broke a 1–1 deadlock. Kevin-Prince Boateng scored the opening goal of the match for Ghana in the 5th minute. The goal followed an error by Ricardo Clark, who lost the ball to Ghana in midfield. Boateng took the ball to the edge of the penalty area, beating US goalkeeper Tim Howard with a low left foot shot. Landon Donovan equalised with a penalty kick in the 62nd minute, awarded after Jonathan Mensah fouled Clint Dempsey. The US had chances to win the game thereafter, but they were unable to get past Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson. The match thus went to extra time. In the third minute, Gyan latched onto a high long ball, chesting it down and holding off two defenders before scoring the winner. After the match, Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac hailed his side's achievement in becoming one of the \"best eight teams in the world\", but regretted the number of players that would miss the quarter-final against Uruguay because of injury or suspension. The president of the Soccer Federation, Sunil Gulati, lamented the team's failure to make the quarter-finals and thereby further raise the profile of the sport in the US.\nUruguay vs Ghana.\nUruguay and Ghana met on 2 July 2010 at Soccer City, Johannesburg for a place in the semi-final against the Netherlands. It was the first time that the teams had ever played each other in a senior competitive football match. After a dramatic 120 minutes of play (including extra time) that finished 1–1, Uruguay won in a penalty shoot-out 4–2.\nUruguay dominated the early periods of the match, but suffered an injury to captain Diego Lugano in the first half. Just before half-time, Ghana took the lead when Sulley Muntari was allowed time on the ball by Uruguay, and took advantage by scoring with a shot from 40 yards. After half-time, Diego Forlán pulled Uruguay level with a free kick from the left side of the field that went over the head of Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson. While both teams had chances to win, the match proceeded to extra time as the scores remained level. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the box; Luis Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. On the rebound, Dominic Adiyiah's header was heading into the goal, but Suárez blatantly blocked the shot with his hands to save what would have been the extra-time winner and he was red carded. Asamoah Gyan missed the ensuing penalty kick off the crossbar and Suárez celebrated the miss. In the shootout, Gyan converted his penalty, as did everybody else until the 4th round of penalty kicks when Adiyiah's penalty was saved by Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera. Uruguay's Maxi Pereira then hit his penalty kick over the bar. Muslera saved Captain John Mensah's, and Ghana's fifth, penalty. Sebastián Abreu converted Uruguay's fifth spot kick by lightly chipping it Panenka-style to win the match.\nAfter the game, Suárez said, \"I made the save of the tournament,\" and, referring to the infamous handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup, claimed that \"The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me.\" Suárez claimed he had no alternative and was acting out of instinct. Forlán agreed that Suárez saved the game, \"Suárez this time, instead of scoring goals, he saved one, I think he saved the game. \nGhana coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\" and Suárez was labeled a \"villain\" and a \"cheat\". But Uruguay coach, Óscar Tabárez, said these labels were too harsh, \"Well, there was a handball in the penalty area, there was a red card and Suárez was thrown out. Saying that Ghana were cheated out of the game is too harsh. We have to go by the rules. It might have been a mistake by my player but I do not like that word ‘cheating’.\"\nGhana was the last African team left in the tournament and if they had won, they would have been the first team from Africa to ever make the semifinals. But others viewed him as a hero who sacrificed himself in the semifinal for the unlikely chance that his team could win. A distraught Gyan conceded, \"I would say Suárez is a hero now in his own country, because the ball was going in and he held it with his hand. He is a hero now.\"\nBrazil 2014.\nHead coach: James Kwesi Appiah\nThe final squad was announced on 1 June 2014. On 26 June 2014, midfielders Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng were sent home and indefinitely suspended from the national team for disciplinary reasons."

Simmons designed and built golf courses for 30 years before his death in 1986. Dothan National Golf Club was originally named Olympia Spa and under that moniker played host to the 1974 SEC Collegiate Golf Championship. In the 1980s the name of the club changed to Dothan National Golf Club. In 2000, the club hosted the Nike Tour. The golf course has also hosted multiple Emerald Coast Golf Tour events. In 2004, the Emerald Coast Golf Tour Fall Classic Golf Tournament was won by Bubba Watson who eventually went on to the PGA Tour and won a Masters green jacket in 2011.\nThe golf course is 7,425 yards long from the back tees and plays to both par 72 and a par 73 due to the 18th hole which is listed on the card as par four or a par five depending on the tee location.\nThe property was originally developed by the Flower's family which also developed nearby Flower's Hospital. The Flowers were originally drilling for oil on the property and instead of hitting oil, they tapped into a hot mineral water spring. Doctor Flowers sent patients from his hospital to the Olympia Spa for rehabilitation. The golf course and hotel were built around the site of the hot mineral spring. The Flowers family sold the golf club and hotel in 1988.\nThe golf course and hotel went bankrupt and closed in the fall of 2012. New owners reopened the facility in January 2013."

Six finalists dipped under 50, and Kseniya Ryzhova was lucky Amantle Montsho had gapped the first semi with the leading qualifier of 49.56. Ryzhova cruised in with a 50.48 to be the second automatic qualifier. Five others ran personal bests attempting to qualify.\nThe fast semifinals slowed the majority of the field. Only the medalists improved their times. From the gun Natasha Hastings and defending champion Amantle Montsho took it out, Hastings in lane 3 making up the stagger on Christine Ohuruogu in 4. Francena McCorory held her own and came off the final turn with Montsho but as Montsho aimed at the finish, the others went backward. With 50 metres to go, Christine Ohuruogu had worked her way from several metres down in the turn and had pulled even, looking like a good bet for silver. But she had other ideas. A steady stretch run put both a diving Ohuruogu and Montsho on the line at the same time. And that was what was posted 49.41, the same time for both.\nIt took a look at the photo finish to determine that Ohuruogu had won by 4 thousandths of a second.\nRunning a more even pace Russian Antonina Krivoshapka came off the turn even with Ohuruogu and made a stretch run of her own, overtaking the Americans and Stephanie McPherson to get a bronze medal that she later lost following a doping violation.\nIn the process of running a personal best to win the championship, Ohuruogu also got Kathy Smallwood-Cook's 29-year-old British national record (from the 1984 Olympics) that had so far evaded her through her career, a career that had included two Olympic medals, including the gold in 2008, and a previous World Championship.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:15."

She got back up and tried to catch back up to the pack. Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi was the first to fall out the back, passed by Assefa. But Milcah Chemos Cheywa and Lydiah Chepkurui were on the front of train, stringing out the Ethiopians. Chemos, running determined after two successive bronze medals, led out the final lap, with Assefa chasing her teammates. Chemos held her slight lead all the way to the finish. Assefa caught Hiwot Alayew just before the water jump and continued to gain on Chepkurui. At the last barrier it looked like Assefa had the momentum to go by, but she seemed to lose a step after landing, Chepkuri ran away to the silver and Assefa making an impressive comeback to get bronze.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:25."

        "text": "Botafogo Basquete, or Botafogo Basquetebol (English: Botafogo Basket or Botafogo Basketball) is the men's professional basketball team of the major multi-sports club Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas (Botafogo Football and Rowing), which is abbreviated as Botafogo F.R. The club is based in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The club's full name is Basquete do Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, which is abbreviated as Botafogo F.R. Basquete.\nHistory.\nThe multi-sport Club de Regatas Botafogo (Botafogo Rowing Club), abbreviated as C.R. Botafogo, was founded in 1894. The club's basketball section was founded in 1933, and were finalists of the Rio de Janeiro State Championship, in 1934 and 1937. The multi-sport club Botafogo Football Club, abbreviated as Botafogo F.C., was founded in 1904. Its basketball section won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1939 and 1942.\nBasketball played a major role in the development of Botafogo F.R.'s multi-sports athletic club. In 1942, a basketball game was played between the two sports clubs of the Botafogo neighborhood, C.R. Botafogo and Botafogo F.C., respectively. During the game, just after halftime, Armando Albano, a player of Botafogo F.C., died on the court, after suffering a heart attack. In his honor, the presidents of each club decided to merge their clubs, and become Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas (Botafogo Football and Rowing), abbreviated as Botafogo F.R. The club also took a new flag and a new crest, mixing both club's originals. After that, Botafogo F.R.'s basketball club won several local Rio de Janeiro State Championships, including the three-peat of 1943, 1944, and 1945.\nBotafogo F.R. also won the Brazilian Cup (Brazilian Championship) title in 1967, and became the first and only club from Rio to win the top-tier level Brazilian league. Another club from Rio did not do so until 2000. They also competed in the 1968 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup. At the beginning of the 2000s decade, the club's basketball department became amateur, and only became professional again in 2015.\nIn the 2017 season, Botafogo F.R. played in the Brazilian Gold League, the second-tier level of Brazilian pro club basketball. The club finished the regular season in first place, and went on to win the league title. They beat Blumenau in the playoffs, and then won the league's finals, after beating AAB Joinville in the 5th and decisive game, at home, by a score of 90–68. The team's main star, Jamaal Smith, was named the league's Finals MVP, after a great performance during the series.\nIn the 2018–19 NBB season, with Léo Figueiró already as head coach, the team reached the semifinals, losing to Flamengo Basketball that would go to win the league's title. Coach Léo Figueiró was named NBB's Coach of the Year. With this campaign, Botafogo finished 4th and secured a place at the Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol's next season.\nAt the beginning of the 2019–20 season, the team debuted at the Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol, in a group hosted in San Andres, Colombia, that had the home team Warriors de San Andrés, Nacional de Montevideo and Salta Basket. After finishing 2–1, the team advanced to the semifinals stage. The next stage was played in La Banda, and Botafogo faced, once again, Salta and Nacional, and the home team Ciclista Olímpico. At the first game, Botafogo beat Salta 62–61 with a buzzer-beater shot from Arthur Bernardi. The next day the team beat Nacional by a 10 points margin and, at the final and decisive game, Jamaal Smith put on a show and helped Botafogo come from a 17 point deficit against Ciclista Olímpico to advance to the Finals to face Corinthians. After losing the first game of the finals in Rio, the team counted with amazing performances of Jamaal Smith and Cauê Borges in game 2 and 3 respectively to win back to back games in São Paulo to conquer its first international trophy. The next day, a huge crowd of fans showed up to receive the players and celebrate the title at the club's Ginásio Oscar Zelaya.\nIndividual awards.\nBrazilian 2nd Division Season MVP:\nBrazilian 2nd Division Finals MVP:\nNBB Coach of The Year:\nSouth American League MVP:\nWomen's team.\nBotafogo's women's basketball team has won the most state championships, with seven titles. They won the state championship in 1955, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1995, and 2006."

Like the 2012 Olympics, this did not look like the day for defending champion Edna Kiplagat, by 10K she had already dropped almost 30 seconds off the pace set by a large pack of leaders. By 15K, Kiplagat had joined the pack of 7 leaders, which also included Jia Chaofeng, Lucy Wangui Kabuu, Valentine Jepkorir Kipketer, Meselech Melkamu, Feyse Tadese and Kayoko Fukushi with the rest of the field being single or double marathoners, without any chase group. The pack lost individuals, Jia was the first to exit, followed by Tadese, Kipketer and Kabuu. By the time Fukushi lost some ground, the closest remaining chaser was her teammate Ryoko Kizaki over a minute back. When Melkamu left, she left quickly leaving a two-woman race to the finish. In the shadow of the stadium, Kiplagat pulled away from Straneo through the Olympic Park to a 14-second victory, Fukushi about 2 minutes back to get the bronze. Kiplagat is the first woman to repeat as champion in the marathon.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nFinal.\nThe race was started at 14:00."

        "text": "The women's 200 metres at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Luzhniki Stadium on 15–16 August.\nBefore the race, without her nemesis of the last 8 years, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Allyson Felix came into this race as the favorite. She had won three gold medals in a row, but that streak was interrupted by Campbell Brown. Felix was back to start a new streak. But she was not without challengers, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was just two-tenths behind her at the previous Olympics and like the previous two Olympics, Fraser-Pryce had already won the 100. And Kimberlyn Duncan had actually beaten Felix at the American Championships, but after a long college season, she didn't make it to the final.\nAt the gun, Fraser-Pryce was out quick, making up the stagger on Blessing Okagbare to her outside halfway through the turn. The pressure was on, Fraser-Pryce was pulling away and before the turn was over, Felix was rolling to the ground with a pulled hamstring. Jeneba Tarmoh and Murielle Ahouré were the next best to the straight, Okagbare a step back. As Tarmoh faded, Okagbare managed to pass Ahouré, but Ahouré came back. As the two battled, they were gaining on Fraser-Pryce, but not enough to make a dent in her huge lead. After giving up .026 to Okagbare in reaction time at the start, Ahouré beat her by .008 to take silver, with nobody else close to the medalists.\nTwo sprinters, Turkmenistan's Yelena Ryabova and Ukraine's Yelyzaveta Bryzhina, gave positive drug tests at the competition.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 3 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nWind: Heat 1: 0.0 m/s, Heat 2: +0.1 m/s, Heat 3: 0.0 m/s, Heat 4: 0.0 m/s, Heat 5: −0.1 m/s, Heat 6: +0.3 m/s, Heat 7: +0.4 m/s\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nWind: Heat 1: 0.0 m/s, Heat 2: 0.0 m/s, Heat 3: −0.2 m/s\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:15."

But most of the pack stayed in close order formation throughout with much jockeying for position and flying elbows. Cain tried to stay on the curb but kept getting moved back as new suitors moved forward then fell back. Zoe Buckman came forward then went to the curb to suffer the same fate ahead of Cain. Throughout world leader Abeba Aregawi hovered near the front but not passing Simpson. With 300 to go, Aregawi went around Simpson and made a break for it. But Simpson and the rest of the pack didn't go away. Just 100 meters later, Simpson looked like she would go by, but Aregawi wouldn't let her by. Then Hellen Onsando Obiri moved up with momentum, but couldn't make her way around either of them. Aregawi gained a couple of steps around the final turn, but Simpson came back to make it a close finish. Obiri lost ground but held on to keep the bronze. Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon tried to hang on to her teammate but Hannah England made an impressive run from back in the pack to pass her on the inside to get fourth.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 6 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:20."

Also missing by design is world record holder Tirunesh Dibaba who won the 10000 earlier, leaving Meseret Defar the 5000.\nThe final started slow with the Ethiopians watching the front (the reigning Olympic champion Defar watching her teammates from the back), letting Dominika Nowakowska then Dolores Checa jog through 75-second laps at the front. With 2000 to go, the racing began, Almaz Ayana took over the lead and the crowd disappeared. Within a lap, not surprisingly, the three Ethiopians and two Kenyans were running alone. Lap times were dropping, 71, 69, 68. In the next lap Buze Diriba fell back to the trailing American duo of Molly Huddle and Shannon Rowbury. The two Ethiopians were leading, the two Kenyans trying to keep up. Shortly after the bell, Viola Kibiwot lost touch with her teammate Mercy Cherono and then there were three. Defar stayed tucked into second place waiting until the time was right. The time was 200 meters to go, that was when Defar accelerated past Ayana and into the lead. Cherono made no effort to go after Defar, she was gone sprinting to gold. Cherono waited through the turn and executed her best move to outsprint Ayana for the silver. So prepared for victory, Defar and Ayana had already received their flags and were displaying them while the early leaders were still finishing.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 5 fastest (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18:55."

Followed by her teammate, Belaynesh Oljira, the two Ethiopians picked up the pace with Kenyans Gladys Cherono and Emily Chebet giving chase, Niiya couldn't handle the acceleration and disappeared from contention.

        "title": "Tennis Court (song)",
        "text": "\"Tennis Court\" is a song recorded by New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde. She co-wrote the song with Joel Little, with production handled by the latter. Universal Music Group (UMG) released the song as the second single from her debut studio album \"Pure Heroine\" (2013) in Australia and New Zealand on 7 June 2013. On the same day, the label released an extended play (EP) of the same name containing three additional tracks throughout Europe. It combines alternative pop, art pop, and downtempo music over hip hop beats, minimalist synthesisers, and an electronic pulse. Inspired by Lorde's fresh insights into the music industry, the lyrics address her newfound fame and nostalgia for Auckland.\n\"Tennis Court\" received positive reviews from music critics, with some highlighting the song's production and lyrical content. It was a commercial success in Oceania, reaching number one in New Zealand and number 20 in Australia. Elsewhere, the single achieved modest chart success throughout Europe and North America. \"Tennis Court\" earned platinum certification in Canada and triple platinum certifications in New Zealand and Australia. Joel Kefali directed the song's accompanying music video, a one shot in which Lorde stares at the camera throughout. \"Tennis Court\" was included on the set list of Lorde's Pure Heroine Tour (2013–14) and Melodrama World Tour (2017–18).\nBackground and production.\nNew Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde (born 1996 as Ella Yelich-O'Connor) was interested in performing live at local venues around her home city of Auckland during intermediate school years. Scott Maclachlan, an A&amp;R executive of Universal Music Group (UMG), discovered Lorde upon witnessing her performance at her school talent show when she was 12. Maclachlan subsequently signed Lorde to UMG for development and paired her up with Joel Little, a songwriter and record producer. In December 2011, the pair finished their first collaborative effort, a five-track extended play (EP) titled \"The Love Club\". Lorde then self-released the EP for free download via her SoundCloud account in November 2012.\nUpon completion of \"The Love Club\", Lorde and Little quickly collaborated again, initially planning to release another EP. The pair recorded materials at Little's Golden Age Studios in Morningside and started writing \"Tennis Court\" in January 2013. They also recorded several additional tracks and ultimately decided to work on a full-length studio album instead. Little acted as the song's sole producer, using audio software Pro Tools. Songwriting for \"Tennis Court\" was different from how Lorde usually writes songs; by and large, she would have a lyric forming before going into the studio to record. For this song, Little and Lorde first wrote the music and the beat, and the lyrics were built on the instant instrumental. Speaking to \"Billboard\" in November 2013, Little appreciated Lorde's developed songwriting skills on \"Tennis Court\", for which Lorde wrote the melody and the whole chorus, praising her as \"an amazing songwriter\".\nRelease.\nOn 7 June 2013, Universal Music Group released \"Tennis Court\" for digital download as Lorde's second single following \"Royals\" in Australia and New Zealand, where Lorde's cover of The Replacements' 1985 song \"Swingin Party\" serves as the B-side. On the same day, an EP of the same name was released digitally throughout Europe. The EP contains three additional tracks—\"Swingin Party\", \"Biting Down\" and \"Bravado\"—all of which were previously included on \"The Love Club EP\". On 22 July, the EP was released as a 10-inch vinyl in the UK by Virgin EMI Records. \"Tennis Court\" was later included as the opening track on Lorde's debut studio album \"Pure Heroine\", released on 27 September 2013.\nIn the US, \"Tennis Court\" was released as a 7-inch vinyl single on 27 August 2013. Lava and Republic Records initially planned to service \"Tennis Court\" to US modern rock radio on 11 March 2014 and contemporary hit radio (CHR) on 8 April 2014 as the album's third US airplay single, following \"Royals\" and \"Team\". Republic cancelled the scheduled release in favour of \"Glory and Gore\", which impacted modern rock radio on 11 March 2014. The label also planned to service \"Glory and Gore\" to CHR, but instead serviced \"Tennis Court\" to CHR as originally planned. \"Tennis Court\" ultimately impacted hot adult contemporary radio and CHR on 21 and 22 April 2014, respectively. It was released to UK radio on 12 May 2014.\nComposition.\n\"Tennis Court\" is written in the key of C major and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. Lorde's vocal range on the song spans one octave, from G3 to G4. It combines alternative pop, art pop, and downtempo genres over hip hop-influenced beats, minimalist synthesisers, and an electronic pulse. \"Billboard\" editor Jason Lipshutz commented that \"Tennis Court\" conveys a darker aspect of pop music. Nick Messtite from \"Forbes\" wrote that the track was reminiscent of The Postal Service's 2003 song \"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\", \"Clash\"s Joe Zadeh likened the song's production to The xx's 2013 song \"Together\". Siân Rowe from \"NME\" compared \"Tennis Court\" to works by Lana Del Rey.\nLyrical interpretation.\nThe song's lyrics address Lorde's newfound fame. In an interview with Spotify in May 2013, Lorde explained that \"Tennis Court\" was inspired by her friends and daily life in her hometown Auckland, saying that the song was a summary of the events she witnessed during the previous months of her life. On her Tumblr account, the singer elaborated on the tennis court imagery as \"a symbol of nostalgia\" that embodied memories of her hometown. Lorde also elucidated that the track reflected the changes in her life at the moment, when she had ventured into a career in music.\nLorde also took inspiration from \"how superficial people can be\" after having perceived the mechanism of the music industry. Paul Lester from \"The Guardian\" opined that the song criticises the extravagant lifestyle of the rich, while \"Billboard\" writer Drew Fortune compared its songwriting to the works of American rock musician Paul Westerberg. During the songwriting process, Lorde explained that she took an interest to the works of American photographer Gregory Crewdson due to his depictions of human life, suburbia and sense of loneliness.\nThe track opens with Lorde questioning \"Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?\", which suggests \"a frictional relationship with the high life\", and summarises \"Pure Heroine\"s central theme of Lorde's observations and critiques of mainstream culture. The refrain contains the lyrics \"Baby be the class clown / I'll be the beauty queen in tears\", which express underlying sorrow behind superficial beauty. The follow-up lines \"It's a new art form showing people how little we care / We're so happy even when we're smilin' out of fear\" illustrate Lorde feigning disinterest when facing fame and adolescence. In the second verse, Lorde wonders about her future music career, therefrom expecting inevitable nostalgia of her non-celebrity lifestyle, \"But my head's filling up with the wicked games, up in flames / How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known?\" At the bridge, Lorde sings \"I fall apart, with all my heart / And you can watch from your window\", which \"HuffPost\" interpreted as a commentary on the breakdowns of teenage celebrities.\nCritical reception.\n\"Tennis Court\" received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. Siân Rowe from \"NME\" complimented Lorde's \"strong pop vocals\". Emily Yoshida from \"Grantland\" labelled it a \"murkily winsome, ever-so-slightly chopped ballad\", while Kyle Jaeger writing for \"The Hollywood Reporter\" commended the track's lyrical content and its \"catchy\" melody. \"Billboard\"s Jason Lipshutz was favourable towards the song's \"detached attitude\" and minimalist production that evoked \"something intoxicating\" in the music scene. Sharing the same sentiment, Adam Offitzer from independent music blog \"Pretty Much Amazing\" regarded \"Tennis Court\" as a \"[burst] of originality\" in the mainstream music scene of \"mindless hooks and dubstep anthems\" for its minimalism and \"clever\" lyrics.\n\"Pitchfork\" writer Lindsay Zoladz applauded the song's narrative for \"exposing irony and even hypocrisy without coming off as preachy or moralistic\". In his review of \"Pure Heroine\", Jon Hadusek from \"Consequence of Sound\" selected \"Tennis Court\" as an \"essential\" track and highlighted its narrative lyrics. \"Time Out\" editor Nick Levine similarly lauded Lorde's \"compelling\" songwriting ability despite her young age at the time and praised the song's composition as \"glorious\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine and \"The Independent\"s Andy Gill also picked \"Tennis Court\" as a standout track of \"Pure Heroine\", while John Murphy from \"musicOMH\" complimented the track as \"impossible not to sing along to\". In a less enthusiastic review, Evan Sawdey of \"PopMatters\" considered the song a \"drawback\" that does not \"[suit] her well\". \"Paste\" ranked it number 34 on their list of the 40 Best Debut Album Openers of All-Time.\nCommercial performance.\n\"Tennis Court\" debuted atop the New Zealand Singles Chart dated 17 June 2013, becoming Lorde's second number-one single on the chart following \"Royals\", which reached the top position in March 2013. It spent 21 weeks on the chart, six of which in the top ten. The single received double platinum certification from Recorded Music NZ for exceeding sales of 30,000 copies in the country. \"Tennis Court\" was the 19th best-selling single of 2013 in New Zealand. In neighbouring Australia, the single peaked at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart and remained on the chart for 22 weeks. It was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 210,000 units.\nOutside Australasia, the single achieved modest commercial success. It peaked at number 78 on the Canadian Hot 100 and remained for five weeks on the chart. The track earned platinum certification from Music Canada, which denotes shipments of 80,000 copies in the country. The single had the similar position on the UK Singles Chart and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for track-equivalent sales of 200,000 units, based on sales and streams. It also entered the top 100 of the German Singles Chart, where it reached number 83. Despite not entering the record chart of Norway, the song was certified platinum by IFPI Norway for exceeding sales of 10,000 units in the country. In the US, \"Tennis Court\" debuted at number 71, which was also its highest placement, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart dated 19 October 2013. The single spent 18 weeks on the chart and had sold 355,000 copies in the US by April 2014. It also reached number nine on the Hot Rock Songs, a \"Billboard\" auxiliary chart.\nMusic video.\nThe official music video for \"Tennis Court\" was directed by Joel Kefali, who previously worked with Lorde on the accompanying video for her debut single \"Royals\". The video was filmed as a one-shot. Lorde appears in \"black clothing, braided hair, and dark lipstick.\" It features Lorde staring into the camera as the song plays; she does not lip sync the lyrics except for the word \"Yeah!\" after each verse and during the chorus. The set lighting fades in and out throughout the video.\nWriting for \"The Washington Post\", Bethonie Butler observed a discrepancy between Lorde's statement that \"In a perfect world, [she] would never do any interviews, and probably there would be one photo out there of [her]\", and the fact that, in the music video, Lorde is \"front and center.\" Butler viewed the video as \"a metaphor for celebrity.\" Writing for Ryan Seacrest's website, Kathleen Perricone complimented the \"super simple\" clip, which allowed Lorde's \"voice and lyrics [to] really shine.\" Lindsay Zoladz, of Pitchfork Media, compared the video to that for The Replacements' \"Bastards of Young\" (1985). \"MTV News\" editor Luke O'Neil wrote that the \"Tennis Court\" video is \"a bit unsettling at first, but eventually it starts to make sense. [Lorde is] trying to do things a bit differently, and so far it seems like it's working.\"\nLive performances.\nTo promote her works to American audiences, Lorde held her first US show at Le Poisson Rouge in New York on 6 August 2013 and performed \"Tennis Court\" among songs from \"The Love Club EP\". She subsequently included the song on the set list for her debut concert Pure Heroine Tour, which ran from late 2013 throughout 2014 in support of her debut studio album. On 13 November 2013, Lorde performed \"Tennis Court\" among five other songs from \"The Love Club\" and \"Pure Heroine\" on \"Live on Letterman\". Six days later, Lorde held her first UK concert at Soho, London, where she performed several tracks from \"Pure Heroine\" including \"Tennis Court\". She also performed the track during the \"Almost Acoustic Christmas\" event on KROQ-FM radio station on 9 December.\nLorde performed \"Tennis Court\" at the 2014 \"Billboard\" Music Awards in May. The following month, she performed a medley of \"Tennis Court\" and \"Team\" at the 2014 MuchMusic Video Awards. Lorde also performed the song during several music festivals, including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, the Laneway Festival in Sydney, Lollapalooza Brazil in Sao Paulo. At the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago on 1 August 2014, she performed the track among other songs from \"Pure Heroine\". \"Billboard\" picked Lorde's performance as the fifth best of the festival, while \"Rolling Stone\" deemed her set list the highlight of the event. Lorde included \"Tennis Court\" on the set list of her Melodrama World Tour, which ran from September 2017 to November 2018.\nUsage and remixes.\n\"Tennis Court\" was played during the 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles Final by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). \"Tennis Court\" was remixed by Australian musician Flume in 2014. \"Noisey\" credited his remix as one of the earliest examples of a SoundCloud trend incorporating a \"dizzy drop\", described as \"piercing flurries of stuttering synths and stomach-churning side-chain compression.\" In July 2014 American producer Diplo released his version, titled the Diplo's Andre Agassi Reebok Pump Mix. In 2014, \"Tennis Court\" was featured in the soundtrack of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows versions of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nReferences.\nFootnotes\nBibliography"

        "text": "Mike Middleton (born December 4, 1969) is a former professional American football safety in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (84th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft. He played college football at Indiana University.\nEarly years.\nMiddleton attended Western Hills High School, where he played as a running back and linebacker. In his senior season, he posted 1,620 rushing yards and 20 touchdowns, including a 250-yard, 6-touchdown game against Walnut Hills. \nHe received All-conference and All-southwest Ohio honors. In his last 2 years he registered 2,742 yards and 35 touchdowns. He also practiced track and field.\nCollege career.\nMiddleton accepted a football scholarship from Indiana University with the plan of being the eventual successor at running back to Anthony Thompson. A chronic injury to his right ankle that he suffered in the Ohio All-Star game, forced the team to redshirt him in his first season.\nAs a freshman, because of his size and athletic ability, the coaching staff wanted to find a way to get him on the field and converted him into a cornerback, although his body type was considered heavy for the position. As the starter at left cornerback he made 59 tackles (fourth on the team), 5 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, one interception and one pass defensed. \nAs a sophomore, he experienced a muscle spasm in the walls of his heart and missed 2 games. He finished the season with a career-high 65 tackles, 6 tackles for loss, 4 passes defensed and one interception. In the season opener he returned an interception 22-yards for a touchdown against the University of Kentucky. He had a career-high 15 tackles against Michigan State University. He also added 8 kickoffs returns for 169 yards (21.1-yard average). As a junior, he had 63 tackles (fourth on the team), 4 tackles for loss and 7 passes defensed (tied for the team lead).\nIn his last year, he was diagnosed with mononucleosis, which forced him to miss the first 2 games. He still was able to post 58 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 tackles for loss, 3 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He put together a string of double-digit tackle performances over the final three games of the season. He also practiced track and field as a senior.\nHe was a four-year starter, making 42 starts in 46 games, 245 tackles (18 for loss), 3 sacks, 15 passes defensed, 2 interceptions and one forced fumble.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nMiddleton was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (84th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft to play safety. He was released before the season started on August 23.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn December 1993, he was added to the Miami Dolphins practice squad. He was signed for the 1994 training camp, but was released before the season started on April 25.\nBarcelona Dragons (WLAF).\nIn 1995, he signed with the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football. He was placed on the injured reserve list on May 11. In 1996, he returned as the starter at strong safety.\nOrlando Predators (AFL).\nOn July 10, 1996, he signed with the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League to play wide receiver/defensive back. On May 27, 1997, he was traded to the New York CityHawks along with the rights for John Bock in exchange for Curtis Cotton.\nNew York CityHawks (AFL).\nIn 1997, he signed with the New York CityHawks. He was waived on July 23.\nAugusta Stallions (AF2).\nIn March 2000, he signed to play for the Augusta Stallions at fullback/linebacker in the inaugural AF2 season. On May 12, 2000, he was placed on the injured reserve list after tearing a ligament in his ankle.\nPersonal life.\nMiddleton became an assistant football coach at Winton Woods High School, helping the school win its first state championship in 2009."

        "title": "Box Lacrosse League",
        "text": "The Box Lacrosse League (BLL) was a senior men's semi-professional box lacrosse league in the United States. In its final year, the league consisted of five teams with a geographical footprint centered on the Midwest region of the United States and Ontario.\nFormerly known as Midwest Indoor Lacrosse Association (MILA), the league was renamed the Continental Indoor Lacrosse League due to expansion teams outside of the Midwest region in March 2013. The league again changed its name in 2017 to Box Lacrosse League, citing the new commitment to following guidelines set by USBOXLA. The league ceased operations after the 2017 season.\nHistory.\n2011.\nOn August 27, 2011, Grand Rapids defeated Columbus 18-17 (OT) in the first-ever MILA game. Columbus went on to have the best record and were the top seed for the inaugural championship playoff, but Columbus withdrew on the day before the event. Second-seed Grand Rapids Dragonfish went on to claim the first league championship by defeating Chicago 13-7 on October 1, 2011. Chicago had advanced with a 26-1 semifinal win against Milwaukee.\n2012.\nIn the off-season, several expansion teams were announced for the second season of MILA. The St. Louis Pride, Pittsburgh Octane, Southern Ohio Box Lacrosse, Cleveland Demons, Detroit Coney Dogs, and Nebraska Fighting Perkins were all announced before the end of the calendar year. Three more teams (Madison Capitals, Minnesota Jaxx, and Colorado Sabertooths) were also announced for the 2012 season. Nebraska never materialized and a group from Indiana took over the franchise rights, adding Indy Swagger to the league.\nColorado was crowned champion after the 2012 season, when 10 teams competed in league play. St. Louis and Nebraska/Indy failed to get its team off the ground.\n2013.\nExpansion was again on the off-season agenda as the Upstate Bears were named the 11th league member in February 2013. With the new geographical boundaries, the league again changed its name. In March 2013 MILA became the Continental Indoor Lacrosse League.\nIn May 2013, a league administration was announced. Grand Rapids GM Russ King was named commissioner of the CILL. Detroit GM Owen Blank (secretary) and Ray Kincaid (treasurer) of Chicago were also appointed.\nSeven teams made up the CILL in 2013, with Colorado going undefeated to win the regular season and #1 seed for the CILL Cup playoffs. The Sabertooths went on to defeat Chicago 14-11 in the championship game and were crowned CILL Cup champions.\n2014.\nThe Cleveland Demons announced that they would return to the CILL in 2014. The Demons competed in the league starting in 2012, but went on a 1-year hiatus. The CILL announced that the Lansing Hot Rods would join the league as full-time members after playing a limited exhibition schedule in 2013.\nJust prior to the season the Colorado Sabertooths announced that they would not play in 2014. Soon after, the Columbus Brew pulled out of the season after multiple cancelled games. The Detroit Coney Dogs withdrew from league play after one game and a forfeit due to low player numbers.\nChampionship weekend took place September 27, 2014, in Chicago. Third place Milwaukee declined to participate so it became a three-team event. Second place Grand Rapids defeated the Pittsburgh Octane 20-7 in the semifinal to advance. Later that evening, the Chicago Outlaws defeated the Grand Rapids Dragonfish 20-13 to win their first CILL Cup.\n2015.\nLeadership change came in the spring when A.J. Collier II took over as league commissioner. A schedule was released in early July with nine teams set to compete.\nJust before the regular season it was announced that the expansion Minnesota Ox would be joining the league as a probationary team. Minnesota played exhibition games in 2015, but then ceased operations.\nThe Cleveland Demons won the championship, beating the Dragonfish.\n2016.\nAt the 2016 Winter Meeting that took place on March 19, the CILL accepted the application the expansion St. Louis Centurions.\n2017.\nDuring the Winter Meeting, the Board of Governors voted to rebrand as the Box Lacrosse League. Governors also accepted the expansion Wallaceburg Satans.\nSt. Louis went undefeated during the season, capturing the BLL Cup."

        "text": "The 2013–14 season in Bangladesh was the fourteenth in which first-class cricket was played at the domestic level. The main domestic competitions were the National Cricket League (NCL), the Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL) and the Dhaka Premier League. The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) was cancelled. Internationally, there were tours by New Zealand and Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh hosted both the 2014 Asia Cup and 2014 ICC World Twenty20 tournaments. The season was disrupted by civil and political disturbances caused by issues arising from the 2014 Bangladeshi general election.\nInternational tournaments.\n2014 Asia Cup.\nBangladesh hosted the Asia Cup for the second consecutive time from February 24 to March 7, 2014. The tournament featured Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. However, it was an extremely disappointing tournament for the Tigers, as they lost to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.\n2014 ICC World Twenty20.\nBangladesh hosted the men's and women's World Twenty20 from March 15 to April 7, 2014, in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet.\nInternational tours.\nNew Zealand in Bangladesh.\nThe New Zealand cricket team toured Bangladesh in October and November 2013. The tour consisted of two Test matches, three One Day Internationals and one Twenty20 International. The matches were to be played in Chittagong and Mirpur. Both Test matches ended in draws, Bangladesh won all three One Day Internationals and New Zealand won the sole Twenty20 International.\nSri Lanka in Bangladesh.\nSri Lanka toured Bangladesh in January and February 2014 playing two Test Matches, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. Sri Lanka won every match, with the exception of the second Test match which ended in a draw.\nDomestic competitions.\nInitially it was planned that the NCL would be held in November and December 2013, the BCL in May and June 2014 and the BPL in December and January. This plan was severely disrupted by the protests, strikes and blockades surrounding the 2014 Bangladeshi general election. Some tournaments were rescheduled as a result. The 2013–14 BPL was, in the end, cancelled but that was because all six franchises had been suspended by the governing committee for violating tournament regulations and the tournament's third edition was held in 2014–15 with six new franchises.\nNational Cricket League.\nThe National Cricket League (NCL) was initially scheduled to take place in November and December 2013. It was later rescheduled to take place from January to April 2014 with a break for the World Twenty20.\nVictory Day T20 Cup.\nThe 2013–14 Victory Day T20 Cup was a Twenty20 cricket competition that was held in Bangladesh. It was played by four Dhaka Premier League teams, from 22 December to 31 December 2014. BCB originally organised the tournament as the preparation and the criteria for selecting players for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, scheduled to be played in early 2014. Prime Bank Cricket Club was crowned the champions of the tournament.\nBangladesh Cricket League.\nThe Bangladesh Cricket League (BCL) was initially scheduled for May and June 2014 but, in view of the national disturbances, it was contested in two parts. The first two rounds of the tournament were brought forward to January to fill a gap left by disruption to the NCL. There was then a break to let the leading players prepare for the Test series against Sri Lanka. The remaining rounds of the tournament were scheduled to take place in May after the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. South Zone defeated North Zone in the final.\nResults.\nFinal\nDhaka Premier League.\nTwo editions of the List A Dhaka Premier League were scheduled. The first edition, held from September to November 2013, was initially scheduled for the 2012–13 season but was rescheduled due to the unavailability of players from the Bangladesh national team. The title was won by Gazi Tank Cricketers. The second edition of the league, that for the 2013–14 season itself, was cancelled by the BCB and was set to resume in 2014–15.\nWomen's matches.\nPakistan women in Bangladesh.\n1st ODI\n2nd ODI\n1st T20I\n2nd T20I\nIndia women in Bangladesh.\n1st T20I\n2nd T20I\n3rd T20I"

        "text": "Esporte Clube Pinheiros, or Pinheiros Basquete, is a Brazilian professional basketball team that is based in São Paulo, Brazil. The club's name is commonly abbreviated as E.C. Pinheiros, or E.C.P. The full name of the club is Esporte Clube Pinheiros São Paulo (E.C.P.S.P.). It is a part of the multi-sports club, Esporte Clube Pinheiros (E.C.P.) which among other sports, fields a men's professional basketball team. The club was originally known as Sport Club Germânia (S.C. Germânia). The club plays in the top-tier level Brazilian League, the NBB.\nHistory.\nThe club's parent athletic club, Esporte Clube Pinheiros, was founded in 1899, under the name Sport Club Germânia (S.C. Germânia). The club's name was changed to Esporte Clube Pinheiros (E.C.P), in 1941. In the 2005–06 season, E.C. Pinheiros participated for the first time in the professional first division of Brazilian basketball, but then failed to qualify for the single league that resulted from the merging of the conferences. In the 2008–09 season, Pinheiros joined the new top-tier level Brazilian league, the Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB), under the sponsored name, Pinheiros/Sky. The club finished 2nd in the FIBA South American League in 2011, and also finished 2nd in the InterLeagues Tournament in 2011 and 2012.\nIn 2013, the team won its first international tournament, the most important tournament of Latin America, the FIBA Americas League, with two victories against the host team, Capitanes de Arecibo, of the Puerto Rican League, and the Argentine League club CA Lanús. In the second round, Pinheiros also needed a Capitanes victory over the Brazilian League club, UniCEUB/BRB, the team that had eliminated Pinheiros in the two previous editions of the NBB. And it happened - the team from Puerto Rico, beat the defending three time Brazilian League champions, helping Pinheiros to win its first international title.\nPinheiros thus qualified to play at the 2013 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup, against the defending back-to-back EuroLeague champions, Olympiacos. Pinheiros lost the series two games to none, losing the first game by a score of 81–70, and the second game by a score of 86–69.\nArenas.\nE.C. Pinheiros plays its home games at the Ginásio Poliesportivo Henrique Villaboim, which is located on the club's home grounds, at Jardim Europa."

The series began with a digital mini-series, followed by a six-issue standard mini-series. Two ongoing series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and He-Man: The Eternity War, were produced and are now concluded. There have also been two crossover mini-series with the DC Universe, and one with ThunderCats. Several origin one-shots and collected edition graphic novels have also been produced.\nThe series.\n\"Masters of the Universe\".\nIn June 2012, DC began publishing a weekly digital-first title, \"Masters of the Universe\", with the first chapter written by Geoff Johns, with art by Howard Porter and John Livesay. The title explored the world of Eternia and tied directly into DC Comics' print title, \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\". The digital series lasted eight issues and ended in December 2012.\n\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" (Volume One).\nIn July 2012, a six-issue mini-series started titled \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\". The series lasted until January 2013. In the story, Skeletor succeeds in capturing Castle Grayskull but ultimately fails at unlocking the secret of its power. In the course of the adventure, Skeletor murders the Sorceress before being brutally defeated by He-Man and transported to the side of an unseen villain who reveals he has been manipulating Skeletor all along.\n\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" (Volume Two).\nA new series running from June 2013 to January 2015 started with the aftermath of the first volume. 19 issues were released, consisting of 3 story arcs of 6 issues and one prelude to the next ongoing series. At the start of the first arc, a celebration of the Sorceress’ life is interrupted by an invasion of the Horde, the army of Hordak himself. Leading the charge is a human woman called Despara. He-Man's friend Teela soon recognized Despara as her forgotten childhood friend Adora, who is destined to become She-Ra, the Princess of Power. The second arc, entitled \"What Lies Within\" (issue 7–12) sees King Randor lead He-Man, Teela, Stratos, Battle Cat and Moss Man into Subternia to attempt to bring the Sorceress back to life. Along the way they face the reborn Snake Men. \nThe third arc, \"The Blood of Grayskull\" (issues 13 to 18) explains the origin of She-Ra. The final issue, #19, features a flashback to the youth of Prince Adam and serves as a prelude to the Eternity War.\n\"DC Universe vs. Masters of the Universe\".\nStarting August 28, 2013, a six-issue mini-series titled \"DC Universe vs. Masters of the Universe\" began publishing. It takes place between Volume two issues six and seven. Skeletor, last seen at the end of Volume one, has been sent to Earth by his mysterious ally. Once there, he sets a plan in motion to siphon off Earth's core magic. He-Man and the Masters follow Skeletor to Earth but are confronted with the heroes of the DC Universe, primarily the various factions of the Justice League.\nOrigin one-shots.\nA series of one-shots detailing the origins of different characters have also been published. The origin stories of Skeletor, He-Man and Hordak have been explored.\n\"He-Man: The Eternity War\".\nA second ongoing series, that continues from Volume two, started publishing in December 2014, and ended in February 2016, after 15 issues.\n\"He-Man / ThunderCats\".\nIn 2016, DC Comics released a crossover with ThunderCats. The six-issue crossover lasted from October 2016, to March 2017.  Unlike the various abovelisted series and one-shots—all of which take place in the same continuity as one another, a continuity in which neither Battle Cat nor Swiftwind can talk—\"He-Man/ThunderCats\" takes place in a separate universe, one in which Battle Cat \"can\" talk.\n\"Injustice vs. Masters of the Universe\".\nContinuing the continuity that began with \"He-Man/ThunderCats\", this is a six-part series that crosses over with DC Comics' , the first issue of which was released 18 July 2018 and the sixth of which was released on 2 January 2019.  Taking place after the events of \"He-Man/ThunderCats\" and after Superman's ending in \"Injustice 2\", after defeating the robotic imposter and seizing control of Eternia, He-Man and his allies are approached by the Insurgency to help defeat Superman's despotic rule.\n\"He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse\".\nA 6-part miniseries, with the first issue released on November 20, 2019. The threat of Anti-Eternia has spread across the multiverse, conquering every version of Eternia with a ragtag group of surviving alternate He-Men banding together to save the Multiverse by recruiting the one person that could possibly help them achieve victory, Anti-Eternia's version of Prince Keldor, the man that would become Skeletor.\nCollected editions.\nThe series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks:\nMost of the series was also compiled into one omnibus, excluding the latest mini-series (\"Injustice vs. Masters of the Universe\" &amp; \"He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Multiverse\"):"

David Verburg passed first to silver medalist Tony McQuay who broke first and stayed out of traffic. Behind them, the race was quite competitive, with Russia's Maksim Dyldin closing the first lap in a rush then Lev Mosin running a strong curve to close off the break. Great Britain's Martyn Rooney had to go wide around the turn to pass the Russians, only to be passed himself by Belgium's Kevin Borlée. After Jonathan had led off, he passed to a third Borlée, Dylan. The team of brothers pulled to within two meters of the leading Americans with 500 meters to go, but then the gap widened to five meters. With gold medalist LaShawn Merritt pulling away, Russia's Vladimir Krasnov quickly passed Belgium's Will Oyowe at the handoff. Down the backstretch Jamaica's Javon Francis passed Great Britain, Belgium and Russia to move into second. Krasnov came back but Francis held him off at the line to take silver.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 2 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 21:30."

Kebede was next to go, followed by Tola, but Desisa stuck to Kiprotich like glue. Kiprotich crossed the roadway from side to side, more like match race sailboat tacking maneuvers and Delisa followed. Finally in the last kilometer, Kiprotich was able to make a gap. A meter became ten then fifty. A jubilant Kiprotich began throwing kisses to the crowd, crossing the finish line more than a hundred meters ahead of Delisa. Tola held on for third, with Kebede barely ahead of Nakamoto.

Her 6.57 tied with teammate Funmi Jimoh so she won her position by her second best jump (also 6.57 with Jimoh not having a second legal jump). Shara Proctor led three automatic qualifiers.\nIn the final, her first round 6.50 was more of the same, while Blessing Okagbare jumped 6.89 for the lead.

In the fifth round, Ivana Španović's Serbian national record of 6.82 equaled Sudarava and Okagbare improved her best to 6.99, just 2 cm short of Reese. Reese followed with a meaningless 6.95. Okagbare's final attempt was 6.96, again close but too short to take the win. Left with a tie for third, officials again had to look to the second best attempt for the tiebreaker.

Montaño hit the 600 at 1:26.45 with the lead but as she was slowing that's still a long way to get home. Sum had spent most of the last lap second to Montaño, but when defending champion Mariya Savinova tried to go past her at the head of the straight, she responded and held off the challenge. Both of them passed a dying Montaño 40 meters out with the rest of the field gaining rapidly. As she was passed on the inside by teammate Brenda Martinez, Montaño tossed herself at the finish line, collapsing to the track in fourth as Martinez took the bronze.\nIn 2015, Savinova and Ekaterina Poistogova were recommended for lifetime bans dating back to the 2012 Olympics as part of the wholesale Russian performance-enhancing drug scandal.

If only three competitors are available to challenge for an event then no bronze medal is awarded. Some events were classed as 'no medal' events.\nEvents.\nClassification.\nTo ensure competition is as fair and balanced as possible, athletes are classified dependent on how their disability impacts on their chosen event/s. Thus athletes may compete in an event against competitors with a different disability to themselves. Where there are more than one classification in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a points system is used to determine the winner.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table at the end of Day 5 (28 June).\nSource: paralympic.org\nHighlights.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who have obtained at least three medals.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who agreed to participate in the Championships and the requested number of athlete places for each."

        "text": "Robert Andrew Day (born January 31, 1982), is an American former professional basketball player, who last played with the Brazilian team Bauru, of the Novo Basquete Brasil, the major Brazilian basketball league.\nEarly life and career.\nBorn in Portland, Oregon, Day started to practice basketball at 10 years old. He went on to play high school basketball at Benson Polytechnic High School where he averaged over 20 points per game as a senior.\nCollege career.\nAfter high school, Day played college basketball at Western Oregon University, with the Western Oregon Wolves.\nProfessional career.\nDay's first professional team was with the Algodoneros de la Comarca in Mexico where he stayed for two years. He stopped playing for a season and a half due to a lack of playing time and a lack of opportunities elsewhere. He returned to professional basketball again in Mexico in the second half of the 2007–08 season with Caballeros de Culiacan. The following season, he returned to Algodoneros de la Comarca.\nIn the 2009–10 season he signed with Lobos Grises de la UAD Durango in the hopes of gaining visibility outside of Mexico. After the season, his agent initially arranged for him to participate in a tournament in China with an Argentine team, but after further negotiations he signed with Brazilian team Unitri/Uberlândia for 2010–11 NBB season.\nIn his first season in Brazil, Day gained visibility and became known for being extremely dangerous from the three-point line. His great performances earned him a spot in the NBB All-Star Game, held in Franca, where he played for a team composed of foreign players, called \"NBB Mundo\" (NBB World), against a team composed entirely of Brazilian players. Day started the game on the bench, but when he entered the court, his story began to be written. With a rare performance from the three-point line, Day hit an unbelievable 12 three-pointers and scored an incredible 50 points. NBB World won the match 115–99 and Day was named the MVP of the game. During the season, Robert Day, assisted by Robby Collum and Valtinho, led the team to the quarterfinals of the championship, being eliminated by Brasília of Alex Garcia, Guilherme Giovannoni and Nezinho dos Santos.\nThe following season, Uberlândia emerged as one of the favorites of the NBB. The team had been having a great season, having led a good portion of the regular season, but the departure of Uruguayan coach Miguel Volcan in the middle of the season was detrimental to the team, which finished fifth in the first phase. In the playoffs, the team of Minas Gerais was eliminated by Flamengo in the quarterfinals.\nBut in the 2012–13 NBB season, with the return of Helio Rubens Garcia and Helio Rubens Filho, Robert Day had his best season in Brazil, led the team to the championship final, again facing Flamengo. But this match, played at the Rio de Janeiro, was canceled. The Paraguayan Bruno Zanotti took charge to mark the American, which was fundamental for the title of the team from Rio de Janeiro.\nAfter the match, Robert Day was chosen to the NBB First Team, beside Fúlvio de Assis, Marquinhos, Rafael Mineiro and Caio Torres.\nRobert Andrew Day now has 3 kids Lainey (the oldest), Cooper (the middle), and Beckett (the youngest)."
