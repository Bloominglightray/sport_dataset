        "title": "Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition",
        "text": "Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition, also known as simply Microsoft Baseball 3D, is a sports video game developed by Microsoft and WizBang! Software Productions. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 1998. It received praise for its graphics, but criticism for numerous glitches and its varying difficulty. It was followed by \"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" and \"Microsoft Baseball 2001\".\nGameplay.\n\"Microsoft Baseball 3D\" includes all of the players, teams and ballparks from the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Players include Ron Gant, Lance Johnson, Mickey Morandini, Sammy Sosa, and Todd Stottlemyre. The game has three modes, including single game, season play, and playoffs. There is no home run derby or practice mode. The game has three difficulty settings, three swing types, and four pitch types. The game can be played in a manual mode or an assisted mode. The game includes the General Manager utility, in which baseball players' statistics can be edited, including their weight and height.\nDevelopment and release.\nThe game was developed by Microsoft and WizBang! Software Productions. Development of the game began in January 1996, and took 28 months. The baseball players' actions were created through 500 motion-captured moves. Because of its graphics, the game can only be played with a 3D accelerator card. The game was originally scheduled for release in October 1997, but underwent additional development, before being released on July 1, 1998. The game shipped without multiplayer capability, although a patch was in development at the time to allow such a feature through the Internet.\nReception.\nThe game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\nThe game was praised for its graphics. Scott May of \"Computer Gaming World\" praised the animation and considered the graphics to be the best of any computer baseball game to date.\nThe game was criticized for containing a number of audio and visual glitches. The artificial intelligence (AI) received criticism as well, although a patch was planned to correct this issue. Long load times were another subject of criticism, and the ball physics received a mixed response. Regarding the game's audio, \"GameSpot\"s Michael E. Ryan wrote in his early review of the game, \"Instead of complementing each other and fitting together to form a realistic game atmosphere, the various sound effects seem to be in constant conflict for your attention.\" Dan Egger of \"PC Accelerator\" similarly criticized the uneven sound effects.\nDaniel Morris of \"CNN\" considered the gameplay to be mediocre, and Rick Worrell of \"Sports Gaming Network\" found it to be the least impressive aspect. Egger criticized the lack of a home run derby, and other reviewers criticized the lack of displayed statistics during season play. The difficulty modes were criticized, being described as either too easy or too hard. Tom Anderson of \"GameRevolution\" criticized the assisted mode, stating that \"rather than assist you, the AI just takes over, moving your fielder to the ball and making the play all on its own.\" Ryan wrote that it would have been better if \"the computer simply gave you a little help starting the fielders in the right direction, then turned control over to you\". During play, the game will sometimes rapidly change its camera angles for visual effect, although this was considered disorienting by some critics, who viewed it as one of the reasons for the game's difficulty. Anderson found the pitching and batting interface difficult to master, and the controls too responsive.\nPaul Rosano of \"Hartford Courant\" wrote that the game \"produced some fine features, but along with most of its competitors, it also falls down in enough other areas to make an unqualified recommendation impossible.\" May stated that the game's problems \"can't be ignored or dismissed. But then again, neither can its considerable strengths.\" Anderson only recommended the game for \"the most dexterous button pushers\", although he felt that the game could be worthwhile with fine-tuning in a later release. Worrell called the game a \"noble, if ultimately flawed, effort\", writing, \"This could have been a great title. Unfortunately, there are so many bizarre bugs and inconsistencies. [...] it would take the mother of all patches to fix this game. Barring that, I cannot recommend that you buy it.\""

        "text": "Microsoft Baseball 2000 is a sports video game developed by WizBang! Software Productions and published by Microsoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 1999, as an updated version of \"Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition\". Critics considered the game to be an improvement over its predecessor. It received praise for its graphics and $20 price, but was criticized for containing various glitches. It was followed by \"Microsoft Baseball 2001\".\nGameplay.\n\"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" is an updated version of its predecessor, \"Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition\". It features Major League Baseball (MLB) players, and 30 MLB stadiums. Players include Kevin Brown, Mark McGwire and Curt Schilling. It has several game modes, including QuickGame. There is also a training mode for pitching and fielding, while a home run derby mode allows for batting practice. Seasons consist of 162 games. \"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" has three difficulty settings, and includes commentary by Thom Brennaman. The game also includes the General Manager, which allows the editing of baseball players' traits.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" was developed by WizBang! Software Productions, which also developed the previous game. Unlike its predecessor, the graphics of \"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" do not require a 3D accelerator card to run, although the game does support the use of one for enhanced visuals. Brennaman spent eight days providing his dialogue as the game's commentator, and much of the script called for various inflections of each comment, contributing to the lengthy process. Brennaman, describing his voiceover experience, said, \"You have to do the best you can while imagining plays in your mind. You have to act like it's taking place in front of you.\"\n\"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" was completed in April 1999, and was released in the United States later that month. It was published by Microsoft for Windows. The game was priced at $19.95 in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic. Baseball player Al Leiter is featured on the game's cover. Later in 1999, an updated MLB player roster was released for download through the game's website. A patch was also released that allowed for multi-display.\nReception.\nThe game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\nCritics viewed the game as an improvement over its predecessor, although some still considered \"High Heat Baseball 2000\" to be a superior baseball game choice. The \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" considered the game to be near-perfect. Joel Strauch of \"GamePro\" praised the improvement in gameplay and controls, while \"GameSpot\"s Michael E. Ryan praised the addition of a mid-range difficulty setting. Ryan stated that \"Microsoft Baseball 2000\" had the best pitching interface of any baseball video game, although he described fielding as \"very tough\" and stated that the game's computer-assisted base running was problematic. Joshua Roberts of \"AllGame\" wrote that the game \"has just the bare minimum and there's nothing in its actual gameplay to make up for its glaring omissions.\"\nThe graphics were praised, as was the game's $20 price. \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" wrote that the game \"offers the best budget baseball experience on the PC this summer, and also one of the best at any price.\"\nReviewers criticized various audio and visual glitches that are present in the game. Jason Bates of \"IGN\" complained of frequent lock-ups during gameplay, and Strauch noted long loading times. Scott Silverstein, writing for \"The Washington Times\", stated that it took four attempts across an 80-minute period to get the game running on a computer which had easily met the system requirements.\nRick Worrell of \"Sports Gaming Network\" criticized the commentary for a number of audio glitches, but he praised the sound effects. Roberts found the commentary to be stiff, while other critics praised it. William Abner of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" called the commentary \"fairly entertaining and usually accurate.\" Strauch stated that it was rarely repetitive, and wrote that the crowd noises \"fluctuate appropriately\"."

        "text": "The Omaha Mavericks men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Omaha Mavericks men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Mavericks represent the University of Nebraska Omaha in the NCAA Division I Summit League.\nOmaha began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1910. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nAn added complication in statistical recording is that Omaha did not begin playing in Division I until the 2012–13 season, having previously been in Division II. This is significant because the NCAA did not officially record assists, blocks, and steals in D-II until several years after it began doing so in D-I. The NCAA briefly recorded assists as a statistic in 1950–51 and 1951–52, before the NCAA first split into divisions in 1956. However, after 1952, assists were not officially recorded again in D-I until the 1983–84 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in D-I in the 1985–86 season. By contrast, assists were not officially recorded in D-II until 1988–89, and blocks and steals were not officially recorded in that division until 1992–93. Nonetheless, Omaha's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Swimming in the Stars",
        "text": "\"Swimming in the Stars\" is a song by American singer Britney Spears from the deluxe reissue of her ninth studio album, \"Glory\" (2016). It was released as the lead single of the reissue on December 2, 2020, coinciding with the singer's 39th birthday. The song was conceived during the initial recording of \"Glory\", with the track being written in 2015 by the producers Matthew Koma and Dan Book, with an additional writing provided by Alexei Misoul. An electropop ballad focuses on optimism and escapism over a synth groove.\n\"Swimming in the Stars\" was announced through becoming available for pre-order as a part of the Urban Outfitters's \"11/11 Singles Day\" promotion as an exclusive 12-inch vinyl single on November 11, 2020. The song was met with positive reception of music critics, whom praised its production and positive message. The single did not generate commercial success, charting on digital component charts in Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, however it managed to peak at number three in Malaysia, and within the top 20 in Hungary.\nBackground and composition.\n\"Swimming in the Stars\" was written by Matthew Koma, Dan Book, and Alexei Misoul in 2015 when Koma revealed he had been working with Spears though his tracks never made it on to the initial release of the album. During an interview with \"PopCrush\", Koma said that Spears is \"extremely talented\" and is \"super surreal to sit there and hear [her] sing one of your songs\". The song was recorded in 2016.\n\"Swimming in the Stars\" is an electropop ballad containing a synth-laden groove. The song contains optimistic and catchy lyrics with dreamy escapism spread throughout its chorus. According to Jenzia Burgos of \"StyleCaster\", the song is reminiscent of Spears's interest in astrology, with giving an example of the song's bridge, where she is singing about her sister zodiac sign: \"What if we could float here forever? / In these Gemini dreams together\".\nRelease.\nFollowing the #JusticeForGlory campaign that was launched by Spears's fans on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the singer unveiled a new cover art for \"Glory\" on May 8, 2020, nearly four years after its release. Three weeks later, Spears announced that \"Mood Ring\" would be released worldwide on all streaming and download platforms the next day, on May 29, 2020. Later that year, \"Swimming in the Stars\" was unveiled since it became available for pre-order as part of the Urban Outfitters's \"11/11 Singles Day\" promotion as an exclusive 12-inch vinyl single on November 11, 2020; however, orders would not ship until January 15, 2021. The release took critics by surprise, having been released amidst the #FreeBritney movement and Spears's work hiatus. After the announcement of the song's vinyl release, a 12-seconds long snippet was released by Urban Outfitters via Instagram.\n\"Swimming in the Stars\" was released to digital download and streaming media on December 2, 2020 as the fourth single from \"Glory\", coinciding with Spears's 39th birthday. Two days later, the track was included on the 2020 deluxe physical reissue of \"Glory\" with \"Mood Ring\" and \"Matches\". On the single cover, Spears crouches on one knee in the sand next to broken chains, wearing gold crop top and high-low sarong skirt, which were made of the same material as her bracelets and shoes. She is set to be on desert oasis. On the day of release, a visualiser to the song was published on Spears's YouTube channel, featuring the single cover with animated soft waves and glistering stars behind the singer. Brea Cubit from PopSugar called the visualizer \"mesmorizing\".\nCritical reception.\nUpon release, \"Swimming in the Stars\" received critical acclaim. Lake Schatz of \"Consequence of Sound\" described the lyrics of \"Swimming in the Stars\" as \"positive\", since they are talking about \"briefly forgetting our worries and holding onto joy\". Jon Blistein of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the song \"boasts a big drum pop groove, which anchors a wash of atmospheric synths and Spears' unmistakable vocals as she croons\". Writing for \"Vulture.com\", Rebecca Alter said that \"Swimming in the Stars\" has \"big liquid-stardust, shimmery, synth-y sound perfect for stargazing when it gets dark at like 2PM\". Gary Dinges from \"USA Today\" stated that the song is \"classic Britney\" and contains \"catchy lyrics\". Mike Wass from \"Idolator\" called the song an \"absolute gem\" and described its chorus as \"sweeping\". In \"The Musical Hype\", \"Swimming in the Stars\" was named a \"well-produced record with a relatable theme\", where Matthew Koma's production was described as \"lush, sleek, and smooth\".\n\"Idolator\" ranked the song at number 15 on their list of 100 best pop songs of 2020.\nCommercial performance.\nDue to not receiving any substantial promotion, \"Swimming in the Stars\" did not spawn huge commercial success, charting mostly on component charts. It peaked at number 25 on the Canadian Digital Song Sales, 28 on Germany Digital Song Sales, 36 on UK Download Chart and 18 on the US Digital Song Sales chart. However, the song managed to peak at number three on Malaysia's RIM chart and number 13 on the Hungary Singles Sales chart. Additionally, the song also charted at number 96 on the Croatian Airplay chart.\nCredits and personnel.\nPersonnel\nDesign"

Later that year, he participated in the 1976 IBSF World Snooker Championship and won four of his seven round-robin group matches, which was not enough to qualify for the knockout stage.Straight after the IBSF World Snooker Championship, Ross was accepted as a professional by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.\nBetween the English Amateur Championship in April 1976 and the IBSF World Championship in November of that year, Ross was vomiting three or four times a day, and after returning from the World Championship he later found himself unable to pick up a cue. He retired from playing snooker until adopting a different stance, and an unusual style of grip on the , with his wrist underneath the implement.\nIn his first professional match, Ross was whitewashed 0–11 by Cliff Thorburn in a qualifying round match for the 1977 World Snooker Championship. In the 1977–78 snooker season, he defeated Jack Karnehm 5–4 in the first qualifying round for the 1977 UK Championship before losing 1–5 to Graham Miles in the second qualifying round. The only other tournament he played in was the 1978 World Snooker Championship, where he lost 1–9 to Pat Houlihan. He did not record any match wins in the following two seasons; He also played in the 1980 UK Professional English billiards championship, losing 933–1,093 to Bernard Bennett.\nIn his qualifying match for the 1981 World Snooker Championship, Ross found that his was unsteady and that he was unable to control his properly, and conceded his match against Tony Knowles when trailing 0–7. Although he played in several tournaments over the next couple of seasons, his only match win came with a 6–5 victory over Bert Demarco at the 1982 Scottish Professional Championship. In 1983, Ross resigned his membership of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. He died in 2013, aged 80."

Leaders are listed in various categories, including points, three-pointers, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders.\nLiberty, originally known as Lynchburg Baptist College, began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1972 as a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). In 1975, the same year in which the school changed its name to Liberty Baptist College, it joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). LBC joined the NCAA in 1980 as a Division II member while retaining its NAIA membership; it dropped its NAIA membership in 1983 and adopted its current name in 1985. Liberty moved to Division I in the 1988–89 season. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions. The NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its current records (as of 2020–21) for single-game and single-season assists were both set in 1972–73, and the career record for blocks dates to 1975. The NCAA has recorded scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made field goal was abolished. Individual rebounding was first recorded in 1950–51, as were individual assists. While rebounding has been recorded in every subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season. Assists were not reinstated as an official statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season. Three-pointers were first officially recorded in all divisions in 1986–87, the first season in which the three-pointer was mandatory in NCAA men's play at a standardized distance from the basket. Blocks and steals were first recorded in D-I in 1988–89, during Liberty's first season at that level. That season was also the first in which assists were recorded in Division II; blocks and steals were not recorded at that level until 1992–93.\nLiberty's record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which the school was a member.\nLeaders are current as of the end of the 2022–23 season."

        "text": "A swimming dress, also known as a swim dress, is a modern dress worn by women while swimming that preserves traditional religious definitions of modesty. Swimming dresses are popular among Christians belonging to the conservative holiness movement, Orthodox Jews and many Muslims; many wearers of swimming dresses, such as the Methodists of the conservative holiness movement, believe that modern popular practice of the wearing of trousers by women blurs the distinction between men and women, while others, such as adherent Muslims teach that pants should not be worn by women as they reveal the contour of the legs that should be hidden to maintain modesty. Swimming dresses have sleeves that usually go beyond the elbows as well as hemlines that extend beyond the knees for the purpose of maintaining traditional religious definitions of modesty (cf. \"outward holiness\"). In Israel, they are known as \"Shvimkleid\". In recent years, the demand for modest clothing has risen, which may be due to the growth of religious traditions such as Apostolic Pentecostalism. This has led to a greater interest in swimming dresses."

        "text": "The 2021 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2021 season. The 117th World Series was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros. The series began on October 26 and concluded on November 2.\nThe Braves won the series four games to two. It was their fourth World Series title in franchise history, their first since 1995, and their second since the franchise's relocation to Atlanta in 1966, making this the first time they've won a second title in the same city.\nThe Braves advanced to the World Series after winning the NL East division title. Atlanta then defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. The Astros advanced to the World Series after winning the AL West. Houston then defeated the Chicago White Sox in the AL Division Series and the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series.\nThe Astros had home-field advantage due to their superior regular-season record over that of the Braves. The series was played in a 2–3–2 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and 7 if it was necessary); and the Braves hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. The teams split the first two games, which were played at Minute Maid Park in Houston, and the Braves won Games 3 and 4 at Truist Park in Atlanta to take a 3–1 lead. The Astros won Game 5, returning the series to Houston. The Braves won Game 6 to win the World Series. Jorge Soler was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting .300 in the series with home runs in three of the Braves victories, each time giving them a lead they would never surrender.\nBackground.\nThe team with the better regular-season winning percentage, the Houston Astros, had home field advantage in the series, thus hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and would have hosted Game 7 if needed).\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the National League Division Series when the Astros competed in the National League. Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005). The Astros and Braves played in the National League West from 1969 to 1993.\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series patch for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their caps.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves were managed by Brian Snitker, who joined the organization in 1977 and became their manager in 2016. The Braves qualified for the postseason after winning the National League East for the fourth straight season. They played four months with a winning percentage at .500 or below before finally surpassing .500 on August 6, the latest point in a season that an eventual league champion achieved a winning record. In the best-of-five National League Division Series, the third-seeded Braves defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in four games. In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves defeated the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. Left fielder Eddie Rosario was named NLCS MVP after hitting 14-for-25 (.560) with 3 home runs and 9 runs batted in in the series.\nThis was the Braves' first World Series appearance since 1999, tenth in franchise history, and sixth while in Atlanta. The Braves entered the series with three prior World Series titles, one as the Atlanta Braves in and one while based in each of their previous cities of Boston () and Milwaukee ().\nHouston Astros.\nUnder second-year manager Dusty Baker, the Houston Astros qualified for the postseason as the American League West division winner, having finished atop the division for the fourth time in five seasons. In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the second-seeded Astros defeated the Chicago White Sox in four games. In the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Astros defeated the Boston Red Sox in six games, with designated hitter Yordan Álvarez named ALCS MVP after batting 12-for-23 (.522) in the series. Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., who missed the ALCS due to a forearm strain suffered during the ALDS, was omitted from Houston's World Series roster due to that injury.\nBaker became the ninth manager to win both American and National League pennants (having won the latter with the San Francisco Giants in 2002). Baker's gap of 19 years between appearances in the World Series is surpassed only by Bucky Harris, who managed in the and editions. At 72 years and 4 months old, Baker became the second-oldest manager in World Series history, the oldest having been Jack McKeon of the Florida Marlins in , who was seven months older. Astros' hitting coach Troy Snitker is the son of Brian Snitker, the Braves manager. As a player, Baker was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1967 and spent seven seasons there.\nThis was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, having appeared in and , and fourth overall, having also appeared in when they represented the National League. Their only prior World Series title came in 2017.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nIn pregame ceremonies, the national anthem was performed by Keke Palmer, and the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by former Astro and National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Craig Biggio.\nFramber Valdez started for Houston while former Astro Charlie Morton started for Atlanta. Jorge Soler led off the World Series with a home run to left field for a 1–0 Atlanta lead after the first three pitches; he became the first player ever to lead off a World Series with a home run. A one-out single by Ozzie Albies followed by a double from Austin Riley gave the Braves a 2–0 lead. In the bottom of the first, the Astros had the bases loaded with two outs following a single and two walks, but Morton got Kyle Tucker to ground out, ending the threat. Atlanta added a run in the top of the second on two singles, a fly out, and a fielder's choice, making it 3–0. Freddie Freeman then singled and Albies beat out an infield grounder, loading the bases with two outs, but Valdez struck out Riley to end the inning. In the top of the third, Eddie Rosario singled, followed by a two-run home run from Adam Duvall, making it 5–0 Braves and driving Valdez from the game after 52 pitches.\nMorton left in the bottom of the third inning with an injury; X-rays later revealed a fibular fracture in his right leg, causing him to miss the remainder of the series. The injury stemmed from a comebacker off the bat of Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second. It was unclear when Morton's leg was fractured; Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters that X-rays taken in between innings revealed nothing wrong with Morton, though he said Morton's leg was \"stressed.\" Morton threw 16 pitches following the injury, retiring the next three batters he faced and striking out two.\nA. J. Minter was brought into the game; Michael Brantley hit a one-out double to right, but Minter retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom of the fourth inning, Tucker hit a one-out double, advanced to third when Gurriel singled with one out, and scored on a fielder's choice, making it 5–1. In the top of the eighth, after three scoreless innings, Dansby Swanson walked, advanced to third on a single by Soler, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Freeman, extending Atlanta's lead to 6–1. In the bottom of the inning, Yordan Álvarez hit a lead-off triple and then scored on a groundout by Carlos Correa, making the score 6–2. In the bottom of the ninth, Atlanta closer Will Smith allowed only one walk, to Aledmys Díaz, as the Braves took a 1–0 lead in the series, their first World Series win since Game 2 in 1996.\nGame 2.\nBefore the game, Atlanta added Tucker Davidson to their roster in replacement of the injured Charlie Morton. Giavanni Walker, a petty officer first class in the United States Navy, sang the national anthem, and Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell threw the ceremonial first pitch.\nMax Fried started for Atlanta while José Urquidy started for Houston. In the bottom of the first inning, José Altuve doubled, advanced to third on a flyout by Michael Brantley, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Alex Bregman, giving Houston a 1–0 lead. In the top of the second, Atlanta tied the game, 1–1, via a solo home run to left field by Travis d'Arnaud, coming on a full count with two outs. In the bottom of the second, the Astros hit three consecutive one-out singles, retaking the lead, 2–1. With runners on first and second, Martín Maldonado delivered a base hit to the outfield, driving in another run. Braves left fielder Eddie Rosario tried to throw out José Siri advancing from first to third, but no Braves player was on the base resulting in an error and allowing Siri to score and making it 4–1. After Altuve lined out, Brantley singled to make it 5–1. In total, the Astros collected four runs on five singles, tying their club record for most hits in an inning in the World Series.\nWith two outs in the top of the fifth inning, Freddie Freeman delivered an RBI single to left, scoring d'Arnaud and cutting the Astros' lead to 5–2. Houston extended their lead to 6–2 in the sixth on a fielder's choice that scored Yordan Álvarez. The final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning, as Altuve homered on the first pitch by Drew Smyly, making it 7–2. It was the 22nd home run of Altuve's postseason career, tying him with Bernie Williams for the second-most all-time. This was the first victory by the home team in a World Series since 2018.\nGame 3.\nIn pregame ceremonies, the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Hank Aaron Jr., as his father was honored before the game; the national anthem was performed by Zac Brown. This was the first World Series game ever played at Truist Park, and the first played in Atlanta since . Ian Anderson started for Atlanta while Luis García started for Houston, marking the first time two rookie pitchers started against each other in a World Series since Justin Verlander and Anthony Reyes opened Game 1 in .\nAfter two and a half scoreless innings, the Braves scored on an RBI double by Austin Riley that drove in Eddie Rosario in the bottom of the third inning. García was relieved after innings, having allowed one run on three hits while striking out six batters. Anderson allowed no hits, three walks, and one hit batsman while striking out four in five innings. The Astros remained hitless through seven innings, as A. J. Minter and Luke Jackson did not allow a hit in the sixth or seventh, respectively. Tyler Matzek started the eighth for the Braves and allowed a bloop single to Aledmys Díaz, who was replaced by José Siri as a pinch-runner. With two outs, Siri stole second and advanced to third on a throwing error by Travis d'Arnaud, but was left on base as Michael Brantley popped out. In the bottom of the eighth, d'Arnaud hit a solo home run to extend Atlanta's lead to 2–0. That home run was the first time home runs were hit in back-to-back games by the same player since Ryan Klesko did so in the 1995 World Series. d'Arnaud became the first catcher to do this since Roy Campanella did so for the Dodgers in the 1955 World Series. Will Smith, Atlanta's closer, pitched in the top of the ninth inning. He allowed a leadoff single to Alex Bregman, then retired the next three batters, giving Atlanta a 2–1 lead in the series. The seven-inning no-hit bid by the Atlanta pitching staff was the longest in a World Series game since Jim Lonborg of the Boston Red Sox went innings before allowing a hit in Game 2 of the 1967 World Series. This was the first shutout in the World Series since Game 3 of the 2016 World Series.\nGame 4.\nPrior to the game, the Astros replaced backup catcher Jason Castro on their roster with Garrett Stubbs, due to COVID-19 protocols. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by cancer survivor Elizabeth O’Connor, and the national anthem was performed by Jordan Fisher. Zack Greinke started for Houston, while Dylan Lee acted as an opener for Atlanta in his first MLB start. Greinke was placed eighth in Houston's batting order, the first starting pitcher in a World Series game not to bat ninth since Babe Ruth in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series.\nIn the top of the first, Lee allowed a hit to José Altuve while issuing two walks and recording one strikeout, then was relieved by Kyle Wright. Altuve scored on a ground out by Carlos Correa to give the Astros an early 1–0 lead. Altuve hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth to extend Houston's lead to 2–0. Greinke exited after four innings, having allowed no runs on four hits while striking out three and walking none. In the bottom of the sixth, Atlanta had runners at first and second with one out, via a double and a walk. Houston reliever Phil Maton entered, struck out Ozzie Albies, and allowed a hit to Austin Riley that scored a run, cutting the lead to 2–1. After an intentional walk to Joc Pederson that loaded the bases with two outs, Maton struck out Travis d'Arnaud to end the rally. Back-to-back solo home runs by Dansby Swanson and Jorge Soler off of Cristian Javier with one out in the bottom of the seventh put Atlanta ahead, 3–2. After a scoreless eighth inning, Atlanta closer Will Smith entered to pitch the top of the ninth. He retired the side for his second save in two days, as Atlanta took a 3–1 lead in the series.\nGame 5.\nHall of Fame inductee Greg Maddux threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and Lauren Alaina performed the national anthem. Framber Valdez started for Houston, while Tucker Davidson started for Atlanta; Davidson had not played in an MLB game since June 15, 2021.\nAdam Duvall hit a grand slam for Atlanta with two outs in the bottom of the first inning, the first grand slam in the first inning of a World Series game since 1960. The Astros scored two runs in the second inning, with an RBI double by Alex Bregman and a sacrifice fly by Martín Maldonado. Houston scored twice more in the top of the third, coming on an error, walk, double, and ground out, to make it a 4–4 tie game. A solo home run by Freddie Freeman in the bottom of the inning put the Braves back ahead, 5–4. Both managers brought in relief pitchers during the third inning. The Astros tied the game at 5–5 in the fifth inning when Maldonado drew a walk with the bases loaded, and then scored two more runs on a single by Marwin González to take a 7–5 lead. The Astros added a run in the seventh on an RBI single by Maldonado, and a run in the eighth on an RBI single by Carlos Correa, making it 9–5. Kendall Graveman pitched the final two innings for Houston, holding the four-run lead as the Astros avoided elimination and sent the series back to Houston.\nZack Greinke singled for Houston in the fourth inning as a pinch hitter, becoming the first pitcher with a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in . Game 5 of the 2021 World Series marked the last game to date in which the designated hitter rule was not used. Starting in , the National League added the DH permanently. This makes Greinke the last pitcher to date to get a hit in the postseason (pitchers such as Shohei Ohtani have since gotten hits in the regular season). Additionally, Freeman's home run in this game is the furthest-hit home run in the World Series since the beginning of distance tracking in 2015, at 460 feet.\nGame 6.\nA \"Rally Nun\" threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and country music artist Carly Pearce sang the national anthem. Before the game, Johan Camargo replaced Ehire Adrianza on the Braves' roster as Adrianza was placed on the paternity list. Luis García started for Houston and Max Fried started for Atlanta. The Braves took a 3–0 lead in the top of the third inning on a single and walk followed by a towering two-out home run by Jorge Soler that left Minute Maid Park over the raised train tracks in left field. Garcia exited after Soler's home run, having pitched innings while striking out three batters. In the top of the fifth, a two-run home run by Dansby Swanson followed by a walk then a two-out double by Freddie Freeman extended Atlanta's lead to 6–0. In the top of the seventh, Freeman hit a solo home run with two outs to make it 7–0. Tyler Matzek entered in relief in the bottom of the seventh; Fried allowed no runs on four hits while striking out six batters and walking none in six innings. Atlanta closer Will Smith was brought in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Brantley and retired the next three batters, the last out being a Yuli Gurriel infield grounder fielded by Swanson, who threw to Freeman, giving the Braves the title. With this final inning, Will Smith finished off a postseason in which he closed 11 of 16 Braves games while allowing no runs. Jorge Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.\nWith the World Series victory, Joc Pederson became a back-to-back World Series winner on two different teams, joining names like Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist who previously accomplished that feat. Pederson had become a fan-favorite throughout his three-month stay in Atlanta, particularly for his preference to wear pearls.\nSeries statistics.\n2021 World Series (4–2): Atlanta Braves beat Houston Astros.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFor the 22nd straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox. Joe Buck called the games as a play-by-play announcer, along with Hall of Famer and former Braves pitcher John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis. Game 6 was the final Major League Baseball game that Buck called on Fox and one of the final major sporting events he called on the network (his final broadcast on Fox was the 2021 NFC Championship Game).\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Scott Braun providing play-by-play and Dan Plesac as color commentator. The MLB International feed was produced by MLB Network.\nRatings.\n\"Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.\"\nTelevision ratings for the 2021 World Series were 20% higher than the 2020 World Series in the shortened season. It also averaged a higher rating than the NBA Finals for the second straight year. However, ratings were still below the norm in 2021. Game 6 drew a 33.5 rating and 54% share in the Atlanta market, the highest since Game 4 of the 1999 World Series. It drew a 25.6 rating and a 47% share in the Houston market.\nRadio.\nFor the 24th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States, led by Dan Shulman on play-by-play with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo Pérez as color analysts; Kevin Winter hosted the pregame coverage with analyst Chris Singleton and reporters Buster Olney and Marly Rivera, while Olney provided in-game reports and conducted postgame interviews.\nThis was the first World Series to be broadcast on TUDN Radio, which had acquired national rights to Spanish-language MLB radio broadcasts in early October. TUDN Radio commentators included Jose Napoles, Jesus Acosta, Alberto Ferreiro, and Luis Quiñones.\nThe flagship radio stations for both teams also produced local broadcasts of each game. In Atlanta, WCNN and WAOS broadcast in English and Spanish respectively, KBME (in English) and KLAT (in Spanish) aired the games in the Houston market. Outside of those stations, MLB rules dictated that team-affiliated stations carry the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games.\nAftermath.\nAstros.\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, the Astros lost six players to free agency: Carlos Correa to the Minnesota Twins, Zack Greinke to the Kansas City Royals, Marwin González to the New York Yankees, Kendall Graveman to the Chicago White Sox, and Brooks Raley to the Tampa Bay Rays. Justin Verlander was the lone free agent to re-sign with the Astros, returning on a two-year deal with a player option in the second year after missing all of the 2021 season.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Astros traded starter Jake Odorizzi for Braves reliever Will Smith. Smith was the pitcher who recorded the last out of the World Series, making him the first pitcher ever to be traded the following season to the opposing team that he recorded the last out against.\nThe Astros repeated as American League West champions in 2022, their sixth consecutive postseason appearance and fifth division title in six seasons. They swept the Seattle Mariners in the Division Series and the New York Yankees in the Championship Series to return to and win the World Series by beating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.\nBraves.\nThe much maligned Braves bullpen turned out to be the team's biggest strength during their World Series run. The bullpen was dominant throughout the postseason with the late-inning combination of Will Smith, Tyler Matzek, Luke Jackson, and A.J. Minter leading the way. Closer Will Smith struggled at times during the regular season having posted a 3.44 ERA, particularly with a 5.40 ERA during the dog days of a close NL East division race in August. Those struggles however disappeared for Smith in the postseason as the veteran reliever worked 11 consecutive scoreless innings in October allowing only five hits, three walks, and eight strikeouts with six saves. As it turned out, 2021 would be the last full season the bullpen was together as Smith was traded to Houston at the 2022 trade deadline, Jackson suffered an elbow injury in April 2022, and Matzek had a similar injury before the start of the 2022 postseason in October. The media came up with the nickname 'The Night Shift' for the bullpen, but Luke Jackson later stated he was the one that came up with the name.\nThe Braves celebrated their championship with a parade on November 5, with fitting nods to Henry \"Hank\" Aaron, the franchise legend who died in January at the age of 86. On their parade route, the Braves stopped through Georgia State University's Center Parc Stadium complex including the landing spot of Aaron's 715th home run, or where Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium used to stand. Once the parade reached Cumberland and Truist Park, the crowd was addressed by Henry's widow, Billye Aaron, in a fitting tribute to the slugger. The Braves honored Hank Aaron during the 2021 season by including his jersey number 44 on the back of the team caps, along with Phil Niekro's jersey number, 35, who died one month earlier in December 2020. They also painted 44 in the midfield at Truist Park. Aaron was also honored in the design of the team's World Series championship ring, which includes 755 total diamonds to commemorate Aaron's career home runs, and 44 emerald-cut diamonds to represent Aaron's jersey number with the Braves.\nMedia.\nThis was Joe Buck's last World Series, which ended a 23-year run (1996–2021), the longest run of any play-by-play announcer on network television calling the World Series. Buck and his NFL broadcast partner Troy Aikman signed a lucrative multi-year deal with ESPN, which saw them become the new lead broadcast team of Monday Night Football beginning in the 2022 NFL season. FOX would promote number two play-by-play baseball announcer Joe Davis to replace Buck's spot for the regular season, All-Star, and postseason games."

After starting the season with a 5–2 record, 2019 Most Valuable Player Jay \"sinatraa\" Won retired from competitive \"Overwatch\" to compete in \"Valorant\". Three weeks later, the Shock transferred DPS Park \"Architect\" Min-ho to the Hangzhou Spark and signed former Vancouver Titans flex support Lee \"Twilight\" Jooseok.

After the Shock came out with a quick 2–0 lead, the Dynasty evened up the score, winning the following two maps; however, San Francisco won the final map of the match and moved on to the Upper Bracket finals.

        "text": "The 2019 Sweden women's national ice hockey team strike was a months-long strike by the players of the Sweden women's national ice hockey team.\nBackground.\nStagnation.\nAfter winning silver at the 2006 Winter Olympics, becoming the first country other than the US or Canada to reach the women's Olympic finals, and winning bronze at the 2005 and 2007 IIHF Women's World Championship, the Swedish national team went through a period of stagnation, finishing in 5th place in 3 of the 4 World Championships held between 2008 and 2012, and finishing in 4th in the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nIn November 2009, Sweden defeated Finland 2–1 in the preliminary round of the 2009 4 Nations Cup and defeated Finland against in the bronze medal game of the tournament. Since then, Sweden has failed to win a preliminary round game in the tournament.\nLeif Boork-era.\nAfter Sweden's quarter-finals defeat in the 2016 World Championships, 14 players on the team met in a hotel room in Norrtälje to discuss the team's poor moral and performance, and to attempt to address complaints over poor conditions such as being fed outdated food and strict rules of conduct intruding into their personal lives, including dictating what clothes players could wear. The Swedish Ice Hockey Association refused to meet with the players.\nLater in the summer of 2016, Leif Boork kicked veteran defender Emma Eliasson off the team, despite her having just been named Swedish Player of the Year and having captained Luleå HF/MSSK to a Riksserien championship, telling the press that the national team \"leadership has been too weak\" and that it was \"time to stop compromising.\" National team captain Jenni Asserholt then retired from the national team at the age of 28, after refusing to join the team in June and amidst allegations that Boork was bullying her over her weight.\nIn August 2016, the players petitioned the Swedish Ice Hockey Association to have Boork fired as head coach of the national team. The Association declared it had full confidence in Boork's leadership.\nIn an exhibition game against Finland held in Luleå in September 2016, the fans in attendance held a protest against the coaching decisions, holding up banners calling for \"Emma to the National Team\" and \"Resign Boork.\"\nIn March 2017, the NSD newspaper revealed that the men's national team could expect a bonus of several million kronor for advancing to the finals of the World Championships, while the women's team would receive nothing for achieving the same feat.\nOn 5 May 2017, Boork made a series of controversial tweets accusing players of compromising success, despite having earlier declared himself the \"women's hockey knight\" of Twitter.\nIn June 2017, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association ended subsidies for SDHL transfer fees for foreign players, raising the cost of a transfer fee from 3500kr to 12 500kr, a move widely condemned by league coaches but supported by Boork.\nIn December 2017, SVT Sport released the results of a survey showing that over half of national team players had considered quitting hockey.\nAt the end of 2017, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association announced that it would not be renewing Boork's contract as head coach after the 2018 Winter Olympics. Out of all the international games the team had played in the 2016–17, it had only won four.\nRelegation.\nOn 1 April 2018, former AIK IF head coach and alternate captain in the silver medal-winning Olympic teamof 2006 Ylva Martinsen was named head coach of the national team.\nIn April 2018, the national team players announced that they had unionised under the Swedish Ice Hockey Player's Central Organization (SICO), the same union that represents the players of the men's national team and of the top-flight domestic men's league, the SHL.\nIn July 2018, the Swedish Olympic Committee announced that it was cutting all funding from the women's national team.\nAt the 2019 IIHF Women's World Championship, held in Finland in April 2019, Sweden finished 4th in Group B and 9th overall in the tournament after only managing to win a single game. For the first time in history, the country was relegated from the top division of the IIHF.\nIn July 2019, the location for the 2019 4 Nations Cup was revealed as Luleå, in northern Sweden.\nNorth American strikes.\nIn March 2017, the players of the United States women's national ice hockey team announced their intention to strike ahead of the 2017 IIHF Women's World Championship, after over a year of failed negotiations with USA Hockey concerning wages and playing conditions. The players were publicly supported by the players' associations for the NBA, WNBA, MLB and the NHLPA, and all players USA Hockey approached to serve as replacements for the striking players refused to play. After two weeks, the players were able to reach a four-year deal with USA Hockey, including increased pay and being paid wages outside of the Olympic period.\nAfter the collapse of the Canadian Women's Hockey League in May 2019, over 200 players announced their intentions to sit out from any professional leagues in the hopes of securing greater investment and media coverage of the sport. The #ForTheGame movement soon became more formally organised in the form of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association.\nStrike.\nIn August 2019, all 43 players selected to the Swedish national team camp ahead of the Five Nations announced that they would be striking in protest over a lack of support and financial compensation from the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. Two days later, the players along with their union, SICO, published a list of issues they wanted addressed, listing:\nThe strike adopted the hashtag #FörFramtiden (For the Future) on social media, with players releasing coordinated social media posts stating that \"Many of us have borne the frustration that led to today's decision for several years. Now it's all about the younger generation not having to do it.\" The Five Nations Cup was cancelled due to the strike.\nIn September 2019, the 4 Nations Cup was cancelled due to the strike, as the Swedish Ice Hockey Association couldn't guarantee its participation.\nIn October 2019, over two months since the beginning of the strike, it was announced that a deal had been reached between the players and the Association. The deal included compensation for national team duties, bonuses for medals in international tournaments, as well as an additional bonus once the team earned promotion back to the top IIHF division.\nSupport.\nThe strike received widespread support from other Swedish players, both active and retired. NWHL goaltender Lovisa Selander stated that \"I think what we're doing is right and this was a good time to do it.\" Emma Eliasson, who had retired in 2017, stated that \"a lot of good will come from [the strike].\"\nThe PWHPA spoke out in support of the striking players, with co-founder and board member Liz Knox stating that \"We support them striving for better because in the end, women's hockey as a whole will be the better for it.\"\nSeveral NHL players and members of the Swedish men's national team spoke out in favour of the strike, including Henrik Lundqvist, who stated that he believed that the Association couldn't improve conditions \"then there is no other way.\" Mika Zibanejad announced that for each burger sold at a restaurant owned by him, 10kr would be donated to the striking players. Mattias Ekholm stated that \"It's strong that they're daring to speak up. It helps us to be better as a hockey world.\"\nCriticism.\nSwedish Ice Hockey Association chairman Anders Larsson said that the strike damaged the team's brand, represented a failure of both the Association and the team, and that he felt the Association treated both the men's and the women's sides equally.\nSDE Hockey goaltender Sofia Reideborn, who had played for Sweden in two IIHF World Women's U18 Championship, criticised the strike, stating that the players should first \"show that you are good before making demands\" and that she wouldn't want to play in the Swedish national team because she wouldn't be welcomed by the other players.\nAftermath.\nThe Swedish national team played their first match since the beginning of the strike in December 2019, losing 3–2 to Germany. In March 2020, national team head coach Ylva Martinsen stepped down, being replaced by Ulf Lundberg.\nSweden was set to compete in the 2020 IIHF Women's World Championship Division I in France against France, Norway, Austria, Slovakia, and the Netherlands, aiming for promotion back to the top IIHF division. The tournament was cancelled, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The country will instead compete against the same group for promotion in the 2021 IIHF Women's World Championship Division I. The country will also be competing for qualification to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Group E, the qualification tournament set to be held in August 2021 in Sweden.\nIn the summer of 2020, several national team veterans announced their retirement from hockey, including Erica Udén Johansson and Fanny Rask. The latter announced her retirement from hockey via an Instagram post in which she voiced her frustration with the pace of professionalization in women's hockey and her exhaustion with the financial insecurity of being an SDHL player.What I dreamed of in my youth was to become a professional [ice hockey player]. That the [women's] league would grow to such an extent that we could live on hockey. (No, not millions, everyone knows it is unreasonable still.) But I have always thought that I would be able to join-in when we become professionals. But it has not happened and I feel that we are at a standstill... And I don't see that there will be any change. Of course, I know that things are happening but for me it is going too slowly and I am incredibly uncertain that it will ever happen... So maybe I chose the wrong path, had the wrong dream and too high of demands. I hope there are some people who still have the strength to carry on and who work for a future for women's hockey. My energy has run out, I'm empty and I'm sorry.\nIn September 2020, SICO announced the first-ever collective bargaining agreement between the players of the SDHL, the league and the national team, providing injury insurance for both league and international games along with aid for education and job-finding post-retirement. The agreement entered into force on 1 October. Later that month, the newly appointed Swedish Ice Hockey Association general-secretary Johan Stark called for the men's and women's national teams to receive equal conditions;\nSeveral commentators have also called to introduce restrictions on the number of foreign players on teams in the SDHL as a means to give Swedish players more icetime and improve the national team's performance."

He played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nEarly years.\nIbrahim was born and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland and attended Our Lady of Good Counsel High School in Olney, Maryland. As a senior, he rushed for 1,313 yards and 16 touchdowns on 206 attempts. He committed to play college football at Minnesota over offers from Kentucky, Iowa, Temple, and Towson.\nCollege career.\nIbrahim redshirted his true freshman season.

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Southeastern Louisiana's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "The 2021 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park, on 8–21 February 2021. It was the 109th edition of the Australian Open, the 53rd in the Open Era, and the first Major tournament of the year. It was originally scheduled for 18–31 January 2021, but was postponed by three weeks to February due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was part of the 2021 ATP Tour and the 2021 WTA Tour.\nThe tournament consists of events for professional players in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. Wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.\nNovak Djokovic successfully defended the men's singles title as he claimed his 18th Grand Slam title, defeating Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. Sofia Kenin was the defending Women's Singles champion, but she lost to Kaia Kanepi in the second round. In the final, Naomi Osaka claimed her fourth Grand Slam singles title, defeating first-time Major finalist Jennifer Brady in straight sets.\nTournament.\nThe 2021 Australian Open is the 109th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nThe tournament is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2021 ATP Tour and the 2021 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There are singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nThe tournament is played on hard courts and is taking place across a series of 25 courts, the four main show courts Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena (formerly Melbourne Arena), Margaret Court Arena and 1573 Arena.\nFor the first time in Grand Slam history, Hawk-Eye Live electronic line judging was used for all matches. Thus, calls could no longer be challenged by the players.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 17 December 2020, due to mandatory 14-day quarantine on all arrivals into the country Tennis Australia announced that the start of Australian Open would be delayed by three weeks from 18 January 2021 to 8 February. This was to provide time for those who qualify to quarantine before the tournament. For the same reasons, the men's and women's qualifying matches were held outside of the country in Doha and Dubai respectively, and the junior and legends matches were not played.\nTo honour key workers, recordings of their voices were broadcast for line calls as part of the electronic system.\nOn 4 February 2021, all of the scheduled day's events leading up to the tournament, including the ATP Cup and warm-ups, had to be suspended after a 26-year-old man working at the hotel players were quarantining at tested positive for COVID-19. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews stated that the 8 February start would not be affected due to the schedule change. The events originally scheduled for 4 February as well as the draw ceremonies were held the next day.\nThe hard quarantine policy was viewed as significantly affecting the tournament bracket, especially in women's singles. In all, 26 players in the women's singles bracket were quarantined, with 12 of them seeded. Nine quarantined players, including four seeds (one of them, past Australian Open winner Angelique Kerber), lost in the first round to players who had not been quarantined. Of the 13 quarantined players who survived the first round, five (including two seeds) lost in the second round, and only 22 seed Jennifer Brady advanced past the third round. While the men's singles draw had more quarantined players (29 in all), the only seeded player among that group was No. 25 Benoît Paire. Six first-round matches were between players in this group; of the other 17 players who had been quarantined (including Paire), only Pablo Cuevas won his first-round match. The six survivors all lost in the second round.\nSpectator restrictions.\nOn 30 January 2021, Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula announced that the number of spectators would be limited to 30,000 per day during most of the tournament, which is around 50 percent of normal spectator capacity. Actual attendance was generally below this number, with a total attendance of 98,512 spectators during the first 10 days of the tournament. The last five days of the tournament would have up to 25,000 spectators per day.\nOn 12 February 2021, a five-day snap lockdown and stay-at-home order was declared by the Victoria State Government beginning at 11:59 p.m. AEDT, due to a cluster of active cases linked to another quarantine hotel in Melbourne, presumed to involve a highly-infectious variant of SARS-CoV2. As a result, the tournament was played behind closed doors from 11:30 p.m. AEDT that night; the final match of the day between Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz was suspended at that time to escort spectators from the premises.\nOn 17 February 2021, organizers announced that spectators would be allowed to return beginning 18 February. Each session was capped at 7,477 spectators.\nEvents.\nMen's singles.\nThe Men's Singles final was the last match of the tournament, taking place on 21 February. Top seed Novak Djokovic defeated No. 4 Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to win his 18th Grand Slam singles championship and his ninth overall (and third consecutive) Australian Open, in a game that lasted an hour and 53 minutes.\nDjokovic started the match winning the first three games of the first set and advancing to a 3–0 lead. In this period, he won 13 of the first 16 points, limiting Medvedev to three. Medvedev mounted a brief comeback to win the next three games to match Djokovic 3–3, and both of the players held the next two of their games to reach a scoreline of 5–5. Djokovic broke Medvedev's next serve to win the first set 7–5.\nDjokovic started the second set with a fault, and a subsequent break for Medvedev. However, Medvedev went on to lose the next two games of his serve. The set ended with Djokovic winning 6–2.\nDjokovic had an early lead in the third set, winning the first three games to gain a lead of 3–0. Medvedev was then able to win his first game with a lunge and lob at the net, which Djokovic was unable to return. Both would hold the next two games off their own serve with the score reaching 5–2. Djokovic went on to win the next game, breaking Medvedev's serve, with the final point having him reach to the net and hit a cross-shot across to win the championship. Through the match, Medvedev made a total of 67 errors, of which 30 were unforced errors, while Djokovic had 17 unforced errors. This was Djokovic's ninth Australian open win and 18th grand slams title. 2001 Wimbledon winner Goran Ivanišević, who was part of Djokovic's coaching staff, praised his play and total control through the game, calling his performance, \"a masterpiece\".\nWomen's singles.\nIn the Women's Singles final, played on 20 February, No. 3 Naomi Osaka earned her fourth Grand Slam singles title (and her second at the Australian Open) by defeating first-time Grand Slam finalist Jennifer Brady, the No. 22 seed in straight sets in a match that lasted an hour and 17 minutes. Osaka progressed through the tournament having lost only one set, and became the first woman to win each of her first four Grand Slam singles finals appearances since 1991.\nOsaka began the final with service, and dominated the first game without conceding a point. Likewise, Brady held service in the second game, but required two deuces to tie the set at 1–1. Osaka held again to take the lead, and achieved a break in the fourth game, again without conceding a point. Brady subsequently broke Osaka's serve, and held in the sixth game, levelling the set at 3–3. Each player held service once to tie at 4–4 before Osaka took the lead at 5–4 and broke Brady's serve to win the first set, 6–4. The final point of the first set came with Brady charging to the net and trying to smash the ball but finding the net instead.\nThe second set began with Osaka serving, and she took control of the set shortly thereafter. She held in the first and third games, and broke Brady's service in the second and fourth, jumping out to a 4–0 lead whilst conceding no more than 30 points in any of those games. Brady won her first game of the set breaking Osaka's serve coming from a position of deuce, before winning from an unforced error from Osaka. Both players would hold their next two games, putting the score at 5–3. Osaka took advantage of two forced errors and won the game without conceding, ending the set at 6–3 and winning her the title after 1 hour and 17 minutes.\nBrady had a total of 31 unforced errors with four double faults to Osaka's 24 with two double faults.\nMen's doubles.\nThe Men's Doubles title was decided on 21 February, as the No. 9 seeded pair of Ivan Dodig and Filip Polášek defeated the No. 5 seeded pair of Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury. The match was decided in straight sets (the first such match for the winning pair since the third round), and was the second and first Grand Slam doubles titles for Dodig and Polášek, respectively, in their third and first appearances.\nWomen's doubles.\nNo. 3 seeded duo Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka captured their second Grand Slam doubles title as a pair in the championship match of the Women's Doubles event, defeating the Czech No. 2 duo of Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková in straight sets. Following the conclusion of the match, Sabalenka announced that the pair would not play doubles together for the remainder of the year, so that she could focus on singles.\nMixed doubles.\nThe sixth-seeded duo of Women's Doubles finalist Barbora Krejčíková and Men's Doubles finalist Rajeev Ram defeated Australian duo Samantha Stosur and Matthew Ebden in straight sets on 20 February to win the Mixed Doubles event. The title was their second as a pair, and the third and second overall for Krejčíková and Ram, respectively.\nWheelchair men's singles.\nThe final of the wheelchair men's singles took place on February 17 between two of the unseeded players after the top two seeds fell in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. In the final between Belgian player, Joachim Gérard and British player, Alfie Hewett it would be Gérard who would take out the wheelchair men's singles in three sets to record his first grand slam singles title.\nWheelchair women's singles.\nThe final of the wheelchair women's singles was played between the top two seeds in the tournament, Dutch player Diede de Groot and Japanese player Yui Kamiji. The match which was played on the 17 February saw the two tennis players had their match go to three sets with de Groot claiming her third Australian Open title in a tiebreaker.\nWheelchair quad singles.\nThe final of the Quad Singles was played on the 17 February between Australian top seed Dylan Alcott and Dutch player, Sam Schröder. The match which was originally going to be held on Rod Laver Arena after the quarter-final match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rafael Nadal but after that match went into a fifth set, the match was moved over to Margaret Court Arena. After being broken in the first game of the match, Alcott raced away winning the next twelve games to record his 12th major Grand Slam quad singles title.\nWheelchair men's doubles.\nThe final of the wheelchair men's doubles tournament was played on 16 February in what was a rematch of the 2020 final. The British pair of Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid took their tenth Grand Slam title as a duo, with the pair winning in straight sets.\nWheelchair women's doubles.\nThe wheelchair women's doubles final, which was played on 16 February, was won by Dutch duo Diede de Groot and Aniek van Koot in straight sets. It was the ninth Grand Slam doubles title for de Groot and the sixteenth for van Koot.\nWheelchair quad doubles.\nThe wheelchair quad doubles championship match, a rematch of the last four finals (most recently in 2020), was held on 16 February with Dylan Alcott and Heath Davidson defeating Andy Lapthorne and David Wagner in a third-set tiebreak. It was the seventh and fourth Wheelchair quad doubles title for Alcott and Davidson, respectively.\nPoint distribution and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\n2,000 points were awarded to the winners of the men's and women's singles titles. The men's finalist received 1,200 and the women's finalist received 1,300. Men's singles semifinalists each got 720 points, while women's singles semifinalists got 780.

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Butler's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The Falcons represented Bentley University and were coached by Ryan Soderquist, in his 19th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Bentley's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nBentley didn't play well in the first month of the season, beginning 1–5. After a COVID-19-extended break, the Falcons returned to the ice in late January and won consecutive games. Their good play didn't last, however, and the team followed the mini-resurgence with five straight losses. Despite a poor record, Bentley was the host to start the Atlantic Hockey Tournament. The Falcons played Air Force and won decisively, 7–3. As the team was preparing to take on top seed American International, Bentley University began to see a surge in positive COVID cases. Due the school's protocols, Bentley withdrew from the remainder of the tournament on March 11 and ended their season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Professional Tennis Players Association",
        "text": "The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) is an association of male and female tennis players founded by the players Vasek Pospisil and Novak Djokovic. The group represents singles players in the top 500 and doubles players in the top 200 of the ATP rankings and WTA rankings.\nIt was founded by players who had previously been members of the Association of Tennis Professionals Players Council. Members of the PTPA include Novak Djokovic, the outgoing president of the Council, and Vasek Pospisil. The pair will initially serve as co-presidents of the PTPA for a two-year period. The PTPA is governed by a board of trustees of nine members, to be elected annually.\nAs the ATP is the representative of both players and tournaments, a greater degree of autonomy for players is sought by the members of the PTPA. According to proponents of the new association, the current structure makes having decisions in the best interests of the players difficult, given the conflicting and complex interests of tournaments, Grand Slam bodies and the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The PTPA said in a document that the goal of their organization was \"not to replace\" the ATP but to \"provide players with a self-governance structure that is independent from the ATP and is directly responsive to player-members needs and concerns\".\nBeginnings.\nThe concept for the PTPA began in 2019, when Vasek Pospisil and Novak Djokovic found they shared a perception of shortcomings on how the ATP protected the interest of its players.\nAcross 2020, they aimed to form and consolidate a movement, and it was formally founded as a non-profit in Canada in 2021, with the aim to \"create transparency and fairness throughout decision-making in professional tennis\", with membership being open to both men and women ranked in the top 350 in singles and/or top 150 in doubles.\nLaunch.\nThe initial announcement and launch of the PTPA was done at the US Open on August 29, 2020. The announcement was posted on Vasek Pospisil's Twitter account and included a picture of the members standing on the court in masks with the caption, \"After today's successful meeting, we are excited to announce the beginning of the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA). The first player only association in tennis since 1972. #PTPA\". After the initial launch there was not much movement, however on June 22, 2021 the PTPA released a formal press release on their official Twitter account announcing their advisory board and public communications firm, ANACHEL Communications Inc., as well as their website and social channels. They also launched their own website, www.ptpaplayers.com, which includes their mission and value statements, list of advisory board members, player stories, and an FAQ page to answer all questions those may have about the association. The official launch of the PTPA was concluded with a global press conferencethat included the founders of the association, Vasek Pospisil and Novak Djokovic, the executive director of the PTPA, Adam Larry, and CEO of ANACHEL Communications Inc., Carrie Gerlach Cecil. The press conference was opened to all tennis writers around the world and was livestreamed on YouTube for all to see.\nResponse.\nMilos Raonic stated his intention to join the group: Raonic has expressed his displeasure with Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the ATP on the body's handling of the COVID crisis. Speaking after his semifinal win at the Cincinnati Masters held in New York due to the pandemic, Raonic said:\n\"Players have had plenty of time to think and reflect and take a look at certain parts which they may not be happy with and discuss...A lot of us were kept in the dark by our leadership for six months. We were disappointed with many things. I voiced my opinion on many things, such as ... executives in other sports taking pay cuts to support us. As tennis players, we weren’t making a dime for months and months. ... Lower guys weren’t making a dime,\" Raonic said. \"But our executives were staying home and didn’t feel it necessary to take any pay cuts. I pushed for that on every single phone call we had\".\nGaudenzi was critical of the PTPA and said that \"You have what other athletes in other sports would strive for — a seat at the boardroom table. That is what players fought for in the creation of the ATP Tour...It makes no sense why you would be better served by shifting your role from the inside to the outside of the governance structure\".\nPospisil said in a statement that it was \"very difficult, if not impossible, to have any significant impact on any major decisions made by our tour\" and that \"Our voices will finally be heard and we will soon have an impact on decisions that affect our lives and livelihoods\".\nIn response, the ATP, the WTA, the four Grand Slam tournaments and the ITF released a statement in support of the ATP and said that \"It is a time for even greater collaboration, not division; a time to consider and act in the best interests of the sport, now and for the future...When we work together, we are a stronger sport\". The PTPA has drawn the opposition of players including Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the former writing on Twitter: \"It is time for unity, not for separation. These are moments where big things can be achieved as long as the world of tennis is united\". Andy Murray meanwhile argued that while he is \"not totally against a player union\", the WTA should be on its board and the current ATP management \"should be given some time to implement their vision\".\nThis is not the first time that professional tennis players have called for a players' only union or body. Former world number 1, Andy Roddick, tweeted on 29 August in response to the news, \"It's almost like someone should have said something a decade ago\". Roddick has called for a players union as far back as 2011.\nIn November 2020, after a refusal of the ATP to allow Djokovic and Pospisil to return to the ATP player council, they were said to have been nominated by their peers, Pospisil gave an interview to tennis.com podcast, to clarify why they accepted their nomination, and argued further about the need for the new association:\n\"We basically don't have any information and the tournaments don't need to provide anything and don't need to be transparent at all,\" he says. \"And that's not a business partnership. And especially when we're the product, where people come in and pay money to watch the players play. It's nothing confrontational. We're not here to be confrontational at all.\"\nSupport.\nSupport of the PTPA has been widespread since the launch by both current and former players around the globe. A year after its foundation, it had over 500 members. \nAmerican tennis players John Isner and Ryan Harrison have voiced their support on Twitter and have identified as members of the association. Top 30 players such as Hubert Hurkacz, Reilly Opelka, and Pablo Carreno Busta have done the same. \nSupport from former players in the tennis world stems from Paul McNamee, Mats Wilander, and Patrick McEnroe. Denis Shapovalov has also voiced his support of the association.\nLeadership and Player Executive Committee.\nIn August 2022, the PTPA announced former CEO of OneTeam Partners, Ahmad Nassar, as its Executive Director.\nIn January 2023, the following players were announced to be part of the association's inaugural Player Executive Committee:"

Issues arose from some potential members, namely Harvard, and instead of a formal league a loose association was formed in order to discuss issues, settle arguments and facilitate scheduling.\nAfter Talbot Hunter's sudden departure from the team the program brought in former player Francis Bangs as coach. Unfortunately, the team was still having to use the Philadelphia Ice Palace as its home arena since the temporary rinks that were built on the Whitney Avenue tennis courts proved insufficient. After opening up with two losses before Christmas, Yale headed to Pittsburgh to face Carnegie Tech for the first time in over a decade. The Tartans had just brought their program back and were hardly a match for the experienced Bulldogs but the Tartans showed promise.\nYale won a third consecutive game against another program that returned after several years away (Columbia) but when they faced stiffer competition, the Elis were unable to raise their game. In their final five game of the season, Yale managed only 3 goals and surrendered 28. Their best performance came against Dartmouth when the two teams played a scoreless contest although the game was called due to poor ice conditions. Yale lost all four of its Triangular Hockey League games and finished the season with a very poor record.\nIn the two games against Harvard and the Dartmouth match, Yale's opponents insisted on playing 7–on-7. Records indicate these were the final games played by Yale under the old format as all colleges switched to the more popular 6-on-6 style the following season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

Accumulation of 6 negative points eliminated the wrestler. When three wrestlers remained, they advanced to a final round. These 3 wrestlers each faced each other in a round-robin (with earlier results counting, if any had wrestled another before); record within the medal round determined medals, with bad points breaking ties."

        "text": "Brett Riley is an American ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently the head coach at Long Island and was previously an assistant at Colgate.\nCareer.\nRiley began his college hockey career as a player at Hobart. In four years with the Statesmen Riley played only sparingly, appearing in just 22 games and scoring twice, but was a three-time academic All-American. After graduating with degree in history, Riley began his coaching career at The Albany Academy, leading the program while also serving as a scout for the Charlottetown Islanders, a team in the QMJHL. In 2017 he returned to college hockey, becoming the first head coach for Wilkes University, and had a full year to prepare for its inaugural season in 2018–19.\nWhen Wilkes hit the ice, the team performed well, finished in a tie for 3rd in the UCHC, but lost their quarterfinal game in the conference tournament. After just one season with Wilkes, Riley was hired as an assistant coach by Colgate, working under one of the most respected men in Division I hockey, Don Vaughan. Riley's tenure with the team saw the Raiders achieve moderate gains, rising from 10th in ECAC Hockey to 8th and won its first playoff round in five years. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Colgate's season ended prematurely.\nDespite his brief tenure at the top level of competition, Riley was brought in to be the first head coach for yet another program. This time he signed on to lead the LIU Sharks beginning with the 2020–21 season.\nPersonal.\nRiley is part of a legendary college hockey family, with his father, uncle and grandfather all having coached Army since 1950. His father Rob also won a Division III National Championship in 1984 while his grandfather Jack coached the US National team to a gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics.\nCollege head coaching record.\n \n "

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Trojans represent the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the NCAA Division I Ohio Valley Conference.\nLittle Rock began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1930. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Little Rock's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

This is a list of all teams that have participated, organised by country.\nOverview.\nAs of 2023, of the 47 nations to have competed, 18 of them have played in all thirteen tournaments to date.\nAustralia.\nAn ever present at the World Cup, Australia had their best performance in 2012 when they reached the final against England. The match went all the way, being decided by a sudden death leg where all four players had darts at double before Adrian Lewis reigned in victory for England. But in 2022, their 10-year agony came to an end when Damon Heta and Simon Whitlock beat Wales in the final to become the 5th different nation to win the trophy.\nAustria.\nMensur Suljović has led the Austrian team at every World Cup since its inception. The team's best performance was reaching the last eight, which \"The Gentle\" has achieved five times with three different partners, but in 2021, a fairytale run saw them reach the final before eventually losing to Scotland.\nBahrain.\nBahrain became one of three new nations participating in the World Cup, when they made their debut in 2023.\nBelgium.\nAmongst teams that have never won the World Cup, Belgium has the best record, reaching the semi-finals seven times, including a loss to in the 2013 final. The six semi-finals statistic is third only to the four-time champions of England and the . The Belgian team is also unique in being the only team to be composed of brothers, being represented by Kim and Ronny Huybrechts from 2013 to 2017.\nBrazil.\nBrazil was one of two teams to debut in the 2017 World Cup and did so with a first round victory over other debutant Switzerland. Diogo Portela has been an ever-present for the team.\nCanada.\nTriple World champion John Part was an ever-present in this tournament until 2018, with the team reaching the quarter-finals on four separate occasions.\nChina.\nChina was one of the seven teams to debut in the 2014 World Cup, when the tournament field was increased from 24 to 32 teams. They notably became the second team to have a female representative at the World Cup when Momo Zhou teamed with Zong Xiao Chen in 2018. Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, they had to withdraw from the 2020 tournament, and miss the 2022 tournament altogether.\nCroatia.\nCroatia didn't play in the inaugural World Cup, but were one of the 5 new teams to debut in the 2012 edition. Despite beating New Zealand and Northern Ireland to reach the quarter-finals in 2013, they hadn't been invited back to another World Cup, until a surprise recall in 2021, but they then had to withdraw owing to an illness to Boris Krčmar.\nCzech Republic.\nAfter being forced to withdraw from the inaugural World Cup in 2010 due to inclement weather, the Czech Republic had to wait until 2015 to make their debut. They have been active in the tournament ever since, but have yet to win a match. Their average of 103.47 in their 2021 loss to Poland was the highest losing average in a first round match at the World Cup of Darts.\nDenmark.\nAn ever-present in the competition, the Danes have never gone beyond the last 16 stage.\nEngland.\nAfter the loss to Spain in the inaugural World Cup in 2010, England reached the final in the next 5 editions, winning 4 of them, thanks to the combination of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis. Since then, they only reached one final, in which they were whitewashed 3–0 by Wales.\nFinland.\nAnother ever-present team, Finland's record is unspectacular with the exception of a surprise semi-final run in 2013, including an upset victory over the Dutch team of Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld.\nFrance.\nFrance were one of seven teams to debut in the 2014 World Cup when the tournament field was increased from 24 to 32 teams. They lost 5–4 to Wales in the first round, and would not make a return to the tournament until 2023.\nGermany.\nDespite having home advantage for most of the tournaments, the German's best run came in 2020, when they reached the semi-finals in Austria, which included a win over their rivals, the Netherlands.\nGibraltar.\nThe smallest nation in the tournaments by both size and population, Gibraltar's only win to date came in 2015, when they beat Italy.\nGreece.\nGreece were the only team to debut in the 2016 World Cup after John Michael secured a Tour Card at Q-School.\nGuyana.\nGuyana will become one of four new nations participating in the World Cup, when they make their debut in 2023.\nHong Kong.\nHong Kong were one of the seven teams to debut in the 2014 World Cup (the only of which to be seeded) when the tournament field was increased from 24 to 32 teams.

After averaging under 70 and failing to win a leg in 2014 and 2015, the latter would be their final year in the tournament.\nIreland.\nAfter a relatively unspectacular record in the competition, the Irish reached the final in 2019 after impressive wins over England and the Netherlands, before Scotland claimed the title.\nItaly.\nItaly did not participate in the first two World Cups, but joined the roster in 2013 as a replacement for the withdrawn Philippines. As of the 2022 tournament, they have the longest record of matches without ever recording a win at the World Cup, losing all eleven of their matches.\nJapan.\nAnother ever-present, Japan's run to the semi-finals in 2019 bettered their previous best of quarter-final runs in 2013 and 2018.\nLatvia.\nLatvia were set to debut at the 2017 World Cup led by tour card holder Madars Razma along with Nauris Gleglu, but withdrew late on and were replaced by . Following China's withdrawal from the 2020 tournament due to flight issues, Latvia finally made their long-awaited debut with a last leg victory over .\nLithuania.\nLithuania were the only team to debut in the 2019 World Cup, taking the place of after former WDF number one Darius Labanauskas secured a Tour Card at Q-School.\nMalaysia.\nSo far, Malaysia have only competed in the second and fourth editions of the tournament, losing to both Irish teams in the process.\nNetherlands.\nThe winners of the inaugural tournament, the Netherlands have won the event on three other occasions, and have only failed to reach the quarter-finals stage twice.\nNew Zealand.\nThe New Zealand team's only run of note came when they reached the quarter-finals in 2019. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, they couldn't participate in the 2021 tournament, ending their ever-present record.\nNorthern Ireland.\nA team who have always been a top 8 seed, the Northern Irish team have only reached the semi-finals on two occasions.\nNorway.\nNorway was one of the seven teams to debut in the 2014 World Cup when the tournament field was increased from 24 to 32 teams. Though they achieved their first match victory in 2016, it would be their last appearance in the tournament.\nPhilippines.\nPhilippines did not compete in the first World Cup, but debuted as one of the five new teams in the 2012 World Cup, and after missing the 2017 and 2018 tournaments, they returned in 2019.\nPoland.\nAppearing in all but the 2012 tournament, Poland have never gone beyond the last 16 stage. In 2023, Poland set the world record highest Pairs average of 118.10 against Lithuania in the group stage.\nPortugal.\nPortugal were invited to play at their first World Cup of Darts in 2020, following the late withdrawal of Singapore.\nRussia.\nAfter including Anastasia Dobromyslova in the inaugural tournament, Russia would miss the next 2 tournaments, before reaching the quarter-finals in 2017, where they beat Australia on the way.\nScotland.\nAfter succumbing to Spain (twice) and South Africa in the first three tournaments, Scotland reached the final in 2015 and 2018, before winning the title in 2019 and again in 2021.\nSingapore.\nSingapore were one of the seven teams to debut in the 2014 World Cup when the tournament field was increased from 24 to 32 teams. They have consistently been represented by Paul Lim and Harith Lim (no relation). Singapore notably knocked out the number one seeded Scotland in the first round to kick off a run to the quarter-finals in 2017.\nSlovakia.\nSlovakia have only been invited to play at the first World Cup of Darts in 2010, where they lost to Ireland 6–3 in the first round.\nSlovenia.\nSlovenia have only been invited to play at the first World Cup of Darts in 2010, where they lost to Sweden 6–2 in the first round.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa did not appear in the first World Cup, but debuted the second World Cup in 2012 with a quarter-final run, and have been present for every edition since, and have still been the only African representatives in the competition.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Hoyas represent Georgetown University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nGeorgetown began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Georgetown's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "This is a list of golf clubs that have been granted permission to bear the appellation of \"Royal\", having been bestowed by a reigning monarch, such as from British, Spanish, Belgian, Nepalese, Dutch, or Swedish monarchs. To receive the honour of \"Royal\", the golf club would normally invite a member of the Royal family to be a patron or an honorary member, or they apply for the title, which is granted from the reigning monarch. In Britain, according to Scott Macpherson in his book \"Golf's Royal Clubs Honoured by the British Royal Family 1833–2013\", the title of \"Royal\" officially was restricted to ”institutions of eminence, long standing and secure financial position, and devoted to national, charitable and scientific objects” by the British monarchy.\nNot all golf clubs that have \"Royal\" in their title have Royal status, for instance, the Royal Tara Golf Club in Ireland gave itself the title because the golf club is near the Hill of Tara where the ancient Kings of Ireland once resided. The Royal Spring Golf Course in India is called Royal Springs because there are four natural water springs that were used back by Mughal emperors, hence it is said to be \"Royal\". The now-defunct Royal Links Golf Club in Las Vegas, USA, had no royal connections at all, it was built to acknowledge the traditions of the game. It featured holes inspired by 11 different Open Championship courses, including the Old Course at St Andrews, Royal Liverpool, Hoylake, Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes and Royal Birkdale. The Royal Automobile Club is a Royal club but not a Royal Golf Club, because the Royal Club just happens to have a golf course. King Edward VII granted the Royal status to the Automobile Club.\nIn Denmark, the Royal Golf Club in Copenhagen, also appears to have given itself the title of Royal when there is no evidence of any royal connections. Likewise the similarly named Royal Copenhagen Golf Club's () only connection with royalty is that the national park, which today includes the golf club, was established by the Danish King Christian V in the late 17th century, and King Frederik III's castle sits near the 16th hole. The course is also located in Kongens Lyngby, Danish for \"the King's Heather Town\". There is no evidence to show that the golf course has been granted a charter or similar document.\nNot all Royal golf clubs own their own golf course, the Royal Perth Golfing Society -the world's earliest 'royal' club - play on the North Inch Golf Course, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews play on St Andrews Links, the Royal Montrose Mercantile Golf Club play on Montrose Links, and the Royal Epping Forest Golf Club play on Chingford Golf Course, which are all public golf courses.\nGolf clubs granted Royal status by the Belgian Monarchy.\nWith some exceptions, Belgian golf clubs automatically adopt the title of Royal after they have been in operation for 50 years."

The Chargers represented the University of Alabama Huntsville and were coached by Lance West, in his 1st season.\nThe start of the college hockey season was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, Alabama–Huntsville's first scheduled game was in mid-November as opposed to early-October, which was the norm.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Alabama–Huntsville's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDue to the program's financial crisis that nearly prevented the Chargers from fielding a team for this season, as well as the departure of former head coach Mike Corbett, many players transferred to other teams in the offseason. The loss of the experience these players possessed hamstrung the Chargers efforts to improve their record and ended with the team predictably near the bottom of the conference. UAH won only 3 of their 22 games all season but were rescued from a last-place finish by Ferris State winning only one of their games. Despite the few wins, there were some positive signs from the hastily assembled team; freshman Tyrone Bronte led the team in scoring, indicating that the team may be able to recover from its recent struggles if the program's financial stability could be assured.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Due to the cancellation of the previous year's tournament due to COVID-19 pandemic, this was the 73rd season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held, and was US college hockey's 127th year overall.\nDue to concerns related to the pandemic, the start of the season was delayed until what would have normally been the 8th week of play. Despite having to contend with contend with cancellations and delays due to the pandemic, the season was completed. Massachusetts won their first national championship, ending the 4-year run of NCHC teams.\nRegular season.\nDue to difficulties in scheduling, Arizona State entered into a scheduling alliance with the Big Ten while LIU did the same with Atlantic Hockey. Both teams remained independent programs and will not be considered for conference championships.\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division I men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 61 Division I men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 60, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013-14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, most teams played a very small selection of intraconference games, if any at all. As a result, the PairWise rankings would not be used as the primary measuring tool for determining which teams would receive at-large bids for the NCAA tournament. The ranking would only be used to differentiate between teams within their own conferences. The PWR will likely be used as the primary ranking system once a full NCAA season is played.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n&lt;br&gt;\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nTournament bracket.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The New York Mets received the 11th pick as compensation for failing to sign Kumar Rocker. The Boston Red Sox received the 41st pick as compensation for failing to sign Jud Fabian.

There are limitations on teams participating in the lottery multiple years in a row, with separate limitations for revenue-sharing recipients and revenue-sharing payers. The draft will permanently switch to 20 rounds, with an annual pre-draft combine, and guarantees to draftees of 75% of their slot value provided that they submit to pre-draft physicals.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Owls represent the Rice University in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nRice began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1914. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Rice's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

He is currently Head Coach of Irish provincial team Connacht Rugby in the United Rugby Championship competition. He was previously Senior Coach and Attack Coach at Connacht Rugby in the Guinness Pro14, Assistant Coach of Edinburgh Rugby, also in the Guinness Pro14, and Assistant Coach of the Queensland Reds in the Super Rugby competition. Prior to this, he held roles as Head Performance Analyst of the Queensland Reds, Head Coach of Queensland Reds A, and Coaching Coordinator of Queensland Country in the Australian National Rugby Championship.\nEarly life.\nBorn in London, Wilkins grew up in the Hampshire city of Winchester, attending Christ's Hospital School as a boarder and captaining the school's rugby and cricket teams, as well as Sussex Schools Rugby representative age grades. In 1997, he relocated to Australia to play colts rugby for Eastern Suburbs RUFC, before returning to the UK to study Geography at Durham University.\nCommunity Rugby.\nIn 2007, Wilkins returned to Australia to work for the Queensland Rugby Union as their Regional Rugby Manager for North Queensland and Central Queensland, where he oversaw rugby development and coach education across the region's rugby communities. This role later expanded to include the areas of South East Queensland outside of Brisbane. Wilkins progressed to the role of Head of Coach Education for the Queensland Rugby Union, overseeing and delivering coach accreditation courses across the state. During this time he also gained coaching experience at the community level with North Ward Old Boys Rugby Union Club in the Townsville and Districts Rugby Union competition, and Easts Tigers Rugby Union and GPS Rugby in Queensland Premier Rugby. Wilkins has maintained his links to the community game and is regularly involved in providing ongoing education for grassroots coaches and players.\nProfessional Coaching Career.\n2011-2015.\nIn 2011, Wilkins joined the Queensland Reds high performance department as a Performance Analyst, the same year the team won the Super 15 Final. He was promoted to Head of Performance Analysis later that year, before becoming Skills Coach in 2013, and Defence Coach in 2015. During this time, Wilkins was also Head Coach of the Reds Wider Training Squad, Coaching Coordinator of Queensland Country in 2014's inaugural Australian National Rugby Championship, and Head Coach of the Queensland Reds A team for three seasons. Leading Queensland Reds A in the Pacific Rugby Cup, now known as the World Rugby Pacific Challenge, the team enjoyed unbeaten seasons in 2013 and 2015, and were beaten finalists in 2014 against Argentina A.\n2015-2017.\nAt the conclusion of the 2015 Super Rugby season, Wilkins accepted the role of Assistant Coach with Edinburgh Rugby in the Guinness Pro12 competition, arriving on a one year contract and later that season renewing for another two years on the back of significant improvements in Edinburgh's defence. When Head Coach Alan Solomons departed his role during the 2016–17 Pro12 season, Wilkins remained to coach the team along with interim Head Coach Duncan Hodge, and Forwards Coach Stevie Scott.\n2017-2022.\nWilkins joined Connacht Rugby as Assistant Coach for the start of the 2017–18 Pro14 season, arriving on a two year contract to work under newly appointed Head Coach Kieran Keane. When Keane left the club at the end of his first season, Wilkins remained to continue his role under new Head Coach Andy Friend. During the 2018–19 Pro14 season, Wilkins extended his contract for another two seasons with Connacht. In April 2021, Wilkins was promoted to the role of Senior Coach with Connacht Rugby, with primary responsibility for the team's attack. He has described his attack coaching philosophy as favouring an unstructured style of play based on key attacking principles, and the importance of building an emotional connection to the team's style of play.\n2022-Present.\nIn June 2022, Ireland Head Coach Andy Farrell announced the inclusion of Wilkins as an Assistant Coach for Ireland's summer tour to New Zealand, including a three test series against the All Blacks and two mid-week games against New Zealand Maori. On his return from Ireland's series win, Wilkins was promoted to the position of Connacht Head Coach, with Andy Friend moving to a new Director of Rugby role. When Friend later announced he would be leaving Connacht at the conclusion of the 2022-23 season, it was confirmed that Wilkins would assume overall responsibility for the professional team, signing a three-year contract as Head Coach. He would combine this new role with a return to coaching the team's attack."

        "text": "Trafford Rowing Club is a rowing club on the Bridgewater Canal, based at Walton Park Sports Centre, Raglan Road, Sale, Greater Manchester.\nClub colours.\nThe blade colours are black with a jade band; kit: black with a jade green stripe.\nHistory.\nAccording to British Rowing's records, Trafford Rowing Club (TRC) was founded in 1957 by Russell Kerniham. At that time, the club was known as the MetroVicks Boat club (MVBC), a sports club created for the employees of the Metropolitan Vickers Engineering Company based in Trafford Park. The company also gave birth to other sports clubs in the area for its staff.\nThe MVBC started with just four members, however during the 1960s the club did grow and achieved success at a number of events in the north. MVBC was originally based further along the Bridgewater Canal at Dane Road. Originally the clubhouse was a grain warehouse that the council donated. Club night was established on a Wednesday evening  where members would go down and repair the racks and the boats.\nAt some point (unknown) the old boathouse burnt down and the members relocated to the current boat house in Walton Park Sports Centre in the 1980s. At this point the name changed the name to Trafford Rowing Club. The former MVBC was resurrected in its present form as Trafford Rowing Club and its blade and kit colours became black and green.\nThe club was run by a small number of dedicated members including notable figures such as Ken Jolley and John Gill. In the early 1990s the club began to emerge from the difficult times of the previous decade. In 1990 the club had enough members to enter a crew at the Head of the River Race in London for the very first time. Since then the club has grown stronger and now has more members than any time since 1957.\nTrafford RC is affiliated to the sports national governing body, British Rowing, is a Community Amateur Sports Club (CASC) and in February 2009 gained Clubmark accreditation.\nIn 2007, the club celebrated its 50th birthday.\nEvents.\nThe Head of the Bridgewater started in the late 1970/s early 1980s. The race originally started past the Bay Malton pub in Dunham Massey. The race was originally held in, November, however, given the impact of the weather conditions, the Head was moved to February . In the early 1990s the club resurrected itself and is now renamed Trafford Head and is typically held every year, apart as a result of weather conditions and most recently, COVID restrictions."

        "title": "National Girls Baseball League",
        "text": "The National Girls Baseball League (NGBL) was a professional women's baseball league which existed from 1944 to 1954, with teams based in Chicago, Illinois. The National Girls Baseball League started a year after the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was featured in the film \"A League of Their Own\". The National Girls Baseball League differed from the AAGPLB in that the NGBL kept and allowed the traditional underhand softball pitching format. Football legend Red Grange served as commissioner of the National Girls Baseball League.\nHistory.\nThe National Girls baseball League was founded in 1944 by Forest Park, Illinois contractor Emery Parichy, Charles Bidwill, who was owner of the Chicago Cardinals football team and politician Ed Kolski. Parichy had built Parichy Stadium in Forest Park in 1934 and owned a softball league, the Metropolitan League. Parichy and Bidwell hired Red Grange to preside over the league.\nThe National Girls Baseball League was formed in 1944 and played 11 seasons. It was formed as a result of scouts for the Chicago–based All–American Girls Professional Baseball League scouting and recruiting talent from the Chicago softball Metropolitan League, run by Parichy. It was decided to then turn the Metropolitan League to a professional league.\nThe National Girls Baseball League consisted of teams from the greater Chicago, Illinois area and regularly drew over 500,000 fans annually. Unlike the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, the National Girls Baseball League kept the traditional underhand softball pitching format.\n\"For two seasons our league outdrew the White Sox in attendance,\" noted player Freda Savona, in reference to the Chicago White Sox of MLB. “They packed the place,” said Al Maag, of the NGBL attendance. Maag was the founder of the Chicago 16-inch Softball Hall of Fame, which posthumously inducted and honored Charles Bidwill with the Richard J. Daley Friend of Softball Award in 2013 for his contributions to women's baseball and softball.\nThe National Girls Baseball League had six teams, all owned by Emery Parichy: the Bloomer Girls, Blue Birds, Chicks, Queens, Cardinals, and Music Maids. The Forest Park based Bloomer Girls were moved by Parichy to Chicago from Boston in 1937 and used the \"Parichy Bloomer Girls\" moniker, playing home games at Parichy Stadium. The league played at ballparks throughout Chicago, including Soldier Field and Wrigley Field.\nThe National Girls Baseball League was in competition with the All–American Girls Professional Baseball League. The integrated National Girls Baseball League offered higher salaries and emphasized closer road game schedules in an attempt to secure the best players. League rosters included an African–American, Betty Chapman; a Chinese–American, Gwen Wong; and Nancy Ito, a Japanese–American. One player, Freda Savona, was rumored to earn $500 a week. Connie Wisniewski jumped to the NGBL when the AAGPBL switched to overhand throwing and Audrey Wagner was a notable AAGPBL player who switched to the NGBL. Pro Football Hall of Fame member Red Grange served as league president. Retired major league baseball players Buck Weaver (Black Sox Scandal) and Woody English were team managers.\nIn 1946, after two years of conflict over players, the administrators in the two leagues reached a non–raiding agreement.\nRed Grange served as commissioner of the National Girls Baseball League until 1949. Grange was replaced as commissioner by Arch Wolfe, who had worked for the Chicago Cardinals. Wolfe had served as president of the league, with Ed Kolski serving as secretary and Emery Piarchy as treasurer.\nIn the winter of 1952–1953, players from both the AAGPL and National Girls Baseball League played together in the four–team International Girls Baseball League (IGBL) based in Miami, Florida. The league was formed by Frank Darling, the owner of the NGBL’s Music Maids. Darling served as the president, while Harry D. Wilson, also from the NGBL, served as league secretary. Darling recruited players from both leagues and created the team rosters and schedule.\nConnie Wisniewski, a former AAGPBL player of the year, played in the 1950 National Girls Baseball League. Wisniewski played for the 1950 Music Maids, winning 30 games as a pitcher. Wisniewski returned to the Grand Rapids Chicks of the AAGPL in 1951.\nFreda Savona was called the “Babe Ruth” of the NGBL, setting home run records and batting over .400 in 1951.\nAudrey Wagner joined the Parichy Bloomer Girls and the National Girls Baseball League in 1950 from the AAGPL. Offered a higher salary, a signing bonus, with no extensive travel, Wagner valued being home every night, being closer to school and her studies. With a salary of 125 dollars a week, Wagner put herself through school at Elmhurst College and then the University of Illinois-Chicago, where Wagner earned her MD in 1955. Wagner helped her team to the Championship in 1950 and made the All–Star Team in each of her four seasons in the National Girls Baseball League. In 1952, Wagner led the league in doubles, triples, home runs and total bases, and was second in the batting, with a .364 average.\nSophie Kurys stole 1,141 bases in her career. She joined the National Girls Baseball League in 1951, moving from the AAGPL with her teammate Joanne Winter. Together, they helped lead the Admiral Music Maids to the 1951 championship. Kurys played three seasons in the National Girls Baseball League.\nLois Roberts Strenkowski played barefoot for the duration of her time in the National Girls Baseball League and throughout her career. Playing for the Cardinals team in the NGBL, she made $65 per week playing for two seasons through 1951. In June, 2010, on her 90th birthday, celebrated at Dodger Stadium, Strenkowski was given the honor to announce the Dodgers' opening words, “It’s time for Dodger baseball.”\nAfter the 1952 National Girls Baseball League season, Jesse Owens was on hand to present Dolores Moore with the league's Most Valuable Player Award at a ceremony. Moore's manager Woody English, became the manager of the AAGPBL's Grand Rapids Chicks and added Moore to his roster.\nAfter the 1954 season, the National Girls Baseball League folded amid declining attendance. Increased TV viewing of Major League Baseball was a factor.\nIn 2013, in a women's professional softball league game, the Chicago Bandits of the National Pro Fastpitch Softball played tribute to the Parichy Bloomer Girls and the National Girls Baseball League by wearing replica Bloomer Girls' uniforms.\nRules of play.\nThe league allowed underhand pitching and used a 12\" ball. Uniforms generally consisted of long knee socks, jerseys over long-sleeves and shorts.\nLeague champions/runner-up.\nYEAR / CHAMPION / RUNNER-UP\nMedia.\nThe National Girls Baseball League was the subject of a documentary. \"Their Turn at Bat: The Story of the National Girls Baseball League\" is a documentary film by Adam Chu."

The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. It was the first time in fourteen years that South Africa toured Pakistan.\nIn December 2020, Cricket South Africa (CSA) confirmed that they would be touring Pakistan. The Test matches took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, with the T20I matches being played in Lahore.\nPakistan won the first Test by seven wickets, to take a 1–0 lead in the series. Pakistan won the second Test by 95 runs, taking the series 2–0, and recording their first series win against South Africa since October 2003. The T20I series was level after the first two matches, with Pakistan winning the third match by four wickets, winning the series 2–1. With winning the third match, Pakistan became the first men's team to win 100 T20I matches.\nBackground.\nAfter successfully arranging a limited-overs series against Sri Lanka in Pakistan, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Ehsan Mani announced that they would no longer play their future home matches at a neutral venue. For the tour to go ahead, Cricket South Africa needed to grant permission for their players to travel as a group, due to the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. In August 2020, the South Africa women's team were denied a request to travel to England.\nOn 25 September 2020, the PCB confirmed that the South African team would be touring Pakistan, as per the schedule. A month later, Cricket South Africa sent a security delegation to Pakistan to perform a feasibility assessment for the tour. South Africa last toured Pakistan in October 2007. On 16 January 2021, the PCB named the match officials for the tour. Aleem Dar, who has been the on-field umpire for 132 Tests prior to the tour, stood in his first Test match at home. Ahsan Raza also made his debut as an on-field umpire in Test cricket.\nSquads.\nIn December 2020, Pakistan's Shadab Khan suffered an injury ahead of the Test series against New Zealand. On 26 December 2020, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that he had been ruled out of the second Test against New Zealand, and the Test matches at home against South Africa. Before South Africa departed for the tour, Ottniel Baartman was ruled out of their Test squad, with Marco Jansen named as his replacement. On 24 January 2021, the PCB confirmed that seventeen players would be available for selection for the first Test match, with Abdullah Shafique, Kamran Ghulam and Agha Salman staying with the squad for training sessions.

Before the opening of the downtown KFC Yum! Center in 2010, Freedom Hall had been the full-time home of Louisville men's basketball for more than 50 years, and had also been at least the part-time home of Louisville women's basketball since that team's establishment in 1975. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bellarmine could only seat 300 at its on-campus facility, Knights Hall. With Freedom Hall's basketball capacity of 18,252, the Knights were able to seat 2,700.\nTemporary arenas.\n\"To be added.\"\nSeason outlook.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nEarly season tournaments.\nEarly season tournaments are TBA, although many have canceled and others are unlikely to occur.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I Women's Basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked in the Top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of #1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll.\nBold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 31 Division I athletic conferences that played in 2020–21 ended its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference was given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. Unless otherwise noted, the winners of these tournaments received automatic invitations to the 2021 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, an \"upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball."

The golf course, at an elevation of above sea level, is the second highest green golf course in the world. It lies from Srinagar in the west. The golf course gets covered in by a thick layer of snow during the winter. It is open from April to November.\nHistory.\nGulmarg, which means \"the meadow of flowers\", is a hill station surrounded by pine and fir. The Gulmarg Golf Course with a 6-hole course was built within a meadow by Colonel Neville Chamberlain in 1890 at Gulmarg, a hill station near Srinagar. In 1922 the first Golf championship was played at the course with the introduction of Nedou's Cup in 1929. The course was later redesigned and turned into the Gulmarg Golf Club by Peter Thomson in 1970. It was developed in a links-style in accordance with its surrounding natural landscape and made more challenging by relocation of the greens. The golf course hosted the Northern India Cup regularly until 1989, when it was shifted to Delhi. In 2011, the golf course was redesigned by Ranjit Nanda a Delhi-based golf-architect. From December to March, the golf course becomes a winter sports center for skiing and snowboarding.\nLegacy.\nThe Gulmarg Golf Club, at an elevation of above sea level, is the second highest green golf course in the world. It has 16 different species of wildflowers along with the creeping bent on the greens. The 18-hole golf course features the country's longest hole (the 8th, a 610-yard par 5).

        "text": "The England cricket team toured Sri Lanka in January 2021 to play two Test matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in March 2020, but the series was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed the dates for the tour, with both Test matches played in Galle.\nEngland won the first Test match by seven wickets to take a 1–0 lead in the series. England won the second Test by six wickets to win the series 2–0. The win was England's fifth successive victory overseas, their best away streak since touring South Africa in 1914.\nBackground.\nOriginally England's tour to Sri Lanka was scheduled to take place in March 2020. However, on 13 March 2020, the two-match Test series was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the announcement, England were mid-way through a four-day match against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI team, which was ended abruptly. On 1 May 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket announced that the tour would be rescheduled to be played in January 2021, although the ECB did not confirm the fixtures at the time.\nIn July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed it was their priority to reschedule the matches, along with the five other World Test Championship series that had been postponed due to the pandemic. In October 2020, Sri Lanka's head coach Mickey Arthur said he was \"really positive\" that the rescheduled tour would go ahead. In November 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket's CEO Ashley de Silva announced the dates for the tour, subject to agreement by both cricket boards. In December 2020, the ECB confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned in January.\nIn December 2020, a new strain of the COVID virus was discovered, prompting concern from Sri Lanka Cricket's medical staff regarding the tour. Despite a travel ban from Britain due to the new variant, the England cricket team were given permission to fly to Sri Lanka. On 3 January 2021, the England cricket team arrived at Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport.\nSquads.\nEngland also named James Bracey, Mason Crane, Saqib Mahmood, Craig Overton, Matt Parkinson, Ollie Robinson and Amar Virdi as reserve players for the tour. Upon arrival in Hambantota, England's Moeen Ali tested positive for COVID-19, and was placed into isolation for ten days. Chris Woakes was identified as a close contact to Ali, and so was forced to self-isolate for seven days.\nAhead of the tour, Sri Lanka made several changes to their squad. Dhananjaya de Silva and Kasun Rajitha were ruled out of the series after being injured in the first Test at Centurion during the tour of South Africa. Avishka Fernando, Ashan Priyanjan, Ramesh Mendis, Roshen Silva, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Pradeep and Lakshan Sandakan, who were not part of the Test tour of South Africa, were initially called up as reserves for the series for Oshada Fernando, Dhananjaya de Silva, Dinesh Chandimal, Kasun Rajitha, Wanindu Hasaranga and Lahiru Kumara. Later, Avishka Fernando and Ashan Priyanjan were left out from the squad. Dinesh Chandimal captained Sri Lanka in the first Test due to Dimuth Karunaratne's injury.\nPrior to the second Test match, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis, Minod Bhanuka, Lahiru Kumara and Nuwan Pradeep were all released from the Sri Lankan squad. Dinesh Chandimal was again named as captain in Karunaratne's absence.\nWarm-up match.\nAhead of the Test series, England played a two-day intra-squad warm-up match in Sooriyawewa. Ollie Pope took part in the match as preparation for England's tour of India, despite not being named in the Test or reserve squads for the matches against Sri Lanka. No play was possible on the second day of the match due to heavy rain.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets.\nSri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020–21"

        "text": "The 2001 Nations Cup (officially the 2001 Coalite Nations Cup) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place at The Hexagon, in Reading, Berkshire, England, from 13 to 21 January 2001. It was a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association team competition held as part of the 2000–01 snooker season and the third and final edition of the Nations Cup. The competition was contested by eight nations of three players each, with one of them qualifying via a play-off match. It was sponsored by smokeless coal manufacturer Coalite.\nEngland were the tournament's defending champions but were eliminated in the group stages after finishing third in their group. Scotland's Stephen Hendry, John Higgins and Alan McManus won the competition, defeating the Republic of Ireland's (ROI) Ken Doherty, Fergal O'Brien and Michael Judge six to two (6–2) in the final. During the match, referee Alan Chamberlain courted controversy when he cautioned O'Brien over slow play since the television coverage was due to end soon after. The event's highest was a 131 made by Thai player Phaitoon Phonbun in the second frame of his nation's group match with Malta.\nBackground.\nThe Nations Cup was formed in 1999 as a five-squad snooker tournament involving the Home Nations. The 2001 tournament was expanded from five to eight teams to accommodate non-Home Nations sides. It was a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association team event staged as part of the 2000–01 snooker season and was held at The Hexagon, Reading, Berkshire, from 13 to 21 January 2001. Although there were plans to rename the tournament the World Cup, this was the final year it was played because ITV stopped broadcasting snooker. Sponsored by smokeless coal manufacturer Coalite, the event had a total prize pool of £69,400, with £46,950 going to the winning squad divided equally amongst all three players. The host broadcaster was ITV.\nRules.\nThe Nations Cup had eight national teams consisting of three players each. These teams were split into two round-robin groups of four. Each side played a best-of-seven match between other nations in their group. The first three frames were contested by one player from each team and the fourth by two from each side. The last frames were played by one participant per nation. The two squads who won the most games in their group qualified for the semi-finals. Should there have been a tie for second place, the nation with the higher frame difference progressed or each player would have two tries to the on its from the in a shoot-out. If this did not determine a group winner, the match would go to sudden death.\nThe two best-of-nine frames semi-finals were contested on 19 and 20 January with the best-of-eleven frames final on 21 January. The final's first three frames were played by one player from each nation with the fourth featuring two from both teams. The final six frames featured one participant from each squad. In the event the game was tied at 5–5, the team captains would be required to nominate the player for the final frame decider. Except for the last frame of the final, players were not allowed to play two frames in succession or more than one frame against their opposite from the other squad.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the 2001 tournament is listed below. Each player received an equal share of prize money for how well their team fared. The £20,000 maximum break prize would be awarded to the first participant to attain the feat in the competition.\nParticipants.\nThe tournament composed eight teams of three players representing individual nations. All of the eight nations were represented by their three highest ranked players. Each team was seeded with the defending champions England seeded first and Scotland second. Malta qualified for the Nations Cup by defeating Belgium 3–2 in a play-off round in the Bournemouth International Centre, on 18 November 2000. Below is a list of participating teams and players.\nGroup stages.\nGroup A.\nGroup A was played between China, England, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) from 13 to 17 January. In the first match, England versus China, Ronnie O'Sullivan won the first frame against Asian qualifier Da Hai Lin and John Parrott the second on a after Marco Fu himself on the last . Stephen Lee beat Hasimu Tuerxun in frame three with breaks of 54 and 79 and Fu and Da won the doubles frame over Lee and O'Sullivan. England won the match 4–1 when O'Sullivan beat Tuerxun. Gerard Greene took a final frame decider for Northern Ireland over the ROI's Michael Judge to win 4–3. O'Sullivan was ruled out for three days with a lower back injury he picked up during a massage at the 2000 China Open and was replaced by Anthony Hamilton.\nEngland's Lee, Parrott and Hamilton and the ROI's Ken Doherty, Fergal O'Brien and Judge shared the first six frames of their match to force a final frame decider won by the latter side with Judge's win over Lee for a 4–3 victory. China defeated Northern Ireland 4–3 in Group A's fourth match. Trailing 2–0 after Fu and Tuerxun lost to Greene and Joe Swail, China took frames three to five before Northern Ireland's Murphy defeated Tuerxun to force a final frame decider. A break of 41 from Hai Lin helped China win 4–3. China came from 3–1 behind the ROI to win the next two frames courtesy of Fu and Hai Lin to end with a final frame decider won by Judge over Tuerxun for a 4–3 victory in 3 hours, 26 minutes and a spot in the semi-finals. Greene, Murphy and Swail helped Northern Ireland defeat England's Lee, Hamilton and Parrott 4–2 to qualify for the semi-finals and eliminate the top seeded team. The final frame was won by Murphy for Northern Ireland after Parrott incurred 67 penalty points in fouls. Parrott admitted post-match: \"I was definitely the weakest link ... It's my last time in the event and I certainly haven't covered myself in glory.\"\nGroup B.\nGroup B was contested by Malta, Scotland, Thailand and Wales between 13 and 18 January. The first match in the group was between Malta and Scotland. Tony Drago made a 47 break to defeat John Higgins before Alan McManus and Stephen Hendry beat Alex Borg and Joe Grech to go 2–1 ahead. Scotland took three of the next four frames to defeat Malta 4–2.

Thailand took the next three frames to win 4–1.\nIn Wales' match against Scotland, Dale and Stevens won the first two frames over Higgins and Hendry. McManus beat Williams in frame three but Stevens and Williams restored Wales' two-frame lead by winning the doubles frame over Higgins and McManus. Both nations shared the next two frames but Wales won 4–2 to make the semi-finals. Scotland's Hendry, Higgins and McManus whitewashed the Thai trio of Noppadon, Phonbun and Wattana 4–0 to progress to the semi-finals and Wales' Dale, Stevens and Williams maintained their unbeaten tournament record by 4–0 over Malta's Borg, Drago and Grech for the last spot in the next round. Wales' win also allowed Stevens to maintain his unbeaten form in singles frames.\nKnockout stages.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the best-of-nine frame semi-finals were held between 19 and 20 January. The first-semi final was between the ROI and Wales. Judge won the first frame for Ireland with a 50 break over Williams, and O'Brien the second over Stevens following a one-hour battle in which O'Brien fluked the final red ball into the and made a clearance to the pink ball. Dale made a break of 59 to win frame three for Wales before the doubles frame saw Doherty and O'Brien pot the blue, pink and while under pressure from to give the ROI a 3–1 lead. The fifth frame saw Doherty the and pot the brown and blue balls to defeat Stevens and put the ROI 4–1 ahead. The ROI won frame six with O'Brien beating Williams on a fluke on the final red ball and a clearance to the blue ball for a 5–1 victory and the first spot in the final. Losing player Dale said he could not believe the outcome, adding: \"In nearly every frame, luck played a part and we didn't have any.\"\nThe other semi-final was a 99-minute game between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Hendry made a 71 break against Greene to win the first frame for Scotland and McManus beat Swail by 94 points for the second. Higgins came from 46 points behind Murphy to compile a 60 clearance to the pink and win Scotland's third frame. Greene and Swail led 49–0 in the doubles frame until Hendry partnering McManus made a 68 clearance to claim Scotland's fourth frame. Swail led Higgins 39–0 in frame five before the latter won to finish Scotland's 5–0 whitewash of Northern Ireland and enter the final. Hendry described Scotland's performance as their best since their 1996 World Cup victory in Bangkok, adding: \"our opponents can consider themselves unlucky to catch us on such a hot day.\"\nFinal.\nThe best-of-eleven frames final between the ROI and Scotland was held in the afternoon of 21 January. Hendry made a break of 92 to defeat Doherty in the first frame and McManus won a 59-minute second frame over O'Brien who missed the green ball during an attempted clearance. Judge made a break of 75 against Higgins to win frame three for the ROI and Doherty and O'Brien made it 2–2 by winning the doubles frame over Hendry and Higgins. McManus fluked the final red ball from a into the left-centre pocket to defeat Doherty in frame five. In frame six, O'Brien was ahead of Higgins when referee Alan Chamberlain cautioned him about playing slowly after taking more than a minute to select a shot. Chamberlain received support from most of the audience for the comment. O'Brien missed a red ball and a snooker to allow Higgins to make a clearance to the black ball and win the frame. Hendry defeated Judge with a break of 87 in the seventh frame and Scotland won the match 6–2 when Higgins beat Doherty with a break of 34 in frame eight. The game lasted 4 hours and 7 minutes.\nIt was a repeat of Scotland's 1996 World Cup win over the ROI, who became the third nation to claim the Nations Cup. The team won £46,950 prize money shared between all three players. Hendry commented on the victory: \"Since losing to Wales in the group we haven't put a foot wrong. As a team we were very solid and I think we deserved to win. People will say that we didn't play England in the semis or Wales in the final but you beat whoever's in the other seat.\" Higgins added: \"'It's been a great week and Stephen's contribution was vital. We've been disappointed in the last two years by our performances but today we responded to the challenge.\" McManus said: \"It was extra special for me because I have not won a tournament for a while. And it's great to play alongside a couple of legends like Stephen and John. We are all very patriotic and we're delighted to win for Scotland.\"\nOf the warning about slow play. O'Brien said Chamberlain told him to finish because ITV's coverage of the match would end at 17:00 local time. He added: \"If he had used some tact and maybe waited until the end of the frame it would have been different. But to do it in front of the crowd and TV was tactless, especially as I was fighting for myself and my team out there.\" Doherty called Chamberlain's selection of words \"an absolute disgrace\" and said he would write a complaint. Hendry said he thought the incident with O'Brien \"unfortunate, to say the least, and unfair\", adding: \"He isn't a slow player, he flows as much as anyone when he's among the balls.\" Steve Davis, the six-time world champion, defended Chamberlain's choice, believing there was a straightforward shot based on position of the balls and that O'Brien spent too long examining the situation. A spokesperson for production company ISN commented: \"We feel it is important to make it plain that there was no communication or attempted communication between ourselves and any of the match officials.\"\nChamberlain was deemed by the WPBSA to have applied the rule correctly but ruled his comment not appropriate. He accepted that he did not say the right words and he was reassigned away from the next match involving O'Brien at the first round of the 2001 Masters.\nMain draw.\nThe teams highlighted in bold text in the table indicate who progressed to the semi-finals.

        "text": "A Rugby card is a type of trading card relating to rugby football codes, usually printed on cardboard, silk, or plastic. These cards are most often found in the Australia, New Zealand and other countries where the sport is popular.\nHistory.\nEarly versions of rugby union trading cards came at the beginning of 20th century, when tobacco companies released their cigarette card series. The first collections consisted on black and white photographs of rugby players, such examples of this were series issued by Ogden and W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills (both in 1902) and Taddy (1906). Later collections featured color illustrations of player portraits (Ogden, 1906) and live actions (issued by Gallagher in 1912).\nIn successive decades, other tobacco manufacturers launched series. In 1926, Ogden released a new black and white series of players. The same year, John Player &amp; Sons released a series that consisted of caricatures of rugby players. In 1935, W.A. &amp; A.C. Churchman released an illustrated series displaying player portraits.\nAustralian company Scanlens produced its first rugby league set in 1963, releasing several collections during the 1970s and 1980s. Other companies that produced cards were Stimorol (1988–91) and Regina (1992–93), until Dynamic Market took over the contract to produce rugby league cards in Australia.\nAnother Australian company, \"Select Australia\", entered into the business in 2000. The company was the official licensee for National Rugby League (NRL) cards (2010–12). Since then, the NRL licensed company \"Elite Sport Properties\" (ESP) to produce trading cards. The NRL also released its own collections, \"Startoons\", featuring caricatures of players.\nCollections.\nSome rugby union/rugby league card collections released through the years include:\n! width=50px| Year\n! width=150px| Manufacturer\n! width=250px| Series\n! width=400px| Type, format"

He played college football at Baylor.\nCollege career.\nBlack was a member of the Baylor Bears for five seasons, redshirting as a true freshman. He finished his collegiate career with 119 tackles, four tackles for a loss, two sacks, and two forced fumbles with eight passes defended and two interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nBlack was signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent following the 2020 NFL Draft on April 29, 2020. He was waived during final roster cuts, but signed to the team's practice squad the following day. He was elevated to the active roster on October 24 for the team's week 7 game against the Houston Texans and made his NFL debut the next day. Black forced a game-ending fumble that was recovered by the Packers in the 35–20 victory. He was returned to the practice squad following the game without having to clear waivers. He was elevated again on October 31, November 5, and November 14 for the weeks 8, 9, and 10 games against the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, and Jacksonville Jaguars, and reverted to the practice squad again after each game. On December 8, Black was signed to the active roster.\nBlack was named the fourth safety on the depth chart to begin the regular season. 2020 seventh-round pick Vernon Scott missed much of the season with injuries, and as a result, Black saw regular action as the Packers' dime safety. He recorded his first NFL interception on October 28, 2021, during a Week 8 win against the Arizona Cardinals, off a pass thrown by Kyler Murray. The Packers did not pick up Black's exclusive rights free agent (ERFA) tender, which would have given him a 1-year, $645,000 contract to stay with the team, making him a free agent for the 2022 season.\nNew York Giants.\nOn May 18, 2022, Black signed with the New York Giants. On July 26, 2022, Black was waived.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Atlanta Falcons signed Black.

        "title": "2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2022–23 season. The 84th annual edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the UConn Huskies defeating the San Diego State Aztecs, 76–59 in the championship game on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.\nASUN champion Kennesaw State made its NCAA tournament debut, while Southern Conference champion Furman made its first NCAA appearance since 1980. Another school, Texas Southern, won the SWAC tournament to become the third 20-loss team to make the field, after the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013. It was also Texas Southern's 3rd consecutive NCAA tournament.\nThis tournament featured several notable upsets. For only the second time in history, a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed, when Fairleigh Dickinson upset Purdue in the first round 63–58 in Columbus. Coincidentally, much like the previous time a top seed lost in Round 1, the regional final was contested between a mid-major (in this case Florida Atlantic) and Kansas State. For the third consecutive year, and seventh time since 2012, a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed in the tournament, when 15-seeded Princeton defeated 2-seed Arizona 59–55 in Sacramento for the Tigers' first tournament win since 1998. Arizona became the first team to lose to a 15-seed team twice, with the first loss being against the Santa Clara Broncos in 1993. Additionally, Princeton subsequently defeated Missouri in the second round to advance to the Sweet 16, marking the third consecutive year where a 15-seed reach the regional semifinals. It was also the 15th consecutive tournament since 2007 where a double-digit seed made the regional semifinals. Additionally, Virginia was knocked out in the first round as a top-four seed for the second consecutive year, and the third time in five years as a 4-seed when they were upset by 13-seed Furman.\nThe defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks were eliminated in the second round, against the Arkansas Razorbacks, becoming the sixth consecutive tournament where the defending champion failed to make the Sweet Sixteen.\nThis was also the first NCAA tournament in which all of the top seeds failed to make the Elite Eight, after Alabama and Houston's eliminations in the Sweet Sixteen. This year also had the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.\nFor the first time since 1970, three teams made their first Final Four appearance in this tournament. Those three teams were Florida Atlantic, who defeated 3-seed Kansas State to join Wichita State as the only 9-seeds to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, San Diego State, and Miami (FL), who both advanced to their first Final Four in program history. FAU also became the first team since George Mason in 2006 to make the Final Four in the same season that it earned its first NCAA tournament win. This is also the third Final Four without any 1-seeds since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, with the first two being in 2006 and 2011, the second time without any 1 or 2 seeds (2011), and the first time in Final Four history without any teams seeded 1–3. With FAU (Conference USA) and SDSU (Mountain West Conference), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU.\nThe 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.\nProcedures.\nA total of 68 teams participated in the tournament with 32 automatic bids being filled by each program that won its conference tournament. The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on Selection Sunday, March 12. The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\nEight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament bracket.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites selected to host the each round of the 2023 tournament:\nFirst Four\nFirst and second rounds (subregionals)\nRegional semi-finals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semi-finals and championship (Final Four)\nHouston hosted the Final Four for the fourth time, having previously hosted in 1971, 2011, and 2016.\nQualification and selection of teams.\nSeeds.\n&lt;section begin=\"RegionSeeds\" /&gt;\nThe tournament seeds and regions were determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process and were published by the selection committee after the brackets were released.\nSource:\n&lt;section end=\"RegionSeeds\" /&gt;\nBracket.\nSource:\nAll times are listed in Eastern Daylight Time ()\nFirst Four – Dayton, OH.\nThe First Four games involve eight teams: the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams.\nNotes and game summaries.\nUpsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2023 tournament saw a total of 9 upsets, with four in the first round, three in the second round, one in the Sweet Sixteen, and one in the Elite Eight.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports and Warner Bros. Discovery Sports had US television rights to the tournament.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Broncos represent Western Michigan University in the NCAA's Mid-American Conference.\nWestern Michigan began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Western Michigan's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

They play their home matches at various grounds, including Trent Bridge and Grace Road. They are captained by Kirstie Gordon and coached by Chris Guest. The team carries over many elements of the WCSL team Loughborough Lightning. They are partnered with Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire.\nHistory.\nIn 2020, women's cricket in England was restructured, creating eight new 'regional hub' teams, with the intention of playing both 50-over and 20-over cricket. The team, then known as Lightning, were one of the sides created under this structure, effectively replacing the Women's Cricket Super League team Loughborough Lightning and representing the East Midlands, partnering with Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, as well as Loughborough University. The side was to be captained by Kathryn Bryce and coached by Rob Taylor. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was truncated, and only 50-over cricket was played, in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy. Lightning finished bottom of the North Group in the competition, winning two of their six matches. At the end of the season, five Lightning players were given full-time domestic contracts, the first of their kind in England: Kathryn Bryce, Sarah Bryce, Bethan Ellis, Lucy Higham and Abigail Freeborn.\nThe following season, 2021, Lightning competed in both the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy and the newly-formed Twenty20 competition, the Charlotte Edwards Cup. In the Charlotte Edwards Cup the side finished bottom of their group, losing all six of their matches. In the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, Lightning finished fourth in the group of eight, winning three of their seven matches. In the final match of the season, Lightning scored 320/6 in their victory over Central Sparks, with the Bryce sisters, Kathryn and Sarah, sharing a 207-run partnership, the highest across the competition. Lightning bowler Kirstie Gordon was the leading wicket-taker in the competition, with 16 wickets. Rob Taylor left his role as Head Coach at the end of the season, and was later replaced by Chris Guest.\nLightning again finished bottom of their group in the Charlotte Edwards Cup in 2022, but did win their first Twenty20 match, beating North West Thunder by 5 wickets. In September 2022, it was announced that Nottinghamshire CCC would become the new host of the team, replacing Loughborough University, and it was also announced that the name of the team would change. The side finished sixth out of eight in the 2022 Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.\nIn November 2022, it was announced that the team had been renamed The Blaze. Kirstie Gordon was named as the side's new captain in April 2023. The side went unbeaten through the group stage of the Charlotte Edwards Cup, but lost in the final to Southern Vipers. They also qualified for the knockout stages in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, finishing second in the group, before defeating South East Stars in the play-off. However, they again lost to Southern Vipers in the final.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nAs per 2024 season.\nAcademy.\nThe Blaze Academy team plays against other regional academies in friendly and festival matches across various formats.

The game will be televised nationally by Fox.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nOn May 23, 2018, the league originally selected New Orleans as the site for Super Bowl LVIII, then tentatively scheduled for February 4, 2024. In March 2020, the league and the NFLPA agreed to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games starting in 2021, pushing Super Bowl LVIII to February 11, 2024, and causing a conflict with New Orleans's Mardi Gras celebrations. On October 14, 2020, the league decided to move Super Bowl LVIII to another city (Las Vegas was later chosen) and awarded Super Bowl LIX to New Orleans instead, as Mardi Gras in 2025 is not until March 4, thus avoiding any conflicts.\nLogo.\nThe official logo was unveiled on February 12, 2024, and follows the logo template established since Super Bowl LVI, with the Roman numerals featuring imagery representing the host city/region. For this event, the Roman numerals contain artwork by local artist \"Queen\" Tahj Williams—a figure in the community of Mardi Gras Indians. It marks the first time the NFL collaborated with a local artist on the design of a Super Bowl emblem. \nThe design–originally created with beads–features red, green, and gold-colored fleur-de-lis patterns (a symbol long connected with New Orleans and used as the logo for the New Orleans Saints), evoking the designs of ironwork balconies common in the city's architecture (particularly in the French Quarter).\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LIX is scheduled to be televised by Fox. It will be the second Super Bowl to be broadcast under the 11-year NFL television contract as part of the four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN.\nFox Deportes is expected to air a Spanish-language feed of the game.\nStreaming.\nThe game will be available via streaming to mobile devices on NFL+. Fox has not yet announced streaming plans.\nRadio.\nWestwood One holds the national radio rights to the game."

The initial format was three pools of three, with the top six teams moving into two subsequent pools of three. The top four teams then contested elimination semi-finals. \nMatches.\nPhase one\nThe nine teams were grouped into three pools of three. \nGreat Britain (two wins) led Samoa (one win) and Tonga in their pool. Australia (two wins) led Māori (one win) and Niue. New Zealand (two wins) led the Cook Islands (one win) and Tokelau. Standinsgs after the first phase were New Zealand (1st, 4 points, +140 differential), Great Britain 4 (2nd, 4, +70), Australia (3rd, 4, +62), New Zealand Māori (4th, 2, +40), Samoa (5th, 2, +24), Cook Islands (6th, 2, -50), Tokelau (7th, 0, -90), Tonga (8th, 0, -94) and Niue (9th, 0, -101).\nPhase two\nThe three teams without a win in the first phase were placed in the same pool.

The other pool included Great Britain (2nd), Māori (4th) and Cook Islands (6th). \nBowl and Plate Semi-Finals \nThe New Zealand - Australia - Samoa phase two pool finished in that order, New Zealand with two wins, Australia one and Samoa nil. \nThe other qualifying pool finished with Māori on top with two wins, and Great Britain and Cook Islands drawing their match. Great Britain, who had a better points difference, as well as two wins to one from the phase one pools, advanced to the semi-final. \nIn the consolation pool, Niue (one win, one draw) led Tokelau (one win) and Tonga (on draw). \nThe Plate and Bowl semi-finals featured Cook Islands, Tokelau, Samoa and Niue.

        "title": "Swimming in the Dark",
        "text": "Swimming in the Dark is a 2020 novel by Polish writer Tomasz Jędrowski. This novel was subject to a \"hotly contested\" six-way publishing auction, from which Bloomsbury gained rights. After being first published in English by Bloomsbury in February, Robert Sudół's translation was released in Poland later in the month. The writer’s debut novel, it is a gay love story set in the closing years of the Polish People's Republic. It received praise for both its quality of writing and compelling story as well as its tactful treatment of its LGBTQ themes. It received at least one starred review from \"Publishers Weekly\", and was later longlist-nominated for the HWA Debut Crown.\nAuthor.\nJędrowski was born in 1985 in the Federal Republic of Germany. Jędrowski writes in English, which he attributed to English not having been \"imposed on me. It's not something that I happened to be born into. It's just something I enjoyed from the very start, and I don't feel like it's my parents speaking through me when I'm writing in English, because we never spoke in English\".\nSynopsis.\n\"Swimming in the Dark\" is a gay love story that takes place in the final years of the Polish People's Republic. The present time of the novel is the early 1980s. Ludwik, has emigrated from Poland to New York City where he follows the political situation in Poland on the news. Written in the first-person, \"Swimming In the Dark\" takes the form of a letter from Ludwik to his former lover in Poland, Janusz, recounting and reflecting on their past relationship.\nSome years before, Ludwik, a recent college graduate, is spending his summer at an agricultural work camp in a rural part of the Polish People’s Republic. There he meets the slightly older Janusz, a working-class student from the countryside who has dedicated himself to the Communist Party as a way out of rural poverty. Ludwik has brought with him a contraband edition of \"Giovanni's Room\" by James Baldwin. Janusz asks Ludwig to lend him the book, and Baldwin's novel creates a shared awareness of their feelings for each other. After the camp closes and the other workers return to Warsaw, the two spend a few weeks camping in an isolated area, and, free from conformist social pressures, their romantic bond intensifies.\nAfter returning to Warsaw, the pair must meet in increasingly furtive and clandestine ways. As the trade-union movement of the day begins to incite more general public protests, Ludwik and Janusz have opposing thoughts and reflexes about whether to support the protests or accommodate themselves to the existing political structures and enjoy the advantages that favoured party members accrue. Janusz is pulled toward a romantic alliance with a young woman with a powerful political father. A gay man from Ludwik's past is arrested and gives Ludwik's name as a homosexual to receive a lenient sentence. Discovered, Ludwik flees Poland.\nBackground and development.\nJędrowski cites \"Giovanni's Room\" by James Baldwin as a major influence in this writing, and Baldwin's novel plays a pivotal role in the novel: when the young protagonist Ludwik lends his copy to a stranger named Janusz, the two begin an intense sexual affair that plays out later in Warsaw in the 1980s during trade union agitation and a government crackdown.\nMany regions of Poland declared themselves LGBT-free zones in 2019, and Polish president Andrzej Duda commented that \"LGBT ideology [is] even more destructive than Communism\". Jędrowski cited as another formative event for him the expulsion of Michel Foucault from Poland in 1958 after being ensnared by the authorities in a gay honey trap. He commented that \"there's a lot of anxiety being channeled into this topic [LGBT rights in Poland], a lot of fear-mongering and propaganda\" but that \"Swimming In the Dark\" is not only about homophobia, against which he writes \"to revive, to resuscitate, the queerness that had been silenced\". The novel is also, he said, \"an homage and celebration of Polish culture, and the beauty of nature there\".\nPublication.\nThe novel was the subject of a six-way auction won by Bloomsbury for the UK and Commonwealth and William Morrow for North America, the latter part of a six-figure contract.\nBloomsbury published the work in English in the UK on February 6, 2020. The Polish publishing house Osnova published a simultaneous Polish translation by Robert Sudół as \"Płynąc w ciemnościach\" later that month on February 26. William Morrow published an English-language edition in North America on April 28 of the same year.\nAdaptations.\nIn 2023, an opera libretto and score is in development, with libretto by Stephen Kitsakos and music by Martin Hennessy. A concert reading featuring four scenes from Act 1 was performed at Indiana University on January 20, 2024 at Auer Hall of the IU Jacobs School of Music.\nReception.\nAuthor Jędrowski's debut novel received positive acclaim upon release. The \"Evening Standard\" summed up the book as \"Elegant, compelling and full of melancholy beauty\". Tim Pfaff, reviewing in the San Francisco \"Bay Area Reporter\", highlighted the author's \"nimble, refined English\" in a novel composed \"without a whiff of sentimentality.\" Pfaff praised Jędrowski for avoiding the cliché of \"a timid gay man's unrequited infatuation for a handsome fellow student.\" He drew attention to Jędrowski's \"mastery of the first-person\" framework, noting that as Ludwik writes to Janusz, the second-person \"you\" startles the reader with \"its fusion of intimacy and the inevitability of their separation.\" \"The Guardian\" described the novel as \"an affecting and unusual romance, with a political undercurrent.\" The reviewer praised Jędrowski’s \"elegant\" prose, which \"evokes the emotional honesty that the lovers first thrive in, and then the grimly repressive machinery\" of the authoritarian state.\n\"Publishers Weekly\" gave the novel a starred review and described it as a \"dazzling debut [that] charts an evocative sexual awakening and coming of age amid political unease in early 1980s Poland\".\nAustralia's \"Sydney Morning Herald\" described the novel as \"grand and gorgeously written, as passionate, as shot through with melancholy as anything by Edmund White or Alan Hollinghurst.\" The reviewer predicted that \"Swimming In the Dark\" was \"bound to become a queer literary classic\" citing \"its rather sweeping political dimension [which] breaks new ground in the genre.\"\nIn June 2020, \"Vogue India\" called the novel \"the year’s best [LGBTQ-themed] debut so far\" and mentioned Jędrowski's \"beautiful\" writing, \"as measured in its tenor as it is evocative in its emotion.\" By the end of the year, \"Attitude\" magazine included the novel on its list of \"20 Best LGBTQ Books of 2020,\" describing Jędrowski's debut as \"one of the most astonishing contemporary gay novels we have ever read . . . Erotic, mesmeric, heartrending and brutal, this book is a masterpiece.\" "

However, the ODI matches were called off due to a COVID-19 outbreak. The ODI series would have formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England team stayed in a bio-secure environment whilst in South Africa, with the matches played in Cape Town and Paarl. In October 2020, Cricket South Africa (CSA) made a plea to its parliament, saying that is of \"critical importance\", while waiting on government approval for the tour to go ahead. On 21 October 2020, both cricket boards agreed to the series, with the full tour itinerary being confirmed.\nEngland won the first two T20I matches to take an unassailable lead in the series. England won the third match by nine wickets to take the series 3–0, with the victory putting England at the top of the ICC T20I Championship.\nThe first ODI match, originally scheduled to be played on 4 December, was cancelled less than an hour before it was due to start, after a South African player tested positive for coronavirus. As a result, the fixture was moved back by two days. However, on 6 December, the rescheduled match was abandoned after two members of the hotel staff tested positive for coronavirus. Shortly after the match was called off, two members of England's touring party returned \"unconfirmed positive tests\" for the virus. Later the same day, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the second ODI, scheduled for 7 December, would not be played on that date. On 7 December, the remainder of the ODI series was postponed. Both cricket boards agreed to work on hosting the ODI series at another time.\nSquads.\nJake Ball, Tom Banton, Tom Helm were also named as reserves for England across both formats. Kagiso Rabada was ruled out of South Africa's ODI squad after picking up a groin injury during the T20I series. South Africa also rested Faf du Plessis, Pite van Biljon, Bjorn Fortuin and Reeza Hendricks for the ODI series.\nPractice matches.\nA South Africa intra-squad warm-up match, due to take place on 21 November, was cancelled after two players tested positive for coronavirus. A second match, scheduled to be played on 23 November, was also cancelled in an attempt to limit the impact of any possible infections. Conversely, England played one 40-over intra-squad match and one 20-over intra-squad match, with Jos Buttler and Eoin Morgan named as the team captains."

The fixtures for the tour were confirmed in January 2021, with three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) and three Women's One Day International (WODI) were played. The WT20I matches took place on the same day as the New Zealand men's fixtures at the same venues.\nOn 27 February 2021, the second WT20I match was moved from Eden Park in Auckland to the Wellington Regional Stadium after Auckland went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining matches were scheduled to be played behind closed doors. However, crowds were allowed to attend the last WT20I after restrictions were relaxed.\nOn 1 March 2021, the final WT20I was also moved from the Bay Oval in Tauranga to the Wellington Regional Stadium, after logistical complications arose from the movement of the men's T20I matches.\nEngland won the first two WODI matches to take an unassailable lead in the series. New Zealand won the third WODI by seven wickets, ending a losing streak of eleven matches, with England winning the series 2–1. England also won the first two WT20I matches, winning the series with a game to spare. Nat Sciver captained England for the first time in international cricket for the third WT20I match, after Heather Knight was ruled out of the fixture due to an injury. England went on to win the match by 32 runs to take the series 3–0.\nSquads.\nIssy Wong also travelled with the England squad, but was not part of the playing squad. New Zealand's Lea Tahuhu was ruled out for the last two WODIs due to a hamstring injury, with Gabby Sullivan named as replacement.

Certain tournaments were given ranking status, with the results at those events contributing to a player's world ranking. The events that made up the 1976–77 snooker season were the first to use ranking points, awarding points from earlier seasons. Originally, the world rankings were decided based only on results in the World Snooker Championship, but other events were later added. The system used for the 2020–21 snooker season was first used in the 2010–11 season, where players were awarded ranking points based entirely on prize money won from these events. The rankings are based on the prior two seasons, with ten revisions after specific tournaments throughout the season. These revisions are used as official rankings, with points awarded in the current season overwriting those from two years prior.\nJudd Trump began the season as the world number one and retained the position throughout, as he won five ranking events. Trump began the season with a lead of over 500,000 points, ahead of 2020 World Snooker Championship winner Ronnie O'Sullivan in second, and finished the season in first, above 2021 World Snooker Championship winner Mark Selby by 124,000 points.\nRanking list.\nRevision dates.\nSeedings for each event were based on the world rankings, with totals being updated at specific revision dates. On these dates, ranking points from the 2018–19 snooker season were removed from a player's total.\nSeeding list.\nThe following table contains the rankings which were used to determine the seedings for following tournaments. Other provisional and unofficial rankings are produced after each ranking event which are not noted here. Blank fields indicate that the player was not active on the tour, or had no ranking.

        "text": "The 2020 European Rugby Champions Cup Final was the final match in the 2019–20 European Rugby Champions Cup, and the twenty-fifth European club rugby final in general. The final was held between first-time finalists Exeter Chiefs, and two-time runners-up Racing 92. Originally due to take place at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille on 23 May, it was rescheduled to Ashton Gate in Bristol on 17 October due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground.\nBoth Exeter and Racing entered into the 2020 final with significantly little championship pedigree compared to the finalists of the previous year's final, Saracens and Leinster, as neither team had yet won the tournament. Racing had appeared in two previous finals in 2016 and 2018, losing to Saracens and Leinster respectively, while Exeter hadn't previously reached the semi-finals. Exeter entered the final undefeated with a 31–31 away draw to Glasgow Warriors while Racing also had a 21–21 away draw with Munster but also with a 27–24 away loss to Saracens.\nExeter and Racing had never met in European competitions prior to the 2020 final.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nMatch.\nSummary.\nDrawn into pools 2 and 4 respectively, Exeter and Racing both finished at the top of their pool. Exeter finished on 27 points, winning five matches and drawing away to Glasgow Warriors. Racing finished on 23 points, winning four matches, drawing away to Munster and suffering defeat away to Saracens in their final pool match. Exeter qualified with a No. 2 seed for the knockout stage, while Racing captured the No. 5 seed. In the knockout stage, Exeter defeated No. 7 Northampton Saints (home) and No. 3 Toulouse (home), while Racing 92 defeated No. 4 Clermont (away) and No. 8 Saracens (home) en route to the final.\nIn the match, Exeter raced out to a 14–0 lead with tries by Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds in the 8th and 16th minutes respectively, with Joe Simmonds successful on both conversions. Four minutes later, Racing got on the board via Simon Zebo, but the conversion was not successful. Racing's Juan Imhoff scored another try in the 32nd minute, with Finn Russell making the conversion. Exeter responded in the final minute of the half with a try scored by Harry Williams and a conversion by Joe Simmonds, making the halftime score 21–12 in favour of Exeter.\nThe second half began quickly, as Racing's Simon Zebo found the try zone in three minutes and Exeter's Henry Slade did the same two minutes later. In the 50th minute, Camille Chat narrowed Exeter's lead to one score with a try, and Maxime Machenaud's subsequent conversion narrowed the score to 28–24. Machenaud made it a one-point contest in the 65th minute by scoring Racing's only penalty of the game. The next 15 minutes were the longest scoring drought of the match, as it remained 28–27 until the game's final moments. During this time however, tensions arose when Exeter's Tomas Francis was sin binned by referee Nigel Owens for a deliberate knock-on within their own 22, however a penalty of their own for not releasing permanently put them out of danger. Joe Simmonds's stoppage time penalty goal then all but ensured an Exeter victory, by the score of 31–27.\nWith the victory, Exeter Chiefs won their first European Champions Cup title, while Racing 92 fell in their third final in the last five years.\nDetails.\nTouch judges:\nMike Adamson (SRU)\nCraig Evans (WRU)\nTelevision Match Official:\nIan Davies (WRU)"

Due to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Switzerland there was no defending champion as the previous season's playoffs were cancelled.\nDue to the 2019–20 league qualification series also being cancelled, the participating teams remained the same as the previous season.\nThe league announced changes to the format ahead of the season, meaning that 52 games rather than 50 would be played in the regular season. The playoffs would also be re-formatted, so that the top 6 teams now qualified directly for the quarter-finals, with the next four teams playing in pre-playoffs for the remaining two spots. There would also be no relegation from the season. The two pre-playoffs series were played in a best-of-three, the quarter-finals in a best-of-seven and the semi-finals and final in a best-of-five. The series were shortened to allow enough time for the national team to prepare for the 2021 IIHF World Championship.\nEV Zug won the regular season with 6 games remaining, having already clinched their club record points total, surpassing their previous best of 98 points from the 2011–12 season. With two games remaining EV Zug broke the record for most points in a single regular season, held by HC Davos from the 2010–11 season. Whilst this season was the first to be 52 games in length, EV Zug passed the milestone in the same number of games as the previous record holders.\nEV Zug swept Genève-Servette HC 3-0 in the final to win its first NL title since 1998.\nRegular season.\nDue to coronavirus cases in both EHC Biel and SC Bern forcing late season stoppages to training, not all regular season games could be completed, and the league would use points per game to determine the final regular season standings.\nPlayer statistics.\nScoring leaders.\nThe following players led the league in points, at the conclusion of the regular season. If two or more skaters were tied (i.e. same number of points, goals and played games), all of the tied skaters were shown.\nLeading goaltenders.\nThe following goaltenders led the league in goals against average, provided that they have played at least 40% of their team's minutes, at the conclusion of the regular season."

The colours serve, as heraldry in its earliest form on the battlefield, as a \"recognition device\" to enable spectators to identify and differentiate racing horses at a distance.\nThe display of racing colours in England is strictly regulated by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) (formerly by the Jockey Club) by whom all colours must be approved and officially registered. Since regulations made in 1970, permissible designs are limited in scope, style and to 18 standard colours (before 2017), and also take account of international agreements between various international controlling bodies of horse racing, counterparts to the BHA, for example the French France Galop (formerly the \"Société d’Encouragement des Races des Chevaux\", founded in 1833). However old colours registered before 1970 are exempt from the restrictive design regulations, including for example the royal colours incorporating gold braid, which date back to Edward VII.\nThe term \"silks\" is used in the United States to refer to racing colours. Racing colours comprise three elements: jacket, sleeves and cap, the colours of which being stated in that order (as a blazon for a coat of arms) define the \"racing colours\".\nOwnership.\nRacing colours are not heritable as is heraldry, the design and form of which descends via the male line automatically on death of the holder. Racing colours may be acquired by application to the Jockey Club on their \"Racing Colours application form\".\nHistory.\nThe practice of riders wearing colours probably stems from medieval times when jousts were held between knights. However, the origins of racing colours of various patterns may have been influenced by racing held in Italian city communities since medieval times. Such traditional events are still held on town streets and are known for furious riding and the colourful spectacle they offer, for example the Palio di Siena.\nThe wearing of colours or silks originated in England and was first mentioned in 1515, probably being an extension of the owner's livery colours, i.e. as displayed on the costume of his domestic servants. The system was formalised and regulated in the 1700s by the Jockey Club (founded at Newmarket circa 1750), a century and a half after horse-racing in its current form became established during the reign of King James I in the environs of Newmarket in Suffolk. In 1762 the second order made by the Jockey Club stipulated that the riders must wear the colours of their patrons \"for the greater conveniency of distinguishing the horses in running, as also for the prevention of disputes\".\nPrior to 2017 a rule specified that only 18 standard colours were allowed.\nDesigns.\nDesigns in racing colours may be compared to simple heraldic designs incorporating \"heraldic ordinaries\", for example the bend, chevron, fess, etc., which appear in racing colours in the form of stripes, braces, hoops, etc. Other heraldic designs are reflected in racing colours as follows: bend sinister (sash); saltire (cross belts); chequy (check); roundels (spots); mullets (stars); per pale (halved); quarterly (quartered); per saltire (diabolo); lozenges (diamonds); paly (striped); barry (hooped); fess dancetty (chevron hoop).\nThe design was at first shown only on the front of the jockey's coat, but must now be shown on the back also, which interferes with some heraldic comparisons, for example the sash as it appears on the front, in heraldry a \"bend-sinister\", when worn on the back as a mirror-image becomes a mere heraldic \"bend\" (i.e. dexter, the usual positioning). However the beasts, birds, flowers, and monsters so common in heraldry are entirely absent.\nIn comparison to the heraldic achievement, the jacket is comparable with the shield, the central element of the achievement, with the sleeves being comparable to flaunches, and the cap \"as a counter-part to the simple forms of very early crests\". In a few rare occurrences the racing colours are identical to the family's coat of arms, for example Viscount Portman, whose arms are \"Or, a fleur-de-lys azure\".\nMethod of wearing.\nSilks are worn over helmets (or skull-caps), safety vests and \"skivvies\", the latter being a lightweight mesh or microfibre bodysuit, sleeved or sleeveless, whereas, for track work, a more heavy-duty version may be worn."

        "title": "2021 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 2021 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 105th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge for sponsorship reasons) was a 500-mile (800 km, 200 lap) race in the 2021 IndyCar Series, held on May 30, 2021, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. The month of May activities formally began on May 15 with the GMR Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice for the Indianapolis 500 began on May 18, and time trials were held May 22–23. Carb Day, the traditional final day of practice, took place on May 28.\nOn April 21, 2021, the track management announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event would be held with a limit of 135,000 spectators, approximately 40% capacity. The previous year's race was postponed from May 24 to August 23, then ultimately held without spectators, as was the GMR Grand Prix (which was moved to July 4). The Intercontinental GT Challenge meeting in October 2020, which included the twin road course races for INDYCAR, carried a 10,000 spectator limit, with spectators restricted to grandstands in what are normally Turn 4 and Turn 1 on the oval (Turns 1-4 and Turns 12-14 on the road course).\nScott Dixon, the winner in 2008, won the pole position, and was a heavy favorite to win. Dixon, however, ran out of fuel during the first sequence of pit stops, as a result of a caution coming out, closing the pits and trapping him out on the track. He had to make a stop for emergency service, but the crew could not refire the stalled engine before he fell a lap down, and essentially out of contention. Two-time winner Takuma Sato (2017, 2020) was the defending champion, and led as late as lap 193, but he was off-sequence with the other leaders. Sato had to pit for fuel with seven laps to go, and finished 14th.\nThree-time winner (2001, 2002, 2009), and four-time pole winner (2003, 2007, 2009, 2010) Hélio Castroneves took the lead for the final time on lap 199, and won his record-tying fourth Indianapolis 500 after dueling with second-year driver Álex Palou for most of the final 80 laps. The race set a new record for the fastest running of the Indianapolis 500, with an average speed at , as well as a new record for most cars running at the finish (30). Castroneves joined Hall of Fame drivers A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears as four-time winners. After the race, Castroneves celebrated his victory by climbing the catch fence, his signature celebration, which had earned him the nickname \"Spider-Man\" early in his career. The race was also the first IndyCar Series victory for Meyer Shank Racing.\nRace background.\nSponsorship.\nOn January 31, 2019, it was announced that the online financial services company Gainbridge would become the new presenting sponsor of the 500 under a four-year deal. This will be the third year under the current deal.\n2021 IndyCar Series.\nThe 2021 Indianapolis 500 was the sixth race of the 2021 NTT IndyCar Series season. Five different drivers won the first five races of the season, including three first-time winners. Álex Palou won the season opener at Birmingham, his first career IndyCar Series win. The following week, Colton Herta won at St. Petersburg. A doubleheader weekend at Texas saw Scott Dixon and first-time victor Pato O'Ward as race winners. The GMR Grand Prix kicked off the month of May at Indianapolis on May 15, won by Rinus VeeKay, the third first-time winner of the season. Scott Dixon entered the Indianapolis 500 as the series points leader. For the first time since 2013, Team Penske failed to win a race prior to the Indy 500.\nRace schedules.\nThe 2021 IndyCar Series schedule was announced on October 1, 2020. The Indianapolis 500 returned to its traditional Memorial Day weekend date after being delayed to August 23 in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was scheduled for Sunday, May 30, the 54th time the race has been held on May 30. From 1911 to 1970, the race was scheduled for May 30 regardless of the day of the week, as Memorial Day at the time was a fixed-date holiday. During that period, if May 30 fell on a Sunday, the race was scheduled for Monday, May 31. Since 1974, the race has traditionally been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.\nPractice, time trials, and other ancillary events were scheduled for the two weeks leading up to the race. The Freedom 100, however, was not held as the 2021 Indy Lights season only included a race on the road course during GMR Grand Prix weekend.\nThe GMR Grand Prix returned to the month of May, again serving as the opening weekend of track activity. The Road to Indy held doubleheader races on both Friday and Saturday, while IndyCar held practice and qualifying on Friday, and their race on Saturday. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IndyCar event was moved to July 4 (as part of the NASCAR weekend), the Road to Indy events were moved to September, and a second IndyCar road course event (Harvest GP) was held in October as part of the Intercontinental GT weekend. The 2020 GMR Grand Prix was held without spectators, while the October Harvest GP races were held with a maximum of 10,000 spectators.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the 2021 Indianapolis 500 was released on May 12, 2021. Thirty-five entries appeared on the list, including nine former race winners and three rookies. With thirty-five entries, bumping returned for the first time since 2019. An expected 36th entry for driver Cody Ware set to drive for Dale Coyne Racing with Rick Ware Racing was withdrawn shortly before the entry list was released due to lack of sponsorship. All entries utilized the Dallara DW12 chassis with the Universal Aero Kit 18, with Firestone tires. The nine former Indy 500 winners making the field the most since there were ten in 1992.\nTesting and Rookie Orientation.\nOctober 2020.\nAn offseason test was scheduled at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the last week of October after the conclusion of the 2020 season. On Wednesday, October 28, Takuma Sato (Rahal) and Josef Newgarden (Penske) conducted test runs utilizing new aerodynamic pieces and configurations. Rain delayed the start of the session from 11 a.m. to approximately 12:30 p.m. Rookie Scott McLaughlin (Penske) completed the mandatory Rookie Orientation during the afternoon.\nTrack activity for Thursday, October 29 was rescheduled to Friday, October 30 due to a poor weather forecast.\nOn Friday, October 30, Sato and Newgarden were joined by Ryan Hunter-Reay (Andretti), Ed Carpenter (ECR), Pato O’Ward (Arrow McLaren SP), and Scott Dixon (Ganassi). The six-car session primarily focused on evaluation of new aerodynamic configurations in traffic. Cool temperatures delayed the start of track activity until approximately 12:15 p.m. No incidents were reported.\nEngine hybridization test.\nA special oval test was held on Friday, March 26 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It was originally planned for earlier in the week, but poor weather pushed it to Friday. The series oversaw test runs to attempt to replicate the effects of racing with KERS, which will be part of the new hybrid engine package scheduled to debut in 2023. Four entries, two Chevrolet and two Honda, took laps in choreographed sessions. The KERS simulation was implemented utilizing the existing Push-to-pass system. The drivers and teams involved were Scott Dixon (Ganassi), Josef Newgarden (Penske), Alexander Rossi (Andretti), and Pato O’Ward (Arrow McLaren SP).\nNo incidents were reported. Following the test, reactions from the drivers were mixed to negative. The horsepower increases were in the range of 50–60 HP, resulting in straight-line speed increases of 5–7 mph.\nTime Trials.\nBump Day/Pole Day — Sunday, May 23.\nLast Chance Qualifying.\nLast Chance Qualifying began at 1:15 p.m. The format was expanded to a 75-minute session, with each participant having one guaranteed attempt. Previously, the Last Row Shootout session was limited to only one attempt per car. Entries were now allowed to make additional attempts, time-permitting, but were required to withdraw their previous time to do so. In addition, cars that had completed an attempt would have the time voided if they performed any subsequent work on the car before time ran out in the session. If any adjustments were made, or if any engine cooling efforts were performed, the car was automatically withdrawn and was required to make a new attempt.\nSage Karam was the fastest of those in the Last Row Shootout, turning a four-lap average at , to secure 31st starting position. Despite brushing the wall in turn two on his final lap, Will Power was second fastest, taking 32nd. Simona de Silvestro was third fastest, giving her the final starting position (33rd) for the race. Charlie Kimball and R. C. Enerson were 4th-fastest and 5th-fastest, respectively. Despite multiple attempts each, Kimball and Enerson failed to qualify.\nFast Nine Qualifying.\nScott Dixon won his fourth Indianapolis 500 pole position with a four-lap average of and a fastest single lap of . It was Dixon's first IndyCar pole position since the 2017 race. Colton Herta qualified second at , only 0.0197 seconds slower than Dixon. Rinus VeeKay improved from his fifth-placed result in Saturday qualifying to take the outside of the front row, running at . VeeKay was also the highest qualified Chevrolet-powered entry in the field.\nFollowing the conclusion of qualifications, a two-hour practice session was held.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace report.\nFirst half.\nEd Carpenter Racing teammates Conor Daly and Rinus VeeKay dominated the first half of the race. The race began with Scott Dixon pulling into the lead, but by the end of the first lap, Colton Herta had overtaken him. On lap 2, VeeKay moved into the lead and kept it for 29 laps. The lead cars remained in roughly the same order until the first round of pit stops began around lap 31. Ed Carpenter lost significant time when his car fell off its air-jacks and then stalled, dropping him down the order. In the midst of this pit sequence, Stefan Wilson lost his control of his car and wrecked entering pit lane, triggering the race's first caution period. The timing of the caution period caused several participants to make emergency service stops. The worst affected were pre-race favorites Dixon and Alexander Rossi, who both ran out of fuel entering pit lane. Both drivers fell off the lead lap trying to get the cars refired as a consequence. Due to the number of cars taking penalties for stopping for emergency service, the caution period lasted 11 laps while IndyCar officials determined the running order.\nRacing resumed at lap 46, with Herta, VeeKay, and Daly as the top 3. After a few laps of racing, VeeKay moved into the lead briefly before being passed by his teammate Daly. Hélio Castroneves ran fourth. The next round of pit stops began at roughly lap 68, with no major incident. Daly and VeeKay retained their lead positions, while Patricio O'Ward moved into third. A slower stop dropped Castroneves to seventh. At the halfway mark of the race, the running order was Daly, VeeKay, O'Ward, Ryan Hunter-Reay, and Herta.\nSecond half.\nAnother round of pit stops came around lap 103. Differing fuel strategies meant that several drivers extended farther, going as far as lap 118. Graham Rahal pitted at lap 118 from the lead, but was released without the left rear tire secured. As Rahal exited the pits, the tire came off of the car and sent Rahal spinning into the turn 2 wall, triggering the race's second caution period. As cars scrambled to avoid the debris from Rahal's wrecked car, Conor Daly struck the loose tire, damaging his front wing. The team elected not to repair the damage, but Daly never reclaimed the lead for the remainder of the race. After a reshuffling of positions from pit stops and the caution, Álex Palou now held the lead ahead of Hélio Castroneves, Patricio O'Ward, and Rinus VeeKay.\nRacing resumed at lap 125, with the top 3 drivers exchanging the lead for several laps before settling back into their original order. More pit stops came at roughly lap 144, with the lead cars avoiding incident. Further back, Will Power spun his car trying to slow down for pit entry, causing him to fall off the lead lap. The running order remained Palou, Castroneves, and O'Ward, with Ryan Hunter-Reay moving up to fourth.\nThe final round of pit stops came at around lap 170. Castroneves came out ahead of Palou initially, but was quickly passed on track. Hunter-Reay's top-5 run came to an end after failing to slow in time for pit entry, resulting in a penalty. Further back, Simona de Silvestro spun and damaged her car entering pit lane, forcing her to retire from the race.\nFinish.\nWhile the leaders had pitted for the final time, Felix Rosenqvist and Takuma Sato stayed out, hoping to get another caution period and allow them to reach the end of the race without making another pit stop. The caution never came, and both drivers were forced to pit for fuel after lap 190. This left Palou and Castroneves with the lead positions in the closing stages of the race. With two laps remaining, Castroneves overtook Palou to take the lead. Despite encountering a large pack of backmarkers on the final lap, Castroneves held off Palou to take victory. For Castroneves, it was his fourth Indianapolis 500 victory, equaling the record for most victories set by A. J. Foyt, Al Unser, and Rick Mears. He also became the fourth driver aged 46 or older to win the race. The 12-year gap between Castroneves' fourth win and his third win in 2009 is the second-longest gap between victories in Indianapolis 500 history, only after Juan Pablo Montoya's 15-year gap between victories in 2000 and 2015. It was also the first ever IndyCar race victory for the Meyer Shank Racing team. For his victory, Castroneves received $1,828,305 from a total purse of $8,854,565. Palou, the second-place finisher, took over the series points lead with his result. Simon Pagenaud took third position after climbing from a 26th place starting position. Patricio O'Ward and Ed Carpenter rounded out the top 5. Scott McLaughlin was the higher finishing of the two rookies in the race despite a pit lane penalty, netting him Rookie of the Year honors.\nWith an average speed of , the 2021 race set a new record for the fastest running of the Indianapolis 500, eclipsing the mark set in the 2013 race by over 3 mph. The race was noted for its competitive parity, with 361 overtakes made, including 35 for the lead between 13 different drivers. The race further set a record for most competitors still running at the finish, with 30 of the initial 33 starters still circulating.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from time trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised on NBC in the United States. The coverage began at 11:00 a.m. EDT. On May 28, it was announced that the race was not blacked out in the Indianapolis area for the fifth time in race history, airing live on WTHR (Channel 13), as all tickets had been sold out and reached 40 percent of venue capacity. This event hosted 135,000 fans on the circuit.\nMike Tirico and Danica Patrick returned for pre and post-race coverage, as they had done the previous two years. Patrick also drove the pace car during pre-race festivities. Jac Collinsworth made his Indy 500 debut as the Prerace Host on NBCSN. Dale Earnhardt Jr. returned for pre-race coverage after being absent for the 2020 event as a result of rescheduling (Earnhardt and Letarte were covering the Drydene Twin 500km at Dover International Speedway on the rescheduled weekend).\nOn May 4, Jimmie Johnson was announced as part of the broadcast team as part of the \"Peacock Pit Box\" crew alongside Steve Letarte.\nThe 2021 race was the final \"500\" for Robin Miller, who had covered the event for roughly fifty years at \"The Indianapolis Star\", Racer, and on television through ESPN, Speed, and NBC. Miller died of leukemia on August 25, 2021.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried by the IndyCar Radio Network. The chief announcer or \"Voice of the 500\" for the sixth consecutive year was Mark Jaynes with Davey Hamilton as driver analyst. Recently retired Donald Davidson returned to the booth in a live capacity for the first time since 2019 as in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic all of his appearances were taped. This year marked the debut of Alex Wollf as an on-air pit reporter. It also marked the debut of Scott Sander as a pit reporter.\n1070 The Fan broadcast weeknights with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\". Speedway historian Donald Davidson retired at the end of 2020, and his longtime program \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\" was no longer aired. In its place, a new Indianapolis 500 themed program title \"Beyond The Bricks\" was hosted by Jake Query (an IndyCar Radio Network veteran) and former WIBC personality Mike Thomson.\nThe 2021 race was the final \"500\" for Bob Jenkins, the former radio, television, and public address announcer, and emcee. Jenkins died August 9, 2021, from brain cancer. Jenkins had worked as a reporter/broadcaster at the race every year from 1979 to 2020, and had attended the race nearly every since 1960. Due to his condition, he attended the 2021 race only as a spectator, and sat for only brief pre-recorded pieces for the radio broadcast."

        "title": "Sunrisers (women's cricket)",
        "text": "Sunrisers are a women's cricket team that represent the London and East region, one of eight regional hubs in English domestic women's cricket. They play their home matches at various grounds, including the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. They are captained by Grace Scrivens in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy and Dane van Niekerk in the Charlotte Edwards Cup, and are coached by Andy Tennant. The team is partnered with Middlesex, Essex, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, as well as Marylebone Cricket Club.\nHistory.\nIn 2020, women's cricket in England was restructured, creating eight new 'regional hub' teams, with the intention of playing both 50-over and 20-over cricket. Sunrisers were one of the sides created under this structure, representing the London and East region, Middlesex, Essex, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, as well as Marylebone Cricket Club. The side was to be captained by Amara Carr and coached by Trevor Griffin. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was truncated, and only 50-over cricket was played, in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy. Sunrisers finished bottom of the South Group in the competition, losing all six of their matches. At the end of the season, five Sunrisers players were given full-time domestic contracts, the first of their kind in England: Amara Carr, Naomi Dattani, Cordelia Griffith, Jo Gardner and Kelly Castle.\nThe following season, 2021, Sunrisers competed in both the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy and the newly-formed Twenty20 competition, the Charlotte Edwards Cup. The side again lost all of their matches in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, finishing bottom of the eight-team group. For the Charlotte Edwards Cup, Kelly Castle was named as captain of the side. In the first match of the tournament, Sunrisers recorded their first ever victory, beating Western Storm by 7 wickets. However, they did not win another match in the tournament and finished bottom of their group, although they did tie their home match against North West Thunder.\nAhead of the 2022 season, it was announced that Castle was becoming captain of the side in all formats, and that Trevor Griffin was stepping down as Head Coach for personal reasons. Griffin was later replaced by Laura Marsh, taking on the Head Coach role on an interim basis for the 2022 season. The side finished bottom of their Charlotte Edwards Cup group, losing all six of their matches. The side also finished bottom of the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy group, losing all of their completed matches. Sunrisers all-rounder Grace Scrivens was the joint-leading wicket-taker in the competition, with 13 wickets, and the third-highest run-scorer, with 297 runs. At the end of the season, it was announced that Andy Tennant had been appointed as the permanent Head Coach of the side.\nIn June 2023, it was announced that Kelly Castle had stepped down as captain of the side, being replaced by overseas player Dane van Niekerk. After van Niekerk's spell with the side ended in September 2023, Grace Scrivens took over the captaincy. That season, the side finished bottom of the group in the Charlotte Edwards Cup, but won their first matches in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, including a late season winning run to finish fourth in the table. Ahead of the 2024 season, Scrivens was confirmed as captain in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, with van Niekerk captaining in the Charlotte Edwards Cup.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nAs per 2024 season.\nAcademy.\nThe Sunrisers Academy team plays against other regional academies in friendly and festival matches across various formats. The Academy selects players from across the Sunrisers regional hub, and includes some players who are also in the first team squad. Players in the 2024 Academy are listed below:\nCoaching staff.\n\"As of the 2023 season.\""

        "text": "Interplay Sports Baseball Edition 2000 is a baseball video game developed and published by Interplay Entertainment for PlayStation (as Interplay Sports Baseball 2000) and Microsoft Windows in 1999. This is the first game released after the developer changed its name from VR Sports to Interplay Sports.\nGameplay.\nThe game uses motion capture of the baseball players, including their stretches. The bottom of the screen has statistics from 1998 baseball games in a format similar to real television. The gameplay is similar to \"VR Baseball '99\", but with an improvement to the 3D graphics. People have an option to design their players. The modes are exhibition, season, tournament, playoffs, and home run derby. Players can be traded and team lineups can be changed. The voice of the announcer, the audience, and sound effects are presented in Dolby surround sound. The pitch speeds are slow, medium, or fast. Mike Carlucci voices the announcer and he had the same role in the video game \"MLB 2000\". The game used one public-address announcer during a time that its competitors were switching to two commentators as featured on real baseball game broadcasts.\nReception.\nThe game received mixed reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\nRyan MacDonald of \"GameSpot\" said of the PlayStation release, \"Baseball 2000 feels, plays, and looks just the way its name sounds: generic. The game fails to offer anything innovative in any category.\" \"Game Informer\", in a review of said console version, said, \"The stadiums and player models are fairly decent, but we couldn't help but be frustrated and disappointed with the game as a whole.\" Air Hendrix of \"GamePro\" said that the \"sim-style action\" of the same console version \"makes for the kind of ballpark that could appeal to hardcore baseball fans looking for a realistic game, especially if Triple Play 2000's glamorous homerfest turned you off and MLB 2000 didn't strike your fancy. However, this diamond's definitely still in the rough, and many gamers won't be patient enough to tolerate its shortcomings. Rent it before you shell out for a full-price admission.\"\nMichael E. Ryan of \"GameSpot\" said of the PC release, \"Of all the baseball games on the market, Interplay's VR Baseball series has consistently been one of the most promising and most disappointing.\" \"AllGame\" said that the PC version's visuals are \"stunning\", but that it is \"simply a bad game\". \"PC Gamer\" wrote, \"Easily the worst of this year's crop of baseball games.\" Joel Strauch of \"GamePro\" said that the same PC version featured \"a lot of creative extras, including a tournament mode in which players can draft their own all-star team and create a player to see how your guy stacks up against the pro--both in games and in the leader board in the Home Run Derby. But, then again, these extras--and the realistically reproduced players and stadiums--can't keep \"Baseball Edition 2000\" from being more than a minor league hit.\""

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Huskies represent Washington State University in the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference.\nWashington State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1901. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Washington's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Dragons represent Drexel University in the NCAA Division I Coastal Athletic Association.\nDrexel began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1894. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Drexel's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 1923–24 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 29th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nYale's season began much like any other, with the exception of their captain sidelined due to an injured ankle. Even with their best defender missing, the team was able to score enough to outlast the St. Nicholas Hockey Club and open with a win. After a mid-week loss to the New Haven Bears, who had swiftly become one of the top amateur clubs in the country, Yale played host to McGill and the backup netminder Ives earned a hard-fought shutout due to Jenkin's illness.\nThe victory over the Canadian team propelled Yale into their winter break and the team headed first to Cleveland. They played fairly even hockey with the local All-Stars and Athletic Club but the team began to hit its stride when it went to Lake Placid. Over a four-day span Yale played four other college teams and won every match. The team didn't score many goals, but the defense and goaltending was superb, limiting their opponents to 2 goals in the 4 games. Yale kept rolling when they returned home, defeating and then tying two more Canadian colleges to run their record to an impressive 8–2–1 as they entered their conference schedule.\nThey met Princeton on 12 January and the two teams looked to be the match of each other. Yale would go ahead twice, only for the Tigers to even the score both times and end regulation tied 2–2. The teams agreed to play two 5-minute overtime sessions and just 23 seconds into the first one Thomas Sargent scored to give Yale its third lead of the game. Princeton again tied the score before the frame had ended and after a mad dash for the net, Sargent scored his second overtime goal of the game. Yale held the Tigers back for the final three minutes and the team earned an impressive victory.\nAfter losing to the New Haven Bears yet again, the Elis ran roughshod over their opponents for several weeks. Yale dominated both Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Agricultural College, outscoring the two 18–1. The only goal scored resulted from a bad bounce off of Farnsworth's skate and, in response, Jenkins refused to allow another for four games. The streak included wins over both Dartmouth and Harvard and gave Yale an inside track for the Eastern Collegiate Championship. With everything going their way, Yale was nearly toppled by Cornell. The Bulldogs scored twice in the first and appeared to relax, not taking their opponents seriously, which almost cost them the game. The Reds scored twice in the second but were still behind due to a third score from the Elis. The undermanned Cornell squad didn't use a single substitution in the game but they still skated rings around the Bulldogs. Yale's fourth goal proved too much for Cornell to overcome and the Elis escaped with a win.\nIn their next game Yale had apparently not learned its lesson and the team failed to score a single goal, losing 0–1 to Princeton after the Tigers scored with just 45 seconds remaining in the second extra session. Yale would have a third game with Princeton to decide the season series, but first they had to face Harvard. The Crimson may have been eager to repay Yale for the 3–0 loss earlier in the season but the Bulldogs were the stronger squad and send Harvard packing after a 6–1 victory. The win caped the first series win over their arch rivals in seven years and made this season the first since 1908 that Yale had not been defeated by Harvard (excluding the war year when Harvard did not field a team).\nIn their final game of the season, Yale could capture both the league championship and the Eastern Collegiate title with a win and they played hard defensive match against Princeton. Yale took a lead after one period but the Tigers tied the game less than a minute into the middle frame. With both goaltenders playing tremendously, it looked like the contest may be another overtime classic, however, a hard shot from O'Hearn with just over five minutes remaining put Yale ahead and the team formed a defensive shell around their net, preventing the Tigers from tying the score and Yale earned their first Championship in over fifteen years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cougars represent the College of Charleston in the NCAA Division I Coastal Athletic Association.\nCharleston began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Charleston's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "2020 Challenge Cup final",
        "text": "The 2020 Challenge Cup Final was the 119th final of rugby league's Challenge Cup knock-out competition. The culmination of the 2020 Challenge Cup was originally scheduled for 22 August, but was postponed due to safety concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic along with most of the latter stages of competition. The final was rescheduled to be played on 17 October 2020 with kick-off at 15:00 (BST). The final was contested by the winners of the tournament semi-finals, Leeds Rhinos playing Salford Red Devils (who were appearing in their first cup final since 1969).\nSince the 1928–29 season, Challenge Cup finals have been played at Wembley Stadium, London (except the 1932 season and the Second World War period), but due to the COVID-19 pandemic there was discussion about moving the 2020 final away from Wembley. It was not until 22 September that the Rugby Football League (RFL) confirmed that the game would still be played at Wembley Stadium.\nNew COVID-19 restrictions announced in September forced the RFL to announce on 28 September, that the game would be played behind closed doors for the first time in the history of the competition. \nFollowing the semi-finals fans raised a petition calling on the government to allow season ticket holders of the two clubs to attend the game in person, on the basis that the number of spectators this would allow could easily maintain social-distancing inside the 90,000 seat venue. The RFL issued a statement saying that they continued to lobby the government to allow spectators in.\nBackground.\nLeeds Rhinos are the tournament's second most successful side, winning 13 Challenge Cup trophies. The 2020 final would be their ninth cup final of the Super League era, which included their last victory in the competition during their treble winning season of 2015. By contrast, Salford Red Devils had only won the competition once, in 1938. It would be Salford's first final since 1969 when they lost 6–11 to Castleford in the 1969 final. The match would also be the first time these two clubs had met in the final of the Challenge Cup.\nRoute to the final.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nLeeds Rhinos were due to face Hull KR in their opening sixth round tie in the Challenge Cup. The match, originally scheduled for early April, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled for late August. However, due to Championship, League 1 clubs and Toronto Wolfpack withdrawing from the competition, the restructuring of the competition gave several teams, including Leeds, a bye to the quarter finals. The quarter final draw saw the Rhinos drawn against Hull Kingston Rovers (their originally scheduled opponents for the sixth round). Leeds won the game comfortably 48–18. The win against the Rovers saw the two most successful teams in the history of the Challenge Cup drawn against each other as Leeds (the second most successful side) played Wigan Warriors (the most successful team). Leeds dominated the first half of the game and, despite the Warriors attempted comeback in the second half, the Rhinos progressed with a comfortable 26–12 victory.\nSalford Red Devils.\nSalford Red Devils's sixth round opener was due to be against the previous season's champions St Helens, to whom they were runners-up in the Grand Final. However, like all Round 6 ties, it was postponed and eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Salford was another of the teams to receive a bye to the quarter finals where they were drawn against French side Catalans Dragons. The game, after an 18-all draw at full time, saw a try from Dan Sarginson give the Red Devils victory. A semi-final against Warrington Wolves was the final step before Wembley. After trailing 8–14 at half time, Salford came out victorious with a 24–22 win over Warrington.\nPre-match.\nBritish classical singer Lizzie Jones sung The National Anthem at Wembley before the game. Instead of singing \"Abide with Me\" at Wembley, she recorded a special version of the hymn above Castle Hill in Huddersfield, the birthplace of Rugby League, to celebrate 125 years of the sport. This would be Jones's second Challenge Cup Final appearance after previously performing at the 2015 Final.\nFormer Leeds Rhinos scrum-half Rob Burrow was given the honour of Chief Guest of the final. Whilst choosing to be absent from Wembley due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Burrow was awarded the honour following his diagnosis of motor neuron disease in December 2019, in recognition of his charity work and fundraising for research into a cure, in addition to a 16-year career with the Rhinos from 2001 to 2017, ending in the 2017 Super League Grand Final, winning his eighth Grand Final with Leeds. The BBC aired a documentary \"Rob Burrow: My Year with MND\" the Tuesday night before the final on BBC Two. The programme documented Burrow's personal and family struggle with the disease and the charity work he and his family underwent to raise awareness of the diseases and money for its cure. The documentary was aired again on BBC One prior to their coverage of the final.\nPost match.\nThe 2020 Final saw Leeds Rhinos lift their fourteenth cup title, their first in five years following their treble winning season in 2015. Tom Briscoe's 14th minute try saw him break the record for most tries scored in the Challenge Cup Final, with seven, after scoring once in 2014 and a further five times in 2015, both years seeing The Rhinos come out as winners.\nAfter the final it was confirmed that over two million people had watch the \"Rob Burrow: My Year with MND\" documentary and over £50,000 had been raised for his charity - Motor Neurone Disease Association.\nTV viewing of the final increased 50% from the previous year with over six million watching the competition, making it the most viewed final since 2012."

        "text": "Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing () is a 2020 animated Russian folklore spin-off film written by Vadim Sveshnikov, Maxim Sveshnikov, Alexsandr Boyarskiy and directed by Darina Schmidt and Konstantin Feoktistov. The writers and producers of \"The Three Bogatyrs\" resumed production in the tenth film of the Russian animated saga. Veteran producers for the series as well as CTB Film Company, Sergey Selyanov and Alexander Boyarsky resumed production for the film. \"Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing\" is the sequel to \"Three Heroes and The Heiress to the Throne (2018)\" and is dedicated to the feats of the character Bogatyr horse Julius.\nAlyosha Popvich and his horse Julius have been folk heroes ever since they have defended Kievan Rus from attacks of villains. Julius always accompanied the hero as they found themselves in the very center of dangerous events. Prince Vladimir himself proclaimed Julius as the court horse. Julius asks to be married to the royal mare of the East - Zvezda. It is up to Julius to win a race to prove his status for marriage.\nMelnitsa Animation Studio from St.Petersburg was the animation production studio in charge of design for the film. The studio uses traditional animation for the series known internationally as \"The Three Heroes\". The road trip comedy was released in Russia on 31 December 2020 by the distribution company Sony Pictures under the Columbia Pictures label.\nPlot.\nAt the borders of the Kiev Principality, three heroes and the horse Julius save Sultan Rashid from the robbers of his brother Arkan. Arkan tried to take away from his brother a Mare he bought at auction named Zvezda. Julius, the royal horse for the bogatyrs asks for the hand, that is, the hooves of the Royal princess Mare Zvezda of the East from Sultan Rashid. However, Julius cannot boast of his own pedigree, and according to the rules of royal marriages, only a candidate of equal status can marry a person of such bloodlines.\nSuddenly, Julius comes up with the idea of asking the Prince of Kiev to become his matchmaker. Julius rushes to Kiev, but the Prince is engaged in other matters. Julius turns to the Prince of Kiev for help, but is refused. However, Julius does not to give up. Under the cover of the night when everyone is sleeping, Julius sneaks into the castle. He kidnaps the Prince and forcibly takes him to the Sultan for matchmaking. Meanwhile the bogatyrs also have business on the East side. Everyone will meet at the big races, where the winner will get everything.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn November 2018, announcement was made of the new installment to the series titled \"Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing.\" The creators of the series intended to present a feature film on one of the series' most beloved characters, horse Julius. The horse has been depicted as a sarcastic but faithful bay horse with a red mane. The character's Homeric punch lines are famous throughout the series. Julius' catchphrase \"Don't make my horseshoes laugh...\" was part of a contest at the radio station Humor FM (Юмор FM). In 2018, Smotrim collected the top ten jokes of Horse Julius. Horse Julius formerly known as Gaius Julius Caesar, is developed as a paradox character who is a bibliophile at the library but at the same time acts in a confused or ineffectual way.\nThe script written by the Sveshnikovs and Alexander Boyarsky developed the characteristic of Julius and in general the comedy of the series into a spin-off type film. The theme of developing one's innate abilities and talents is described in the film through the bumbling character Julius who despite flaws can manage to find friends and allies while at the same time execute ambitious plans as seen in the finale international horse race competition.\nThe film is the tenth cartoon in the cycle of \"The Three Heroes\" based on Russian culture and history. The film series depicts the titular bogatyr knights in animated format. Darina Schmidt, who was previously worked for such films as \"Luntik\" and \"Smeshariki\" became the director of the film. Konstantin Feoktistov who has previously worked for the film \"\" also was director, with the film becoming his fifth production for the franchise.\nIn March 2018, Sergey Selyanov presented the film to the Cinema Foundation. Leading up to the holiday season of 2020, cinema chains KARO and allied in a strategic joint advertising merger that will bolster the Russian film industry. As the most dynamic and number one cinema market in Europe in terms of attendance in 2020, despite the difficulties of COVID-19, the Russian film industry will see a host of films as it enters the fourth quarter including \"Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing.\" The film as part of the New Year releases heralded a new record in Russian film industry. The share of Russian cinema reached 50% compared to the share in 2019. The film was designated as a national film approved for distribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sony Pictures signed a production pact with Sergey Selyanov's CTB Film Company. The partnership is intended to benefit both companies as Sony Pictures will be able to branch out its portfolio while CTB Film Company will be able to increase its presence in the national film market. The association's first set of films to be released by the end of the year are animated films \"Barkers: Mind the Cats!\" and \"Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing.\"\nFilm producer Alexander Boyarsky, states the film is \"A fun, good New Year's picture, a funny character, we love him, we hope that the audience also loves him. And the story of his matchmaking formed the basis of the film, around it, in general, everything revolves around the idea.\" The film is catered to the family audience with emphasis on a festive mood. The film was one of the anticipated releases of the New Year. Voice actor Sergey Burunov states, \"This is the first sultan in my life. He's kind, he's cunning, he's rich, he's smart. It wasn't me. In the story, our horse Julius fell in love. This time it is serious. He asks for the hooves of the royal mare Star of the East from Sultan Rashid, that is, from me. The love of the horse is strong, but whether the sultan will give up his main treasure is a big question.\"\nCritical response.\nIntermedia noted \"\"Horse Julius and Big Horse Racing\" is a spin-off of the mega-popular animated series about \"Three Heroes\", which has not lost ground for 16 years.\" The film was \"shot with a fair amount of humor, ingenuity and excitement.\" Kino Mail stated, the style of the film is still the same: \"The film will be of interest primarily to loyal fans of the franchise — as before, it is a comedy adventure film for young children and family viewing with them. Stylistically, it has not changed in any way, and fans of the series will be pleased with all the same bright colors, cartoon images of heroes, dynamic editing and cheerful music.\"\nKinoafisha stated the eponymous horse Julius, \"first appeared on screens in 2004, the character waited 16 years to get a solo album.\" The review stated, the film can be watched separately from the series because it is a spin-off movie and is the \"story is more for big fans of the franchise about the \"Three Heroes\".\" The film became one of the top twenty most watched film in KinoPoisk HD film service in February 2021.\nAdaptations.\nThe film is part of the \"Three Heroes\" franchise that has spanned the decades since the historic 2004 release \".\" The animated series has become a behemoth in Russian animation industry that has won many prestigious international awards in the field of animation.

        "text": "Edward Livingston Bigelow (April 19, 1899 – August 20, 1975) was an American ice hockey player and coach for Harvard who was active in the 1910s and 1920s.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from St. Mark's School, Bigelow began attending Harvard University in 1917 while much of the student body had left for Europe to fight in World War I. Due to the lack of available athletes, Harvard had suspended both its varsity and freshman ice hockey teams for the duration of the war and only an informal agglomeration existed. In November of the following year the war ended with the 1918 armistice and the surviving undergraduates began to return to their respective colleges. Harvard, as well as several other colleges, were quick to restart their ice hockey programs and Bigelow was among the players that appeared for the team in 1919. Harvard finished the season with an undefeated record (7–0), however, because the team played only three intercollegiate games and many schools had yet to return, no championship was either conferred or claimed for the season.\nThe next year ice hockey returned for a full season and Harvard was expected to be among the top programs in the nation. Unfortunately, the Crimson started slow, losing their first three contests. This was due in part to having to use the Pavilion ice rink, a much smaller surface that could only fit six players for each team rather than the normal seven. Because none of those games were intercollegiate matches, Harvard's chances for a National Championship were not affected and, when the team met Yale for the first collegiate game of the season, Harvard had grown accustomed enough to the rink to eek out a 5–4 win. Bigelow was one of the team's stars as the Crimson went on a winning streak that extended until the end of the season. Harvard won 10 consecutive games and finished undefeated in collegiate play, earning themselves the Triangular Hockey League Championship (also called the \"Big Three\" Championship) and were the Intercollegiate Champions.\nBigelow was named team captain for his senior season and the team continued to dominate their opponents. They won their first six games of the season but had their winning streak snapped at 16 with a pair of losses to the St. Patrick's Hockey Club of Ottawa. Because their losses were to an amateur team Harvard's collegiate standings were again unaffected and after they finished the season with two more intercollegiate wins (including the largest victory the program has ever produced over Yale) Harvard won its second consecutive Intercollegiate Title. Because the western schools had yet to play a significant amount of intercollegiate games, this was also the last time that one program could claim a unified Intercollegiate Championship until after World War II.\nAfter graduating, Bigelow played amateur hockey in the Boston area before returning to his alma mater to take over head coaching duties. In the interim Harvard, as well as all college programs, had fundamentally changed their playing style by adopting the modern 6-on-6 format. In his first season Bigelow didn't seem affected by the change in style, continuing the staunch defensive game plan that had been emphasized at Harvard for well over a decade. Aside from a pair of losses to two amateur clubs, Harvard won each of their first six games, allowing more than two goals only once. They even provided defending champion Yale with their first loss of the season and entered the game on February 14 with a chance at an Intercollegiate title. The Bulldogs, however, were able to get their revenge and even the season series with a 3–2 win of their own and Harvard's offense failed to score in the rubber match, giving Yale the Eastern Intercollegiate Championship.\nBigelow's second year as coach was much like his second season as a player. The team began with an uninspired win over MIT and then dropped their next three games. With panic setting in for the Crimson faithful, Harvard's offense woke up just in time for the match with Princeton and the team proceeded to win seven consecutive matches, sweeping their conference schedule and finishing with an 8–1 record against collegiate opponents. They were able to dethrone Yale as the Eastern champions, winning their first title in four years. In his third season behind the bench, Bigelow's defense was overpowering and held their opponents to less than two goals in half of their games. Only the Canadian clubs were able to get more than two goals behind the Crimson netminders and Harvard dominated their opposition. The team finished undefeated in intercollegiate play, going 9–1–2 in all matches, and won their second consecutive Eastern Intercollegiate Championship.\nAfter the season, Bigelow announced that he was resigning as head coach to devote himself fully to his business career. He finished with a sterling record and was even more impressive against collegiate opponents (22–3–1).\nBigelow eventually became president of the State Street Bank in 1950 and then Chairman of the Board before retiring in 1965.\nHe died of cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1975."

Aris won the first game at home, by a score of 117–85, and they also won the second game on the road, by a score of 104–88, and thus won the first Greek Super Cup, by an aggregate score of 221–173. Aris then went on to win both the Greek Basket League championship and the Greek Basketball Cup title, or the Greek domestic double, for the next four consecutive seasons (1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90). As a result, the tournament was not held again during that time, since its format didn't allow it to be held after the same team won both titles in the same season. Eventually, the original organizers of the competition, the Hellenic Basketball Federation (E.O.K.), decided that the Greek Super Cup was no longer needed, and they canceled it.\nIn September 2020, the Hellenic Basketball Association (HEBA), decided to hold its own new version of the Greek Basketball Super Cup competition. Under the current competition format, the top two ranked teams from the previous Greek Basket League season, along with the two finalists of the previous Greek Cup tournament, compete against each other, in a final four, with single elimination games. If the same team or teams, finished in both the top two places of the previous season's Greek League and Greek Cup competitions, then the next highest-placed team or teams from the previous season's Greek League competition will take part in the Greek Super Cup.\nPromitheas Patras won the 2020 Greek Super Cup, on September 24, 2020, in the Athens final four. Panathinaikos OPAP won the 2021 Greek Super Cup, on September 26, 2021, in the Patras final four. Olympiacos won the 2022 Greek Super Cup, on October 2, 2022, in the Rhodes final four.

Emma Raducanu won the women's singles title, becoming the first qualifier, male or female, to reach a major final and win a major title.\nDominic Thiem and Naomi Osaka were the men's and women's singles defending champions. However, Thiem withdrew from the tournament due to a wrist injury causing him to end his season early. Osaka lost in the third round to Leylah Fernandez.\nBoth Dylan Alcott and Diede de Groot achieved the Golden Slam in wheelchair quad singles and wheelchair women's singles, respectively, by winning all four majors and the Paralympics in 2021. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid also achieved the Grand Slam in wheelchair men's doubles by winning all four majors in 2021. Novak Djokovic was attempting to be the first man to complete a calendar Grand Slam in men's singles since Rod Laver in 1969, having won the men's singles tournaments at the 2021 Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, but unlike Alcott and de Groot, who also won the Olympic gold medal (Djokovic lost to Alexander Zverev in the semifinal for the gold medal match at the Olympics in 2021), he lost to Medvedev in the final.\nThis was the first Major tournament since the 1997 Australian Open not to feature Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, or Venus Williams in the main singles draw.\nThe United States Tennis Association allowed the return of spectators after the 2020 tournament was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. Due to a surge in COVID-19 cases resulting from the delta variant of the virus, spectators had to present a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination in order to be allowed to enter the grounds.\nTournament.\nThe 2021 US Open was the 141st edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, United States.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and part of the 2021 ATP Tour and the 2021 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws, as both doubles draws returned to the standard 64 players, and singles players remained in standard 128-person format in each category. There were also singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18).\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place over a series of 17 courts with Laykold surface, including the three existing main showcourts—Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium and Grandstand.\nWheelchair events were held on September 9 as scheduled. Unlike previous events on scheduling conflicts with the tournament and the Summer Paralympic Games, the 2020 Summer Paralympics (which was delayed from 2020 due to the pandemic) were held during the first week of the tournament.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe US Open has the richest prize purse of all Grand Slams.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Chippewas represent Central Michigan University in the NCAA's Mid-American Conference.\nCentral Michigan began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Central Michigan's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

That rivalry has continued and even intensified since the emergence of the professional era in the late 1990s. Connacht and Leinster comprise two of the four Irish provincial teams competing in the Pro14 (formerly known as the Celtic League). As such, the two sides regularly face each other during the regular season, and occasionally during the knock-out rounds.\nThe rivalry has been heightened on several occasions due to certain games or events. Connacht and Leinster met in the 2016 Pro12 Grand Final, with Connacht winning 20–10, to claim their first Pro12 championship. Leinster has observed that the rivalry leads Connacht to raise their game when playing Leinster, leading to resentment among Leinster players when this causes them to lose matches they had expected to win.\nConnacht defeated Leinster 47–10 in 2017, and were so comfortable in their victory that they had a forward kick a conversion. Connacht and Leinster players have recognized the rivalry that exists between the two teams.\nBelow are the historical results of the Irish Rugby Football Union teams, Leinster and Connacht, as part of the IRFU Interprovincial Championship, and later the Celtic League, Pro12 and Pro14.\nStatistics.\nHighest scoring match\n2021–22: 76 points (Leinster 56 Connacht 20) \nLowest scoring match\n1960–61: Leinster 0 Connacht 0\nHighest margin of victory\nLeinster: 47 points (54–7 at home in 2019–20)\nConnacht: 37 points (47–10 at home in 2017–18)\nMost consecutive wins\nLeinster: 20 (1965–1985)\nConnacht: 2 (2015–2016)"

        "title": "2021 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2020–21 season. The playoffs began on May 15, 2021, and concluded on July 7, 2021, with the Tampa Bay Lightning winning their second consecutive and third overall Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Montreal Canadiens four games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals. The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin a few days after the regular season concluded, but they began four days prior to the end of the regular season after the Vancouver Canucks had eleven games postponed because of a COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe league returned to the traditional 16-team playoff format with all series being best-of-seven, after using a 24-team format in 2020 due to the regular season being cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to cross-border travel restrictions imposed by the Government of Canada, the league temporarily realigned this season into four divisions with no conferences. Consequently, the first two rounds of the playoffs featured intra-divisional matchups, with the higher seeded teams receiving home-ice advantage in those rounds. In the Stanley Cup semifinals, the four remaining teams (one from each division) were reseeded based on their regular season records. Both semifinal winners advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. After initially stating that the Campbell and Wales trophies would not be awarded this season, the league decided in June 2021 that the Montreal Canadiens and Vegas Golden Knights would play for the Campbell Bowl and the New York Islanders and Tampa Bay Lightning would play for the Wales Trophy.\nAlthough it was initially unknown whether the Canadian teams that qualified for the playoffs would be able to play in their home arenas after the second round, on June 6, it was announced that those teams would be allowed to play in their home arenas for the remainder of the playoffs. In order to complete the playoffs in Canada, the League applied for a cross-border travel exemption with the Public Health Agency of Canada. Prior to the announcement, there were some ideas of the Canadian team playing in a neutral NHL city in the US after the Second Round.\nThe Colorado Avalanche made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins increased their postseason appearance streak to 15 seasons. This became the longest active streak in the four major North American professional sports after the NBA's San Antonio Spurs missed the playoffs for the first time in 22 years. For the second year in a row and third time overall since 1996, all California-based teams, the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings, and San Jose Sharks, missed the playoffs. For the first time since 1966, every team that qualified for the playoffs was also in the previous year's postseason. With all of the Canadian-based NHL teams in one division, the format for this season ensured that there would be a second round series between two Canadian-based teams for the first time since 2002.\nFor the first time since 1992, three of the previous year's semifinalists, the New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning and Vegas Golden Knights, returned to the round for a second consecutive season.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe top four teams in each of the four realigned divisions made the playoffs; this was the first time since 1993 that this format had been used.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top four teams in each division made the playoffs. \nIn the first round, the fourth seeded team in each division played against the division winner from their division. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In each round, home ice advantage was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record. Teams advancing to the Stanley Cup semifinals were re-seeded one through four based on regular season record.\nFirst round.\nCentral Division first round.\n(C1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (C4) Nashville Predators.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes finished first in the Central Division earning 80 points. Nashville finished as the fourth seed in the Central Division, earning 64 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Carolina won six of eight games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Hurricanes defeated the Predators in six games. Hurricanes captain Jordan Staal scored twice in game one to give Carolina a 5–2 victory. In game two, Alex Nedeljkovic made 32 saves for the Hurricanes in a 3–0 shutout victory. Back in Nashville for game three, Juuse Saros stopped 52 shots and Matt Duchene scored at 14:54 of double-overtime for the Predators to emerge victorious 5–4. In game four, Juuse Saros made 58 saves for the Predators, defeating the Hurricanes 3–2 in double-overtime on Luke Kunin's snap shot goal. The Hurricanes forced overtime in game five, and in the extra period, Jordan Staal scored during a 4-on-4 to defeat the Predators 3–2 and take a 3–2 series lead. In game six, the Hurricanes overcame a two-goal deficit to force overtime, where Sebastian Aho scored on a deflected shot to send Carolina to the second round.\n(C2) Florida Panthers vs. (C3) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe Florida Panthers finished second in the Central Division with 79 points. The Tampa Bay Lightning earned 75 points to finish third in the Central Division. This was the first playoff meeting between these two rivals. Florida won five of eight games in this year's regular season series. This was also the first postseason match-up between two Florida-based professional sports teams since the National Football League's where the Jacksonville Jaguars defeated the Miami Dolphins.\nThe Lightning defeated the Panthers in six games. Upon his return from hip surgery in game one, Tampa Bay forward Nikita Kucherov scored twice and Brayden Point, on a breakaway attempt, scored with 1:14 left in the game to give the Lightning a 5–4 victory. In game two, Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy made 32 saves for Tampa Bay as they defeated Florida 3–1 to take a 2–0 series lead. In game three, the Panthers gave up five goals in the second period; however, after a goalie change, Florida forced overtime where Ryan Lomberg scored to end the game 6–5 for the Panthers. The goaltending woes of the Panthers continued in game four when Sergei Bobrovsky allowed five goals on fourteen shots giving the Lightning a 3–1 series lead after a 6–2 rout. In game five, Florida opted to start rookie goaltender Spencer Knight whose 36 saves paid dividends for the Panthers in a 4–1 victory and extending a sixth game. Vasilevskiy held the fort for the Lightning in game six, posting a 29–save shutout in a 4–0 victory, advancing his team to the Second Round.\nEast Division first round.\n(E1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (E4) New York Islanders.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins finished first in the East Division earning 77 points, winning the tiebreaker against Washington with 34 . The New York Islanders earned 71 points to finish fourth in the East Division. This was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with New York winning four of the five previous series. They last met in the 2019 Eastern Conference first round, which New York won in a four-game sweep. Pittsburgh won six of eight games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Islanders defeated the Penguins in six games. In game one, with Semyon Varlamov out as goaltender for New York, Ilya Sorokin stepped in and made 39 saves for the Islanders, defeating Pittsburgh in overtime on Kyle Palmieri's goal. Tristan Jarry made 37 saves for the Penguins in game two who emerged victorious by the score of 2–1. The Islanders attempted a rally in the third period of game three after being down by two goals. The comeback was spoiled at 16:24 when Penguins forward Brandon Tanev scored to make it 5–4. The Islanders played defensively in game four with Sorokin stopping 29 shots in a 4–1 victory, tying the series 2–2. In game five, heading into double-overtime, Josh Bailey scored 51 seconds into the period for the Islanders to give his team a 3–2 series lead in a 3–2 victory. Brock Nelson scored twice and provided an assist in New York's game six victory, advancing to the Second Round with a 5–3 triumph.\n(E2) Washington Capitals vs. (E3) Boston Bruins.\nThe Washington Capitals finished second in the East Division with 77 points, losing the tiebreaker against Pittsburgh with 33 . The Boston Bruins earned 73 points to finish third in the East Division. This was the fourth playoff series between these two teams, with Washington winning two of the three previous series. They last met in the 2012 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Washington won in seven games. Washington won their round-robin game in the previous year's Stanley Cup Qualifiers 2–1. These teams split their eight-game regular season series.\nThe Bruins defeated the Capitals in five games. In game one, with the teams tied at two a-piece after the third period, Capitals forward Nic Dowd scored at 4:41 of overtime to give Washington their first victory of the series. With game two tied 3–3 and heading into overtime again, the Bruins' Brad Marchand scored 39 seconds into the first overtime period to tie the series 1–1. In game three, the two teams extended into overtime for the third consecutive game where Capitals's goalie Ilya Samsonov misplayed the puck behind the net and Bruins forward Craig Smith scored in double overtime to give Boston a 3–2 victory. David Pastrnak scored a goal and provided an assist in Boston's 4–1 victory of game four, taking a 3–1 series and a chance to advance in game five. In game five, captain Patrice Bergeron scored twice for the Bruins, ending the series with a 3–1 victory.\nNorth Division first round.\n(N1) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (N4) Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs finished first in the North Division earning 77 points. The Montreal Canadiens earned 59 points to finish fourth in the North Division. This was the sixteenth playoff meeting between these two rivals, with Montreal winning eight of the fifteen previous series. They last met in the 1979 Stanley Cup quarterfinals, which Montreal won in a four-game sweep. Toronto won seven of ten games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Canadiens defeated the Maple Leafs in seven games after being down 3–1 in the series. In game one, Maple Leafs captain John Tavares got upended by Ben Chiarot; while falling to the ice, Canadiens forward Corey Perry attempted to jump over Tavares' head; however, Perry's knee clipped the Toronto captain in the head. Ultimately, Tavares required a stretcher to leave the ice and was transported to the hospital. After the game, Perry expressed sincere remorse for his actions stating \"I don’t know what else to do there. I tried to jump. I know Johnny pretty well and just hope he’s OK.\" The Canadiens won the game 2–1 on Carey Price's 35 saves along with Paul Byron's shorthanded game-winning goal in the third period. In game two, Auston Matthews scored a goal and two assists in the Maple Leafs' 5–1 victory to tie the series 1–1. The victory was their first playoff win over Montreal since their 1967 Stanley Cup-clinching game. In game three, the Maple Leafs scored twice in the second period, and with Jack Campbell's 28-save performance, secured a 2–1 victory. Campbell continued his goaltending prowess into game four with a 4–0 shutout victory, stopping all 32 shots he faced and granting the Maple Leafs a 3–1 series lead. In game five, the Canadiens grabbed a 3–0 lead in the second period, however, the Maple Leafs tied the game with 8:06 left in the third period to force overtime. In overtime, Toronto forward Alex Galchenyuk gave the puck away causing a 2-on-0 break for rookie Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki, the latter of which scored to spoil the Maple Leafs comeback and forced a sixth game. The first two periods of game six remained scoreless until the third period where Montreal scored two power-play goals. In the final nine minutes, Toronto evened the score to send it to overtime where Maple Leafs defenceman Travis Dermott gave the puck up to Paul Byron who passed it towards Jesperi Kotkaniemi for the game-winning goal at 15:15, tying the series 3–3 with a 3–2 victory. Canadiens goalie Carey Price made 30 saves in game seven, defeating Toronto 3–1 and completing a 3–1 series comeback. With the victory, Montreal ties the NHL record for most series victories after being down 3–1 in a series.\n(N2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N3) Winnipeg Jets.\nThe Edmonton Oilers finished second in the North Division with 72 points. The Winnipeg Jets earned 63 points to finish third in the North Division. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.

In overtime, Nikolaj Ehlers, who had been injured up to this game, scored to complete the comeback and snatch a 3–0 series lead. With game four headed into triple-overtime, the Jets ended the marathon with Kyle Connor's series-clinching goal at 6:52, sweeping the Oilers in four games upon a 4–3 victory.\nWest Division first round.\n(W1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (W4) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Colorado Avalanche earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team with 82 points, winning the tiebreaker against the Vegas Golden Knights with 35 . St. Louis finished as the fourth seed in the West Division, earning 63 points. This was the second playoff series between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 2001 Western Conference Final, which Colorado won in five games. Colorado won their round-robin game in the previous year's Stanley Cup Qualifiers 2–1. Colorado won five of eight games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Avalanche defeated the Blues in a four-game sweep. In Game 1, the Avalanche shot the puck 50 times throughout the game with Nathan MacKinnon potting two goals and an assist in a 4–1 victory. MacKinnon scored a hat-trick in Game 2 as the Avalanche defeated the Blues 6–3. During the game, Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri hit Blues defenceman Justin Faulk in the head. Kadri would be suspended for eight games for the hit, although he filed an appeal, the suspension was upheld on May 31.

Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury made NHL history in Game 1, becoming the first goaltender to start at least one game during the playoffs in fifteen consecutive seasons.

This was also the first Stanley Cup playoff meeting between these two cities since 1908, when the Montreal Wanderers retained the Stanley Cup by defeating the Winnipeg Maple Leafs. Winnipeg won six of nine games in this year's regular season series. This was the first second round series between two Canadian-based NHL teams since 2002.\nThe Canadiens defeated the Jets in a four-game sweep. In game one, Joel Edmundson had two assists in the Canadiens' 5–3 victory. After Canadiens forward Jake Evans scored the empty-net goal against Winnipeg, Jets forward Mark Scheifele charged Evans, knocking him to the ice. Evans required a stretcher to leave the ice.

In game six, Alex Pietrangelo scored a goal and two assists in a 6–3 victory, advancing Vegas to the third round for the second consecutive season.\nStanley Cup semifinals.\nThis was the first time since 1981 that this round was not contested as Conference finals. Due to the league using an intra-divisional schedule during the regular season, none of the participants in the Stanley Cup semifinals played each other during this year's regular season. The last time this occurred was in 1924 when the Stanley Cup was contested by the champions of the NHL, PCHA and WCHL.\n(1) Vegas Golden Knights vs. (4) Montreal Canadiens.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. This was Vegas' second consecutive Semifinals/Conference finals appearance and third within their four seasons of play. Vegas lost the previous year's Western Conference final in five games to the Dallas Stars. Montreal made their eighth Semifinals/Conference finals appearance since the league began using a 16-team or greater playoff format in 1980. Their most recent Semifinals/Conference finals appearance was in the 2014 Eastern Conference final, which they lost to the New York Rangers in six games.\nThe Canadiens defeated the heavily favoured Golden Knights in six games. The Golden Knights struck first in game one; with the goal, Montreal trailed in a game for the first time since game four of their first round series with the Maple Leafs. Shea Theodore lead Vegas in that game scoring a goal and an assist in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Canadiens scored twice in the first period and held off a third period rush by the Golden Knights to win 3–2. Back in Montreal for game three, Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury misplayed the puck behind his net, coughing up the puck to Josh Anderson who tied the game with 1:55 left in the game. In overtime, Jesperi Kotkaniemi threw the puck to an open Anderson and Paul Byron, the former of which scored to give Montreal a 3–2 victory. After missing game three, Canadiens' \"interim\" head coach Dominique Ducharme tested positive for COVID-19, placing him in isolation for fourteen days; he continued working with the team through phone and video calls, talking with the coaching staff and players through the remainder of the series. Robin Lehner started for Vegas in game four, making 27 saves in a 2–1 overtime win with Nicolas Roy scoring the game-winning goal 1:18 into the first overtime. In game five, Nick Suzuki provided a goal and two assists in Montreal's 4–1 victory, giving the Canadiens a chance to clinch a spot in the Finals in game six. Carey Price made 37 saves and Artturi Lehkonen scored the overtime series-winning goal in game six, sending the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1993. As the winners of the semifinal and due to the temporary playoff restructuring, the Canadiens accepted their first Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, normally presented to the Western Conference playoff champions.\n(2) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the second consecutive postseason match-up and the fourth overall playoff meeting between these two teams; with Tampa Bay winning all three previous series. Both teams were in their second consecutive semifinals/Conference finals appearance; Tampa Bay was in their seventh appearance while New York was in their eighth appearance in the semifinals/Conference finals since the league began using a 16-team or greater playoff format in 1980. Tampa Bay won the previous year's Eastern Conference final match-up in six games. This was also the first semifinal/Conference final since 2014 to feature a rematch of the previous year's semifinal/Conference final series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Islanders in seven games. In game one, Islanders goalie Semyon Varlamov made 30 saves for New York, defeating Tampa Bay 2–1. The Lightning evened the series in game two, led by Nikita Kucherov's three assists in a 4–2 victory. Andrei Vasilevskiy was stout for the Lightning in game three, making 27 saves in a 2–1 victory. New York spoiled the Lightning's comeback in game four with Ryan Pulock blocking a shot with 2.7 seconds left in the game to preserve a 3–2 lead, tying the series 2–2. The Lightning dominated in game five, scoring eight unanswered goals, granting Vasilevskiy a 21-save 8–0 shutout victory. In game six, which later proved to be the last game ever played at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Islanders overcame a 2–0 deficit and won in overtime thanks to Anthony Beauvillier's goal, preserving the series to a seventh game. Yanni Gourde scored the only goal of game seven, short-handed early in the second period, whilst Vasilevskiy made 18 saves in a 1–0 shutout victory for Tampa Bay, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second consecutive season. As the winners of the semifinal and due to the temporary playoff restructuring, the Lightning accepted the Prince of Wales Trophy normally presented to the Eastern Conference playoff champions.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams with Tampa Bay winning two of the three previous series. They last met in the 2015 Eastern Conference second round, which Tampa Bay won in six games. This was Tampa Bay's second consecutive Finals appearance and fourth overall. They won last year's Finals against the Dallas Stars in six games. Montreal appeared in their thirty-fifth Stanley Cup Finals. They are the most recent Canadian-based team to win the Stanley Cup, doing so in 1993 (their most recent Finals appearance) against the Los Angeles Kings, winning in five games. They were also the first Canadian team since the Vancouver Canucks in 2011 to reach the Finals. This was the first Finals since 2009 to feature two teams in the same time zone. These teams did not play each other during this year's regular season. \nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points, following the conclusion of the playoffs.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, for the seventh postseason under Rogers Media's current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live.\nFor this season, lead play-by-play voice Jim Hughson did not call any of Sportsnet's playoff games, having opted to work only nationally televised Vancouver Canucks home games during the regular season. Consequently, Chris Cuthbert joined lead colour commentator Craig Simpson on Sportsnet's lead broadcast team, calling the Canadiens–Maple Leafs series on-site for the First Round, the Jets–Canadiens series in the Second Round, the Golden Knights–Canadiens series in the semifinals, and the entire 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. Harnarayan Singh and Louie DeBrusk served as the secondary team, doing a similar role for the Oilers–Jets series. John Bartlett and Garry Galley served as the tertiary team, calling a select number of games from the West, Central, and East Division series inside the Sportsnet studios on CBC, while those broadcast on Sportsnet were simulcasts of NBC Sports' feeds.\nThis marked the final postseason under NBC Sports' 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games were aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. During the First Round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games.\nAfter NBC's lead play-by-play voice Mike \"Doc\" Emrick retired at the end of the previous season, NBC split top play-by-play duties between Kenny Albert and John Forslund during the regular season. For the playoffs, Albert, Eddie Olczyk, and Brian Boucher served as the lead broadcast team while Forslund, Joe Micheletti, and Pierre McGuire served as the secondary team. Brendan Burke and A. J. Mleczko primarily served as the tertiary team. Rounding out NBC's broadcast crew were play-by-play voices Alex Faust, Ken Daniels, and John Walton, and analysts Keith Jones, Dominic Moore, and Jody Shelley. Most first-round games were called remotely, with a few others called on-site. For the Second Round, all games were called on-site except the Jets–Canadiens series. All games were called on-site starting with the semifinals. Peacock, NBC's streaming service, streamed all remaining games of the Stanley Cup playoffs starting on June 14.\nAs it had been done throughout the regular season due to COVID-19 protocols, the home broadcaster provided a neutral \"world feed\" to the other media partners for at the first two rounds: the home team's regional rightsholder during most first-round games in the U.S., NBC for the rest of the U.S. games, and Sportsnet for all games played in Canada.\nAmazon Web Services debuted advanced shot and save analytics for the playoffs, taking data from the player and puck tracking technology that was first implemented at the start of the regular season. NBC used a redesigned score bug to display these new statistics."

        "text": "The 2021 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2020–21 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Eastern Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, 4–2, winning their first NBA championship in 50 years and second overall. Holding home-court advantage, the Suns led the series 2–0 before the Bucks won the next four games, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to win the championship after losing the first two games. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). With the COVID-19 pandemic altering the NBA's schedule for the second consecutive year, the start date of the series was pushed from its usual time in late May or early June to July 6, the second-latest start in Finals' history. This was the first NBA Finals since 2010 to have neither LeBron James nor Stephen Curry as one of the players competing.\nMilwaukee and Phoenix were two of five teams in the league with an active championship drought of 50 years or more. Prior to 2021, the Bucks won their only title in 1971, while the Suns have yet to win a title since joining the league in 1968. They were both making their third Finals appearance. Phoenix and Milwaukee each began play as expansion teams in 1968. Both teams were involved in a coin toss for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft, which the Bucks won and used to select Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, from UCLA. He led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971. The 2021 Finals was the first since 1971 to not include any players who had previously won an NBA championship, and the first since 2015 that no players on the winning team had prior NBA Finals experience. The Suns' Jae Crowder was the only player in the series who previously played in the Finals, making it just the second time since the first Finals that fewer than two players had previously appeared in the championship series; no players had previously played in the Finals in the 1977 series.\nBackground.\nImpact of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted the NBA for the second straight year. The regular season was reduced to 72 games for each team, and was held from December 22, 2020, to May 16, 2021. The playoffs started on May 22.\nMilwaukee Bucks.\nThe Bucks finished with the league's best record in the prior two seasons before suffering disappointments in the playoffs. In the offseason, they were at risk of losing two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award-winner Giannis Antetokounmpo in free agency. To improve their roster, the Bucks acquired guard Jrue Holiday, a highly respected defensive player and an All-Star in 2013, from the New Orleans Pelicans in a four-team trade, surrendering a bounty in starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, the rights to R. J. Hampton, and a package of future draft picks. Milwaukee later re-signed Antetokounmpo, and had previously re-signed forward Khris Middleton and center Brook Lopez. The team finished the season with a 46–26 record and clinched the 3-seed in the Eastern Conference.\nIn the first round, the Bucks won in a four-game sweep over sixth-seeded Miami Heat, to whom they had lost in the previous season's conference semifinals. However, Milwaukee lost starting guard Donte DiVincenzo for the season after he tore a ligament in his left ankle in Game 3. A two-way contributor, he was the team's sixth-leading scorer in the regular season, making 38% of his three-point field goals. The Bucks then faced the second-seeded Brooklyn Nets, losing the first two games before winning the series in seven. After taking a 2–1 lead in the conference finals against the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks, Antetokounmpo went down in game four with a hyperextension to his left knee, allowing the Hawks to win game four and tie the series. Despite Antetokounmpo's absence, the Bucks were still able to close out the Hawks in six games behind the timely contributions of Lopez, Middleton, and Holiday to reach the Finals for the first time since 1974. \nThis marked the first time a team from Milwaukee reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 1982 when the Brewers made the World Series.\nPhoenix Suns.\nThe Suns had just a .302 winning percentage in the previous five seasons entering the 2020–21 season, which is the worst winning percentage in the five years prior for a team advancing to the final playoff round in any of the four major American professional sports leagues. During the 2020 offseason, Phoenix acquired All-Star Chris Paul from the Oklahoma City Thunder by trading away Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr., and a future first-round draft pick. The Suns, led by Paul, rising star Devin Booker, 2018 first overall pick Deandre Ayton, and second-year head coach Monty Williams, finished the season with a 51–21 record as the No. 2 seed, their first winning season since the 2013–14 season, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2010. They also clinched the Pacific division for the first time since 2006–07.\nPhoenix began their playoff run by defeating the seventh-seeded and defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers in the opening round in six games. In the conference semifinals, they swept the third-seeded Denver Nuggets. The Suns then defeated Paul's former team, the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers, in the conference finals in six games, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993. At 36 years old, Paul made his first Finals appearance after 16 seasons in the league and 10 All-NBA selections. \nThis marked the first time since 2009 that a team from Phoenix made a championship series from the four major North American sports leagues, since the Arizona Cardinals reached Super Bowl XLIII.\nRegular season series.\nThe Suns won the regular season series 2–0, with both wins decided by a single point.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nChris Paul scored 32 points and had nine assists and Devin Booker added 27 points to lead Phoenix to a 118–105 win over Milwaukee. After he opened the third quarter with a jump shot for the first double-digit lead of the game, Paul later scored eight straight points for the Suns and scored 16 overall in the quarter. Phoenix led 88–68 with 2:20 remaining in the quarter after Paul passed to Deandre Ayton, who was fouled and made two free throws. In his return from his knee injury, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo returned and had 20 points, 17 rebounds in limited minutes due to foul trouble, and made a chase-down block of a layup attempt by Mikal Bridges that was reminiscent of \"The Block\" by LeBron James on Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals. Antetokounmpo's availability was not confirmed until almost an hour before tip-off, and he played with few signs of injury.\nMilwaukee pulled to within seven points midway through the fourth quarter, but Paul passed to Booker for a 3-pointer and then stole the ball from the Bucks' Khris Middleton and hit a jumper to extend the lead to 106–94. Ayton finished the game with 22 points and 19 rebounds for Phoenix. Middleton scored 29 on 26 shots for the Bucks, but did not attempt a free throw. Teammate Jrue Holiday shot just 4 for 14. Milwaukee center Brook Lopez was targeted on switches by the Suns, and he was on the bench for most of the second half while Antetokounmpo played center.\nThe Suns had 26 free throw attempts in the game, 10 more than the Bucks. Phoenix made their first 25 free throws and nearly set a record for most free throws in a game without a miss until Jae Crowder missed with 24.8 seconds left in the game. The Suns finished 25 of 26 on their free throws compared to the Bucks' 9 for 16. The loss by the Bucks marked the third straight series in which they trailed. This marked Phoenix’ first win at home in the Finals since 1976, and the first time they ever held a series lead in the Finals.\nGame 2.\nBooker scored 31 points and Paul had 23 as the Suns won 118–108 to take a 2–0 series lead. Phoenix made 20 of its 40 three-pointers, including seven makes from Booker. Bridges added 27 points and seven rebounds for the Suns, and Paul also had eight assists. Antetokounmpo had 42 points and 12 rebounds for Milwaukee. Phoenix was up 65–50 towards the start of the third period, but Antetokounmpo scored 20 points in the quarter, including a stretch of 13 consecutive points for the Bucks, to keep his team in the game.\nThe Bucks outscored the Suns 20–0 in the key in the opening period, but Phoenix made eight 3-pointers and trailed just 29–26. With less than five minutes remaining in the first half, the game was tied at 41 before Phoenix ended with a 15–4 run. On their last possession, the Suns made 10 passes, with every team member touching the ball, culminating in Bridges passing the ball to Ayton, who laid it in while being fouled. Phoenix weathered Antetokounmpo's 20-point quarter in the third, when he joined Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, and Joe Dumars as the other players to score at least 20 in a quarter during a finals game. Milwaukee cut the lead to six in the fourth quarter, but a 3-pointer by Paul and a basket by Bridges expanded the lead back to double figures, and Booker made three of his 3-point shots to fend off the Bucks.\nAntetokounmpo had more than twice as many field goals as any other teammate, shooting 15 for 22 from the field, and 11 for 18 from the free-throw line. Holiday scored 17 for Milwaukee on just 7-for-21 shooting, and Middleton had 11 points but was 5 for 16. Crowder bounced back from an 0-for-8 shooting performance in Game 1 with 11 points and 10 rebounds for Phoenix.\nGame 3.\nAntetokounmpo had 41 points, 13 rebounds and six assists, and Milwaukee won 120–100 at home to cut Phoenix's series lead to 2–1. He received more support from his teammates in Game 3. Holiday scored 21 points and was 5 of 10 on 3-pointers, and Middleton scored 18. The Suns got 19 points and nine assists from Paul, but his fellow guard Booker was limited to 10 points on 3-of-14 shooting, as the Bucks sent multiple defenders at him.\nThe Suns started the game strongly with Ayton scoring 12 points in the first quarter. However, he was limited by foul trouble the rest of the game. Milwaukee took control of the contest with a 30–9 run to end the first half and a 16–0 finish to the third quarter. The Suns pulled to within 74–70 in the third after outscoring the Bucks 14–5, but Milwaukee closed out the quarter with a 24–6 scoring run to lead 98–76. The Bucks were 14 of 36 from three-point range for the game after making just 5 of 18 in the first half. They limited Phoenix to just nine 3-pointers, though Crowder was 6-of-7 from behind the arc and scored 18 points.  The Bucks also outscored the Suns 54–40 in the paint, and all 14 of Antetokounmpo's field goals were within of the basket.\nAntetokounmpo became the second player to have consecutive Finals games with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, joining Shaquille O'Neal in 2000. He also posted his 11th game in the playoffs with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark set in 1974 for most in one postseason. Antetokounmpo was an improved 13 of 17 on his free throws, as Bucks fans chanted \"M-V-P\", compared to fans on the road mocking him with a sped-up timer count, as his lengthy deliberate free throw routine could take longer than the league's 10-second rule to shoot which would result in a violation.\nGame 4.\nMiddleton scored 40 points, including 10 straight for Milwaukee in the closing moments, and the Bucks won 109–103 to tie the series 2–2. Booker rebounded from his Game 3 struggles to score a game-high 42 points, but his playing time was restricted late by foul trouble. The Suns led for 37:55 of the first 44 minutes of the game. With 3:42 left in the fourth and the Suns up by three Jrue Holiday attempted a layup and received a great deal of contact from Devin Booker with no call (the play was determined to be a foul by the NBA in the Last 3:30 Report after the game). If Devin Booker had received the foul, it would have been his sixth, resulting in him being ejected and hugely affecting the game. This sparked a lot of controversy online, with the decision to not call the foul being criticised by fans and sports media. They were up two with minutes remaining when Middleton scored the next eight points in the contest. He made consecutive midrange jump shots to place Milwaukee up for good at 101–99 with 1:28 in the game. Jumping off the left leg that he hyperextended two weeks earlier, Antetokounmpo blocked a potential game-tying alley-oop by Ayton with 1:14 left, prompting fans and media to debate the play's standing among the greatest blocks of all-time. After Paul lost his balance of his own accord and turned over the ball, Holiday picked up the loose ball and Middleton made a fast-break layup and with 27.2 seconds left for a four-point lead. He capped off his run with four free throws to bring the score to 107–101. The Bucks outscored the Suns 33–21 in the fourth quarter. Antetokounmpo finished with 26 points along with 14 rebounds and eight assists.\nPhoenix made 51.3% of their shots compared to Milwaukee's 40.2%, but they took 19 fewer shots (78–97) due to turnovers and offensive rebounds, outperformed by the Bucks 17–5 in both. The Bucks scored 24 points off turnovers, and their offensive boards led to 19 second-chance points. Crowder scored 15 points for Phoenix, while Paul was held to 10 points on 5–13 shooting and committed five turnovers. Holiday scored 13 on just 4 for 20 shooting, but he added seven rebounds, seven assists and only one turnover, while his defense disrupted Paul. The Bucks also got 14 points from Lopez and 11 points and nine rebounds from Pat Connaughton. Middleton and Antetokounmpo became the third set of teammates to score 40 or more points in games in the same Finals series, joining Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson with the Los Angeles Lakers (1980) and LeBron James and Kyrie Irving while with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016).\nGame 5.\nWith Milwaukee leading by one with about 16 seconds remaining in the game, Holiday stole the ball from Phoenix's Booker and passed to Antetokounmpo for an alley-oop and a free throw (fouled by Paul on the finish) to secure the game for a 123–119 Bucks' win and a 3–2 series lead. Milwaukee recovered from an early 16-point deficit to outscore Phoenix 87–57 from the start of the second quarter to around the nine-minute mark of the fourth quarter. The Suns were down 10 with minutes left in the game before a basket by Paul cut it to 120–119 with 56 seconds to play. Holiday had 27 points, 13 assists and three steals. Antetokounmpo had 32 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and Middleton finished with 29 points. Booker had a game-high 40 points, his second-straight contest with at least 40.\nPhoenix made 14 of 19 shots in the first quarter, including a stretch of 11 straight makes, and led 37–21 after the first period. However, Milwaukee outscored them 21–5 to open the second quarter, tying the game at 42 on a 3-pointer by Connaughton with 7:48 left in the half. Holiday scored 14 in the quarter, when the Bucks scored a record 43 points in a quarter by a road team in the Finals, and they led 64–61 at halftime. After three quarters, the Bucks had made 62.1% of their shots, rivaling Orlando's single-game Finals record of 62.5% in Game 3 of the 2009 finals against the Lakers. Milwaukee led 108–94 after a basket by Holiday with about nine minutes remaining in the game, but the Suns mounted their comeback to pull within one in the final minute. After a Holiday miss, Booker rebounded the ball and dribbled it upcourt himself. He stopped and pivoted in the paint, when Holiday forcefully pulled the ball from his hands for the steal. After initially intending to run down the clock, Holiday instead passed it for the dunk by Antetokounmpo, who was begging for the ball. Fouled on the play by Paul, Antetokounmpo missed the free throw, making just 4 of 11 in the game. However, he volleyed the ball for an offensive rebound by Middleton, who made one of two free throws for the final score of the game.\nMilwaukee became the first team in the series to win on the road. Antetokounmpo, Holiday and Middleton combined for 88 points, becoming the fifth trio to each score 25 points on 50% shooting in a single Finals game, and the first to accomplish the feat since the Lakers' Abdul-Jabbar (36 points), James Worthy (33), and Magic Johnson (26) in 1985. Phoenix lost three straight games for only the second time in the season, the first occurring six months earlier. Paul ended the game with 21 points, 11 assists and one turnover, while Ayton finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Booker became the first player in the Finals to score at least 40 in consecutive games and lose both. Antetokounmpo and him were the first pair of players to score 40+ twice in the same Finals. Bucks' role player Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the older brother of Giannis, and assistant coach Josh Oppenheimer were away from the team due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. The NBA also replaced referee Sean Wright after he entered health and safety protocols.\nGame 6.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored a playoff career-high 50 points and added 14 rebounds and five blocks to lead the Bucks to a 105–98 victory to win the series in six games. The 50 points tied a Finals record for the most scored by a player in a series-clinching game, set by Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks in 1958. After his dominant performance in the series, including his third game with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP, the youngest winner at age 26 since Kawhi Leonard (22) in 2014. Antetokounmpo made 16 of his 25 shots, and was a surprising 17 for 19 on his free throws after hitting just 55.6% in the playoffs. The game was tied at 77 after three quarters before he scored 13 in the final period to lead Milwaukee to its first championship since 1971, when they were led by Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Paul led the Suns with 26 points.\nMiddleton scored 17 and reserve Bobby Portis added 16 for the Bucks. Holiday had 12 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. His defense helped limit Booker to 19 points on just 8-for-22 shooting, missing all seven of his 3-point attempts. Milwaukee became the fifth team to come back from a 2–0 deficit in the Finals, and the first to do so by winning the next four games since Miami defeated Dallas in 2006. They also became the second team in NBA history to come back from down 2–0 twice in the same playoffs after the 2020–21 Los Angeles Clippers also did so in consecutive rounds. The Suns have won two games in each of their three Finals appearances. Paul became the first player in NBA playoff history to lose four series in which his team led 2–0.\nPlayer statistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; background:#FDE910\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nSponsorship.\nAs part of a multiyear partnership since 2018, the internet television service YouTube TV was the presenting sponsor of the NBA Finals. YouTube TV introduced a new multi-platform ad campaign during the series featuring a grandmother using the service to watch NBA games on-demand.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Finals were televised in the United States by ABC (which included local affiliates KNXV-TV in Phoenix and WISN-TV in Milwaukee) for the 19th consecutive year, and broadcast through ESPN Radio nationally. Each of the games' intro videos were directed by Spike Lee.\nAs with the previous years, the series was called by Mike Breen on play-by-play with Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy as analysts. Rachel Nichols was originally to be the sideline reporter, but Malika Andrews took over due to a leaked audio of Nichols saying racist comments against Maria Taylor."

        "text": "The 2021 Rose Bowl (branded as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Capital One for sponsorship reasons) was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2021, with kickoff at 3:00 p.m. CST at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The 107th playing of the Rose Bowl Game, it was one of two College Football Playoff (CFP) semifinal games; it pitted two of the four teams selected by the College Football Playoff Selection Committee—Notre Dame from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and Alabama from the Southeastern Conference (SEC), with its winner facing the winner of the Sugar Bowl, Ohio State, at the 2021 College Football Playoff National Championship. It was also one of the 2020–21 bowl games concluding the 2020 FBS football season.\nIt was the first playing of the Rose Bowl outside of Pasadena, California, since the 1942 game played at Duke University, in a move prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic in California.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe game was originally scheduled to be played at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. In early December 2020, it was announced that the bowl would be contested behind closed doors without fans, due to California Governor Gavin Newsom's orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in California. Organizers attempted to negotiate an exemption to the health orders—which prohibit any spectators at a sporting event—in order to allow the family members of participating players to attend. However, they were denied.\nOn December 15, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that \"serious considerations\" were being made to re-locate the game due to the state of the pandemic in California, with major surges in new cases, and ICU capacity in Southern California declared to be 0% as of December 17. On December 19, 2020, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association announced that the game would be relocated to AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The only prior time the Rose Bowl was played outside of Pasadena was in 1942 during World War II; after large gatherings were prohibited on the west coast due to fears of a Japanese attack following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the game was re-located to Duke Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.\nThe Association stated that it was not immediately clear if the game would still be called the \"Rose Bowl\", as consent would also have to be obtained from the city of Pasadena, due to a master license agreement covering use of the name (which is co-owned by the Tournament of Roses Association and Pasadena's municipal government). A later press release from the Association referred to the game as the \"College Football Playoff Semifinal presented by Capital One\", pending a decision on usage of the Rose Bowl name.\nA formal decision was scheduled to be discussed by city officials in Pasadena on December 22. On December 30, the City of Pasadena approved use of the Rose Bowl name for the game in Arlington, reportedly after receiving $2 million from the Tournament of Roses “to assist the city with its expenses and lost revenue”.\nThe game was allowed to have 16,000 fans in attendance. The University of Alabama fan ticket allotment was 3,380. In comparison, the 2021 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans only would be allowed 3,000 fans in the Superdome in total.\nTeams.\nTeams for the game were selected by the College Football Playoff selection committee and announced on December 20, 2020. The game matched top-ranked Alabama and fourth-ranked Notre Dame. In seven prior meetings, Notre Dame held a 5–2 edge; the programs had most recently played in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, which Alabama won by a score of 42–14.\nAlabama Crimson Tide.\nAlabama entered the bowl with an 11–0 record, having won all 10 of their Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season games, followed by a win over Florida in the SEC Championship Game. The Crimson Tide had last appeared in a CFP semifinal game following the 2018 season, when they defeated Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Alabama had previously appeared in six Rose Bowl games, most recently in 1946, with a record of 4–1–1.\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish.\nNotre Dame entered the bowl with a 10–1 record. The Fighting Irish, who traditionally compete in football as an independent, played the 2020 season as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Notre Dame defeated nine ACC teams and one non-conference program (South Florida) during the regular season, then lost to Clemson in the ACC Championship Game. The Fighting Irish had last appeared in a CFP semifinal game following the 2018 season, when they lost to Clemson in the Cotton Bowl. The only prior appearance by Notre Dame in the Rose Bowl had been a victory over Stanford in the 1925 edition."

        "title": "International Girls Baseball League",
        "text": "The International Girls Baseball League (IGBL) was a professional women's baseball league based in Miami, Florida, which existed for one partial season in the winter of 1952–1953. The four–team International Girls Baseball League was a winter league composed of players from the National Girls Baseball League and its more noted rival counterpart, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was featured in the film A League of Their Own. The International Girls Baseball League permanently folded midway through its first season.\nHistory.\nArthur Meyerhoff, who served as the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Commissioner from 1945 through 1950, first envisioned establishing an International Girls Baseball League in 1948. Later, Frank Darling, a team owner of the National Girls Baseball Leagues’s Chicago Music Maids wanted to start a winter league in Florida in 1950. Neither was able to bring a winter league to fruition at the time. In the fall and winter of 1952, Darling recruited enough players to establish a four–team league in Florida. Darling became president of the newly named International Girls Baseball League. Harry D. Wilson of the National Girls Baseball League (NGBL) served as secretary.\nThe league came into existence, beginning in October 1952, as both National Girls Baseball League and All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) players were recruited to play in the International Girls Baseball League. Potential players received recruiting letters from Darling. If a player agreed to play in the league, she received a contract. Enough players from the NGBL and AAGPBL responded that the league was able to field the four teams. By design, after the IGBL season was completed the players could return to their regular league teams for their scheduled seasons.\nThe International Girls Baseball League established the Ft. Lauderdale Rockettes, Hollywood Queens, Miami Maids and Miami Beach Belles as the four league teams. The schedule called for 120 games per team, with games to be played between December 2, 1952 and April 28, 1953. Umpires from the men’s Florida International League were used.\nGame promotions included Ladies’ Nights, exhibition games against local men’s teams, and a game between the International Girls Baseball League All-Stars and the Fort Lauderdale Rockettes.\nWhen the season started on December 2, 1952, games were played through December 21, 1952 when the league shut down operations for the holidays. Early attendance was negatively affected by cold weather, with 667 fans noted at the season opener and crowds of 200–500 for succeeding games. Players were asked to take a pay cut due to decreased revenues. After a two–week hiatus for the Christmas holidays, games resumed on January 6, 1953. However, weather cancelled many of the games upon the return to play. On January 11, 1953, the league announced that the rest of the season was cancelled. The league noted cold weather and other area attractions contributed to low attendance that led to its folding.\nRules of play.\nThe International Girls Baseball League players wore a skirt-styled uniform, as used by the AAGPBL. The NGBL’s baseball pants or shorts-styled uniforms were not used.\n1952–1953 league standings.\nThe league disbanded January 11, 1953\nMedia.\nThe National Girls Baseball League was the subject of a documentary. \"Their Turn at Bat: The Story of the National Girls Baseball League\" is a documentary film by Adam Chu.\nThe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was featured in the 1992 fictional film A League of Their Own."

        "text": "The 1922–23 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 28th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAt the start of the season, Yale announced they would not be playing during the winter break, as they had traditionally done. Rule changes were also adopted that modified offside calls in an attempt to make them more fair and to aid the referees.\nYale played well in their opening loss to the St. Nicholas Hockey Club and, after the break, welcomed the first western team to play at the New Haven Arena. The Elis outclassed the American School of Osteopathy, and gave hope that Yale would finally be able to challenge their rival Harvard. Sure enough, in the following game Yale proved to be a match for the mighty Crimson and the defense from both teams was remarkable. Each squad was only able to muster one goal in regulation and two five-minute overtimes were required. O'Hearn scored half way through the first and it appeared that the Bulldogs might be able to take the contest. Harvard's captain, George Owen had other ideas and tied the game at 2-all with less than two minutes remaining in the second overtime. A third, sudden-death overtime was required and with both teams visibly tired Harvard's Hill notched the winning goal.\nFor their next game, Yale travelled south and made their first appearance at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink, which had been completed in November. The Tigers had already produced several dominating performances and they continued their strong play against the Elis. Much of the scoring was done in the first half of the game, when both teams were still fresh. From the start of the third period both goaltenders grew stout in net, turning aside every chance that came their way. The first two 5-minute overtimes both passed without a goal being scored and Yale played their second consecutive sudden-death contest. This time it took six minutes before the final goal was scored and again Yale found itself on the wrong side.\nComing so close in both games was unfortunate for the Bulldogs but the Elis would have a second chance at both teams later in the season. Yale would have to get through a 10-day layoff first and then content with four games in 11 days. The Elis acquitted themselves well, taking three of the games and two with dominating performances. Their only loss came at the hand of an undefeated Dartmouth squad but, again, Yale's defeat was only by a single goal.\nIn the rematch against Princeton, Allston Jenkins did everything he could to keep the tigers from scoring and he was equaled, save-for-save by his counterpart. Neither team was able to score in regulation, or the first two overtime periods, so Yale would have to play in their third sudden-death contest of the Triangular Hockey League season. Both teams had agreed before the session had started to play until one of them had scored and, after 13 minutes had elapsed, the 3,000-strong crowd witnessed the first goal of the game. Yale was finally able to capture a league game when Reid netted the winning tally.\nJenkins continued his stellar play, keeping the next two collegiate opponents from scoring as well. While the team's shutout streak was ended by the New Haven Bears, a local amateur team, they entered their rematch with Harvard full of confidence that the team was equal to the task at downing the Crimson. Jenkins was impenetrable in the contest and three goals from Eli sticks were more than enough to take the match. The win was Yale's first over Harvard since 1917 and their first win in Boston in program history.\nYale would not have long to savor the victory, as the rubber match against both Harvard and Princeton occurred during the following week. The Elis had a chance to win the Triangular League if it captured both games and both they and the Crimson fought a pitched battle on the 7th. The teams traded goals in the second period but thanks to Jenkins in net and the typically oppressive Harvard defense, neither team could score again and overtime was required once more. Both 5-minute sessions passed without incident and Yale played its fourth triple overtime of the season. Again, however, Harvard was able to outlast the Elis and take the Triangular League championship, having already defeated Princeton in their season series.\nThe final game would decide second place in the conference and, as they had for the bulk of the season, Yale relied on their goaltender to pull them through. Jenkins made 34 saves on the night, allowing just one goal during a raucous second period where Yale managed to find the back of the net three times, and allowed the Elis to win the game and finished the season with a 9–6 record, their best mark since the end of the war.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Brandon Charles “Don” Coleman (February 2, 1933 – February 9, 2020) was a Texas high school basketball coach. He is the namesake of the Don Coleman Coliseum in Houston, and retired in 1992 as one of the ten winningest high school basketball coaches in the United States.\nEarly life and education.\nDon Coleman was born on February 2, 1933, in Port Arthur, Texas, to Brandon – a State Champion tennis player – and Sydney Coleman, a teacher. He was raised with a brother and two sisters. He played high school basketball and tennis for the Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, and in 1952 he attended Lamar University on tennis and basketball scholarships. He began focusing solely on tennis in his sophomore year, and led the team to three consecutive Lone Star Conference singles championships and won the NAIA doubles title. Upon graduation he was awarded the university's John Gray Award given to the best student athlete.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nColeman became an assistant coach for his alma mater under head coach Pete Pense in 1955 until 1957. He then spent five years as the head coach of the Aldine High School men's basketball team in Houston. His team placed third in the state championships in 1960.\nMemorial Mustangs.\nIn 1962 he then left for Memorial High School in Houston upon the school's opening, where he became the first head coach for their basketball team. Coleman was the head coach of Memorial Mustangs high school basketball team from 1962 to 1992. From 1964 to 1971 the team won consecutive district championships and 81 consecutive 5A district games, which remains a record in the State of Texas. He led the Mustangs to eighteen district championships in all. For twenty-six consecutive seasons as coach, the team had twenty or more victories over his career, and averaged 25 wins per season. Coleman coached the Mustangs to the 1966 Texas state championship, and led the team to the final three other times in 1967, 1969, and 1984. One of the things he was known for was the importance of physical conditioning—having his players run up to five miles per day before the season started in order to condition them for late game pushes.\nRetirement.\nColeman retired with 893 wins, which at the time was the all-time third best record in the State of Texas and eighth best record in the United States. In 1992, upon his retirement, the Spring Branch Community Coliseum was renamed the Don Coleman Coliseum in his honor. He also coached the Texas High School All-Star Game in his final year, his second time since he coached it the year his team won the state championship in 1966. He was also awarded the UIL Denius Award for Coaching Excellence. The Don Coleman Outstanding Coach award was also named for him by its awarding body, the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches in 1999. He has been named to both the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame, the Texas High School Coaches Association Hall of Honor, and in 2000, was named to the Port Arthur Thomas Jefferson High School Hall of Honor and in 2001, the Lamar University Hall of Honor and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes Ring of Honor. In 2019 a life-sized statue of Coleman was added to the entrance of Don Coleman Coliseum.\nPersonal life.\nColeman was married to Mary Kay Coleman, with whom he shared four children from previous marriages: Brandon, Jr., Kevin, Scott, and Barbara. Post-retirement, he increased his dedication to the church. He died in Houston on February 9, 2020."

        "title": "Misogyny in ice hockey",
        "text": "Misogyny in ice hockey refers to the discourses, actions, and ideologies that are present in ice hockey, environments that contribute to the discrimination against women in the sport and their absence. This phenomenon includes issues related to sexism and male chauvinism. The social aspect of the sport supports issues related to misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, and heteronormativity. The subject has been extensively discussed in both media and academia, with many women in the sport increasingly speaking out about the extent of misogyny in hockey and its negative impact on the sport.\nHistory.\nLate 1800s to middle 1900s.\nIn the mid-1800s, the first game of modern ice hockey was played in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, but the first woman to play was Isobel Stanley in the late 1800s. In the early 1900s, the first women's ice hockey league was founded in Quebec, Canada. Hockey appeared to be a masculine sport due to the sport's violent fight and aggressive nature, therefore, women only began playing ice hockey when they came to the U.S. from Canada. It wasn't until after World War I that women's hockey boomed. \nHistorically, organized women's ice hockey has only developed relatively recently as an enduring phenomenon. From the late 1800s, when the sport first began to organize formally, and throughout most of the 1900s, national ice hockey associations found little evidence of existing interest among the female population in regards to participation in ice hockey while substantial interest existed for participation in other winter sports such as figure skating and broomball. In Canada, participation among girls and women in ice hockey by the 1980s registered less than six thousand players nationwide.\nIn the beginning, ice hockey was only played by either sex in the areas of North America which had the right climate that would make a winter season possible, restricting the growth of the sport. Until indoor ice rinks became more widespread, all players, male or female, had to play outdoors where ice was available and could be found. Since registrations were low prior to the mid-1980s, female players had few options when it came to finding other girls to play with and against and felt intimidated by the fact that they had to compete against boys and men. The fact that males in comparison to females have a biological advantage which impacts athletic performance including factors such as physical size, mass, weight, and power, all served as a major deterrent for potential female participants. In addition, body checking was still a part of the female category of the sport, causing further discouragement, until it began to be removed in the mid-1980s in Canada after which registrations increased. A combination of factors crippled the growth of the female game by creating restrictions, namely those related to climate, a lack of interest among the female population, body checking, and a lack of girls and women to participate. Misogyny in ice hockey however became more evident in the late part of the 1900s and remains a complex subject.\nFormal organization.\nThe first record of an organized women's team reports one formed at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. The group dubbed themselves the \"Love-Me-Littles\" after being shunned by the community, the school's archbishop declaring that young women should not be playing hockey.\nAs World War I hit in the 1910s, women's hockey began a marked period of growth, with tournaments at the Jubilee Arena routinely selling out while the men were off at war. One of the game's star players, Albertine Lapensée, was routinely accused of being a man. Lapensée left the sport after asking for a share of the profits her team was generating. When American investors attempted to organise an All-Star Team to tour the United States, they were forced to drop their bid after the Montreal Star newspaper ran a campaign against it, declaring that any woman who participated in the tour would lose their virtue.\nAfter the war ended, investment and media coverage disappeared. In 1923, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association voted not to give women official recognition as hockey players. During the Great Depression in Canada, the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association experienced a heavy decline for various reasons, including increasing competition for ice time. Its most successful team, the Preston Rivulettes, which still drew substantial audiences, were forced to fold as Second World War hit. The military pressured the facilities and the league failed to receive the same support as the men's leagues. The men's leagues were deemed to be morale boosters.\nAbby Hoffman, born in 1947, became an all-star defender in an Ontario boys' league in Canada in the 1950s. Her parents concealed her sex and placed her on a boys team due to the fact that there weren't any local girls hockey teams. One report stated that when her sex was discovered, \"people were incredulous. They couldn’t believe it. Most people assumed that no girl would want to play.\" However, Abby was only nine years old at the time and had not yet entered puberty.\nMiddle to late 1900s.\nCompetition from ringette.\nIn Canada, the new ice skating team sport of ringette was created in 1963.\nAt that time, only bandy and ice hockey existed as options for playing an ice skating team sport anywhere in the world regardless of the sex of the players involved. Bandy required the use of a bandy field while ice hockey made use of the smaller ice rink.\nThe sport of ringette was made specifically for girls and excluded boys and also excluded body contact and body checking as a consequence of ringette's origin, having initially been inspired by a variant of floor hockey created during the Great Depression in Canada and including concepts borrowed from basketball. While ringette was first intended to be an indoor court sport for girls, it was soon decided to make it an ice skating team game for them instead. In the beginning, ringette used both figure skates and ice hockey skates. By the early 1980s, roughly 20 years after its creation, ringette had experienced substantial growth in Canada, with ringette players now using ice hockey skates almost exclusively and the sport outpacing registrations observed in Canadian female ice hockey with female hockey registering only 40% of ringette's numbers. Ringette by comparison had over 14,000 registrations nationally while female ice hockey only broke 5,000. Ringette had also successfully developed an international following, developing a particularly strong hold in Finland and had also been introduced to a variety of other countries including the United States. In 1986, body checking was officially removed from female ice hockey by its organizers in Canada and began to see a rapid increase in registrations, with the controversial decision for the removal of body checking proving a success. Fierce competition for on-ice female talent ensued between the two team sports of ice hockey and ringette, particularly in Canada, but was also witnessed in parts of the USA where the sport had failed to take a strong hold unlike in Finland. In Canada, a short decline in ringette registrations occurred after 1998, but within a decade began to see an increase in registrations once again reaching its peak registration level nationally during the 2018–2019 season.\nFormal organization.\nWomen's hockey began to take on more formal structures in the second half of the 20th century, with the first women's ice hockey program in the United States established at Brown University in 1965 and with Modo AIK facing off against Timrå IK in the first organized women's hockey match in Sweden in 1969. \nNational associations continued to ignore the need to develop the women's game model due to a lack of interest among the female population compared to the male side and as a consequence often imposed a wide variety of differing local rules, making international competition difficult to organize. Canada's Fran Rider, who was one of the founders of the Ontario Women's Hockey Association observed: \"It is important to understand that support from the minor hockey community did not exist for females, so any progress was in spite of discouragement by male hockey. We had to deal with problems like bad ice, few leagues and no support systems.\"\nBy the mid-1980s, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) was coming under substantial pressure to formally codify a consistent set of rules and structures for the women's game but failed to do so, leading to calls for the formation of a separate women's international ice hockey federation. However, International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch informed the IIHF that the IOC would not communicate with separate federations. Within a decade, the 1990 IIHF Women's World Championship was organized and hosted in Ottawa, Canada, and became the first IIHF-sanctioned international tournament in women's ice hockey, 70 years after the first men's World Championship was held. The tournament suffered a number of issues, including Fran Rider organizing the tournament without financial support from the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and Team Canada wearing infamous pink jerseys as a marketing decision. The location of the tournament was chosen five months before it started, and priority for ice-time was given to the junior men's Ottawa 67s team, meaning that the sale of tickets only began a few weeks before the start of the championship.\nIn 1998, women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics. In 2001, women's hockey became an NCAA-sanctioned sport for the first time, with the launch of the NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament.\n21st century.\nUnited States.\nIn March 2017, the players of the United States women's national ice hockey team announced their intention to strike ahead of the 2017 IIHF Women's World Championship, after over a year of failed negotiations with USA Hockey concerning wages and playing conditions. At the time, USA Hockey was spending an estimated 3.5 million dollars a year on youth development programs for boys, but was not making any expenditures which would help development programs for girls.\nSweden.\nIn May 2017, IF Sundsvall Hockey cut its women's team, who were playing at the top level of Swedish women's hockey, citing a need to save money for its third-tier men's side. The club was criticized for the decision, with forward Mathilda Gustafsson stating:\nIn August 2019, the players of the Sweden women's national ice hockey team went on strike over the lack of financial support and poor conditions they faced from the Swedish Ice Hockey Association.\nCanada.\nAfter the collapse of the Canadian Women's Hockey League in May 2019, over 200 players announced their intentions to sit out from any professional leagues in the hopes of securing greater investment and media coverage of the sport. The #ForTheGame movement soon became more formally organised in the form of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association.\nIn February 2019, the University of British Columbia changed its policy of giving its men's hockey team preference in scheduling matches after complaints from players on the women's team, who had a better record than the men's team at the time.\nIn March 2019, a girls peewee team in Mauricie, in Québec, made it to the finals of the boys' regional finals before being kicked out of the tournament and being forced to cede their place in the finals to the boys' team they had defeated in the semi-finals.\nIn 2019 Hockey Canada instituted a new bylaw requiring its five-member board of directors to have at least two men and two women in order to improve representation on the board.\nSex crimes and sexual harassment.\n1990s.\nOn March 30, 1994, Billy Tibbetts—ECHL player—pleaded guilty to raping a 15-year-old girl when he was 17 years old at an outdoor drinking party in Massachusetts. In 1995, while on probation for the statutory rape case, Tibbetts was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a BB gun), disorderly conduct and witness intimidation, and served 39 months in prison. In 2000, he signed an NHL contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. \n2010s.\nIn March 2014, the University of Ottawa suspended its men's hockey programme after multiple players were accused of sexual assault. In November 2014, the OHL suspended two players for 15 games after the players had made a number of misogynistic comments on social media.\nIn March 2015, Ohio State University forced women's hockey head coach Nate Handrahan to resign after being investigated for sexually harassing players.\nIn June 2018, eight members of the 2017-2018 Canada men's national junior ice hockey team allegedly assaulted a woman at a Hockey Canada event in London, Ontario. Hockey Canada paid $3.55 million CAD to the woman in May 2022 but the matter reopened in July 2022.\n2020s.\nIn March 2020, Alyssa Wruble, while playing on the Northampton Area High School hockey team, was bullied over being the only girl on the team, with numerous fans holding up signs and chanting for her to reveal her gender and saying that she had a penis. The Parkland Ice Hockey president Mike Byelick stepped down from his position due to the incident.\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, the IIHF cancelled the 2021 IIHF World Women's U18 Championship, but intends to proceed with the boys' 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The IIHF was criticised by several for the decision, with U18 Team Canada player Jade Maisonneuve stating that \"COVID doesn't exactly discriminate... I understand why the women's tournament was cancelled, but why both weren't is a little questionable.\"\nIn 2022 it was revealed that Hockey Canada, which handles multiple sexual assault allegations per year, diverts a portion of player registration fees to a special fund worth approximately $15 million to \"pay out settlements in cases of alleged sexual assault without its insurance company, and with minimal outside scrutiny\". In federal hearings in July, Hockey Canada explained that from 1989 to 2022 it helped settle 21 cases, paying nearly $9 million CAD. Amid \"growing calls for a leadership overhaul to address the troubling culture\" in hockey, the organization's CEO Scott Smith said he had no plans to resign. In October of that year, Smith and the entire board of directors resigned. They were subsequently replaced by an all-new board.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nIn 2010, Cammi Granato and Angela James became the first two women to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players. The Hall of Fame, however, introduced a rule at the same time limiting the number of women who could be inducted each year to two, and as of 2020 has only inducted six other women (and 36 men) leading to accusations of sexism, male chauvinism, and misogyny.\nAfter scoring the Clarkson Cup-winning goal in 2015, Boston Blades forward Janine Weber was asked by the Hall to donate the stick she had scored with, however it was one of only two sticks she had. She was forced to reach out via Twitter to organise a sponsorship for herself to replace the stick she had donated.\nIn January 2019, the Hall of Fame was criticised for the disparity between the baby clothes in their gift shop, with the boys' clothes proclaiming \"Future hockey legend\" and the girls' clothes proclaiming \"Cutie\".\nDiscrimination lawsuits.\nCanada.\nIn 1981, Justine Blainey-Broker, born in 1973, won a roster position on a boys' team in the Metro Toronto Hockey League, was barred from playing by the league when she was 13 years of age because of her sex since ice hockey was now divided by male and female categories of the sport. Her discrimination complaint against the team was ultimately successful when it reached the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1986.\nIn the year 2000, a group of women filed a complaint against the University of Saskatchewan under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code for giving the university's men's hockey team preferential treatment. The university lost the case.\nAfter the University of New Brunswick downgraded the status of their varsity women's hockey programme in 2008 and stripped it of its funding, players on the team filed a discrimination complaint with the province's Labour and Employment Board. After the board ruled in the players' favour, the university reinstated the programme in 2017.\nUnited States.\nIn 2015, former Olympian Shannon Miller sued the University of Minnesota for discrimination after she was fired. The university had cited the need to cut costs behind the decision to fire her, yet did not fire the men's hockey program head coach, despite him having a higher salary and a substantially less successful record. In 2018, she won the case and was awarded 3,7 million $ in damages.\nIn June 2018, 11 former University of North Dakota women's players sued the university over the decision to axe the women's hockey programme in 2017, alleging that the university failed to meet its Title XI requirements to effectively accommodate student interests and abilities.\nNational Hockey League (NHL).\nIn August 2014, the Chicago Blackhawks announced that they stop playing \"The Stripper\" in between periods following a fan petition. Early that year, the team had been criticised for displays of sexism at the Blackhawks Convention, with the moderator, Mark Giangreco, focusing on the attractiveness of captain Jonathan Toews's partner instead of his trophy awards.\nIn April 2015, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman defended the use of chants by spectators comparing Anaheim Ducks forward Corey Perry to Katy Perry. The chants had been criticised as being sexist for attempting to degrade Perry by calling him a woman, especially since there had been previous similar incidents, such as calling Sidney Crosby “Princess Crosby”. EA Sports' NHL 15 video game was criticised sexist portrayals of women hockey fans in its marketing for the game.\nBy mid-2019 less than 5% of hockey operations jobs in the NHL were held by women. In March 2019, the NHL and the NHLPA established a Female Hockey Advisory Committee to try and increased opportunities for women in the sport.\nIn April 2020, a former Tampa Bay Lightning youth hockey coach sued the team, alleging that she was fired after filing a complaint over being sexually assaulted by a team executive. Later that year, the Los Angeles Kings suspended their senior manager of game presentation and events after he was sued by a former Kings employee for sexual harassment. In November 2020, Jarrod Skalde sued the Pittsburgh Penguins, accusing the team of covering up sexual assaults committed by Clark Donatelli, the head coach of the team's AHL affiliate.\nLack of official domestic violence policy.\nThe NHL is currently the only one of the big four men's professional sports leagues in North America not to have an official policy on domestic violence. Players accused or convicted of domestic violence may still be subject to league suspension if the NHL concludes that their suspension improves the reputation and/or interests of the league. Since 2016, league players have also been mandated to receive anti-sexual assault and domestic violence training.\nIce Girls.\nSeveral NHL teams have come under criticism for the use of cheerleading teams known as Ice Girls, consisting of young women wearing revealing uniforms. The practice has been criticised as objectifying and for poor working conditions faced by the women.\nThe first Ice Girls squad had been introduced by the New York Islanders in the 2001–02 season. In 2007, the New York Rangers stopped using Ice Girls after a lawsuit by a former Ice Girl accusing team officials of sexual harassment. In 2014, the Philadelphia Flyers temporarily stopped the practice after complaints of poor working conditions, including having to work outdoors in sub-zero temperatures in shorts and being forced to spend hundreds of dollars a month out of their own pocket on cosmetics. The Flyers re-introduced the squads after the replacement ice-cleaning workers were booed by fans. Later in 2014, the San Jose Sharks introduced Ice Girl squads, despite a fan petition gathering hundreds of signatures. In 2015, the Islanders stopped the practice after changing arenas.\nMultiple NHL teams have defended the practice, with the Colorado Avalanche stating in 2014 that \"It's what every college in the country does. It's what every NBA team in the country does. It's what every lacrosse team in the country does.\"\nNHL relations with women's hockey.\nThe league has received criticism for exhibiting a lack of initiative to support professional women's hockey on a more than superficial level. In 2019, the league donated only $100, 000 to the NWHL, despite the average NHL team making a $25 million profit that year, and has owned a trademark for the name \"Women's National Hockey League (WNHL)\" since at least 2012 without making any moves to create such a league. After the collapse of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), both the Buffalo Sabres and New Jersey Devils severed their affiliations with the local National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) teams. The league did, however, contribute some money to helping the CWHL pay off its debts.\nA couple of weeks before the 2015 NHL Winter Classic, the NHL announced that a showcase game between the Canadian Women's Hockey League's Candiennes de Montréal, and the National Women's Hockey League's, the Boston Pride, would be held before the event. The game was marked by several controversies, including potentially sub-standard ice as the game was held directly after the NHL's teams' practice, a lack of publicity, and no broadcasting or streaming options available for fans to watch the games.\nIn 2019, the NHL was criticized after it emerged that the league would not be paying Brianna Decker for her demonstration of the passing accuracy skills competition, despite fans unofficially clocking her time as three seconds faster than the competition's winner Leon Draisaitl. After company CCM Hockey pledged to pay her an equal amount to what Draisaitl won, the NHL announced that it had clocked her time as six seconds longer than his and would be donating $25 000 to a charity of Decker's choice.\nThe league expanded women's participation in the 2020 All-Star game, and announced it would be paying the players an appearance fee and making a donation towards girls' hockey, but would not be offering prize money.\nGoaltenders.\nIn 1992, Manon Rhéaume became the first woman to attend an NHL training camp and suited up for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a pre-season game. Despite asking to be treated the same as the men's players, she was forced to use a separate dressing room. Then Lightning president and general manager, Phil Esposito, stated: \"I don't care what anybody thinks, I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't using it for the publicity. The fact is, if I could put a horse in net–if it could stand on skates and stop the puck–I'd do it.\"\nWomen's involvement in hockey.\nAs players.\nA regularly cited barrier women face in hockey is the lack of youth teams and development resources. Cases exist where girls have tried to join high-performance boys' teams only to find themselves being cut, a decision they believed to be made due to their sex.\nStereotypes about female players.\nThere are a number of persistent stereotypes surrounding women in hockey, such as players being perceived as too masculine, with players facing pressure to take on a more feminine appearance. Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation coach Nora Cothren has also stated that \"the presence of homophobia in women's sports is different than that in men's sports. There is a fear among female athletes that if they speak up about gay issues, they will be automatically lumped into the stereotype of gay female athlete.\"\nWomen are also frequently stereotyped as being inherently less physically capable of high-level athletic performance. However, Umeå University professor Kajsa Gilenstam found in her doctoral thesis that the poor quality of equipment female hockey players had to use significantly impacted performance: \"nine out of ten female players increased puck velocity when a more flexible stick and a lighter puck were used.\" Further research by Gilenstam has suggested \"a similar capacity of producing strength and aerobic power in female and male hockey players.\"\nAs coaches.\nWhile many women have played professional women's ice hockey, women have experienced barriers to success in finding coaching positions in the men's game. In 2016, Dawn Braid became the first woman to hold a full-time NHL coaching position, being named a skating coach for the Arizona Coyotes. In April 2020, former Swiss Olympian Florence Schelling became the first woman to be named general manager of a top-flight professional men's team when she named as SC Bern GM. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, only two of the six NWHL head coaches were women.\nFormer Russian player Alexandra Kapustina has stated that: \"A man with no hockey experience at all stood more chance of getting a coaching role than I did, despite my vast background in women’s hockey and my coaching certificates. All those efforts crashed into a barrier of sexism.\"\nA 2016 study of Albertan girls' hockey found that it was commonly assumed that fathers would volunteer for coaching roles and that teams rarely attempted to communicate with or retain women as coaches. A 2015 analysis of Minnesota girls' hockey found that only 21% of teams were led by a female head coach, an increase from 0 in 2008. \nAhead of the 2012-13 NCAA women's Division I season, only 8 out of the 36 teams had women as head coaches.\nAs officials.\nAs of 2019, there were only 2,000 women among the 31,000 hockey officials registered in Canada and only 1,500 among the 25,000 registered in the United States. In 2019, the first woman officiated at the NHL pre-training camp prospects tournament level.\nDuring the 2018–19 season, Cassandra Gregory was due to be the first female official in the Alberta Junior Hockey League after being recommended by the regional refereeing committee, however the league did not assign her to any games. Under the Hockey Canada referee qualifications system, women cannot reach Level 6, while men can. In 2019, Charlotte Girard, who had served as an official at the Olympic level and in the Ligue Magnus, the top tier of French men's hockey, spoke out about the abuse she had faced in the sport, including being physically attacked in pre-match warmups and being left out of communications between other officials.\nA 2019 thesis from a graduate student at the University of Toronto found that \"women officials across Canada experience abusive behaviour, and believe that discrimination prevents them from advancing to higher levels of officiating.\"\nAs fans.\nA \"puck bunny\" is defined as a female ice hockey fan whose interest in the sport is primarily motivated by sexual attraction to the players rather than enjoyment of the game itself. The stereotype is often criticized as being derogatory towards female fans, both by objectifying them and branding them as inauthentic. The stereotype runs into and overlaps with the prevailing idea that the majority of female fans at games are less knowledgeable about the game than male fans. However the idea has not been backed up by evidence.\nProfessional hockey leagues have been criticised for reducing women to stereotypes in marketing and merchandise, such as the overuse of the colour pink in creating merchandise for women.\nIssues.\nWomen who are hockey fans often face harassment targeted at their sex and/or gender appearance both at sporting events and online.⁣\nIn 2017, HockeySverige performed a series of interviews on sexism in the sport with top players in Sweden, including several players speaking anonymously about being sexually harassed by men in the sport. Swedish national team defender Johanna Fällman stated that \"It feels like hockey is several steps behind the rest of society in Sweden.\" A 2018 investigation by SVT Sport found that 9 out 10 girls youth players in the Västergötland region experience degrading and sexist comments.\nThe barriers facing women in ice hockey can also vary from region to region, with women in more conservative regions often having higher barriers to participation. Women of colour often face increased discrimination and barriers in the sport, with feminism in ice hockey having faced criticism for its lack of intersectionality.\nHockey has been widely accused of a culture of conformity, presenting an additional barrier to attempts to speak out about and change issues in the sport. It has also been suggested that the important of the sport within Canadian culture has hindered scrutiny of the sport's issues.\nRape culture.\nThere has been extensive discussion surrounding the widespread presence of rape culture in hockey as an issue affecting both sexes and different genders, especially in boys' junior hockey. A number of major incidents can be found on record involving players who have been charged for sexual assault during the 2000 era with testimonies from multiple former players discussing locker-room cultures that degrade players and promote the objectification of women. There have also been multiple junior boys teams involved in serious hazing incidents.\nA 2012 report by a Boston University taskforce following two incidents of players being charged with sexual assault found that a culture of \"sexual entitlement\" and alcohol abuse existed in the men's hockey programme. In 2014, a series of email chains between junior players starting from the early 2000s detailing their experiences were compiled into a publication released online under the title of \"The Junior Hockey Bible\". The publication contained a large number of degrading slang terms for women commonly used by players.\nA 2014 study from Lakehead University found that social problems in hockey \"include, but are not limited to: extreme violence resulting in injuries and death, hazing rituals, multiple types of sexual violence, drug abuse, financial corruption, as well as various forms of prejudice and discrimination.\" A 2020 study from Sweden found that \"Identified as components of the ice hockey culture and ‘natural’ parts of the game and community, rules that trigger fights, harsh and careless playing styles, a normalising of sexist and derogatory attitudes/language and an exaggerated alcohol consumption.\"\nIn November 2018, former NHLer Daniel Carcillo indicated that as a rookie of the 2002-03 Sarnia Sting, he and other rookies were subjected to several forms of severe hazing, which crossed over into physical and sexual assault. The accusations were corroborated by several other former Sting teammates, and a class-action lawsuit was launched. In December 2020, a large number of testimonies by former OHL players were filed to the Ontario Superior Court, detailing accounts of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.\nLack of investment.\nAnother regularly cited barrier is the lack of investment in professional women's leagues. Even in European leagues such as the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL), where women's teams are part of the same organization as the men's teams, concerns about access to resources are widespread. Calls to invest in women's leagues are often dismissed as charity or as leagues not being able to prove themselves, despite the fact that men's leagues have often received large public subsidies to stay afloat. Some studies have found that women's sports receive less than 5% of all commercial investment in sports, despite having significant and significantly growing reach.\nPay gap.\nPlayer salaries in professional women's hockey leagues are often extremely low even in the most elite leagues and have mostly been a recent development in the sport. The National Women's Hockey League (now renamed the Premier Hockey Federation) became the first league to offer a salary to all its players when it formed in 2015, but cut those salaries in half after only a year. In both the former NWHL and the now-defunct Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), the highest-paid players received around $10,000 per year.\nA Unionen report released in January 2020 found that the average top-flight men's hockey player in Sweden earns more than the combined salaries for an entire top-flight women's team, with the average Swedish Hockey League (SHL) player earning 121 000 kr a month and the average Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL) player earning less than 5500kr a month. The report further found that 99% of the SHL players felt they were able to earn a living playing hockey, while only 7% of the SDHL players felt the same. The report also examined the resources available to players, finding that 91% of men's players had access to team doctors compared to 29% of women, and that 83% of the men were satisfied with the conditions they faced in hockey, while only 27% of the women were.\nThe low salaries force players to hold second full-time jobs, contributing to high levels of stress and burnout. A 2019 Hockey Sverige analysis found that of all 180 Swedish players playing in the SDHL in the 2014–15 season, over 100 had retired by 2019. In July 2020 Swedish national team player Fanny Rask announced her retirement from hockey via an Instagram post in which she voiced her frustration with the pace of professionalization in women's hockey and her exhaustion with the financial insecurity of being an SDHL player.What I dreamed of in my youth was to become a professional [ice hockey player]. That the [women's] league would grow to such an extent that we could live on hockey. (No, not millions, everyone knows it is unreasonable still.) But I have always thought that I would be able to join-in when we become professionals. But it has not happened and I feel that we are at a standstill... And I don't see that there will be any change. Of course, I know that things are happening but for me it is going too slowly and I am incredibly uncertain that it will ever happen... So maybe I chose the wrong path, had the wrong dream and too high of demands. I hope there are some people who still have the strength to carry on and who work for a future for women's hockey. My energy has run out, I'm empty and I'm sorry.\nThe lack of opportunities to make a living while playing the game also has the effect of driving young girls out of the sport, as they will not see any future in the sport.\nMedia coverage.\nThe lack of media coverage of professional women's leagues is regularly cited as a major in the absence of women in hockey and as a major obstacle to the growth of professional women's hockey. Academic research has indicated that women's sports receives less than 4% of all sports media coverage, despite the fact that over 30% of all athletes are women. Media coverage of women's hockey events has also tended to be of poor quality, with low definition streams from hard-to-watch angles, as well as there being a lack of full-time journalists dedicated to covering women's hockey.\nMedia coverage of women's hockey has also been criticized for focusing too much on players' relatives and their personal lives and not enough on their playing performances. Coverage has also tended to comment disproportionately on players' physical appearances. A 2016 study on sports coverage from Cambridge University stated that \"language around women in sport focuses disproportionately on the appearance, clothes and personal lives of women, highlighting a greater emphasis on aesthetics over athletics.\"\nA doctoral thesis by Ryerson University professor Donna Gall found that most potential viewers of women's hockey didn't know where to access coverage of games. Gall's conclusion was that this was caused by media coverage which tended to focus on the issues facing women's hockey rather than the actual ongoing competitions, making it hard for potential viewers to follow games. A study of NBC's play-by-play commentary during the women's tournament at the 2010 Winter Olympics found that the women's players were more often compared to men's players than to other women, and that the male commentators were far more likely to hold male players up as role models for women's players.\nAttempts to promote the growth of women's hockey media coverage have often been met with resistance. One often-presented argument is that women's hockey does not deserve media coverage because nobody would watch it if it did get coverage. Canadian professor Courtney Szto has spoken out against that argument by noting that a number of sporting events only significantly after they received widespread coverage, including the IIHF World Juniors. She has also pointed out that the 2019 Clarkson Cup finals, one of three CWHL games broadcast on TSN in the 2019–20 season, received ratings comparable to other sports broadcasts on the network such as Premier League games. The NWHL became the first North American professional women's hockey league to sign a broadcasting deal with a rights fee when they signed a three-year deal with Twitch in 2019. In 2018, C More had signed a deal with the SDHL to broadcast 12 games during the 2018–19 season.\nWomen also face higher barriers to entering the sport as journalists, often facing discrimination. Andi Petrillo, who became the first female reporter to travel on the Toronto Maple Leafs' team charter in 2006, stated that: \"Some people didn't care but some made my life hell because of my gender. If I was seen talking to a player, some reporters felt I was flirting.\" \nLack of record-keeping.\nWomen's competitions also face barriers to accessing statistics, which can affect coverage of the game, access to information on the sport for fans, and efforts by players and coaches to improve performance. In 2015, online hockey statistics website Elite Prospects began adding female players to their database for the first time. Sports data analyst Meghan Chayka has stated that \"unless you show up on a box score in women’s hockey, traditionally it’s lost. Even a lot of the game tape is hard to find.\"\nAfter the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) put all its archived artifacts and its trophies up for auction as part of the liquidation process of its collapse, several members of the women's hockey community raised concerns about the possibility that it could lead to a significant erasure of the game's history. The CWHL put all 9 of the league's trophies on the auction block, including the Angela James Bowl which was awarded to the leading point scorer each season, and the Jayna Hefford Trophy which was awarded to the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Trophies for the Coach of the Year, Goaltender of the Year, and Rookie of the Year were also auctioned off.\nThe Clarkson Cup, named after former Canadian Governor General, Adrian Clarkson, was designed by Inuit artists and depicted the sea goddess, Sedna."

        "title": "2020–21 American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2020–21 American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey season was the 73rd season of play for the program, the 25th at the Division I level, and the 18th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Yellow Jackets represented American International College and were coached by Eric Lang, in his 5th season.\nThe start of the college hockey season was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, American International's first scheduled game was in late-November as opposed to early-October, which was the norm.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of American International's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAmerican International entered the season needing to replace a great deal of experience on its roster. The Yellow Jackets had more than a third of the previous team's players leave, mostly through graduation, and the remaining upperclassmen would need to remain steady while the coaching staff brought the new players along. The large influx of players included the program's first ever NHL draft pick in Jake Kucharski, a transfer from Providence, which demonstrated how much the program had risen in Eric Lang's short time as head coach. The team got off to a good start, winning their first five matches, but AIC faced its first big test in late December when they played Quinnipiac. The Yellow Jackets were embarrassed in the first game but recovered in the second; though they lost the team did show that it could compete with other ranked teams. As a result, the team's national ranking fell just one spot despite losing both games.\nAIC played well over the next month, going 8–1 and placing themselves as the team to beat in Atlantic Hockey. Unfortunately, COVID cancellations torpedoed the team's schedule and the Yellow Jackets didn't play a single game over the succeeding 7 weeks. Even the team's quarterfinal match in the conference tournament was scratched due to COVID. When the Jackets finally played a game the team looked a bit out of sorts. They were finally able to knock some of the rust off in the third period of their semifinal game to escape with a 2–1 win. They had to come from behind to win the championship as well but the title gave AIC every league crown for a three-year period, making them the first Atlantic Hockey program to achieve that feat.\nDespite a stellar 15–3 record and both conference championships (regular- and post-season) AIC was given the 16th-overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and had to face top-seeded North Dakota in the opening round. The Yellow Jackets still appeared rusty at the start of the game, surrendering 4 goals and being outshot 7–13. The huge lead allowed UND to hang back and play defense for the remainder of the match, giving the Jackets few opportunities to cut into the lead. AIC eventually lost 1–5 but the question remains; just how badly was the team affected by their neatly 2-month layoff?\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Thomas Ahern (rugby union)",
        "text": "Thomas Ahern (born 22 February 2000) is an Irish rugby union player who plays as a lock for United Rugby Championship club Munster.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ahern's parents were from Cork GAA families and Ahern initially favoured those sports, but when a cousin's friend dropped out of a summer rugby camp being held just across the border in Youghal, Ahern stepped in and ended up playing with Youghal RFC for five years, until moving to Dungarvan RFC aged 14, which was closer to Ahern's school. In his sixth year of school, Ahern moved to Waterpark RFC and into the second row, having previously played as a fullback, and by this stage he was on the Munster pathway too, having linked up with the East Munster cadets and then progressing to the Munster under-17s squad and onto Munster under-18s and Ireland Schools.\nAhern attended St Augustine's College and represented Munster and Ireland at under-18 clubs level, winning an inter-provincial title with the former during the 2017–18 season. He is currently studying food science and health at the University of Limerick.\nMunster.\nAhern joined the Munster academy ahead of the 2018–19 season. Due to a number of players being away for the 2019 Rugby World Cup with Ireland, Ahern and the other academy players spent their pre-season training for the 2019–20 season with the remaining senior players, with Ahern pointing in particular to the influence veteran lock Billy Holland had on his development. Ahern made his senior competitive debut for Munster in their 2020–21 Pro14 round 4 fixture against Welsh side Dragons on 1 November 2020, coming on as a 61st minute replacement for Jean Kleyn in Munster's 28–16 away win. He made his first start and scored his first try for Munster in their 52–3 win against Italian side Zebre on 30 November 2020. Ahern was Man-of-the-Match for Munster in their 31–17 win against Italian side Benetton in round 16 of the 2020–21 Pro14 on 19 March 2021.\nAhern joined the senior squad on a two-year contract from the 2021–22 season, and signed a two-year contract extension in October 2022. A shoulder injury sustained in the same month required surgery, ruling Ahern out until possibly March 2023.\nIreland.\nAhern earned one cap and scored two tries for Ireland under-18 clubs against Portugal under-18s in November 2017, and won two caps for Ireland under-19s in their capped friendlies against France under-19s in April 2019. One month later, Ahern was selected in the Ireland under-20s squad for the 2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship, his first call up at that level internationally. He made his under-20s debut when he started in the third pool fixture against Italy on 12 June 2019. Ireland won 38–14, though Ahern left the field injured during the first half. He recovered in time to start in the 30–23 win against England on 17 June and the 40–17 defeat against New Zealand in the 7th-8th place play-off on 22 June.\nSelected again in the under-20s squad for the 2020 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, Ahern started and scored a try in the 38–26 win against Scotland on 31 January, as well as starting in the 36–22 win against Wales on 7 February and scoring two tries in the 39–21 away win against England on 21 February, a victory that secured the triple crown for Ireland. Though the remainder of the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ahern earned widespread praise for his performances.\nThough he wasn't called up to the senior Ireland squad, Ahern was selected to train with the squad as a development player during the 2021 Autumn internationals. Ahern was selected in the Emerging Ireland squad that travelled to South Africa to participate in the Toyota Challenge against Currie Cup teams Free State Cheetahs, Griquas and Pumas in September–October 2022. He started in Emerging Ireland's 54–7 opening win against Griquas on 30 September, featured as a replacement in the 28–24 win against the Pumas on 5 October, before starting again in the 21–14 win against the Cheetahs on 9 October.\nFollowing the Toyota Challenge, Ahern was also selected in the Ireland A panel that joined the senior Ireland team after round 7 of the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship to face an All Blacks XV on 4 November 2022, however, a shoulder injury ruled Ahern out of the match."

Earlier in the day London beat the South &amp; South-West 13–4 in the play-off for third and fourth place.\nResults.\nReport.\nThe 1981-82 Rothmans Rugby Yearbook noted that the championship's final round of matches was ruined by weather variously described as 'vile' and 'unspeakable'. Only a small crowd braved the atrocious weather and witnessed players struggling to come to terms with the conditions. In a repeat of the tournament's previous final, the North once again beat the Midlands to retain the title they won at the inaugural staging of the competition in 1977–78.\nThe pitch was reported as \"wet and muddy\" and the difference between the teams identified as the North pack managing the conditions slightly better than their opponents under the guidance of England's Grand Slam captain Bill Beaumont. Penalty goals were kicked by North's Johnson and Patrick."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Skyhawks represent the University of Tennessee at Martin in the NCAA Division I Ohio Valley Conference.\nUT Martin began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1951, initially as a member of the Volunteer State Athletic Conference and competing in the NAIA. The Skyhawks, nicknamed \"Pacers\" before 1995–96, joined the NCAA in 1971 as a member of the Gulf South Conference, then competing in the NCAA College Division. When the NCAA split the College Division in 1973, creating the limited-scholarship Division II and the non-scholarship Division III, the Gulf South, including UT Martin, moved to Division II. The Pacers moved to Division I in 1991. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions.\nThe NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its current records (as of 2019–20) for single-game and single-season assists were both set in 1972–73, and the career record for blocks dates to 1975. The NCAA had recorded individual assists for two seasons in the early 1950s, but did not resume doing so until 1983–84, and even then only in Division I. The NCAA did not begin officially recording assists in its two lower divisions until 1988–89. As for blocks and steals, they were first recorded in D-I in that same 1988–89 season; by the time those statistics were recorded in D-II and D-III (1992–93), UT Martin had joined D-I. The UT Martin record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which the school was a member.\nThese lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

On September 29, 1965, then President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation No. 461 which separated portions of land from the reservation and declared them as part of the AFP Officers' Village and also made the transferred land alienable and disposable except for areas reserved for public or quasi-judicial purposes.\nThe Navy Golf Club was developed in 1976, upon the proposal of Philippine Navy Flag Officer-in-Command Admiral Ernesto Ogbinar. The Navy set up the Philippine Navy Golf Club Inc. to manage the golf club.\nLand ownership dispute.\nThe status of the golf course's land was in dispute. It was argued that the Philippine Navy wrongly took over lots owned by Merardo Abaya, Ruben Follosco, Elias Santa Clara and the heirs of Angelito Maglonzo which were part of the AFP Officers' Village to develop a golf course. The Philippine Navy insists that the golf course was built in inalienable land citing Proclamation No. 461 and pointed out the golf course' purpose as a security buffer and training ground for the navy to support its claim that the golf course should be considered as public land. However the legal case culminated in 2020, with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Abaya, Fullosco, Santa Clara, and Maglonzo. The high court disagreed with the Navy's arguments pointed out that Proclamation No. 461 which was issued in 1965 can't be used to claim land intended as housing for military veterans for other purposes."

The Pioneers represented Sacred Heart University and were coached by C. J. Marottolo, in his 12th season.\nThe start of the college hockey season was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, Sacred Heart's first scheduled game was in late-November as opposed to early-October, which was the norm.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Sacred Heart's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nComing off of the best season in the history of the program, Sacred Heart saw a bit of a decline. The team finished 6–10–2 but the record does not reflect the difficulties that the team faced during the season. The Pioneers were not alone in suffering through COVID-related cancellations, but Sacred Heart saw their opposition increase in difficulty as a result. Many of their cancelled games were against weaker teams and the Pioneers added a set of games with Quinnipiac, a team that was ranked throughout the season. Additionally, Sacred Heart played Army (another ranked team) six times during the season, a full third of their games. While SHU kept most of those matches close they did lose to the Black Knights 5 times during the season, which accounts for half of the team's losses. It would be difficult to come away with any conclusions about Sacred Heart's season other than the team had to weather several storms during the year.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Golden Griffins represented Canisius College and were coached by Trevor Large, in his 4th season.\nThe start of the college hockey season was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, Canisius's first scheduled game was in late-November as opposed to early-October, which was the norm.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Canisius' players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nEven after being delayed, Canisius had the start of their season disrupted by cancellations and postponements. The Golden Griffins played two games over a 62-day period. In February the team was finally able to put a string of games together and showed themselves to be one of the better teams in the western pod of Atlantic Hockey teams. After a four-game winning streak, Canisius was nearing their first top-20 ranking in years but the team was swept by a down Air Force club. Due to Canisius having so few games on their schedule, the losses to Air Force meant that the team had little chance of making the NCAA Tournament without winning their conference tournament.\nAfter the Golden Griffins dispatched RIT in the quarterfinals, they had to get past a very strong Army team to reach the championship. The two teams battled through a close game, needing overtime to decide the winner, and J. D. Pogue's marker sent the Griffs to the title game. Canisius was unable to overcome American International despite the Yellow Jackets facing their own COVID problems and had to settle for second place. Canisius had a slim chance of being selected as an at-large bid but when the tournament teams were released, Atlantic Hockey was essentially disregarded, with league-leading AIC being given the 16th and final space in the bracket.\nThe program has a great deal to be proud of from this season. The runner-up finish was the second best performance the team had ever achieved and, despite playing less than half as many games as the year before, Canisius won more games. With sophomore Jacob Barczewski establishing himself as the team's starting goaltender, the Golden Griffins are well-placed for next season.\nJohn Stampohar and MacGregor Sinclair sat out the season.\nRoster.\nAs of September 17, 2020.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

He helped lead Wink's football team to a 29 game winning streak. he finished second in the discus at the 1940 Texas state high school track meet. \nAfter being recruited by Texas, TCU, Texas Tech and the Naval Academy, Callahan chose to play at Tech. In his Sophomore season he helped Tech to a 9-2 record and a trip to the Sun Bowl. The next year he helped them win a share of the 1942 Border Conference championship and was named all-conference. He also played basketball for Tech, but not track as they did not have a track team that season. Going into 1943 he was voted co-captain of the team. \nAfter the start of World War II, Callahan had joined the Navy and in August of 1943 he was called to duty and transferred to Texas for V-5 pre-flight training. In October he was given permission by the Navy to play football for Texas, which he did and was called Texas' \"lend-lease fullback\" as a result. He immediately contributed with his rushing, receiving, kicking and blocking; scoring four touchdowns in his first 3 games. Despite missing the first three games of the season, he finished the season as the Southwest Conference's 2nd leading scoring and made the AP's All-Southwest Conference first team. The team went 7-1. won the conference championship and played to 7-7 tie against Randolph Field and it's team of all-stars in the 1944 Cotton Bowl Classic. \nAs soon as the season ended, he was shipped off to Athens, GA for Naval Pre-Flight school where he excelled on the obstacle course and in the classroom. \nHe was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round (13th overall pick) of the 1944 NFL Draft, but had to miss two seasons in the NFL due to his military service. \nA foot injury limited his playing time during the 1946 season, and he only played in 9 games for the Lions. He returned to the Lions in 1947, but was injured in training camp, went on the injured reserve list and then returned to Tech to get his degree. \nAfter finishing his football career and graduating, he worked as a sales manager of a Lubbock car dealership and then at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \nAfter a round of golf in El Paso in March of 1978, he suffered a fatal heart attack and died at 57 years old.\nIn 1999, Odessa American newspaper named him the 20th Century's best high school football player from the Permian Basin.

        "text": "The Detroit Mercy Titans basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Detroit Mercy Titans men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Titans represent the University of Detroit Mercy (UDM) in the NCAA Division I Horizon League.\nUDM was established in its current form in 1990, when the University of Detroit (UD) merged with the nearby Mercy College of Detroit. With the merger, UDM inherited the UD athletic program, along with all of its records. The history of UDM men's basketball thus dates to UD's first season of basketball competition in 1905, when the school was known as Detroit College. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nOfficial NCAA basketball records date only to the 1937–38 season, the first of what it calls the \"modern era\" of men's basketball, following the abolition of the center jump after each made basket. Official statistical rankings in scoring began in 1947–48. Individual rebounds and assists were first officially recorded in the 1950–51 season; while rebounds have been recorded in each subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season, not resuming that practice until 1983–84. Individual blocks and steals were first officially recorded in 1985–86. UDM nonetheless includes player statistics from all men's basketball seasons in its record books, regardless of whether the NCAA officially recorded those statistics in the relevant seasons.\nThese lists are updated through UDM's win over Purdue Fort Wayne in the first round of the 2023 Horizon League tournament. Currently active players are indicated in bold."

        "text": "Mitchell Miller (born December 20, 2001) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was drafted 111th overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, but had his draft status revoked after it emerged that he had repeatedly subjected a disabled black classmate to extreme bullying throughout multiple years of grade school. A commitment to join the University of North Dakota was also ended as a result of Miller's past conduct, and in 2021 he re-joined the Tri-City Storm. In November 2022, he signed an entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins, but the team parted ways with him two days later after intense backlash.\nEarly life.\nMiller was born in Sylvania, Ohio on December 20, 2001, to John and Shelli Miller.\nPlaying career.\nStarting in 2018, Miller played for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders in the United States Hockey League (USHL). He played two games during the 2017–18 season, and stayed with the team for the entire 2018–19 season. During the season, he was called up to the United States men's national junior ice hockey team to play in the 2018 World Junior A Challenge. After the end of the 2018–19 USHL season, Miller was traded to the Tri-City Storm. Miller had committed to play for the Miami University men's ice hockey team and was expected to join the Red Hawks for the 2019–20 season. However, he de-committed, and opted to spend the 2019–20 season playing for Tri-City, where he finished the season with 33 points. He also earned an all-USHL first team selection, an honor bestowed on the best players in the league as determined by the votes of the league's general managers. He was once again called up to the United States junior team for the 2019 World Junior A Challenge where he had two goals and four assists in six games. In May 2020, Miller committed to play for the University of North Dakota men's ice hockey team.\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, the Arizona Coyotes used their first pick, in the 4th round (111th overall), to select Miller. On October 29, 2020, the Coyotes renounced the draft rights to Miller. The next day, he was dropped from the University of North Dakota hockey team.\nOn November 4, 2022, Miller signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins. The next day, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman stated that Miller was not eligible to play in the NHL, adding, \"I can't tell you that he'll ever be eligible to come into the NHL.\"\nOn November 6, 2022, the Bruins parted ways with Miller following considerable pressure from fans and current Bruins players. The club stated it had severed ties with Miller, although he was still technically under contract with the Bruins at the time. As of December 23, 2022, he had earned over $116,000 from that contract.\nIn February 2023, the Bruins reached an agreement with Miller that permanently ended his association with the club. Miller received an undisclosed sum of money and was granted free agency, under a condition of confidentiality. The existence of the deal was not reported to the public until July 2023 in a \"New York Post\" article, which also stated that Mitchell was expected to try to play for a team in Europe.\nOn August 2, 2023, Miller signed with MHk 32 Liptovský Mikuláš of the Slovak Extraliga.\nBullying incidents.\nIn 2016, Miller and a classmate were found delinquent in an Ohio juvenile court on charges of assault and a violation of the Ohio Safe Schools Act. The pair were accused and found guilty of deceiving a developmentally disabled African American classmate, Isaiah Meyer-Crothers, into eating a piece of candy that they had wiped in a urinal, repeated bullying of Meyer-Crothers, and repeatedly calling him a nigger. Surveillance video also captured them kicking and punching Meyer-Crothers.\nThe bullying incidents resurfaced after \"The Arizona Republic\" published an in-depth report on Miller on October 26, 2020. The \"Republic\" exposé also revealed that Miller would frequently use the words \"nigger\" and \"BROWNIE\" to refer to Meyer-Crothers and often told him to \"go pick their cotton\". The Coyotes initially defended Miller, citing their desire to \"be a part of the solution in a real way\" and to help Miller grow from this incident and eventually become a leader against bullying and racism. Although Coyotes general manager Bill Armstrong did not draft Miller, he expressed the team's desire to provide Miller with a second chance.\nAccording to the \"Republic,\" Miller apologized to the then 31 NHL teams (the Seattle Kraken had not formally joined the league at the time), but never to Meyer-Crothers or to his family. In a letter addressed to the Coyotes, Meyer-Crothers' mother, Joni, found Armstrong's comments demeaning to her son, stating that while Miller's classmate apologized to Meyer-Crothers, Miller himself was unwilling to show remorse. A juvenile court magistrate in Ohio concluded that Miller had absolutely no remorse for his actions against Meyer-Crothers and was merely upset that his reputation would be damaged by the situation. As a result of the exposé, the Coyotes received widespread criticism for drafting Miller. This ultimately led to the Coyotes renouncing their draft rights to Miller and cutting all ties with him. A day later, Miller was dropped from the University of North Dakota's hockey team as well. According to UND president Andrew Armacost, school officials and Miller's family mutually agreed that Miller should no longer be on the team.\nMore details about the bullying surfaced after \"The Independent\" published a detailed letter from the Meyer-Crothers family, reiterating that Miller has not apologized to the family, and detailing further accusations about Miller's behavior, including repeated use of the word \"nigger\", spitting in Meyer-Crothers' face, and smacking and punching Meyer-Crothers on the school bus starting as early as 1st grade. Miller claimed that his court-mandated apology letter was read to the Meyer-Crothers family, but the Meyer-Crothers family informed the Bruins that the apology was only made through social media.\nCareer statistics.\nInternational.\nSource:"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Blue Devils represent Central Connecticut State University in the NCAA's Northeast Conference.\nCentral Connecticut began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1934. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Central Connecticut's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Charles Gregory (rugby)",
        "text": "Charles Gregory (2 July 1901 – 12 October 1988) was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in 40 matches including 3 tests from 1925 to 1930. When he debuted for New Zealand in 1925 he became Kiwi number 171. He predominantly played fullback during his career though he played standoff and centre at various points. He also represented Auckland in both rugby league and rugby union and played for the Ponsonby rugby club and the Marist rugby league club.\nEarly life.\nCharles Edward Gregory was born on 2 July 1901. He was the son of mother Johanna Drysdale Gregory, and father William John Gregory. He had four older brothers, Thomas (1891-1975), William James (1895-1977), Frederick Arthur (1898-1979), and George Robert (1896-1963), and a younger brother Albert John (1904-1983). He also had three older sisters, Annie (1887-1924), Mary Elizabeth (1889-1979), and Rose (1893-1942).\nPlaying career.\nSchool rugby.\nGregory attended Mount Albert Grammar School and played rugby in the five eighth position for their rugby side in 1913 and 1914.\nNewton Rangers rugby league.\nIn 1921 Gregory was playing for the Newton Rangers club which was representative of the inner city suburb of the same name. He spent most of the season in the second grade team which won the championship and is in the back row of their end of season photograph. He did however play in the first grade side on some occasions, such as their season opening match.\nRugby union, Ponsonby and Auckland.\nHe began playing rugby for the Ponsonby club in Auckland. Gregory played for the 2nd grade team from 1919 to 1921. During the 1921 season he was selected in the Auckland junior representative team to play Thames juniors in the five-eighths position. The match was played at Eden Park with Gregory kicking a conversion in a 26–0 win. He then played for them in a 10–6 win against the Manukau sub-union senior representative side as curtain-raiser to the Auckland-Wellington match. His last game for them was against Whangarei B in Whangārei with Auckland winning 25–3.\nIn 1922 he began the season in the Ponsonby juniors for the first round but was then promoted to the first grade side for their 6 May match with Grafton. They won 11–3 on the number 1 field at Eden Park. His first points for them were in a 31–3 win in front of 4,000 spectators. He kicked 5 conversions and a penalty. He then scored 2 tries and kicked 2 goals in a 17–8 win over North Shore. In July Gregory was selected to play for Auckland B against Thames Valley in Paeroa. Auckland B won 18–3 with Gregory playing in the halves. Then on 28 July he made his full Auckland debut in an 8–6 win over North Auckland at Kensington Park, Whangārei. Gregory kicked a conversion which were the points which ultimately won the match. He was later selected to go on the Auckland 'southern tour' but was expected to join the team with reinforcements when they arrived at Wellington but he did not make the trip. Gregory finished the season having played 11 times for Ponsonby. His final rugby match was in their 7 a-side team which beat Eden in the tournament final 20–0 with Gregory kicking 4 conversions. The match was played at Avondale Racecourse as part of a full day of 7 a-side games across several grades.\nIn 1923 he again pulled on the Ponsonby jersey playing 12 games for their first grade side and kicking 13 goals for them. After 2 rounds there was discussion of who would replace Stuart Findlay at fullback for Auckland as he was not going to play in 1923. It was said of Gregory that he was \"easily the best custodian that has been seen on the main ground Eden Park so far\". \"He has gained a deal in weight and confidence since last season, and if he keeps up the form shown on Saturday he should be in the running\".\nGregory did indeed gain selection for Auckland and he was their regular fullback throughout the representative season. His first match was against Southland and he was forced from the field with an injury early in the first half in an easy 37–3 win at Eden Park on 4 August. He dived in to stop an attack and received a head injury. He recovered in time to play fullback again against Taranaki in a 30–9 win in front of 12,000 spectators at Eden Park. On 18 August at the same venue he had little to do defensively in a 58–0 win over Wanganui. A win over Northland 33-6 followed. He was again safe at fullback for Auckland's 16–5 win over Otago in front of the largest crowd of the season at Eden Park of 13,000. A feature of his play had been his positional play, solid defense, and good return kicking which became a hallmark of his career.\nGregory's next representative match was for the Auckland Provincial team made up of players from the larger Auckland region with the opponents the touring New South Wales team. The match was played in front of 15,000 spectators at Eden Park on 8 September. Auckland won 27 to 11 with Gregory heavily involved. He then played for his Auckland side in a 21–15 win over Wellington, once again at Eden Park. Auckland's most significant match of the season was next for Gregory. They travelled to McLean Park in Napier to take on Hawke's Bay for the Ranfurly Shield. With 10,000 in attendance the Hawke's Bay side retained the shield with a 20–5 win. After Sheen was injured Gregory moved into the five-eighth position, James Molloy replacing him at fullback. Gregory and Karl Ifwersen were said to be defending George Nēpia and Lui Paewai \"especially well\" before he was later moved back to fullback. It was later said that he was a disappointment at fullback. His final game in an Auckland rugby jersey came in a match against King Country at Taumarunui which Auckland won 18–9. He was named in the reserves to play against Hawke's Bay in their 'return match' at Eden Park but he did not take the field with Malloy being preferred in the fullback position, and so his playing season came to an end.\nSwitch to rugby league, Marist Old Boys (Saints) and Auckland debuts.\nGregory began the 1924 season playing for Ponsonby once again, however his only appearance was in their first round match against University. They won 6–0 with Gregory kicking 2 penalty goals. He then applied for permission to play rugby league and at the Auckland Rugby League management committee meeting on 8 May he was granted reinstatement to the Marist Old Boys club. His debut was against the Ponsonby rugby league side in a 10–3 win at Carlaw Park in front of 3,000 spectators with Gregory converting both Marist tries. The New Zealand Herald reported that \"a smoother display of fullback play than that given by Gregory has not often been seen on Carlaw Park\". The following week their match was postponed and then Gregory was selected in the Auckland training squad to prepare for a match against the touring Australian Universities side. He ultimately did not make the playing XIII. Gregory then played in 2 more Marist wins over Richmond Rovers and Athletic respectively before being chosen in the 'Auckland' Possible trial side which played the probables as a curtain-raiser to the Auckland v Australian Universities 3rd match on 14 June. Gregory played in his regular fullback position and kicked a conversion in a 14–9 win to the Possibles.\nHe played 4 more matches for Marist who were thrashing most opponents and on their way to their first ever first grade title. These games were punctuated by an appearance for Auckland B against Hamilton on 16 July. He kicked 2 conversions in a 28–18 win at Carlaw Park. Then following another win for Marist over City Rovers Gregory was selected for Auckland to play against the touring England. Auckland went down 11–24 in front of an enormous crowd of 20,000 at Carlaw Park. It was said of Gregory that he \"did fairly well, but was bustled at times by the opposing forwards\". That was Gregory's final representative match of the season though he played 8 further matches for Marist including the championship final with Devonport United which Marist won 20–17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000. Gregory kicked 3 conversions and a penalty in the victory.\nNew Zealand selection and debut.\nThe 1925 season saw Gregory make his New Zealand debut when he was selected to go on the New Zealand tour of Australia. He had played 7 matches for Marist kicking 15 goals prior to selection. Tragedy marred the Marist campaign however with Gregory's teammate Bill Stormont succumbing to Rheumatic heart disease on 4 June with Marist's match 2 days later being cancelled. Gregory was selected to play in an Auckland trial match on 27 June which his \"A Team\" lost 0–5. He was described multiple times in a match report as being as usual 'safe' in the fullback position. He was then picked for the tour and made his debut prior to their departure in a match against Auckland. He played fullback in a 16–9 win in a sea of mud at Carlaw Park but still managed to give a \"fine display\". His selection was as part of a 22-man squad which departed aboard the Moeraki to Sydney on 3 July. He was chosen as one of two fullbacks alongside New Zealand incumbent Craddock Dufty. He was joined in the squad by Marist teammates Hec Brisbane, Jack Kirwan, and Jim O'Brien.\nGregory was omitted from the first two matches of the tour and made his first appearance against Newcastle on 18 July. New Zealand won 29–11 before 8,000 spectators at Newcastle Sports Ground with Gregory at fullback, with Dufty playing in the centres. He then played in the 5th match of the tour against New South Wales on 25 July at the Newcastle Sports Ground again. A crowd of 13,000 saw New Zealand with an upset 17–10 win. Gregory was mentioned for his defence during the match saving New Zealand on several occasions with his tackling and kicking. He was in the reserves for the match with Queensland but came on through injury early in the match with Jim Parkes leaving the field. New Zealand went down heavily 43–19 at the Exhibition Oval in Queensland though Gregory along with Wilson Hall and Maurice Wetherill were named as the \"outstanding New Zealand players\" with Gregory playing a \"brilliant game\" before a crowd of 28,000. He was fullback again in a 21–22 loss to Ipswich at the North Ipswich Reserve on 5 August. The tour was not going well from a results point of view with Gregory again involved in the 5th loss of the tour in match 9 against the Queensland team. New Zealand going down 20–29. He was then in the side which was defeated by Toowoomba 14–16 at the Athletic Oval there on 12 August before a crowd of 4,500. This time however he was playing in the centres with Dufty at fullback. In what was overall a disappointing tour New Zealand recorded their most impressive win over New South Wales 19–18 at the Sydney Cricket Ground before 16,000 spectators on 15 August. The final match of the tour which Gregory was again at fullback saw New Zealand on the losing side 25–26 to a Southern Division side at Cootamundra. The game was marked by the local team receiving 28 free kicks to New Zealand's 3 with the New Zealand side expressing \"strong dissatisfaction with the referee's rulings\".\nAfter their return the New Zealand side played Auckland at Carlaw Park and thrashed them 41–17. Gregory was heavily involved both defensively and on attack. A week later they met the Queensland side which was touring New Zealand. A crowd of 18,000 people were on hand to see New Zealand win 25–24 with a large second half comeback after trailing 19–5 at halftime. Four days later he was again at fullback for Auckland's 18–18 draw against the same opponents. He gave a \"sound display\" stopping several Queensland attacks. Gregory was then part of the New Zealand team who played Queensland once again but this time they were badly defeated 14–35. Gregory was busy at fullback though and was said to be \"sound\" though \"overshadowed by Jim Craig, the Queensland fullback\".\nTo this point in the season Gregory had played 21 matches which was an abnormally large amount for a New Zealand rugby league player in this era, however he was not finished yet. On 19 September he represented Auckland in a match with South Auckland (Waikato) which Auckland won 36–19 and thus retained the Northern Union Cup. He then played in the Stormont Shield semi-final which was a trophy played for in honour of his teammate who had passed away earlier in the year, Bill Stormont. Marist lost 22–23 to Ponsonby though Gregory scored a rare try and kicked 5 goals for a 13-point haul. Then in the final match of the Auckland season he kicked 2 conversions in a 16–26 loss to Ponsonby as part of the Labour Day carnival.\nNew Zealand tour of England.\n1926 was again to be an incredibly busy year for Charles Gregory where he played in 28 matches. He played 6 games for Marist before being selected in the reserves for the Auckland team to play South Auckland (Waikato) on 26 June. However the match which was being played as a trial match for the New Zealand team was so lopsided that at halftime when Auckland led 33–3, six of the Auckland players, including Gregory took the field for the South Auckland side. They ultimately won 49–15. Gregory then played in a trial for the A Team which his side lost 16–25, before a match for Auckland against ‘the rest’ which Auckland lost 21–28. His final trial match was for New Zealand Possibles versus New Zealand Probables, though with 26 players being taken on the tour of England his place was reasonably assured. His possibles side ran out 32-15 winners. The New Zealand Herald reporter wrote that Gregory \"played a particularly sound game … and has seldom given a better exhibition\". Gregory was then named in the New Zealand side for the historic tour of England. He played 2 further club matches for Marist before departing New Zealand shores on 3 August aboard the R.M.M.S Aorangi. It was said that several members of the New Zealand team suffered \"severely from sea-sickness on the trip across the Pacific [and] that C. Gregory was one of the worst cases\". It was so bad in fact that when the team stopped off in Suva, Fiji and played a practice game he along with Ernie Herring were absent due the effects of their sea sickness.\nGregory's first match of the tour was in the 4th game against Rochdale Hornets on 23 September at Athletic Grounds, Rochdale. New Zealand recorded a narrow 11–9 win after a late comeback with Gregory at fullback. He then played in the next match against Widnes which saw New Zealand win 15–5 in front of 6,000 spectators. His third match was in the first test against England at Wigan before 14,550 spectators. New Zealand was defeated 20–28 although Gregory was said to have \"played a grand game at fullback\". He was again a standout in New Zealand's 19–11 win over York in their next match, said to be among the \"best of the visitors\" along with Stan Webb, Bert Avery, and Henry. He was again at fullback 3 days later for the 5–17 loss to Warrington in rain and a heavy gale. He was said to be New Zealand's best player in the match though the team was criticised as being \"third rate\" by the Daily News in England. Gregory scored his first points of the tour when he converted a try in a 35–15 win over Bramley on 13 October. \n He was the hero in the match with Hull which New Zealand won 15–13 before a crowd of 12,000. Hull had not been beaten for 35 consecutive matches on their home ground. During the second half Gregory kicked a penalty goal and then converted Hec Brisbane's try before converting Wilson Hall's last minute try to win the match for New Zealand. New Zealand had their fortunes reversed against Oldham on 23 October when they went down 10-15 although Gregory was said to have \"often cleared well when hard pressed\" before a crowd of 15,000.\nGregory was once again at fullback for the match against Leeds which New Zealand won 13–11 with him said to be \"the safest fullback\". St Helens Recreation proved too strong with a 28–14 win despite having four regular players absent. Gregory converted a try late in the match with the result a foregone conclusion. Gregory was then selected for the second test against England at Hull. New Zealand went down 11-21 before a relatively small crowd of 8,000 as poor results and internal strife in the New Zealand team had done little to inspire interest from the local supporters. Gregory kicked a second half penalty and said to have been \"safe at fullback\". During the match Gregory injured his hand which meant that he was unable to play for a period after the test. Gregory returned to fullback for a 14–16 loss to Swinton 2 weeks later on 27 November. A week later New Zealand played their third test of the tour with Gregory at fullback for their test match with Wales at Pontypridd. New Zealand were thrashed 34–8 in front of 10,000 spectators. On 4 December he was on the end of a 12–22 defeat by St Helens. Then he was unfortunate in the next match with Wigan 3 days later on 11 December. He twisted his knee in the second half and had to leave the field. New Zealand had only trailed 12–14 at the interval but with him and Kirwan having to leave the field New Zealand had to continue with 11 players and fell away to lose 15–36.\nHis knee injury was likely to have been serious because he took no part in the final 9 matches of the tour. Therefore, he finished having played in 15 matches in total. After returning to New Zealand the Auckland-based members of the side then played in a New Zealand XIII against the local Auckland side and they went down 21–24 with Gregory in his usual position at fullback for the returnees.\nContinuation of club career and local representative league.\nGregory returned to the club fields of Auckland in 1927 and played 12 games for Marist before being selected in the Auckland team to play Canterbury on 10 September. Auckland had embarked on a rare tour and the match was played at Monica Park, in Christchurch. Auckland won 24–13 before 3,000 spectators. The local media were particularly impressed by his play saying that \"Wetherill and Gregory had a trick up their sleeves in all sorts of positions, and worked the scissors and reverse passes very cleverly… Dufty was always ready to join in, and at a signal from Gregory… was up in a flash to take a scissors pass…\", and that he is a \"great footballer, who can take all sorts of passes at speed\". He then was part of the Auckland side which defeated Otago at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin 20-13 before a crowd of 2,000. He started in the centres but switched positions with Dufty at halftime. He played in the final tour match against Wellington at Newtown Park in Wellington with Auckland winning 41-23. A week later Gregory was selected to play in the North Island v South Island inter-island match for the first time. He played in the five eighths position and set up Auckland's second try in a 13–8 win. Gregory then finished the season playing in the same position in a match against Buller at Carlaw Park. Auckland romped to a 60–33 win with Gregory for the first time in his senior career scoring 3 tries in a match, and he also kicked a conversion.\nThe 1928 season saw Gregory elected on to the management committee of the Marist Old Boys club as part of the executive committee. He only played one representative match during the season which was for the Auckland Possibles side against the Probables in July. It was part of a series of trial matches in preparation to pick the New Zealand team to play the touring England side. He kicked a conversion though his side lost 14–24 and ultimately he was not selected for the New Zealand side. He did however have a busy year for Marist, playing 16 games for them and kicking 21 goals, and was part of their Roope Rooster, Stormont Shield, and Labour Day tournament winning sides.\nAt the start of the 1929 season Gregory had announced his retirement though one week into the season he was back on the playing field. His club form was very good, and he was the second highest point scorer in the competition with 62 points behind Frank Delgrosso (108), while he scored 71 points for Marist across all 13 games he played for them.\nOn 17 August he played for Auckland against Northland with Auckland winning 22–19, then a week later he was in the side for their easy 47–18 win over Canterbury before 10,000 at Carlaw Park. He then gained selection for the North Island v South Island match. He kicked a conversion though was on the losing side with the South Island securing a 22–13 victory.\nAt the end of the season in October Marist played against the South Sydney side who were the first ever Australian side to tour New Zealand. Marist defeated them 10–9 in front of an enormous crowd of 15,000 with Gregory scoring all of Marists points through 2 tries, a conversion and a penalty. A week later they met again in front of a similar sized crowd though this time they fell 5–21 with Gregory kicking a penalty.\nNew Zealand 1930 tour of Australia.\nSuch was Gregory's consistent form through 1929 and into 1930 that he gained selection for the New Zealand team to tour Australia and was named captain. He had played 5 matches for Marist, scoring 29 points. Then in the New Zealand Probables side in their trial match he scored a try and kicked 3 conversions in their 28–3 win over the Possibles.\nGregory played in 12 of the 13 matches. His first match was against New South Wales in Sydney with New Zealand going down 16–5. He played in the five eighths in 7 of the matches, with the other 5 at fullback. He kicked 3 conversions and a penalty in a 20–14 win against Western Division in the second match of the tour at Bathurst Bathurst Sports Ground. He was at fullback for New Zealand's heavy 29–2 loss to New South Wales before a crowd of 19,060 in Sydney. New Zealand lost three players to injury and eventually only had 10 players on the field. Gregory had a better time of it against New England at Armidale when they won 34–19 and he scored a try. Two losses followed for Gregory and New Zealand against Queensland in Brisbane by 14–11, and 32–6 respectively. They managed a win over Brisbane 19-17 again under the leadership of Gregory though he was at fullback for the match.\nThe side then travelled back down to Sydney where they played the Sydney Metropolis side and went down 39–22 before losing by a similar score of 34–22 to the same opponent 2 days later. Gregory was again leading from fullback against a Southern Division side at Young Showground in the town of Young, New South Wales with New Zealand winning 24–20. The final two matches of the tour continued this winning theme. Gregory had moved back to the five eighth position after spending a few matches at full back and New Zealand defeated Newcastle at the Newcastle Showgrounds 25–22. They then beat a Universities XIII side 18–12 with Gregory crossing the line for a try in what would prove to be his last ever performance for New Zealand against foreign opponents. Upon their return mention was made by the management of the side that injuries had played a huge part in their tour results with 16 of the 22 players injured with some of them serious. Gregory said \"although we are disappointed with the result of the tour, it was casualties that beat us to a large extent. The hard grounds caused a terrible lot of accidents, ankle injuries alone being suffered by seven of the team\". He was also critical of the selection of only one halfback meaning Abbott had to play in every single match.\nLike on previous tours the New Zealand side returned and played against Auckland at Carlaw Park. Gregory was at fullback for New Zealand's 34–27 win, ending his career on a positive note with 4 consecutive wins.\nRetirement and coaching.\nThe 1931 season was to be his last. He had semi retired and only returned to play a handful of matches for Marist to help them as required. He did however play well, and scored 21 points in 5 appearances. His final two matches were in the two end of season wins which secured Marist the Fox Memorial title which was being competed for, for the first time in its history. He ultimately finished with 86 appearances for Marist over his 8 seasons with them. In 1934 he became the coach of the Marist senior side when they finished last in the competition. He continued to coach them in 1935 when they improved and finished mid table. He was unable to continue coaching Marist in 1936 as he had moved to an \"outer district\" of Auckland and \"found it inconvenient to retain a position he has held with credit\". He did however appear to take on the Marist reserve grade side and then mid season he took over the responsibilities of the Ellerslie third grade side in a coaching role indicating he had moved to that area. They went on to win the championship for the grade. One of the players in this third grade side under his tutelage was Arthur McInnarney who became Kiwi number 276 at just 18 years of age in 1939. In 1938 he had transferred to Mt Albert and debuted in the first five position creating an immediate impression.\nPersonal life and death.\nCharles Edward Gregory married Alma Mabel Bridgford (1905-1982) on 24 November 1930. Alma had been born in Auckland in 1905. He worked as a lineman in Auckland. On 12 January 1935 he was seriously injured in a fall from an Auckland Transport Board tower lorry. At the time he was repairing some overhead lines which had been damaged by a tram pole near the junction of Khyber Pass Road and Broadway in Newmarket when the line fell loose and knocked him off the platform. He fell 20 feet to the ground landing on the small of his back and suffered spinal injuries though he did not lose consciousness. He was said to be living at 7 Dorset Street in Westmere at the time. Fortunately he recovered well considering the seriousness of the fall and this was mentioned at the annual meeting of the Marist club 2 and a half months later. He was able to continue with his coaching duties that season with Marist finishing mid table.\nAlma died in 1982 on March 16 aged 77, and Charles died on October 12, 1988, aged 87 in Auckland. They had a daughter named Lois which is noted on their grave stone at Waikumete Cemetery"

The Golden Eagles represent Tennessee Technological University in the NCAA's Ohio Valley Conference.\nTennessee Tech began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1924. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Tennessee Tech's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 27th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter struggling through the previous two seasons, Yale brought in their third coach in as many years. The hiring of Clarence Wanamaker from Dartmouth brought about a resurgence for the program, not least of which because the Bulldogs returned to their expansive schedule that was characteristic of the team before World War I. In another return to form, the New Haven Arena began to host ice hockey games for the first time in years and Yale would finally have a local home after having to play as vagabonds since the start of the war.\nYale played inconsistently throughout the year, playing well in some games and poorly in others. The highlight of the season was winning both games against Princeton, guaranteeing themselves at least a second-place finish in the Triangular League. The experience the players gained from the nineteen games, however, would pay dividends in the coming years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Women's State of Origin",
        "text": "The Women's State of Origin is an annual rugby league fixture between two Australian state representative women's sides, the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons.\nFirst played in 1999 as the Women's Interstate Challenge, the game was rebranded as State of Origin for the 2018 season. Queensland won the first game in 1999 and were unbeaten for 17 years until New South Wales won for the first time in 2016.\nHistory.\nWomen's Interstate Challenge (1999–2017).\nDespite women's rugby league first being played in Australia in 1921, the first official game between Queensland and New South Wales was not held until 1999. The two teams met at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium with Queensland winning 16–6.\nAccurate records were not kept in the early years of the Interstate Challenge by either the QRL or the NSWRL, with many player records and game information still unknown. For many years, the women's teams were run by their own governing bodies, the Queensland Women's Rugby League and the New South Wales Women's rugby league, who were affiliated with the QRL and NSWRL.\nBefore coming under the State of Origin banner in 2018, the sides were not known as the 'Blues' and 'Maroons', with the Queensland side being known as the 'Brolgas'. In 2005, the teams began playing for the Nellie Doherty Cup. Nellie Doherty was a pioneer of the women's game in Australia, helping to launch the sport in 1921.\nAlthough the majority of early Women's Interstate Challenges were one-off fixtures, the sides would occasionally play a series of games, such as in 2004 and 2008.\nIn 2015, Queensland failed to defeat New South Wales for the first time, with the sides drawing 4–all at Townsville's 1300SMILES Stadium and Queensland retaining the Nellie Doherty Cup. On 23 July 2016, New South Wales defeated Queensland for the first time, ending Queensland's 17-year undefeated streak, with an 8–4 victory at the Gold Coast's Cbus Super Stadium. On 23 July 2017, in the final game played under the Women's Interstate Challenge name, New South Wales defeated Queensland for the second time, winning 22–6 at WIN Stadium in Wollongong.\nState of Origin (2018–present).\nOn 6 December 2017, the National Rugby League announced that the Women's Interstate Challenge would be rebranded as the Women's State of Origin. The game which, was previously played as a curtain-raiser, would now be a standalone fixture broadcast on the Nine Network and Fox Sports. With the game under the State of Origin banner, the Nellie Doherty Cup was replaced by a shield, with the player of the match now receiving the Nellie Doherty Medal.\nOn 22 June 2018, New South Wales won the first Women's State of Origin game, defeating Queensland 16–10 at North Sydney Oval. Blues' centre Isabelle Kelly, who scored two tries in the win, won the inaugural Nellie Doherty Medal. On 21 June 2019, New South Wales defeated Queensland for the fourth consecutive year, winning 14–4 at North Sydney Oval, with Blues halfback Maddie Studdon being awarded the Nellie Doherty Medal.\nThe 2020 game was originally due to be played in June at Sunshine Coast Stadium, but was moved to the post-season for the first time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The game was played in Queensland for the first time under the State of Origin banner and for the first time overall since 2016. Queensland defeated New South Wales 24–18, winning their first official State of Origin game and their first game since 2014.\nThe 2021 match is historically notable for being the first Women's State of Origin fixture where the players, coaches and on-field officials were all women.\nBroadcasting.\nWithin Australia, the game is simulcast on the Nine Network and Fox Sports.\nIn 2013 and 2014, the game was livestreamed. In 2015 and 2016, the game aired on Fox Sports as a replay the day after the game. In 2017, the game aired live on Fox Sports for the first time.\nSelection rules.\n \nPrior to 2019, the Queensland and New South Wales teams were largely selected under residency rules, meaning a number of players represented both states. For example, Tahnee Norris (who captained Queensland) and Natalie Dwyer, both represented New South Wales before moving to Queensland. Innisfail's Tarah Westera represented Queensland before moving to Penrith, where she represented New South Wales, later returning and playing for Queensland.\nIn 2019, the eligibility rules were revised to be more inline with the men's State of Origin rules. The residency rule was removed, which saw New Zealand representatives Maitua Feterika (Queensland) and Nita Maynard (New South Wales) ruled ineligible. Queensland Rona Peters, who had previously represented New Zealand, was also originally ruled ineligible. This was later overturned and she was given special dispensation, as she had retired from international rugby league in 2015, before she first represented Queensland in 2016.\nNellie Doherty Medal.\nThe Nellie Doherty Medal is awarded to the player of the match. The medal was first awarded in 2018 to New South Wales' Isabelle Kelly after the first official Women's State of Origin game and Kelly became the first player to win the award twice winning it again in 2022\nResults.\nAccurate records were not kept in early years of the Women's Interstate Challenge by either the QRL or the NSWRL. In 2004, 2008 and 2023 two games were played instead of a one-off fixture. \nMatch Details.\n2006.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2006 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2006 /&gt;\n2007.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2007 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2007 /&gt;\n2008.\nGame 1 &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2008game1 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2008game1 /&gt;\nGame 2&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2008game2 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2008game2 /&gt;\n2009.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2009 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2009 /&gt;\n2010.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2010 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2010 /&gt;\n2011.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2011 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2011 /&gt;\n2012.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2012 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2012 /&gt;\n2013.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2013 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2013 /&gt;\n2014.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2014 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2014 /&gt;\n2015.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2015 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2015 /&gt;\n2016.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2016 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2016 /&gt;\n2017.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLInterstate2017 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLInterstate2017 /&gt;\n2018.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2018 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2018 /&gt;\n2019.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2019 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2019 /&gt;\n2020.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2020 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2020 /&gt;\n2021.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2021 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2021 /&gt;\n2022.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2022 /&gt;\n &lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2022 /&gt;\n2023.\n&lt;section begin=WomenRLOrigin2023 /&gt;\nA two-match series to be decided if the teams win one match each on aggregate. &lt;br&gt;\nGame 1&lt;br&gt;\nGame 2&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;section end=WomenRLOrigin2022 /&gt;"

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020–21",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Bangladesh in January and February 2021 to play two Tests and three One Day International (ODI) matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship and the ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nOn 29 December 2020, Cricket West Indies announced their squads for the tour, with Kraigg Brathwaite and Jason Mohammed named as captains for the Test and ODI matches respectively. Regular Test and ODI captains Jason Holder and Kieron Pollard were two of ten players who opted not to travel due to COVID-19 concerns or personal reasons. Shakib Al Hasan was named in Bangladesh's ODI squad, after serving a year-long ban for failing to report a corrupt approach.\nThe first ODI saw seven cricketers make their debut in the format, six of them for the West Indies. Bangladesh won the opening match by six wickets, with more than 16 overs to spare. Bangladesh won the second ODI by seven wickets to take an unassailable lead in the series. Bangladesh won the third and final ODI by 120 runs, taking the series 3–0.\nThe West Indies won the first Test by three wickets, with Kyle Mayers scoring an unbeaten double century on debut. The West Indies also won the second Test, by 17 runs, to take the series 2–0.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to have three Tests, three ODIs and two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. In October 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced that the Bangabandhu T20 Cup would be used as the criteria to select players for the T20I matches. In November 2020, the BCB sent details of their bio-bubble plan to Cricket West Indies (CWI). Officials from CWI visited Bangladesh during November and December 2020, and reported that they were \"very impressed\" with the COVID-19 protocols in the country.\nIn November 2020, the two cricket boards also looked at the possibility of reducing the tour by one Test match, per a request that was made by the West Indies. In December 2020, both cricket boards agreed to play two Test matches instead of three, and dropped the T20I fixtures from the tour itinerary. On 10 January 2021, the BCB updated the tour itinerary, including changing the start times of the ODI matches and reducing the four-day tour match to a three-day fixture.\nBangladesh did not have any umpires on the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. As a result, England's Richard Illingworth was named as one of the umpires for the Test matches, the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that a neutral umpire was named for a Test series.\nSquads.\nRomario Shepherd was ruled out of the West Indies' squad due to a positive test for COVID-19, with Keon Harding named as his replacement. On 15 January 2021, Hayden Walsh Jr. was also ruled out of the West Indies' squad for testing positive for COVID-19. Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad for the second Test due to a thigh injury, with Soumya Sarkar named as his replacement. Shadman Islam was also ruled out of Bangladesh's squad for the second Test, due to a hip injury."

        "text": "The participation of transgender people in ice hockey is an ongoing issue in the place of LGBT+ rights and diversity in ice hockey. Only a small handful of professional players have come out as openly trans, and systemic transphobia presents many barriers to the inclusion of trans people in the sport.\nHistory.\nIn 2003, USA Hockey banned a transgender woman from participating in the Women's National Ice Hockey Tournament.\nIn January 2013, the NHL's Vancouver Canucks welcomed transgender teenager and Britannia Secondary School goaltender Cory Oskam onto the ice to stand next to Cory Schneider during the pre-game national anthem.\nIn 2013, Jesse Thompson, a junior hockey player in Ontario, made a complaint to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario concerning harassment and bullying over his being trans. In 2017, the Ontario Hockey Federation made transgender training mandatory for all minor hockey coaches as a result of the tribunal.\nIn 2014, the Whitehorse Women's Hockey League announced a policy allowing anyone who identifies as a woman or was assigned female at birth to participate in the league without restriction.\nIn October 2016, NWHL Buffalo Beauts player Harrison Browne became the first professional hockey player to publicly come out as transgender during their career. He postponed his medical transition until his retirement from the league in 2018.\nIn January 2018, CWHL Toronto Furies player Jessica Platt publicly came out as transgender, the first professional female hockey player to come out as a transgender woman. Ella Licari, who played in the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League from 2016 to 2019, also came out as transgender that year.\nIn April 2018, Leksands IF Dam goaltender Leon Reuterström publicly came out as a transgender man, and had to retire due to his testosterone therapy contravening SDHL anti-doping rules.\nIn the autumn of 2018, Fabienne Peter became the first openly transgender player to play in the Switzerland women's ice hockey league.\nIn April 2019, the San José Sharks honoured 15-year old Elliot Govaars of the San José Junior Sharks in a pre-game ceremony on Trans Day of Visibility.\nIn January 2020, the British EIHL held its first ever Pride Weekend.\nPolicies.\nIIHF.\nThe 2021 International Ice Hockey Federation Transgender Policy came into effect on 1 June 2020. The policy bars transgender men from playing in women's competitions after beginning any form of hormone treatment, and specifies that transgender women wishing to compete in women's competitions must demonstrate that their serum testosterone concentration has been less than 5nmol/L1 continuously for a period of at least 12 months and continuously throughout their playing time. The policy does not require legal gender identity recognition or surgical changes.\nIce Hockey UK.\nIce Hockey UK maintains a policy on transgender inclusion stating that clubs must \"be conscious of the wide variety within the trans community, and be alert to the flexible approach needed so that they may be welcomed and included without discrimination, not only as players, but also as managers, coaches, staff members, and in the social life of the Club.\"\nUSA Hockey.\nIn January 2019, USA Hockey announced a new set of guidelines on transgender athlete eligibility. The policies included notice that many ice hockey programmes were not limited by gender, such as mixed leagues and children's leagues. The guidelines for eligibility for trans players in restricted leagues stated that transgender women aged 14 and up must have undergone at least a year of testosterone suppression therapy and that transgender men should not have begun testosterone hormone therapy. The policy also explicitly contained guidelines for non-binary players. The policy generally received positive feedback from players.\nNWHL.\nThe now-defunct National Women's Hockey League policy on trans eligibility banned players assigned female at birth from playing while undergoing testosterone hormone therapy and specifies that players assigned male at birth must be able to demonstrate that their serum total testosterone level \"is within typical limits of women athletes,\" and that the league may monitor hormone levels via testing. The policy was announced in December 2016, the first professional sports league to announce specific guidelines for trans eligibility, and was developed in collaboration with You Can Play and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\nOrganisations.\nTeam Trans.\nIn 2019, Team Trans was founded in Massachusetts, in the United States, as an all-transgender and nonbinary hockey team. It is believed to be the only all-transgender sports team currently active in the United States.\nYou Can Play.\nYou Can Play is a social activism campaign dedicated to the eradication of homophobia and the inclusion of LGBT+ people in sports. It was founded after the death of openly-gay Miami University player Brendan Burke."

        "title": "Rugby Town Hall",
        "text": "Rugby Town Hall is a municipal building on Evreux Way in the town centre of Rugby, Warwickshire, England. The building is the headquarters of Rugby Borough Council.\nHistory.\nPrevious town halls.\nTwo previous town halls existed on High Street: The first one was built in 1857, designed by Edward Welby Pugin and James Murray, This town hall was built by a private company for profit, and was multi-purpose, containing indoor markets, shops, an assembly room, a library, and a room for official business by the County Court and Magistrates. An extension was made in 1919. This building was not used by the local council however, who had their offices on Windmill Lane until 1900. In 1906, the building was sold to a theatrical company, and in 1911 it was converted into a cinema called Vint's Palace of Varieties. Most of the building except for the extension was destroyed by a fire in 1921, and was replaced by a building which was until 2009 a Woolworths shop.\nThe second Town Hall, this one being a municipal building which housed the local council dated from 1900, in a building constructed using money left in the will of George Charles Benn, who in his will of 1895 left £6,000 to the local council to construct a building that would be useful to the town. It was constructed on the site of the former ‘Shoulder of Mutton Inn’. It was used by the council until 1937, when they moved to an early 19th century property known as \"The Lawn\" on Newbold Road, and the second town hall was converted into a Marks and Spencer shop, which it remained until 2015.\nCurrent Town Hall.\nAfter civic leaders found that \"The Lawn\" was inadequate for their needs, they elected to construct a purpose-built facility. In December 1937 the borough council approved the design of a new town hall, made by Ernest Prestwich of J.C. Prestwich &amp; Sons, at an estimated cost of £90,478 (), in spite of objections as to cost. By the end of the year, plans were being modified to lower the cost. However, by November 1938 no foundation stone had been laid, the council and populace were still arguing about the cost of the scheme, and a ministerial inquiry was held in relation to the required loans. Prestwich was the only witness called, to \"explain details of the scheme\". The \"Rugby Advertiser\" devoted a whole page to the matter. \nUltimately, construction started in 1959 to the original design. Adjoining it to the north is a functions venue called Benn Hall which was built at the same time. Both the \"New Town Hall\" and the Benn Hall were opened on 5 July 1961 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The town hall consists of two brick neo-Georgian wings, fronted by a white stone entrance portico, the top of which is inscribed with the borough motto \"\"Floreat Rugbeia\", Latin for \"May Rugby Flourish\"\".\nThe architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner did not hold a favourable view of the town hall, describing it as \"quite dead architecturally\".\nDuring 1984-85 the town hall made the national news when it was the scene of protests against Rugby council's controversial decision to remove the words ‘sexual orientation’ from their Equal Opportunities policy. This was widely interpreted as a 'ban on gays' and caused uproar, and led to large protests from gay rights campaigners and politicians, including the MP Chris Smith, who used the occasion to choose to \"come out\" as Britain's first gay MP. The council eventually bowed to pressure to reverse the decision in early 1985.\nA bronze sculpture commemorating Sir Frank Whittle, the \"Father of the Jet Engine\", was installed at Chestnut Field just outside the town hall in 2005.\nIn more recent times solar panels were installed on the roof of the building."

        "title": "Yale Bulldogs golf",
        "text": "The Yale Bulldogs golf teams represent Yale University in intercollegiate competition. The men's team has won more national team championships and more individual national championships than any other university golf program in the United States. The women's team was founded in 1980 and has won a number of Ivy League championships. The teams play out of the Yale Golf Course and compete as members of the Ivy League.\nHistory.\nEarly success.\nIn the fall of 1896, \"Yale Alumni Weekly\" reported that a \"new game,\" golf, was the \"rage among seniors\" at the school. Students used hockey sticks and tennis balls to simulate golf clubs and golf balls on a \"makeshift course\" on campus. For a more \"serious\" game, students traveled off-campus to a complete, nine-hole course, New Haven Golf Club, that had been completed the previous year. The top Yale undergraduates at New Haven created an independent organization, Yale Golf Club, later in the fall. In November, they played their \"first intercollegiate competition.\" The match was against Columbia University. Yale won the event. In December, it was announced that Yale would discuss founding an \"intercollegiate golf association\" with representatives of Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania. The first intercollegiate championship was held the following year. They won the tournament against Harvard 24-4.\nThe game continued to gain popularity through the 1890s. In 1897, the \"Brooklyn Times-Union\" noted that the sport was rivaling football in popularity. The following year, the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" announced that students from Yale were showing an \"unusual interest in the game.\" In May 1898, Yale won the intercollegiate championship for the second straight year. \"The New York Times\" reported that the overall quality of play at the tournament was \"much better golf [than] was shown... last year.\" The following year, it was reported by the \"The Boston Globe\" that Yale students' enthusiasm for the sport was so strong that they had essentially monopolized the facilities at New Haven Golf Club. \"The Globe\" stated, \"The popularity of the game has so taxed the capacity of New Haven Golf Club that most of the townspeople have gone to the New Haven Country Club and left the golf club to the students. The links of the New Haven Club are convenient to the campus and the students have been joining the club by the dozen, preparatory for the coming season.\" The game's prestige at the university continued to advance. In May 1899, it was announced that Yale golfers could place the revered \"Y\" emblem on their jackets like other athletes could, a sign that the sport \"had been placed on an equality with other sports.\" In April 1900, the legendary Harry Vardon played exhibition matches at New Haven Golf Club against Yale golfers. Vardon broke the course record and the event received much media attention, including from \"The New York Times\".\nIn the early 1900s, however, Yale's team had fallen slightly backward in recent years, however, losing three consecutive intercollegiate championships to Harvard. A few days after their final loss to Harvard, Charles Hitchcock was promoted to team captain. He felt that Yale's performance was \"very lax over two years\" and \"decided to send the team into some practice matches this fall\" in an effort to improve performance. Over the course of the 1901-02 academic year, Yale's performance improved and Hitchcock himself had great success. In 1902 finals, Yale \"developed an unexpectedly forceful game\" and beat Harvard 18-6. Captain Hitchcock displayed a \"great performance\" in his individual match, winning 8 up. According to the \"The Boston Globe\", the \"glory in Hitchcock's score was more in evidence with the boys than delight in their defeat of Harvard.\" In the individual tournament, played a few days later, Hitchcock again scored \"an easy victory\" over his competitor, claiming honors. In late May, Hitchcock completed his great year by winning the Yale University Golf Championship.\nA few years later, in 1905, Yale began one of the greatest stretches in the history of college golf, winning the intercollegiate championship nine consecutive years. Yale also possessed some of the top individual golfers in the country during this era. The team included Eben Byers and Robert Gardner, champions of the U.S. Amateur in 1906 and 1909, respectively. In addition, Buck Merriman, winner of the 1909 and 1910 Connecticut Amateur, and Harry Legg, the 1910 Trans-Mississippi Amateur champion, represented Yale. A number of Yale golfers also won individual intercollegiate championship in the early 1900s too. In 1905, Robert Abbott won the event. Subsequently, W.E. Clow, Jr. and Ellis Knowles won the individual tournament. A few years later, in 1910, Robert Hunter won the individual championship and George Stanley followed him.\nBy the 1920s, however, Yale had not won a championship in several years. George Townsend Adee made some proposals to the Director of the Athletic Association to improve the program. One of them was to create a new golf course. In 1923, construction on Yale Golf Course began and opened three years later. In addition, in 1926 the university hired a new coach, the Scottish-born Ben Thomson. The team was also able to recruit a number of star golfers during this era, including Paul Haviland and Jess Sweetser, the future legend.\nThe changes paid off and by the mid-1920s, Yale's team was again among the best in the nation. In 1924, Yale won the first of three consecutive national championship. In 1929, Yale became a founding member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Association (EIGA). Yale had great success in the EIGA, winning eight consecutive conference championships starting in 1931. In the 1930s, Yale also had much success at the national intercollegiate golf tournament. In 1931, Jack Reese was medalist at the event while Sidney Noyes, Jr., also of Yale, finished joint runner-up. The remaining players from Yale, especially Aycock, played well and with a 610 total they defeated Princeton by four strokes. They successfully repeated as team champions the following two years. In 1935, they lost the national finals to the University of Michigan but won the following year.\nPost War War II.\nIn the 1940s, however, Yale entered a period of decline, partly due to sacrifices related to World War II. In 1942, Yale announced it would \"dispense with the services of three veteran coaches\" including Ben Thomson, the golf coach, \"as a wartime economy move.\" Thomson coached the team for 17 years. In the spring, the team's captain Edmund Gravely was recruited by the United States Air Force. Arthur Williams was elected captain shortly thereafter however he was also quickly drafted into World War II. Overall, the Yale team won no notable championships from 1944 to 1948.\nShortly thereafter, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Yale golf team began playing better. Yale won the Eastern Intercollegiate Championship in 1949, 1951, 1953, and 1954. In addition, Lincoln Roden III won the 1951 Eastern Intercollegiate individual championship. In 1955, Al Wilson became the golf coach. Wilson coached the team for 15 years. The Yale golf team had much success during this era. During Wilson's tenure, the team recorded 136 wins against 14 losses for a winning percentage of 90%. This included seven Eastern Intercollegiate Championships. During this era, Robert Trent Jones Jr. and Rees Jones, future golf course architects, participated as a player and manager, respectively, for the team.\nShortly thereafter, marked another period of decline. \"The 1970s were not a good times for Yale golf,\" it was reported. Coach Wilson left his position in 1970. Yale undergraduates were reportedly uninterested in golf during the era. The Yale golf team \"won no league championships\" during the first half of the 1970s. University administration was considering selling Yale Golf Course.\nIn the 1970s, Scottish-born David Paterson became the golf coach. Paterson turned around the team. He arranged a national schedule where Yale would play the best schools around the nation in an effort to improve performance. Paterson also inaugurated a number of significant tournaments, including the William S. Beinecke Annual Member-Guest Tournament, Widdy Neale Invitational, Yale Men’s College-Am, Yale Fall Intercollegiate Tournament (now Macdonald Cup), F.A. Borsodi Student Championship, \"Scratch Cup,\" and Yale Spring Opener. During this era, the future PGA Tour and European Tour pro Peter Teravainen played on the golf team. By freshman year, he was generally regarded as the best player on the team. In 1980, Paterson also inaugurated a spring break golf trip to the United Kingdom for the Yale golf team. This event would occur at four year intervals. The Yale golf team would play matches against leading British universities and golf clubs. Later on, at the end of the 20th century, the Yale golf team won the Ivy League championship in back-to-back years, in 1996 and 1997. In 2008, Paterson retired."

        "text": "Robert \"Bob\" Marquis is a Canadian retired ice hockey center who was one of three people awarded the NCAA Tournament MOP in 1960.\nCareer.\nMarquis came to Boston University in 1956, making the varsity team in his sophomore season. Straight away, coach Harry Cleverly knew he had a star in the making and the team jumped from 13 wins to 17 wins, posting the best record among independent schools. Marquis led the team in scoring finishing 10th in the nation and was named an AHCA East All-American the same year. Despite the program's tremendous season, BU was not selected for the NCAA tournament, and were ranked lower than Harvard.\nAs a junior, Marquis led a depleted offense with 41 goals; nearly two out of every five goals for the Terriers was scored by Marquis. He was again the team's leading scorer, rising up to 6th in the nation and second in goals (behind only the record-setting production from Phil Latreille). He was again named an East All-American and in recognition of his leadership, he was named team co-captain for his senior season. The Terriers' offense didn't improve much in Marquis' senior season and while he finished with fewer goals he still recorded the same number of points (59). BU finished with a 17–8 record and were the second-ranked team in the east but, instead of just offering the team a bid, the NCAA decided to hold two play-in games for four eastern teams. This was the only time in history that play-in games were used to determine NCAA tournament participants (for the top level of play) but the Terriers were able to surpass Dartmouth in their match and earn the second eastern seed.\nIn the semifinal, played in their home building, the Terriers played heavy favorite Denver and, though they kept the score close, BU was no match for the offensive firepower possessed by the Pioneers. BU was sent to the consolation match with St. Lawrence and the two teams produced a wild affair that saw the game see-saw between the two for the first two periods before BU pulled ahead for good in the third. Marquis was named to not only All-Tournament First Team, but he was one of three players awarded the NCAA Tournament MOP. This was the only time in the history of the championship the that Most Outstanding Player was given to more than one person (as of 2020) and oddly, none of the three players were on the championship team.\nAfter graduating, Marquis received interest from NHL teams but he passed on a professional career to begin working for General Electric. He did continue to play organized hockey. He was on at least two different independent amateur teams during the 1960s, with records of him dating to as late as 1968.\nMarquis was inducted into the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1967, the Beanpot Hall of Fame in 1997 and was the program's all-time leading goal scorer until 1998 when he was passed by Chris Drury (in more than twice as many games)."

        "title": "2020 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2020 Tour de France was the 107th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour began in Nice with a hilly stage on 29 August, and Stage 11 occurred on 9 September with a flat stage to Poitiers. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 20 September.\nStage 1.\n29 August 2020 – Nice to Nice, \nThe main break of the day was made by Cyril Gautier (), Michael Schär (), and Fabien Grellier (), who split the six mountain points on offer evenly between themselves; Grellier was awarded the King of the Mountains jersey by virtue of having scored his two points first. The break was caught with 100 kilometers still to go, after which it started to rain. This made the downhill portions of the stage very slippery and caused several crashes, with Pavel Sivakov and Miguel Ángel López among those to fall. Eventually, the riders, led by Tony Martin, agreed a truce in the peloton. On the riders returned to the flat roads in the run-in to the finish, a late breakaway attempt by Benoît Cosnefroy with around 20 kilometers left was short-lived. A large pileup occurred with 3 kilometers to go, but the riders involved were all credited with the same time as the stage winner as per race regulations. In the final sprint, Alexander Kristoff won, narrowly holding off the fast-approaching defending World Road Race Champion Mads Pedersen, to take the first yellow jersey of the race. As a result of the crashes, 's Rafael Valls and duo John Degenkolb and Philippe Gilbert withdrew from the race, while several other riders, notably Sivakov, were left severely injured.\nStage 2.\n30 August 2020 – Nice to Nice, \nStage 2 was a noticeably sunnier affair compared to the wet and dreary conditions on stage 1. The early break consisted of seven riders: Benoît Cosnefroy (), Lukas Pöstlberger and Peter Sagan (), Matteo Trentin (), Anthony Perez (), Kasper Asgreen (), and Toms Skujiņš (). Sagan began his points classification title defense as he tried to go for a record eighth green jersey, but he was pipped at the intermediate sprint by Trentin. Cosnefroy and Perez scored 18 points across each of the two category 1 climbs, and Cosnefroy was awarded the polka dot jersey on tiebreakers. With around 40 kilometers left, the rest of the breakaway were caught by the peloton. On the final climb, the Col des Quatre Chemins, Julian Alaphilippe, Marc Hirschi and Adam Yates made a late break and maintained a narrow lead over the peloton to the finish, where Alaphilippe took the sprint and claimed the yellow jersey. Alexander Kristoff was dropped early on in the stage and finished over 28 minutes behind Alaphilippe, but the Norwegian was able to keep the green jersey.\nStage 3.\n31 August 2020 – Nice to Sisteron, \nAs the race headed out of Nice, a trio of French riders formed the main breakaway of the day: Benoît Cosnefroy (), Anthony Perez (), and Jérôme Cousin (). Cosnefroy and Perez were tied on points in the mountains classification, though the former wore the polka-dot jersey on tiebreakers, and they wrestled for points across the early pair of category 3 climbs. Perez managed to outsprint Cosnefroy on both of those climbs, putting the former into the virtual mountains classification lead. Shortly thereafter, they both rejoined the peloton while Cousin soldiered on alone. On the next climb, the category 3 Col des Leques, Cousin crossed over first and two points, while in the peloton behind, Cosnefroy managed to outsprint Perez to take the solitary point left over. It was reported that Perez crashed on the descent of the Col des Leques with around 70 kilometers to go and had to abandon the race, meaning that Cosnefroy kept hold of the polka-dot jersey. At the sole intermediate sprint of the day at Digne-les-Bains, Cousin crossed over first, while the sprinters behind raced for the remaining points, with Peter Sagan being the best of the rest. Cosuin was finally caught with 16 kilometers to go; for his efforts, he was given the stage's most combative rider award. In the final kilometer, took to the front to try and lead out Cees Bol. Sagan and then Sam Bennett led the sprint, but Caleb Ewan, coming from some distance back, weaved through the throng of sprinters and overhauled the Irishman on the finish line. With his fifth place result, Sagan took the green jersey.\nStage 4.\n1 September 2020 – Sisteron to Orcières-Merlette, \nThe Tour de France made an early foray into the high mountains with a summit finish at the Orcières-Merlette ski resort. Right from the start, Alexis Vuillermoz (), Quentin Pacher (), Krists Neilands and Nils Politt (), Tiesj Benoot (), and Mathieu Burgaudeau () formed the day's breakaway. Politt was first at the intermediate sprint, while Sam Bennett won the sprint from the peloton as the sprinters scrambled for the remaining points. Pacher won most of the mountain points across the first few climbs, accumulating six. With around 35 kilometers remaining, on the descent of the Côte de l'Aullagnier, Benoot went wide around a bend and crashed over a barrier, though he was relatively unscathed and was able to continue. Near the top of the penultimate climb, Côte de Saint-Léger-les-Mélèzes, Neilands accelerated away from his fellow breakaway companions, with Pacher and Vuillermoz giving chase. The Latvian was finally caught by the peloton with seven kilometers left and was awarded the stage's combativity award for his efforts. Pierre Rolland tried to attack from the peloton, but his time out in front lasted only a kilometer before he was reeled back in. In the final two kilometers, Sepp Kuss set a fierce tempo for his team leader Primož Roglič. Guillaume Martin initiated the sprint but Roglič chased him down and won the stage. Race leader Julian Alaphilippe finished fifth to maintain his lead in the general classification.\nStage 5.\n2 September 2020 – Gap to Privas, \nDespite the moderate pace of the peloton, there were no noticeable breakaway attempts on the mostly downhill stage, as the riders feared the threat of crosswinds and were happy to take it easy after four hard stages to start the Tour. At the intermediate sprint, Sam Bennett took maximum points while points classification leader Peter Sagan could only manage fourth behind Bennett's teammate Michael Mørkøv and Caleb Ewan. Polka-dot jersey wearer Benoît Cosnefroy took both of the singular mountain points available on the two category 4 climbs unchallenged to extend his lead in the mountains classification. With under ten kilometers left, took to the front and ramped up the pace, stringing out the peloton and causing splits. Like in stage 3, took to the front in the final two kilometers to try and set up Cees Bol for the slightly uphill sprint finish. However, Wout van Aert, who had been sitting on Bol's wheel, came out of the Dutch rider's slipstream and powered away for his first Grand Tour stage win. As a result of finishing ahead of Sagan in both the intermediate sprint and the final sprint, Bennett gained enough points to take over the green jersey. After the stage, race officials handed race leader Julian Alaphilippe a 20-second penalty for taking an illegal feed with less than 20 kilometers to go. As a result, he dropped out of the top ten and Adam Yates took the yellow jersey.\nStage 6.\n3 September 2020 – Le Teil to Mont Aigoual, \nThe peloton were content to let the breakaway decide the stage, which was mostly flat for the first 155 kilometers before offering up a series of climbs in quick succession culminating in a summit finish atop Mont Aigoual. Eight riders formed the day's breakaway: Alexey Lutsenko (), Daniel Oss (), Greg Van Avermaet (), Jesús Herrada (), Rémi Cavagna (), Neilson Powless (), Edvald Boasson Hagen (), and Nicolas Roche (). The octet reached a maximum advantage of over six minutes before the peloton began to slowly close the gap. Boasson Hagen won the intermediate sprint just ahead of Oss while the rest of the breakaway rolled through. Roger Kluge, one of Caleb Ewan's lead-out men, rolled off the front of the peloton and through the intermediate sprint, leaving only six on offer for the next rider, who was green jersey wearer Sam Bennett; Ewan himself did not seriously contest the intermediate sprint and came away with no points gained. Neither of the category 3 climbs were seriously challenged for by the breakaway, though Roche rode across first both times. \nOn the lower slopes of the Col de la Lusette, Cavagna accelerated, dropping Boasson Hagen and Oss. Shortly after, Powless put in an attack, with Cavagna the next to be dropped. Powless put in another surge, hoping to win on his 24th birthday, attacked again, with only Lutsenko being able to follow. Eventually, the efforts took a toll on Powless, as he was unable to keep up with Lutsenko. The Kazakh road champion managed to maintain and even extend his lead over the top of the Col de la Lusette and up Mont Aigoual for the stage win. Herrada managed to claw his way back into second place, nearly a minute behind Lutsenko, while Van Avermaet outsprinted Powless for third. The main favorites finished almost three minutes down on Lutsenko, with Julian Alaphilippe sprinting away towards the end to try and claw back the time he lost due to the penalty he incurred on the previous stage, but the Frenchman was closely followed and only managed to gain back one second.\nStage 7.\n4 September 2020 – Millau to Lavaur, \nBenoît Cosnefroy jumped out of the peloton early on to claim the maximum points on offer in the mountains classification at the Côte de Luzençon less than ten kilometers into the stage. Behind him, took to the front and began to set a fast pace, inadvertently catching Cosnefroy shortly before the summit and forcing the mountains classification leader to put in a second acceleration to earn his points. At the same time, the fast pace caused many sprinters to be dropped, including Caleb Ewan, Elia Viviani, Cees Bol, Giacomo Nizzolo, Alexander Kristoff, and points classification leader Sam Bennett, much to the benefit of sprinter Peter Sagan, who sought to reclaim the green jersey. At the intermediate sprint, Matteo Trentin just managed to hold off Sagan on the line. After the Col de Peyronnenc, Thomas de Gendt made a solo breakaway effort, but he never managed to get an advantage of one minute over the peloton, who reeled him in with under 35 kilometers to go. At the same time, upped the pace and the remaining peloton further split into several groups. Among the general classification contenders who caught out were Tadej Pogačar, Mikel Landa, Richard Carapaz, and the duo of Bauke Mollema and Richie Porte. In the ensuing bunch sprint, Wout van Aert powered through along the barriers to take his second stage win in three days. Pogačar led home the second group, which finished nearly a minute and a half behind the front group, while the dropped sprinters would eventually roll across the line over 14 minutes in arrears. As a result of the intermediate sprint points and his 13th place finish, Sagan took back the green jersey from Bennett.\nStage 8.\n5 September 2020 – Cazères to Loudenvielle, \nThirteen riders formed the day's breakaway: Benoît Cosnefroy and Nans Peters (), Quentin Pacher and Kévin Reza (), Ilnur Zakarin (), Michael Mørkøv (), Neilson Powless (), Ben Hermans (), Carlos Verona (), Søren Kragh Andersen (), Jérôme Cousin and Fabien Grellier (), and Toms Skujiņš (). None of them were placed highly in the general classification, with best-placed Zakarin being over 16 minutes behind Adam Yates, so the peloton allowed them to race for the stage win; at one point, the breakaway was over 14 minutes ahead. Cousin won the intermediate sprint at Sengouagnet relatively uncontested, as Mørkøv led the rest of the uninterested breakaway across. Because intermediate sprints offered points up to the 15th rider to cross, and there had only been 13 so far from the breakaway, some of the sprinters in the peloton decided to duke it out for the last minor points, with Sam Bennett and Bryan Coquard taking them. With around 80 kilometers left, Italian and European road race champion Giacomo Nizzolo was forced to abandon the race, having struggled with a knee injury. At the first category 1 climb, the Col de Menté, Cosnefroy took the maximum ten points on offer to extend his lead in the mountain classification. On the lower slopes of the Port de Balès, a Hors catégorie climb, Cousin broke away. Later on up the climb, shortly after the breakaway caught Cousin, Peters accelerated, with only Zakarin and Pacher able to follow. Pacher did not manage to keep pace for long, and Peters led Zakarin over the summit. Behind them, Pacher continued on, followed shortly after by the quartet of Kragh Andersen, Powless, Skujiņš, and Verona. \nIt was on the descent where the lead duo would be separated, as Peters clearly was more skilled at descending, managing to gain a lead of 30 seconds on Zakarin by the end of the descent. Although Zakarin slowly closed the gap to Peters on the last climb, the Col de Peyresourde, Peters still managed to summit it alone before extending his lead again on that descent. Behind the remnants of the breakaway, the GC contenders began to test each other on the Peyresourde, as set a fast pace. Julian Alaphilippe made an initial attack, but after just one acceleration, the Frenchman bonked and was quickly passed by other riders. Eventually, Tadej Pogačar went clear, pulling with him compatriot Primož Roglič, while Yates struggled to keep up with the group. After a regrouping, Pogačar attacked again and was able to break away on his own. With Yates slowly bridging his way back up to the group, Roglič and Nairo Quintana attacked over the top of the summit. \nPeters managed to hang on to his lead and win his first Grand Tour stage win. Zakarin had also been passed by Skujiņš and Verona on the run-in to the finish, with Skujiņš beating Verona in the sprint for second place. In ones and twos, the surviving breakaway riders managed to finish ahead of Pogačar, who had built up a lead of 38 seconds over the nearest group of his rivals, including Roglič, Quintana, and Yates, who retained the leader's yellow jersey. The advantage saw Pogačar re-enter the top ten as he recouped about a third of the time he had lost on the previous stage. On the other hand, several GC contenders lost time: Richard Carapaz, Enric Mas, and Bauke Mollema finished a further 38 seconds behind Pogačar, while Tom Dumoulin, Sergio Higuita, and Alejandro Valverde lost over two minutes. Alaphilippe eventually crossed the finish line over 11 minutes after Pogačar did. GC contender Thibaut Pinot, who had been suffering from back pain and had been dropped from the peloton on the Port de Balès, was shepherded across the finish line by his teammates nearly 19 minutes behind the main group of GC contenders, effectively ending his chances of an overall victory.\nStage 9.\n6 September 2020 – Pau to Laruns, \nThe stage started with multiple breakaway attempts, including from Tiesj Benoot () and Hugh Carthy (), but the fast pace set by and prevented any breakaways from forming successfully. On the Col de la Hourcère, the peloton began to fracture, while at the front of the race, Lennard Kämna () and Marc Hirschi () made further breakaway attempts. The latter managed to make it stick, riding away from the peloton with 87 kilometers left, while back problems continued to hamper Thibaut Pinot, who was dropped again. By the time Hirschi reached the summit and took the maximum mountain points on offer, the weather began to have an effect on the stage, making for a foggy descent. More importantly, he was nearly two minutes ahead of an eight-man chasing group that included Kämna, Daniel Martínez, and Sébastien Reichenbach, and nearly three minutes ahead of the -led peloton at that point. \nWhile out in front, Hirschi won the intermediate sprint and took 24 mountain points. With 34.5 kilometers left, Hirschi still maintained a lead of over four minutes, but the peloton slowly began to close the gap on the decisive Col de Marie Blanque. Considering the rest day to follow, the GC contenders were emboldened to be aggressive. With many riders struggling to keep pace, including yellow jersey wearer Adam Yates, the four at the front (Egan Bernal, Mikel Landa, Tadej Pogačar, and Primož Roglič) sought to increase the distance to their rivals. After Hirschi summitted first, this time with an advantage of less than half a minute, there were still bonus seconds at the summit for the next two riders. In the ensuing sprint, Pogačar looked behind him as he neared the top, but as Roglič accelerated around the opposite side and past him, Pogačar made a slight deviation that caused his front wheel to nearly be taken out by Roglič's back wheel. \nOn the descent, the lead quartet continued to close down on Hirschi's lead, while a group of six other GC contenders began a concerted chase to catch back up. With five kilometers to go, Hirschi still led by 26 seconds, but it was clear that he was running out of steam; two kilometers later, his lead had dwindled to just 12 seconds. Eventually, the catch came with 1.6 kilometers left, and Hirschi jumped onto the back of the group to try and hang on to them. With 225 meters left, the Swiss youngster launched his sprint first from the back of the group, with Pogačar and Roglič in hot pursuit. Evidently, Hirschi's solo breakaway efforts caught up to him, as the two Slovenians came around him just before the line. With Pogačar's stage win, he became the youngest Tour stage winner in 27 years, while Roglič's second place saw him move back into the yellow jersey. The chase group, made up of Romain Bardet, Guillaume Martin, Bauke Mollema, Richie Porte, Nairo Quintana, and Rigoberto Urán, managed to cut their losses and finish eleven seconds behind. GC leader Adam Yates finished in a group almost a minute behind Pogačar and dropped to eighth.\nRest day 1.\n7 September 2020 – Charente-Maritime\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, all participants, including riders, staff, and race officials, took COVID-19 tests. Race regulations stipulated that a team would face ejection from the race if they returned at least two positive cases. Though all of the riders tested negative, one staff member each from , , , and tested positive, as did race director Christian Prudhomme, who had to quarantine for the next seven days.\nStage 10.\n8 September 2020 – Île d'Oléron to Île de Ré, \nAfter the first rest day and a transfer that took the race from the Pyrenees to the Charente-Maritime department on the west coast of France, the peloton took on a windy and almost pan-flat stage near and along the Atlantic coast that was expected to finish in a sprint. Right from the start, as the race crossed over the bridge to the French mainland, the Swiss duo of Stefan Küng () and Michael Schär () attacked to form the day's breakaway, having agreed to do so in advance. With the sprinters' teams eyeing up the finish, Küng and Schär were kept on a short leash, never having an advantage of more than two minutes. \nWith just under 100 kilometers to go and the breakaway catch imminent, a crash happened near the back of the peloton, sending several riders into the roadside ditches. Of those riders, two fared the worst: it took several minutes for Nicolas Roche, who lost a bracelet in the crash, to get up and start riding again, while 33-year-old Tour debutant Sam Bewley was forced to abandon after fracturing his wrist. As the peloton went around a roundabout 65 kilometers from the finish, there was another crash. Sprinters Edvald Boasson Hagen and Bryan Coquard were involved, as were GC contenders Guillaume Martin and Tadej Pogačar, but all four riders were able to eventually rejoin the peloton. However, Pogačar's teammate Davide Formolo fractured his clavicle, and though he was able to start riding again, he struggled to finish, coming in over 16 minutes down in last place; he would abandon the race after the stage.\nAt the intermediate sprint in Châtelaillon-Plage 39 kilometers from the finish, the sprinters battled it out for the points. Once again, Matteo Trentin won, followed by Peter Sagan and Sam Bennett. A split in the peloton occurred with 17 kilometers remaining, but none of the Tour contenders were caught behind the gap. It was once again who came to the front in the final kilometer for Cees Bol, but their lead-out petered out too soon, leaving Michael Mørkøv on the front to lead out Bennett. The Irishman held off Caleb Ewan on the line to win his first Tour de France stage. Despite green jersey wearer Sagan finishing third, the 50-point haul for first-placed Bennett saw him take over as the leader of points classification.\nStage 11.\n9 September 2020 – Châtelaillon-Plage to Poitiers, \nStage 11 saw the riders make their way inland and east across central France towards the Alps. The second consecutive nearly pan-flat stage meant a second day in a row for the sprinters. In the neutral zone before the official race start, several riders, including Cyril Gautier, Ilnur Zakarin, and stage 6 winner Alexey Lutsenko, crashed on a roundabout, though all riders involved were able to continue onwards. Once the race did start, a sole rider, Mathieu Ladagnous (), attacked to form the day's breakaway. Around 20 kilometers into the stage, another breakaway attempt was made, as Oliver Naesen (), Lukas Pöstlberger (), Stefan Küng (), Tom Van Asbroeck (), Michael Gogl (), and Jasper Stuyven () tried to make it up the road. However, with an intermediate sprint along the stage, , the team of the points classification leader Sam Bennett, quickly reeled back in the six riders.\nOut in front, Ladagnous won the mountain point for the only categorized climb, the Côte de Cherveux, and the maximum points at the intermediate sprint before he was eventually caught, winning the stage's combativity award for his efforts. Back in the peloton, many of the sprinters lined it out for the remaining points. Bennett won the sprint for second, with his lead-out man Michael Mørkøv holding on for third ahead of Peter Sagan, Matteo Trentin, and Bryan Coquard. A crash with 30 kilometers left involving several riders forced Ion Izagirre to abandon the race with heavy injuries; he was the second abandonment of the day following Gregor Mühlberger, who had abandoned earlier due to illness. With just over six kilometers left, Pöstlberger was once again on the attack, putting in a late bid for the win. Like before, were forced to close him down, with Kasper Asgreen and Bob Jungels giving chase. Eventually, they were caught with two kilometers left, with the sprint trains leading the peloton.\nThe hectic sprint culminated in a bike throw at the line from four riders. Caleb Ewan accelerated out of Bennett's slipstream and won the bike throw for the stage win. Sagan pipped Bennett for second, with Wout van Aert squeezed off the podium. However, shortly after the stage, race officials relegated Sagan to 85th place, last in the lead group, for dangerous behavior during the sprint. van Aert had been leading the sprint on the right side of the road, with Clément Venturini on his wheel. Both Bennett and Sagan were on Venturini's wheel, and when they accelerated, Bennett went left and Sagan went right. With little space between van Aert and the barriers, Sagan used his shoulder to nudge the Belgian, who nearly deviating left into Bennett's path, before accelerating through the widened gap past van Aert. As a result, Sagan missed out on any points, while Bennett, who was elevated to second place and gained 30 points, significantly increased his lead in the points classification over the Slovakian to 68."

        "text": "The 2020 Tour de France is the 107th edition of Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour began in Nice with a hilly stage on 29 August, and Stage 12 occurred on 10 September with a hilly stage from Chauvigny. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 20 September.\nStage 12.\n10 September 2020 – Chauvigny to Sarran, \nThe stage breakaway contained Sánchez. Walscheid, Asgreen, Erviti, Burgaudeau and Politt. The latter won the intermediate sprint and Burgaudeau collected mountain points on two occasions. The peloton caught the last survivors with 43 kilometers left, while riders from the peloton launched multiple attacks. Soler, Pacher, Schachmann and trio Benoot, Kragh Andersen and Marc Hirschi made the front group on the Côte de la Croix du Pey. A dozen of riders formed a chasing group. The decisive move by Hirschi came on Suc au May, 26 kilometers before the finish. The Swiss rider reached his first World Tour victory. Pierre Rolland finished second and Søren Kragh Andersen third.\nStage 13.\n11 September 2020 – Châtel-Guyon to Puy Mary, \nMany riders were trying to form a breakaway and seventeen riders finally allied together around 60 kilometers after race began. Simon Geschke and Valentin Madouas won the mountain bonuses on two category 2 climbs, Pierre Rolland won two mountain bonuses on category 3 climbs. Julian Alaphilippe was first on intermediate sprint. The advantage on the peloton grew up to 11 minutes, so the stage winner was expected to be from the breakaway. Neilson Powless attacked first. Maximilian Schachmann joined him with 29 kilometers remaining. Powless was dropped on Col de Neronne and his teammate Daniel Martínez accelerated from breakaway group, followed by Schachmann's teammate Lennard Kämna. Both riders overtook Schachmann within last two kilometers. The Colombian won the sprint for the stage victory. Kämna and Schachmann filled the podium.\nMeanwhile, crash injuries forced Bauke Mollema and Romain Bardet to leave the race. led the peloton to Col de Neronne. Martin was in trouble. Roglič and Pogačar pushed hard on the Pas de Peyrol. Landa, Porte, López were chasing and they dropped Egan Bernal. The Slovenian duo reached the summit six minutes behind the stage winner. Landa, Porte and López finished less than 20 seconds behind them. Bernal came along with Quintana, Urán and Yates. The title defender lost 38 seconds to Roglič. Pogačar jumped to second place overall. Guillaume Martin finished almost three minutes behind the race leader and fell outside the top 10 in general classification.\nStage 14.\n12 September 2020 – Clermont-Ferrand to Lyon, \nStefan Küng and Edward Theuns arranged a breakaway during this stage. Theuns was first at the intermediate sprint. Küng dropped Theuns and won eight mountain points on three climbs. The Swiss rider was caught with 82 kilometers left. Plenty of attacks had started inside 12 kilometers before the finish. In sequence Benoot, Madouas, Kämna, De Gendt, Alaphilippe, Hirschi, Sagan and Van Avermaet all attempted to escape from the bunch and win this stage. But it was Søren Kragh Andersen, who chose the right moment to attack in the last 3 kilometers. Luka Mezgec and Simone Consonni finished second and third from a bunch including all thevTour contenders. Peter Sagan was fourth and earned some points to put pressure on green jersey wearer Sam Bennett\nStage 15.\n13 September 2020 – Lyon to Grand Colombier, \nThe race started with many attemotd to form a breakaway but the presence of points classification contenders Peter Sagan and Sam Bennett prevented a successful move. Sergio Higuita abandoned the race after two early crashes. The definitive breakaway included Pierre Rolland, Simon Geschke, Marco Marcato, Matteo Trentin, Jesús Herrada, Michael Gogl, Niccolò Bonifazio and Kévin Ledanois. Trentin won the intermediate sprint. Herrada and Rolland won mountain point bonuses on two category 1 climbs. Rolland and Gogl were the last to be caught by the peloton at the foot of the final climb of the Grand Colombier. Egan Bernal, Nairo Quintana and Guillaume Martin were dropped early. A group of favourites led by kept the strong pace. Adam Yates attacked with no effect. Cyclists restrained from another moves until the last kilometer. Richie Porte accelerated, Primož Roglič responded but Tadej Pogačar followed him and went for his second stage victory. Most of other favourites finished within 40 seconds. Caruso lost almost two minutes, Guillaume Martin and Quintana were more than three minutes late. Hopes for a sixth consecutive overall win for evaporated. Bernal finished seven minutes behind, Carapaz finished twenty minutes later.\nRest day 2.\n14 September 2020 – Isère\nStage 16.\n15 September 2020 – La Tour-du-Pin to Villard-de-Lans, \nStage 17.\n16 September 2020 – Grenoble to Méribel (Col de la Loze), \nDubbed the \"Queen Stage\" for this year's tour, this stage features two Hors catégorie climbs, the Col de la Madeleine with a height of 2000 m and the Col de la Loze at 2304 m. The latter was being used for the first time on the Tour and was the finish line for this stage. Prior to the race, defending champion Egan Bernal announced that he was abandoning the race.\nDuring the start of the race, five riders started to break away from the main peloton, led by Julian Alaphilippe and Richard Carapaz. At the sprint point, green jersey leader Sam Bennett got ahead of Peter Sagan, adding two points to his lead. On the first climb, Carapaz won over Alaphilippe, both increasing their points but still behind King of the Mountains jersey leader Benoît Cosnefroy. Tadej Pogačar secured third place on the summit while in the yellow jersey group. Because of the fast pace being set by the Team Bahrain McLaren, all of the stage leaders except Carapaz were caught up by the yellow jersey group. While ascending Col de la Loze, yellow jersey leader Primož Roglič and teammate Sepp Kuss, white jersey leader Pogačar, Miguel Ángel López, and Richie Porte were the remaining cyclists from the yellow jersey group, leaving the rest of the leaders' group behind. Carapaz was eventually caught up near the 24% gradient part (the steepest section) of the ascent while Lopez and Kuss went ahead. GC leaders Roglič and Pogačar tried to chase Lopez, but in the end, Lopez emerged as the winner of the stage and climbed to third place in the general classification. As the stage with the highest climb, Lopez also won the Souvenir Henri Desgrange award. Roglič still retained the yellow jersey, while Pogačar got the KoM jersey from Cosnefroy while still retaining the young rider jersey, but his gap from Roglič ballooned to 57 seconds. Bennett retained the green jersey. Alaphilippe won the combativity award for the stage.\nAside from Bernal, Mikel Nieve left the race, the first time he abandoned a Grand Tour.\nStage 18.\n17 September 2020 – Méribel to La Roche-sur-Foron, \nWith the stage featuring the shortest distance to the intermediate sprint point (14km after start), green jersey leader Sam Bennett and Peter Sagan, along with 30 other cyclists battled it out. Bennett edged Sagan by finishing first and third respectively; hence adding five more points to his lead.\nAfter the sprint, the rest of the course featured five mountain classification climbs with the following order: Category 1 Cormet de Roselend, Category 3 Côte de la route des Villes, Category 2 Col des Saisies, Category 1 Col des Aravis, and the Hors catégorie Glières Plateau. With 47 points maximum up for grabs for the King of the Mountains (KoM) jersey for this stage and with several cyclists within 30 points of the current KoM leader Tadej Pogačar, cyclists who planned on getting the jersey made the attack. For the first two climbs, Marc Hirschi went ahead of Richard Carapaz, but Hirschi crashed while descending after the Col des Saisies, leaving Carapaz, teammate Michał Kwiatkowski, and Pello Bilbao as race leaders. On the climb to Glieres Plateau, Mikel Landa tried to distance away from the yellow jersey group, but was soon caught up before reaching the summit, while dropping top 10 cyclists Adam Yates, Rigoberto Urán, and Alejandro Valverde. Richie Porte got a flat tire while traversing the gravel section of the Glieres Plateau, losing at most 40 seconds in the process, but was able to catch up with the yellow jersey group. Hirschi and Bilbao also got caught up with the yellow jersey group, while Kwiatkowski and Carapaz, who placed first on the final two climbs, cruised at the front, giving a 1-2 finish for the Ineos Grenadiers team.\nKwiatkowski won the stage, marking the first time he had won an individual stage on a Grand Tour. Carapaz won the KoM jersey from Pogačar. With his effort on today's stage, Hirschi won the combativity award. André Greipel called it quits for the tour.\nStage 19.\n18 September 2020 – Bourg-en-Bresse to Champagnole, \nStage 20.\n19 September 2020 – Lure to La Planche des Belles Filles, (ITT)\nThe penultimate stage of the tour was an individual time trial and it featured a Category 1 climb at the end of the stage, with the last portion of the climb having a 20% gradient. Because of this, aside from the yellow jersey (in which Primož Roglič had less than a minute lead over compatriot Tadej Pogačar), the king of the mountains (KoM) jersey was also up for grabs (Richard Carapaz had a 2-point edge over Pogačar).\nThe stage started with Rémi Cavagna finishing the individual time trial at a faster time with most of the cyclists prior to the final 20 cyclists. Subsequently, two teammates were faster than Cavagna, Wout van Aert by almost 30\", and Tom Dumoulin, 10\" faster than van Aert. Carapaz started slow on the stage in preparation for his jersey defense but was not able to get any points after the stage concluded. Pogačar was slowly chipping away Roglič's lead on the first and second checkpoints, and on the climb, Pogačar was able to overturn the deficit, besting Roglič by almost two minutes. He also became the stage winner while Roglič finished fifth. Since Pogačar climbed the fastest, he also won the KoM jersey over Carapaz. Sam Bennett still owned the green jersey despite not finishing in the top 10.\nStage 21.\n20 September 2020 – Mantes-la-Jolie to Paris (Champs-Élysées), "

The Bulldogs represent The Citadel in the NCAA's Southern Conference.\nThe Citadel began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but The Citadel's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

OnCore has since released several other golf ball products, including the \"ELIXR\", VERO X1, and VERO X2 tour performance golf balls. OnCore has secured the sponsorship rights of the Gateway Tour. The company relies primarily on word-of-mouth marketing for advertising and conducts much of its sales online. Professional athletes such as Ezekiel Elliott and Josh Allen have become shareholders in the company.\nSports entertainment centers.\nIn 2019, OnCore announced plans for a privately funded $30-million year-round sports entertainment complex along the Buffalo River on a former brownfield near Riverworks and Canalside. The facility was to include a 72-hitting-bay golf entertainment center with food and beverages, 350 parking spaces, a 120-room hotel with meeting and event space, and year-round access to the river, in addition to attractions for children. This project as planned was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, then abandoned in 2023, with the effects of the pandemic on the economy cited as a primary reason. OnCore will instead build a smaller entertainment facility without the hotel in South Buffalo, with a similar facility also planned for Knoxville, Tennessee."

An extension of the broader rivalry between the two schools, which includes the Paul Bunyan's Axe football game, the rivalry series is between two of the most successful in collegiate hockey. Including results from both men's and woman's play, the programs have combined for 23 NCAA titles and 59 Frozen Four appearances over their histories. The men's programs compete in the Big Ten Conference, while the women's programs have resided in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) since the National Collegiate Athletic Association first began to sponsor the sport for women.\nMen's ice hockey.\nSeries history.\nThe rivalry has its origins in informal play beginning in 1922, before halting 12 years later. The rivalry was revived in 1965 with Wisconsin resuming its sponsoring of the sport. In the 1981 season, the teams met for their first and only matchups to-date for the national championship. After three periods, the Badgers topped the Gophers by a score of 6 to 3 under head coach Bob Johnson. After competing together in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association since 1999, both teams moved to their all-sports home, the Big Ten Conference, in anticipation of the 2013–14 season as part of widespread NCAA realignment in hockey. While questions surrounded the continuation of many of the rivals' other historic series, such as North Dakota and Minnesota Duluth, their rivalry with each other continued uninterrupted. As of the end of the 2020–21 season, Minnesota leads the series 176–99–24.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nWomen's ice hockey.\nSeries history.\nSince women's ice hockey became an NCAA sport, the two have been the flagpole programs, with frequent Top-5 meetings and matchups in the NCAA tournament and three national championships. The rivalry is fueled by the local nature of its players; in 2019, 24 players on the two rosters hailed from either Minnesota or Wisconsin. After the Gophers prevailed in the 2019 national title, the last four matchups featured No. 1 versus No. 2. The most recent matchups featured #2 Minnesota visiting the top-ranked Badgers, as Wisconsin took both of the two game set. As of the end of the 2020–21 season, Minnesota leads the series 53–44–13.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

They worked for the train network and met in a pub by St. Mary's bridge each week before deciding that they wanted to start rowing. Initially, they rented some land by the river from the rail company and made a small boathouse (which was called the shed). Over time expansion was needed and one cold winter when the river froze, the clubhouse was moved across to the other side of the river, where it is located today. Throughout the years, many improvements have been made, the latest of which is the addition of an extension which is now our erg room and many boats have been added to our fleet. Our members have competed at the highest levels with members racing in the Boat Race, World Championships and at Henley Royal Regatta.\nThe Club.\nDRC consists of four core squads; men's, women's, junior's and masters.\nAll squads are composed of active members who train regularly and go away to race for the club at various events whether that be Henley Royal Regatta, Henley Women's Regatta or some smaller provincial regattas such as Peterborough Summer Regatta. Our squads also cater for members who are perfectly happy to come down to the club on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to go and have a paddle with their friends.\nUniversity of Derby Rowing Club.\nThe University of Derby Rowing Club is affiliated to Derby Rowing Club."

        "text": "Major League Cricket (MLC) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in the United States. Operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and sanctioned by USA Cricket, it began play on July 13, 2023, with six teams representing major US cities under a single-entity model. The first season took place over three weeks at Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, concluding on July 30, 2023. In 2021, the development league for MLC, Minor League Cricket (MiLC), completed its inaugural season, which was contested by 27 franchise-based teams.\nHistory.\nThere have been various attempts to hold a Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in the United States, such as the short-lived Pro Cricket (which played a single season in 2004), and the American Premier League, a proposed league in partnership between the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) and New Zealand Cricket, modelled after domestic T20 competitions. However, it has yet to properly launch in the United States as of February 2024.\nFormation: 2018–2021.\nIn November 2018, USA Cricket announced that it was seeking partners to establish a domestic T20 league in the country by 2021, with goals to \"engage existing fans and grow new ones\", and spur \"sustainable development of cricketing infrastructure across the United States\". In May 2019, USA Cricket accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment, covering the league and other investments benefitting the US national teams. Its partners include Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, and Willow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan. As part of the agreement, ACE also handles commercial activities for T20I and ODI matches hosted by the United States.\nIn January 2019, USA Cricket was approved as the new governing board for cricket in USA, replacing the USACA, which had been expelled from the International Cricket Council in September 2017 due to governance issues. The new body set a goal for cricket to reach wider, mainstream popularity in the country, where it has typically been considered a niche international sport.\nIn an annual general meeting on February 21, 2020, it was stated that USA Cricket planned to launch Major League Cricket in 2021, and a 22-team development league known as Minor League Cricket that summer as a prelude. Minor League Cricket was officially announced the following week, with plans to host a nine-week, 170-game season beginning July 4; however, it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.\nIn October 2020, USA Cricket reaffirmed plans to launch Major League Cricket in 2022 as part of its \"foundational plan\" for 2020–23. On December 1, 2020, it was announced that the IPL's Kolkata Knight Riders (co-owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan) would invest in ACE.\nIn February 2021, MLC announced plans for Minor League Cricket Youth and Major League Cricket Youth leagues, which would, alongside a MLC Jr. Championship and player development program, serve as a development system for younger players to progress towards Major League Cricket and the national team. In May 2021, the launch of Major League Cricket was delayed to 2023 due to COVID-19 and to provide additional time to develop facilities.\nLaunch: 2022–2023.\nIn May 2022, Major League Cricket announced it had acquired funds of US$120 million as part of its Series A and A1 fundraising rounds. Investors committing to MLC featured the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Ross Perot Jr., Anand Rajaraman, Shantanu Narayen and more. MLC plans to use these funds to mainly build stadiums and first-class facilities in the hopes of accelerating cricket's development across the United States.\nIn June 2022, MLC announced the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket Youth (MiLC Youth). The inaugural season of MiLC Youth was announced to be contested between eleven teams at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston starting July 25, 2022. The finals for the inaugural season took place on July 29 at between the Dallas Mustangs and the New Jersey Stallions, in which the Stallions beat the Mustangs by two wickets.\nIn November 2022, it was announced the first season of MLC will be staged from July 13–30, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium. The tournament will be played in a single round-robin format with 15 league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase. MLC also hopes to play matches in a to-be-constructed stadium in Los Angeles, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nIn February 2023, it was announced that the player draft for the league's inaugural season would be held on March 19, 2023.\nThe inaugural player draft was held on March 19, 2023, at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. The draft was conducted over 9 rounds via a serpentine system, where the team order is reversed every round. Out of the 9 rounds, 8 were general draft picks, with the final round being exclusively for U-23 players. Each of the six teams had a purse of over $1 million, with $800,000 for overseas players and $300,000 for US-based players. The draft had a fixed salary cap with a maximum of $75,000 (first round) and a minimum of $2,500 (ninth round). Overseas signings were directly signed and were not part of the draft. Each franchise must have a minimum of fifteen players, with the maximum being eighteen. Out of these eighteen players, a maximum of nine can be overseas players.\nFollowing the draft, it was reported that USAC had not yet sanctioned either Major or Minor League Cricket for the 2023 season, with the ICC stating that its members should not issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to release players to participate at this time. Interim chairman of the board Atul Rai citing unspecified concerns and outstanding issues over how ACE is administering the competitions, including wanting to seek a more \"favorable\" short-term agreement. MLC director Justin Geale stated that the sanctioning applications were with USA Cricket\", and that \"the recent staffing changes at USA Cricket may have contributed to any delays. In April 2023, the league was officially sanctioned by the ICC, removing a significant obstacle to the league launching in July. Play began on July 13, 2023.\n2024 season.\nIn December 2023, it was announced that the second season of the tournament would begin on July 4, 2024, just four days after the conclusion of the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. It was also reported that the matches would be played in Grand Prairie Stadium along with other venues.\nIn February 2024, the lists of retained domestic and overseas players were released ahead of the domestic player draft. In March, Cognizant was named as the title sponsor for the league from the 2024 season.\nTeams.\nMLC began with six teams and uses a single-entity structure under which all teams are owned by ACE, with investor-operators (who have invested in the company) assigned to each team. It hopes to expand to ten teams in the future.\nUSA Cricket's CEO Iain Higgins identified Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, and San Francisco as markets where the sport was most popular. The league's six inaugural teams are assigned to Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Only Dallas currently has a home stadium; the league plans to build cricket stadiums in the other locales.\nVenues.\nOn November 18, 2020, it was announced that ACE would lease AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas—home of the former Texas AirHogs independent baseball team—and convert it to a cricket-specific facility that will host a Grand Prairie-based team in Major League Cricket.\nIn March 2022, ACE discussed plans to invest $110 million in eight newly constructed or renovated venues for the league and possible hosting of matches during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup (which the United States is co-hosting with the West Indies), including the aforementioned Grand Prairie Stadium, Church Street Park in Morrisville, Moosa Stadium in Pearland, Prairie View Cricket Complex in Prairie View, and new sites in Orange County (backed by the Knight Riders), the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds, and Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington. The renovated venues have a budget of approximately $3 million each, while the three new west coast venues have a budget of $30 million each; ACE stated that the west coast venues would be completed by 2024, and will have a projected capacity of 10,000–20,000. As of November 2022, it was reported that work on the other proposed pitches had not yet commenced.\nIn February 2023, it was reported that most of the 2023 matches were set to be played in Grand Prairie, with Church Street Park set to be used as a secondary venue. Due to the summer heat in Texas, it was reported by \"ESPNcricinfo\" that most matches would be scheduled as night games, rather than scheduled in the daytime hours to attract audiences in markets such as India. With the announcement of the 2023 schedule, it was confirmed that a portion of the group stage will be played at Church Street Park; due to a curfew on the use of floodlights, these matches will begin in the early evening.\nBroadcasters.\nIn the United States, MLC games are broadcast by Willow, with selected matches also being carried by CBS Sports Network, and over-the-top television service Sling TV also streaming matches as part of a sponsorship agreement.\nInternational providers include TNT Sports (formerly BT Sport) in the United Kingdom, Sports18 in India, Fox Cricket in Australia, and Sky Sport in New Zealand.\nMinor League Cricket.\nMinor League Cricket is a developmental league for Major League Cricket that completed its inaugural season in 2021. It consists of 26 franchise-based teams in four regional divisions. Unlike Major League Cricket, Minor League Cricket uses privately owned franchises."

        "title": "Darts in Iran",
        "text": "Darts is a relatively new sport in Iran. \nHistory.\nDarts in Iran was founded in 2003 by the efforts of Masoud Zoohori and Mohammad Amin Azizpour through setting up the statutes of the sport and offering it to the Iranian sports authorities. Finally, darts in Iran started its activity as a formal association titled Iranian Darts Association (IDA) by the ratification of the Physical Education Organization of Iran (Ministry of Sport and Youth) under the supervision of the Archery Federation on September 21, 2004. Zoohori was appointed as the first president of IDA. In its early attempts, the Association prepared the statutes and regulations in order to hold darts training courses and competitions.\nThe first official darts competition in Iran was held with the coordination of the Pass Club in Tehran. The match was welcomed greatly. More than 20 correspondents from different press of the country, watched and reported this event. Moreover, some parts of this competition was aired on Iranian TV, while a particular report was prepared and broadcast by Iranian Sports Radio (Radio Varzesh).\nAfter carrying out the first Iranian darts tournament and its coverage by the media, people’s interest to this sport surged and the number of applications for conducting dart training courses increased.\nWDF Membership.\nZoohori (IDA President) and Azizpour (IDA Secretary) applied to join the World Darts Federation (WDF). In 2004, WDF invited them to participate in the Federation's convention held in Perth, Australia in 2005, to defend and provide the reasons of applying for membership of the Iran Darts Association to the WDF.\nIn this meeting, the representatives of IDA in response to the questions asked by the members and authorities of the WDF, presented a documentary report collected out of press reports, as well as, videos and photos of darts classes and competitions. In addition, they announced that at the moment nearly 500,000 people are either training or playing this sport in Iran.\nFinally, in voting for the acceptance of IDA in WDF, all the members from around 55 countries, voted in favor of acceptance and acclaimed IDA because of making darts more popular among all age groups, for about one minute.\nFirst Participation in WDF Competitions.\nThe WDF membership amplified incentives of the managers of IDA to make any endeavor both in the way of championship, and making darts a family sport.\nReturning from Australia, IDA representatives were welcomed by authorities, media and the desirous fans of this sport. In 2006, for the first time, the Iranian national darts team, led by Masoud Zoohori, participated in WDF Asia-Pacific Cup, held in Malaysia. \nIn this competition, Sahar Zohouri won second place and awarded silver medal. This was the first official WDF medal won by Zohouri for Iranian darts. Meanwhile, in this competition, Zohouri successfully beat Australia's 2005 World Darts Championship third place winner and knocked him out of the tournament.\nInternational Olympiad for Children under Seven.\nIDA provided the infrastructures and platforms needed for standardized administration of the first darts tournament among children under seven in the world, using magnetic and safety darts.\nAt the beginning of the Olympiad, Zoohori announced the plan for discovering talented individuals in this field. He addressed Iranian and international sport authorities and optimistically stated that by supporting of early years age groups (children and adolescents), achievement to the heroic manner of sport, in order to make nations stay tighter and closer in friendship, would be possible. \nHe, also, said that the optimum outcome of this diplomacy will be sustainable peace and tranquility for all the countries around the world.\nThe initiative of this tournament was suggested for the first time by Iran to the WDF. For this reason, a message was sent by Adolf Ogi, former President of Switzerland, and Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace to the United Nations Secretary-General, to the participants and authorities of the Olympiad. The message was read by Philippe Welti, Swiss Ambassador to Iran.\nOgi in part of his message addressed the young participants in the competition in Iran and said: \"I am sending this message to you from afar. I really wanted to be among you today. I hereby express my Congratulations to you. Your choice was to compete with each other concerning good sportsmanship, which is the first incentive to struggle and work hard. Courage, in comparison with other skills and powers, as well as, the energy is needed to win. Sport teaches us life lessons, which is necessary to acquire in order to live in a competitive but humanistic and peaceful society. Global development requires having a competitive spirit. In this way a person would be able to promote. The world needs peace and justice to let hopes and talents flourish. Sport can teach all of these points to us in general and children in particular. Today, you began competing against each other, and have little knowledge about life competitions. Anyhow, by trying to comply with regulations and play fairly versus your friends, you can bring prosperity to your life. \"I wish good luck to all of you who, today, participated in this darts tournament.\"\nMore than 60 teams participated in the international darts tournament for children under seven. More than 50 journalists from different media networks from around the world covered and reported this event. Nearly 3,000 spectators and fans were in the competition setting.\nEstablishment of the West Asian Darts Union.\nIn 2008, the IDA, held the first official meeting of the West Asian Darts Union with the permission of the WDF and Physical Education Organization of Iran.\nOn the sideline of this meeting which took place in the presence of Roy Price, WDF president, in Tehran, National Darts Competitions were held with the participation of wheelchair athletes. In addition, athletes who were unable to throw darts with their hands, were allowed to use air darts. This event was highly admired and appreciated by the WDF President. Following this, IDA proposed to set up Wheelchair Darts Committee in the WDF. Roy Price gave the responsibility of preparing the statutes and regulations for the formation of this committee, as well as hosting darts and wheelchair competitions to IDA. IDA also agreed to host the world's first wheelchair darts tournament under the supervision of the WDF.\n2007 Tournaments in Netherlands.\nThe Iranian national darts team delegation and competitors in the 2007 WDF World Cup:"

The Cougars, led by second-year head coach Brian Barone, played their home games in the First Community Arena at Vadalabene Center in Edwardsville, Illinois as members of the Ohio Valley Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Cougars finished the 2019–20 season 8–23, 5–13 in OVC play to finish in a tie for tenth place. The Cougars failed to qualify for the OVC Tournament.\nPreseason.\nFive players who saw major playing time and a third-year former walk-on return from the 8–23 team of 2019–20. They are joined by one junior who saw considerable action in the 2018-19 season but sat out last season as a medical \"redshirt\", three freshmen, three junior college transfers, and one transfer from another Division I program. Coach Barone, his assistants, and the Cougars recruited probably the strongest incoming group in the program's history. The recruits included SIUE's first legitimate \"blue chip\" recruit, Ray'Sean Taylor from nearby Collinsville, who suffered an ACL injury that ended his first Cougars season before it began. A second :\"blue chipper\" came on board with Sidney Wilson's late transfer from Cinnecticut. Three scholarship players with eligibility remaining did not return; two transferred to other Division I programs, and Zeke Moore is playing professionally in Spain.\nIn a vote of conference coaches and sports information directors, SIUE was picked to finish in 11th place in the OVC.\nRegular season.\nAfter leading the team with career-highs of 18 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists in the Cougars' win at Morehead State, Sidney Wilson was named the \"OVC Newcomer of the Week\" on December 21.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitated revision after revision to the Cougars' schedule. The game at Northwestern was cancelled, and nine (9) OVC games were postponed, including a postponement of a rescheduled game.\nAfter averaging 18.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocks/game while hitting 50 percent (20-of-40) from the field and 73.3 percent (11-of-15) from the free throw line in three road games, Sydney Wilson was again named the \"OVC Newcomer of the Week\" on February 1.\nThe Cougars went 33 days without a game in the span between December 18 and January 21, To make up for the nine game postponements, SIUE was scheduled to play four games per week. Then the OVC ruled that no more than three games were to be played per week; this change brought about a tenth postponement and the cancelation of a game versus Jacksonville State.\nCOVID-19, injuries, and the wear and tear of too many games in too few days to make up for all of the postponements resulted in less success than hoped for. However, the Cougars qualified for th Ohio Valley Conference Tournament, after missing it last season. This was helped by the Cougars' six road wins, the most in the Division I era.\nPostseason.\nThe Cougars, the 8th seed in the OVC Tournament, Lost to the top-seeded Belmont Bruins for a third time, but by a much closer margin.\nRoster.\n\"Source =\" \nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Ohio Valley Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Ohio Valley Conference Tournament\n† = Due to the many schedule changes, it was necessary to move SIUE's home game with Jacksonville State to Jacksonville, AL, but the game was later cancelled, when the OVC limited teams to three games per week."

Notable for investigating the coaching bug scandal in \"\", the organization has received criticisms for a lack of resources and game knowledge.\nHistory.\nThe organization was founded by Ian Smith as the \"Esports Integrity Coalition\" in 2016 before rebranding in 2019. Smith had been an attorney working in sports regulation law before he was brought into the \"Global Offensive\" scene to investigate . His recognition of the lack of regulatory bodies in the scene led to the founding of ESIC.\nServices.\nThe commission works to investigate and prevent all forms of match fixing, cheating, and use of doping, most recently investigating the coaching bug in \"\". The commission only employs five full-time workers and works by partnering with several betting websites and tournament organizers. The results of investigations are passed on to the organizers, who enforce the sanctions recommended by ESIC.\nCriticism.\nWhile ESIC was initially seen as a positive project, the organization has come under significant criticism regarding its legitimacy and competence. According to \"The Washington Post\", unnamed critics have described the organization as \"underfunded\". ESIC doing its work mostly hidden from the public has also caused \"public speculation [to curdle] into skepticism\". Although ESIC received plaudits for the CS:GO coaching bug investigation, the organization has also been criticized for a perceived lack of expertise about the games it regulates.\nThe ban of Team Spirit's coach just before the PGL Major Antwerp 2022 for a minor offense of the coaching bug in 2020 due to ESIC's investigation stalling at the time and the eventual overturn right after the major caused backlash from the CS:GO community. ESIC was criticized in December 2022 when it lifted Nicolai \"HUNDEN\" Petersen's two-year ban early after a \"constructive engagement between the two parties\". HUNDEN was banned by ESIC in August 2021 after he leaked the strategy folder of Heroic, the team he was coaching, to other teams during IEM Cologne 2021."

        "title": "2021 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2021 Major League Baseball season began on April 1, while the regular season ended on October 3. The postseason began on October 5. The World Series then began on October 26 and ended on November 2 with the Atlanta Braves defeating the Houston Astros in six games to win their second title since moving to Atlanta.\nFor the second consecutive year, cross-border travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Toronto Blue Jays to open their home schedule in the United States, with tenures in Dunedin, Florida, and Buffalo, New York. Later, the Canadian government granted an exemption to allow the Blue Jays to return to Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, beginning July 30.\nThe 91st All-Star Game held on July 13 was supposed to be held at Truist Park, the home of the Braves, but league officials moved the game to Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies, following the passage of the Georgia Senate Bill 202 by the Georgia General Assembly, which MLB considered to be restrictive of voting rights.\nThis was the final season of the Cleveland Indians competing with that nickname. On December 14, 2020, the team announced that they would unveil their new moniker and associated uniform and stadium changes before the 2022 season to replace the 106-year-old nickname. On July 23, the Indians revealed that their new nickname would be the \"Guardians\", debuting the following season.\nSchedule.\nMajor League Baseball announced the 2021 regular season schedule on July 9, 2020. A full 162-game season was played. As has been the case since 2013, all teams played their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games. They played six to seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 interleague games. For the second season in a row, interleague play will be between corresponding regions (AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central, and AL West vs. NL West) rather than continue the annual rotation. This included the New York Mets and New York Yankees being scheduled to play a series from September 10–12, which featured commemorations of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The 20 interleague games each team played consisted of two three-game series (one home, one away) against its natural rival (total of six games), two two-game series (one home, one away) against each team for two other opponents (total of eight games), and a single three-game series against each team for the last two (one home, one away; total of six games).\nThe MLB at Field of Dreams game, originally scheduled for 2020 but canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a matchup between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox at a purpose-built ballpark in Dyersville, Iowa on August 12. The White Sox won the game 9–8 when Tim Anderson hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth.\nThe 2021 MLB Little League Classic featured a matchup between the Los Angeles Angels and the Cleveland Indians at Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on August 22. The Indians won the game 3–0.\nRule changes.\nOn February 9, Major League Baseball announced the following temporary rule changes for the 2020 season would continue in the 2021 regular season:\nAdditionally, the broader use of suspended games was carried over from the 2020 season:\nAn increase of the active roster size to 26 players, originally planned for the 2020 season, took effect. Other changes that had also been planned—a limit of 13 pitchers on active rosters and restrictions on position players pitching—were waived for 2021.\nCOVID-19 protocols from the 2020 season remain in effect, but may be eased by teams once 85% of their tier-one staff (players, manager staff) are fully vaccinated.\nForeign substances controversy.\nOn June 15, MLB announced that any player found with a foreign substance (used to doctor a baseball or to improve their grip on a baseball) would be immediately ejected from the game, and would receive a 10-game suspension. Heightened enforcement of existing rules that prohibit such substances began after widespread use by pitchers to increase their grip and spin rate.\nSpring training.\nSpring training for the 2021 season began in late February and lasted through March. Teams began workouts and practice for spring training beginning in late February. Pitchers and catchers reported first, followed by position players a few days later.\nPrior to the start of the regular season, each team played between 24 and 29 spring training games, beginning on February 28. There were several times during spring training where a team had two different squads playing different teams simultaneously. In addition to spring training games, teams occasionally played exhibition games with non-MLB teams, such as Minor League Baseball teams, independent teams, or college teams. These exhibition games were not counted in spring training standings. Spring training ended on March 30, two days before the Opening Day.\nAwards and honors.\nAll-MLB Team.\nPlayers were selected through fan votes (50%) and votes from a panel of experts (50%). The winners were selected based on merit, with no set number of nominees per position and no distinction between leagues.\nUniforms.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nCity Connect uniforms.\nThe Nike MLB \"City Connect\" program aims to create new uniform designs inspired by the teams' home cities.\nThe following teams released alternate uniforms as part of Nike's \"City Connect\" series:\nVenues.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers' Miller Park was renamed American Family Field after Madison, Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance outbid the Miller Brewing Company for the ballpark's naming rights. Miller's 20-year contract expired at the end of the 2020 season.\nOn March 31, the Miami Marlins announced that Marlins Park would be renamed to LoanDepot Park, as the naming rights were sold to Lake Forest, California-based LoanDepot.\nCOVID-19 restrictions.\nUnlike 2020, where all games (except the NLCS and World Series) were played behind closed doors, all MLB teams allowed in-person attendance this season; initial capacities were determined by teams and local health officials, and gradually increased to full capacity over the course of the season as active cases declined and more local residents received COVID-19 vaccines. To help promote vaccination, a number of teams announced that they would sponsor walk-in clinics at their home games (with the Seattle Mariners being the first to do so), and offer promotions such as merchandise or game tickets for those who use the clinics (Atlanta, New York Mets and Yankees), or other promotions for vaccinated spectators at games.\nOn February 18, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that they would open the home portion of their schedule at TD Ballpark in Dunedin, Florida due to travel restrictions enforced by the Canadian federal government. On May 5, it was announced that the Blue Jays would return to Sahlen Field in Buffalo—where the team played the majority of their home games in 2020—on June 1. On July 16, the Blue Jays received a National Interest Exemption from the Canadian government to host games at Rogers Centre beginning July 30.\nBroadcast rights.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis was the eighth and final year of the contracts with Fox, ESPN, and TBS before the new seven-year deals begin in 2022. FS1 televised games on Tuesday nights and on Saturday, both during the afternoon and evening. Fox also aired some Saturday night games. ESPN televised games on its flagship \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as Monday and Wednesday night games and holiday games on Memorial Day and Labor Day. ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts were exclusive.\nTBS televised 13 straight weeks of Sunday afternoon games and also televised the National League postseason. The American League postseason was split between ESPN, Fox/FS1, and MLB Network (AL Wild Card on ESPN, the ALDS split between FS1 and MLB Network, and the ALCS on Fox and FS1). For the 22nd straight year, the 2021 World Series aired exclusively on Fox.\nA three-game series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants, whose regional television rights were both held by the NBC Sports Regional Networks, aired exclusively and nationally on NBC's streaming service Peacock. The first time that NBC Sports produced a nationally televised Major League Baseball game since the year 2000.\nABC televised a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" matchup between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs on August 8. The broadcast marked ABC's first broadcast of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and the first regular season game it has broadcast since its involvement in The Baseball Network in 1995. Former ABC broadcaster and 2021 Ford C. Frick Award winner Al Michaels appeared as a special guest.\nRetirements.\nThe following players retired during the 2021 season and before the start of 2022 campaign:"

        "text": "The 1986 Brisbane Rugby League premiership was the 77th season of Brisbane's professional rugby league football competition. Nine teams from across Brisbane competed for the premiership, which culminated in a grand final match between the Wynnum-Manly and Past Brothers clubs. The season was notable as premiers Wynnum-Manly became the first club to complete a \"grand slam\" of all four major titles in a single BRL season, winning the pre-season competition, the Winfield State League, the Woolies Trophy (contested between the two sides leading the Winfield premiership at the end of the first round-robin), and the Winfield Cup premiership itself.\nSeason summary.\nThe format of the Winfield Cup was changed for the 1986 season, with the pre-season games no longer awarding competition points. The first round of the regular season was played on March 30, after the pre-season but before the Winfield State League. Each club then played either 3 or 4 games against another Brisbane side during the State League, followed by the remaining 13 games of the regular season. This resulted in each team playing 16 first-grade games over 18 rounds. The inclusion of the Ipswich Jets, the first team to join the BRL since Wynnum-Manly rejoined in 1951, resulted in the reintroduction of the bye. Teams that played three first-grade games during the State League received one bye in the regular season, while those that played four times received two (excluding byes for the Woolies Trophy contested between Valleys and Wynnum-Manly). The season resulted in a top four of Wynnum-Manly, Redcliffe, Past Brothers and Fortitude Valley.\nPre-Season.\nThe 1986 Woolies pre-season competition took place over 5 rounds, from February 14 to March 16. Four pre-season competition points were available in each match, with one point going to the side that scored the most points in each half and two points to the winning side. Unlike previous years, no points for the regular season were awarded for wins in the pre-season competition. The pre-season final was held on March 23, between Wynnum-Manly and Brothers. The Brethren were without captain Trevor Bailey, who would also miss the Winfield State League and five rounds of the regular season. Centre Robert Grogan captained Brothers in Bailey's absence against a Wally Lewis captain-coached Wynnum-Manly side, scoring the first try of the match to give the Brethen a 4-2 lead at halftime. Wynnum-Manly would ultimately win the final 10-8 after tries from Scott Lewis and Craig Farrugia.\nLadder.\nSource:\nWoolies Trophy.\nThe 1986 Woolies Trophy match was held on July 13, between rounds 12 and 13 of the regular season. The Trophy was contested by Wynnum-Manly and Fortitude Valley, the teams that led the competition after the end of round 9, with the other sides having an extra bye.\nMatch details.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nGrand Final.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nWinfield State League.\nThe 1986 Winfield State League was the inaugural season of the Queensland Rugby League's statewide competition. A total of 14 teams competed in the season, 8 of which were BRL Premiership clubs. The remaining six were regional teams from across the state, hence the \"State League\" name.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Shockers represent Wichita State University in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nWichita State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1905. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Wichita State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The Boxing and Wrestling Act 1981 passed in 1981 in New Zealand is an Act of Parliament. The Act replaced the Boxing and Wrestling Regulations 1958. The Act has professional wrestling and boxing in an amateur, corporate, exhibition and professional level to require a police permit for the event to take place under an approved organisation. The Act is administrated by The Department of Internal Affairs.\nInterpretation.\nA boxing or wrestling event requires an association (whether corporate or unincorporate) to officiate the event. Every event needs to have an approved police permit from the district police department. The police will do a small background check on all the boxers and approve or decline the boxer's participation depending on any active or past criminal charges or court hearings. Creating a new association to be allowed to officiate can be a lengthy process and requires the association to have a recommendation from the Commissioner of Police, a constitution, suitability of the rules, names and addresses of the members of the executive committee and more. The act also specifies that the permit is required when there is charge of administrated or contribution is put toward the event. It also requires money when people \"...contribute money or to throw money into the ring or to otherwise deposit it in the building where the contest is held or elsewhere, or on the result of which any stake, payment, or prize depends.\"\nExclusions.\nIn the Act, it quotes \"but does not include any of those forms of physical combat commonly known as the Asian martial arts\". This means the Act excludes MMA Fighting, Kickboxing, Muay Thai Fighting, Bareknuckle fighting, Karate, Judo, Taekwondo and more combat sports. In recent years, Asian martial arts have become a vague loophole that promoters have used to get around the legislation, by getting boxers to take their shoes off as they compete. In 2017, a new sport was created to get around the legislation called Mod Boxing, which is essentially Muay Thai Fighting without any kicks.\nPetition for change.\nIn December 2018, Boxing Judge Benjamin Thomas Watt created a petition to update the Boxing and Wrestling Act 1981 to include all combat sports. This petition came after the death of Kain Parsons, Lucy Brown and a serious knockout to Joel Rea which all happen within 5 months of the petition. New Zealand First politician Shane Jones pledging changes to the Boxing and Wrestling Act following an inner rival gang fight night in 2017. Unfortunately, only 49 signatures were obtained, and no further progress happened. In November 2022, Benjamin Thomas Watt created a new petition in hopes to create a combat sports authority. However, Watt petition failed a second time."

It was run on November 7, 2020 at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky with a purse of $6,000,000. It was won by Authentic in a track record time of 1:59.60.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nThe race was broadcast on NBC.\nContenders.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic is open to up to 14 starters, with automatic berths for horses that win one of the designated \"Win and You're In\" Breeders' Cup Challenge races. Other horses are ranked by their performances in graded stakes races and by the judgement of a panel of racing experts.\nEntries were taken on November 2. The leading contenders were:\nThe filly Swiss Skydiver qualified for both the Classic and Distaff by winning the Preakness Stakes and Alabama Stakes respectively. Her connections decided to enter her in the Distaff.\nRace description.\nOn a very fast track that appeared to favor front runners, Authentic went to the early lead, followed by Maximum Security. Tiz the Law also broke well but was taken back and was never a factor. Improbable broke to the inside, bumping into several horses to his inside. He then rated in midpack until the final turn, moving to within a length of Authentic as they entered the stretch. Authentic responded to the challenge and drew away down the stretch to win by lengths.\nIt was the fourth classic win for Authentic's trainer Bob Baffert, and the first for veteran jockey John Velazquez. Baffert had sharpened up Authentic's training after being defeated in the Preakness, telling Velazquez, \"The horse you're riding this week is the horse that you rode in the Derby. You can ride him with confidence. You can be aggressive. You can do what you want. And he's just a really top horse.\"\nAuthentic became the fourth Kentucky Derby winner to also take the Classic in their three-year-old campaign, after Sunday Silence in 1989, Unbridled in 1990, and American Pharoah in 2015. Derby winners Ferdinand and Alysheba won the Classic in their four-year-old campaign. Authentic was subsequently named the 2020 American Horse of the Year.\nAuthentic broke the track record set by American Pharoah five years ago in the same race. The teletimer did not function properly so the race was hand-timed, initially in 1:59.16 based on the video and then in 1:59.60 using additional camera angles. Note that races in North America typically have a \"run-up\" between where the stating gate is placed until the official starting point at which the timer starts (50 feet in this case), which complicates hand timing.\nResults.\nTimes: – 23.20; – 46.84; – 1:10.32; mile – 1:34.64; final – 1:59.60.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.20) (23.64) (23.48) (24.32) (24.96)\nSource: Revised Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

He spent the majority of the subsequent season with the Kanata Lasers of the Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL) while also appearing in eight games for the 67's. Quinn's rookie season in 2018–19 saw him score 12 goals and 20 assists in 61 games. He also went scoreless in two postseason games. Quinn's draft year was far more productive; he recorded 52 goals and 37 assists for 89 points in 62 games. His goal totals placed him second overall, just three behind Peterborough Petes' forward Nick Robertson.\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, Quinn was selected eighth overall by the Buffalo Sabres. On November 16, 2020, he signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the organization.\nDue to the 2020–21 OHL season being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Quinn skated in 15 games for the Sabres' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans. His year was ended prematurely, however, as he underwent season-ending hernia surgery in late-April. He finished his first professional campaign with two goals and seven assists for the Americans.\nOn January 11, 2022, Quinn made his NHL debut; he went scoreless in a 6–1 defeat to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Quinn was reassigned to the Americans the following day. On January 20, 2022, Quinn scored his first NHL goal and added an assist in a 5–4 defeat to the Dallas Stars.\n "

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bison represent Bucknell University in the NCAA's Patriot League.\nBucknell began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1895. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Bucknell's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The first Greek Basketball Super Cup was held prior to the start of the 1986–87 season, and it was organised under the auspices of the Hellenic Basketball Federation (E.O.K.). It was contested between the 1985–86 Greek Basket League season champions, Aris Thessaloniki, and the 1985–86 Greek Basketball Cup winners, Panathinaikos Athens. \nIn subsequent seasons, Aris went on to win both the Greek League championship and the Greek Cup (the domestic double title), for the next four consecutive seasons (1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, and 1989–90). So there was no reason to hold the Greek Super Cup over those next four seasons. However, the Greek Super Cup was revived much later, with the 2020 edition of the competition, under the auspices of the Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association (HEBA), using a different four-team format.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was played between the 1985–86 Greek Basket League champions, Aris, and the 1985–86 Greek Basketball Cup winners, Panathinaikos Athens.

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but SMU's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

Set at the fictional Middleview High School in Calgary, Alberta, in 1999, the film depicts various goings-on centered around the school's largely unsuccessful basketball team, including the referee being forced to babysit his wife's dog, point guard Joel's attempts to indoctrinate his teammates in the philosophy of \"The Matrix\", and the school's theatre students planning a protest after being denied permission to stage a \"post-colonial\" production of \"King Lear\".\nThe film was acted by a cast of predominantly amateur local actors, apart from Andrew Phung in the role of the basketball team's assistant coach Brent. It was shot in 2019 at Calgary's Queen Elizabeth High School, and was funded by Telefilm Canada's Talent to Watch microbudget film financing program.\nThe film premiered on September 24, 2020, on the VIFF Connect platform of the 2020 Vancouver International Film Festival, and was screened over the next week on the virtual platforms of the 2020 Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival and the Calgary International Film Festival. It was screened at the 2021 Canadian Film Festival, where it won the William F. White Reel Canadian Indie award."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Elite One Championship was the 86th season of France's domestic rugby league competition and the 20th season known as the Elite One championship. There were ten teams in the league. Each team played 18 matches in the regular season. The top six teams progressed to the finals series.\nThere were no draws. In case of an equal score, the rule of the \"Golden point\" was applied.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, games were played behind closed doors.\nSome games were televised on the free to air TV regional channel ViàOccitanie. Yet, as this channel was facing economic difficulties, the clubs tend to broadcast their home games via the social networks.\nLadder.\nAt the end of the preliminary phase, the top two clubs qualified for the semi-finals.\nThe other ones played the Playoffs. The third and fourth best-placed clubs hosted the Elimination finals.\nSource:\nPlayoffs.\nAll playoffs games were broadcast on YouTube.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nUnlike, for instance, the BBC, France Television didn't offer any program to the French public about Rugby League. This has been a real issue for the game. Explanations usually given are the low number of participants in France but also pressure which would be made by the Union authorities on the French Public Television Group.\nIn the early 2020s, some Elite 1 games are televised by a local channel ViàOccitanie; this is a free-to-air channel in the South of France but they are also available on the internet and via the triple play internet devices. Therefore, they offer, indirectly, a nationwide coverage of the domestic championship.\nPresently, French clubs have to fund the broadcast of their own games or to televise their own matches themselves via the social networks or YouTube.\nRadio.\nRadio Marseillette, a local Southern radio, has rugby league debate and news every Saturday from 10:00 to 12:00. They also have commentary on some Elite League games.\nPress.\nThe French national mainstream media barely follow the game. Very occasionally, some articles about the sport are published in newspapers such as Le Monde, Le Figaro or the national Sport newspaper L'Équipe.\nNevertheless, there is undoubtedly a French specificity: the Weekly Rugby Union magazine Midi Olympique has a one-page section devoted to Rugby League. However, only two local newspapers genuinely cover the game; L'Indépendant ( based in the South of France) and la Dépêche du Midi (based in the South west of the country).\nThe British Rugby League press cover this championship; for example magazines like Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express offer a weekly report of the games. In Australia, the monthly publication Rugby League Review offer a few columns about the games as well."

The Golden Griffins represent Canisius College in the NCAA's Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.\nCanisius began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Canisius's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Boxing NZ inc (formerly known as New Zealand Boxing Association, also known as Boxing New Zealand) is New Zealand's leading amateur boxing organisation that was established in 1924.\nFirst boxing organisations.\nThe first boxing fight that was recorded in New Zealand was in July 1862 in Canterbury between London boxer Harry Jones and local boxer George Barton. It lasted 70 minutes over 30 rounds of bare fisted boxing. A council was formed in 1902 called the New Zealand Boxing Council which was administrated in Christchurch. In 1924 the New Zealand Boxing Association (NZBA) took over as the country's boxing body as the previous body no longer found themselves adequately to control the sport. NZBA moved the headquarters to Wellington.\nProfessional boxing.\nBetween 1924 and the 2000s, the NZBA was the leading organisation in both amateur and professional boxing. With the introduction of different boxing organisations, Boxing NZ began to focus solely on amateur boxing. The first recorded New Zealand National professional boxing title was won in 1884 by Harry Laing. The first recorded boxing association champion was Hock Keys in 1905 and Carrie Blackburn in September 1924 after NZBA took over as the country's body. The last person to win the boxing title was Colin Hunia in 2004. But the last contest for the title was in 2006 between Guillermo Mosquera and David Wiremu which ended in a draw. This is all according to BoxRec. Boxing NZ has not commissioned a professional boxing bout since 2011, however they are legally allowed to do so if they wish to. However the days of the Pro-Am events were over when the rise of corporate boxing began and took over New Zealand's boxing industry.\nWomen's boxing.\nNZBA was purely a male sport and was officiated only by male referees and judges. This changed in 1990 with Trish Howie becoming the first New Zealand boxing official in New Zealand. In 1996 the NZBA passed a rule to finally allow women to box in New Zealand. The first women's bout was held in 1997.\nNationals and Golden Gloves.\nBoxing NZ holds an annual boxing competition to determine the New Zealand National Boxing Championship, which generally happens within the last quarter of the year. They also host three Golden Gloves events through the year, one for North Island, one for South Island, and finally a National Golden Gloves Championship. The Golden Gloves Championship are separate from the National and generally happen in the middle of the year. The championships first began in 1902.\nLocal bodies.\nBoxing NZ has over 20 local bodies located across New Zealand to act on behalf of Boxing NZ. One of the most notable is the Auckland Boxing Association, where the majority of New Zealand Boxing events are held at the ABA Stadium.\nOpen division for trans boxers.\nIn April 2022, Rainbow Boxing New Zealand Closed down noting the lack of support for the LGBT+ community from Boxing NZ. Benjamin Thomas Watt who was the former President of Rainbow Boxing stated that Boxing NZ refused to create a division for transgender boxers, so that they can participate in their own division. The Rainbow Boxing President stated “was not ready to open its arms to the Rainbow Community.” Four months after the article, Boxing New Zealand created an \"Open\" division for Transgender boxers to compete in."

Twenty-two teams from eleven regions qualified for the tournament based on their placement in regional circuits, such as those in China, Europe, North America, South Korea and Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau/Southeast Asia, with ten of those teams having to reach the main \"groups\" event via a play-in stage.\n\"Take Over\" was the tournament's theme song, put together by Henry Lau, Max Schneider, and A Day to Remember's lead vocalist Jeremy McKinnon.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which was mainly confined to China in January and early February 2020, affected the multi-city hosting format that was present previously. On 1 August, Riot Games announced the dates and location of the event, with all stages taking place in Shanghai through the use of an \"isolation bubble\" environment.\nIn September 2020, Riot Games announced that due to travel restrictions, two teams from VCS of Vietnam would not participate in the tournament.\nDuring the 2020 Worlds Group Draw Show, it was revealed that PSG Talon's members \"River\" and \"Tank\" would be unable to attend the play-in stage due to delayed visas and quarantine issues, and that Hsiao \"Kongyue\" Jen-tso and Chen \"Uniboy\" Chang-chu would be loaned from ahq eSports Club to replace them. The organization confirmed this in an official announcement the next day, and further stated that \"Unified\" would also be unable to participate in the first half of the play-in stage for the same reason. Chen \"Dee\" Chun-dee was loaned from Machi Esports to replace Unified.\nQualified teams and rosters.\nQualified teams.\nAs the two Vietnamese teams (the Champion's Team Flash and Runner-up's GAM Esports of VCS Summer) are unable to participate, the third seed team from South Korea (LCK) will be promoted to start in the main group stage, as they were previously dropped to the play-in stage. The qualification format for North America and Europe changed with teams directly qualifying based on the results from their respective summer playoffs. Due to the merger of Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau (LMS) and the Southeast Asian (LST) professional leagues into a single league (PCS) and have been reduced number of Worlds' spots from 4 to 2, Europe (LEC) will have another direct spot in the group stage and China (LPL) will have an additional spot in the play-in stage for the regional finals runner-up.\nFor the pool, the Main Group stage's pool #2 with 8 teams like as last year will be split to two pools #2 and pool #3, with 4 teams each pool. Qualified teams from Play-in stage will be drawn as pool #4. The Play-in stage's pool #3 in last year will be merged into pool #2, increased to 6 teams.\nVenues.\nShanghai was the city chosen to host the competition. Almost all matches were played at Shanghai Media Tech Studio without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the final match was held at Pudong Football Stadium."

Contested over 200 laps on the asphalt superspeedway, it was the first race of the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series season. In one of the biggest surprise upsets in Daytona 500 history, Michael McDowell, driving for Front Row Motorsports, won after Team Penske teammates Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski wrecked battling for the lead on the final lap. McDowell was a 100–1 underdog, making his 358th Cup Series start and driving for a team with only two previous Cup Series victories.\nReport.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways, the others being Auto Club Speedway, Pocono Raceway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees. The race will be the return of multiple retired drivers, such as 2010 winner Jamie McMurray and Derrike Cope, the 1990 winner. The race will also be the debut of drivers Anthony Alfredo, Chase Briscoe, Austin Cindric and Noah Gragson. Although Gragson missed the race due to Crashing in duel 2. The race will also be the debut of many new teams, most notably 23XI Racing.\nThis is the first Daytona 500 without two-time Daytona 500 winner Jimmie Johnson since 2001.\nFirst practice (February 9).\nBubba Wallace was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 45.057 seconds and a speed of . This was the first practice session for a NASCAR Cup Series race in almost a year, the last one being at the 2020 March Phoenix Race.\nQualifying.\nAlex Bowman scored the pole for the race with a time of 47.056 and a speed of .\nElectrical problems for Derrike Cope and multiple inspection failures for Noah Gragson kept them from taking a timed lap.\nBluegreen Vacations Duels.\nThe Bluegreen Vacations Duels are a pair of NASCAR Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nPractice (post–Duels).\nSecond practice (February 13).\nBrad Keselowski was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 45.826 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 13).\nFinal practice session scheduled for Saturday was cancelled due to rain.\nRace.\nAlex Bowman started on pole, as the race was under threat from rain and thunderstorms. Derrike Cope cut a tire and hit the wall on lap 3, ironically during the lap 3 tribute to Dale Earnhardt, who cut a tire allowing Cope to win the 500 thirty-one years earlier, to bring out the first caution while causing damage to Bubba Wallace. On lap 14, \"The Big One\" struck in turn 3 as Aric Almirola and Bowman got turned into the outside wall collecting 16 cars. Two laps later, the race was red-flagged for 5 hours and 40 minutes due to rain and lightning. The race restarted with Kevin Harvick as the leader. Defending winner Denny Hamlin won stages 1 and 2 as Christopher Bell lost a left-rear tire and spun collecting Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Jamie McMurray in stage 2. The final stage remained caution-free as Hamlin, in contention to win the race for the third consecutive time, pitted from the lead on final pit stops but fell back to 13th as the pack got single file with Joey Logano leading. On the last lap, Brad Keselowski attempted to pass Logano on the backstretch but the two collided, creating a fiery crash sending Keselowski into the catchfence and collecting Kyle Busch, Joey Logano, Bubba Wallace, Austin Cindric, Kyle Larson, Ryan Preece, Ross Chastain and Cole Custer. Michael McDowell, who was third at the time, dodged the final lap crash to win his first career victory under caution as well as earning Front Row Motorsports' third Cup victory.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 65\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 65\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 70\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been broadcast on Fox in the United States.
