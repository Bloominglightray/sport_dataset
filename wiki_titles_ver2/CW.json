He is also a former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins.\nHunter played baseball as a child, and helped lead his team to the Little League World Series in 1955. He graduated from Delaware Township High School in Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill), New Jersey, and played college football for the Syracuse Orange. While a student-athlete at Syracuse University, \"he helped organize the school's boycott of Southern schools whose stadiums were segregated.\"\nIn the NFL, he had one career reception which went for a touchdown. He caught a 29-yard touchdown pass from Dick Shiner in the fourth quarter of a game on October 10, 1965 at District of Columbia Stadium.\nFollowing his football career, Hunter attended law school at UC Berkeley School of Law and became an attorney. One of the youngest United States Attorneys in history, he was appointed to serve the Northern District of California, where he prosecuted high-profile federal defendants including members of Hells Angels and the Black Panther Party. Hunter was named the executive director of the NBPA in 1996.\nHunter was criticized for employing many family members within the NBPA. An external audit initiated by Derek Fisher uncovered numerous irregularities, and a select committee of NBA players unanimously ousted Hunter from his position on February 16, 2013, during the NBA All-Star break. In May 2013, Hunter sued the NBPA, Fisher and Jamie Wior—Fisher's publicist and business partner—seeking compensation and punitive damages. The suit claimed that Fisher had a secret deal with NBA owners during the 2011 NBA lockout. In January 2014, a judge dismissed all of Hunter's claims against Wior and Fisher, and Hunter dropped his subsequent appeal in May. However, the judge also ruled that it was the union's prerogative to fire Hunter, but allowed Hunter's claim that he was still owed $10.5 million to continue."

It is located in the Pierce Street Historic District.\nRobert Walter Johnson (1899–1971) was a Lynchburg physician, the first minority doctor in the entire city to be granted practice rights at the Lynchburg General Hospital. In addition to his work, Dr. Johnson was a successful trainer for promising African-American tennis players. His American Foursquare style home, built in 1911, includes an adjacent tennis court on the lot next door.\nA successful college athlete, Johnson used his athletic skill and personal funds to found the Junior Development Program of the American Tennis Association during the 1950s. Stressing sportsmanship and discipline, Johnson trained stars such as Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe, the first African-Americans to ever win at Wimbledon.\nThe house was also offered as lodging to distinguished African-Americans passing through the city, as blacks were usually denied occupancy from hotels. Guests included the famed Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson, Lionel Hampton, and Roy Campanella.\nThe red clay tennis court where Ashe and Gibson mastered their art was last used in 1971, after which it became buried under grass with the net posts protruding to show where the court was. In May 2018, a new green clay court was installed and dedicated on the site.\nDespite being on the National Register of Historic Places, the house has fallen into disrepair."

Kumar was known for his exceptional skills and ball control. He was a member of the Indian team that won the 1975 World Cup.\nHe was awarded the Arjuna Award in 1974 and, in 1975, scored the winning goal against Pakistan to achieve India's only win in the World Cup. He was awarded with Yash Bharati by the Government of Uttar Pradesh in the 2013. In 2024, he was awarded the Hockey India Major Dhyan Chand Lifetime Achievement Award.\nCareer.\nAshok Kumar played for Rajasthan University in 1966-67 and All India Universities in 1968-69. Thereafter, he moved to Calcutta to play for Mohun Bagan Club and represented Bengal in the National Championships in Bangalore in 1971. He later joined Indian Airlines and represented it in national tournaments. He made his international debut in 1970 when he was included in the team for the Asian Games in Bangkok, losing the title to Pakistan. He also took part in the 1974 and 1978 Asian Games held at Tehran and Bangkok respectively, winning silver medals in those two games.\nKumar represented India in the Olympic Games twice, in 1972 in Munich and in 1976 in Montreal. In 1972, India finished third and, in 1976, India finished seventh, the first time since 1928 that India was not in top three. He played at the Pesta Sukha International Tournament in Singapore in 1971 and captained the team to the 1979 Esanda Hockey Tournament in Perth, Western Australia. He played for the All-Asian star team, where his father Dhyan Chand watched him play for the first time in 1974, and was selected twice for the World XI team.\nAt the World Cup.\nHe was a member of the team that won the bronze medal at the first World Cup in Barcelona in 1971 and silver at the second World Cup in Amsterdam in 1973. The highlight of his career was the 1975 Hockey World Cup in Kuala Lumpur where he scored an important goal in the final match for India against Pakistan. On a pass from Surjit Singh, Kumar hit the ball goalwards. The ball hit the corner of the post and bounced out, but for a fraction of a second the ball had been in the goal and, despite protests by Pakistan, the Malaysian umpire confirmed the goal. His fourth and final appearance in the World Cup was in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina when India was relegated to sixth position.\nOn retirement from active sports, he was appointed manager of the hockey teams of Indian Airlines and Air India."

        "text": "\"Basketball\" is a rap song written by William Waring, Robert Ford, Kurtis Blow, J. B. Moore, Jimmy Bralower, and Full Force and recorded by Kurtis Blow, released in 1984 from his album \"Ego Trip\".\nSong history.\nAccording to Blow, the idea for the song came from his then-girlfriend (whom he later married), who told him, \"You need to make a song about basketball, it's the No. 1 sport for African-Americans and nobody has done it yet.\" Twenty-five famous basketball players are mentioned during the recording. Waring was primarily responsible for choosing which players would be mentioned in the song, but Blow specified that his favorite player, Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving, would be mentioned first. Blow said in 2013, \"We wanted the guys we grew up watching who were all out of the league by the time the song came out, and the best of that time.\" The lyrics consist of rhymed couplets, a structure which has been described as \"typical of early-1980s rap\". The song's hook was sung by Alyson Williams, who later had hit songs of her own on the R&amp;B chart.\nThe music video for the song was directed by Michael Oblowitz, who had a $25,000 budget. The video included cameos by rappers The Fat Boys and Whodini. Although Blow had wanted the video to include footage of the players mentioned in the song, the National Basketball Association would only provide clearance for use of still photos of Micheal Ray Richardson (who is not mentioned in the lyrics). \nNevertheless, the NBA later took an interest in Blow's song and played it at games, as well as creating its own video that featured clips of every player mentioned in the song. Blow said, \"When the song was peaking, the NBA started flying me around to do shows. ... I would do a live performance right after the game to fill the arena.\"\nThe video game \"NBA 2K12\" used the song during the introduction.\nLil’ Bow Wow version.\nLil' Bow Wow covered the song in 2002, featuring Jermaine Dupri, Fabolous and Fundisha for the \"Like Mike\" soundtrack."

        "title": "Hot Spot (cricket)",
        "text": "Hot Spot is an infrared imaging system used in cricket to determine whether the ball has struck the batsman, bat or pad. Hot Spot requires two infrared cameras on opposite sides of the ground above the field of play that are continuously recording an image. Any suspected nick or bat/pad event can be verified by examining the infrared image, which usually shows a bright spot where contact friction from the ball has elevated the local temperature. Where referrals to an off-field third umpire are permitted, the technology is used to enhance the on-field umpire's decision-making accuracy. Where referrals are not permitted, the technology is used primarily as an analytical aid for television coverage.\nUse.\nThe system's principal application in cricket is in deciding whether the ball has struck the batsman's bat or pad – this determination being critical in determining if a batsman is out or not on appeal for LBW or caught.\nIn considering whether a batsman is out when the ball strikes bat then caught by a member of the fielding team or caught in front of the stumps when ball hits pad, one of the most difficult decisions is whether the ball struck the pad only, or the bat only, or (if it struck both) whether the pad or the bat was struck first. If the ball strikes the bat only, or strikes the bat followed by the pad, then the batsman could be out caught but not LBW. If the ball strikes the pad in front of the stumps or inline with stumps, then the batsman could be out LBW but not caught. If the ball strikes the pad followed by the bat, then the batsman could be out LBW or out caught if a fielder catches the ball. The batsman's bat and pad are often close together, and it can be very hard to determine by eye which was struck first, whereas the hotspot technology can often resolve the question.\nHot-spot imagery is also used to show which part of the cricket bat hit the ball, as ideally the batsmen try to \"middle\" the ball i.e. hit it where the sweet spot lies. Hot spot camera provides some valuable information while analysing the strokes played by a batsman.\nMechanism.\nHot Spot uses two infra-red cameras positioned at either end of the ground. These cameras sense and measure heat from friction generated by a collision, such as ball on pad, ball on bat, ball on ground or ball on glove. Using a subtraction technique a series of black-and-white negative frames are generated into a computer, precisely localising the ball's point of contact.\nHistory.\nHot Spot uses technology developed in the military for tank and jet fighter tracking. The technology was adapted for television by BBG Sports, the Australian company responsible for the Snickometer. The technology was first used during the first Test match of the 2006-07 Ashes at the Gabba on 23 November 2006.\nThe International Cricket Council announced that Hot Spot images would be available for use as part of its ongoing technology trial during the second and third Tests (March 2009) in South Africa. The system was to be available to the third umpire in the event of a player referral.\nFor the 2012 season BBG Sport introduced a new generation of Hot Spot using high performance SLX-Hawk thermal imaging cameras provided by UK-based Selex ES (part of Italian-owned defence contractor Finmeccanica, later renamed Leonardo S.p.A.). These cameras provided sharper images with improved sensitivity and much less motion blur than earlier Hot Spot technologies. As a result, the upgraded Hot Spot system was able to detect much finer edge nicks than in previous seasons, essentially ending all earlier doubts about the capability of the technology. Following the success of this updated Hot Spot system, BBG Sport and Selex signed an exclusivity agreement for the supply of SLX-Hawk cameras for Hot Spot in cricket and other sports.\nComparison.\nHot Spot has two main advantages over its competing technology, the Snickometer and Ultra Edge, which are sound-detection based systems. These two systems often produce inconclusive results indicating contact (potentially any combination of bat, pad, feet shuffling, bat handle squeak) only, whereas the Hot Spot clearly shows exactly what that ball has struck. Independent testing has shown Snickometer and other competing sound based technologies are susceptible to the concept of the \"Phantom Snick\", where the sound of the ball whooshing past the bat sometimes creates a sound, even when the ball does not touch the bat."

        "text": "The Boston University Terriers men’s ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents Boston University. They played their first game in 1918 and have won five national championships, while making 24 appearances in the Frozen Four.\nBU has won 12 major conference tournament championships as well as 31 titles in the historic Beanpot tournament featuring the four major Boston collegiate hockey teams.\nBU played in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) from 1961 to 1984, winning five tournament championships; and has since competed in the Hockey East Association, winning seven tournament titles. Ice hockey is the most popular sport at Boston University and has a large fan base on campus and among BU alumni nationwide.\nNational Championships.\nThe Terriers have won five national championships, and are the only eastern team to win back-to-back NCAA titles. They won their first title in 1971 and repeated in 1972, with both titles won under head coach Jack Kelley. BU won their other three titles under head coach Jack Parker, in 1978, 1995, and 2009. In 1972, 1995, and 2009, BU won the \"triple crown,\" consisting of the Beanpot, conference tournament and NCAA championships. In 1995 and 2009, the Terriers also won the Hockey East regular season title, giving the team four major trophies in a single season.\nThe Terriers have appeared in the Frozen Four 24 times and were the runners-up on five occasions. BU has made it to the NCAA Tournament an additional ten times without advancing to the Frozen Four, in 1984, 1986, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2012, and 2015.\nRunners-up in 1950, 1967, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2015\nECAC Conference Championships.\nBU competed in the ECAC from 1961 to 1984, winning six regular-season titles and five tournament championships.\nHockey East Conference Championships.\nBU has competed in the Hockey East conference since the 1984–85 season, winning nine ten-season titles and eight tournament championships.\nBeanpot results.\nBoston University is sometimes jokingly referred to as “Beanpot University” because of its success in the annual mid-season hockey tournament called the Beanpot. This highly anticipated single-elimination tournament is contested by Boston University, Northeastern University, Harvard University, and Boston College, with the winner receiving the coveted Beanpot trophy and bragging rights over its Boston rivals. The four-team tournament is played on the first two Mondays of February at the TD Garden. Of the 62 Beanpots played since the 1952–1953 season, Boston University has been victorious on 31 occasions. The Terriers' last win came in 2022 as they defeated Northeastern University 1-0 in the final round.\nList of Beanpot championships: 1958, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2022\nRecent seasons.\n2009–2010.\nBU's season started off with a banner-raising ceremony to commemorate the previous season's Beanpot, Hockey East and NCAA championship victories. But it was a disappointing year for the Terriers overall.\nBU lost six of its first eight games, and the team finished with an 18–17–3 record that was not good enough to secure a berth in the NCAA tournament.\nThe season's second half was better than the first, with BU defeating Boston College in a unique game played outdoors at Fenway Park, one of nine wins in a span of 12 games. But the Terriers lost to BC in the title game of the Beanpot tournament and to Maine in the semifinals of the Hockey East tournament, putting an end to BU's defense of its national championship.\n2008–2009.\nThe Terriers ended the season as national champions with a 35–6–4 record, setting a team high for games won. They finished the season ranked #1 in both the USCHO.com/CBS College Sports Poll and the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine Poll, earning the #1 overall seed in the 2009 NCAA championship. BU won a school record 7 championships: the Ice Breaker Invitational, the Denver Cup, the Beanpot, the Hockey East regular season title, the Hockey East tournament, the NCAA Northeast Regional, and finally, the National Championship. The team's success was aided by a strong freshman class (especially goaltender Kieran Millan) and the decisions of senior defenseman Matt Gilroy and sophomore forward Colin Wilson to stick with the team instead of taking offers to go pro.\nFollowing victories against the Ohio State Buckeyes, the UNH Wildcats, and the University of Vermont Catamounts, they defeated the Miami (Ohio) RedHawks 4–3 in OT to capture their first National Championship since 1995 (their fifth ever, and Parker's third as coach). BU trailed 3–1 with one minute left in the game, but scored 2 goals in 42 seconds to tie the score and force sudden death overtime. Sophomore defenseman Colby Cohen scored the game-winning goal on a shot that deflected off a Miami player. The championship game brought the senior class to 100 wins in four seasons.\nLongtime head coach Jack Parker, a former Terrier, achieved his 800th win in the January 30th game against Merrimack College. He became only the third college hockey coach to do so, and the first to have all 800 wins be with the same team.\nIn the Beanpot, the Terriers beat Harvard University 4–3 in the first round and then Northeastern University 5–2 in the championship round. In the Hockey East tournament, they defeated Maine in the quarterfinals, Boston College in the semifinals, and UMass Lowell in the championship game. Down by one goal in the third period against BC, the Terriers scored three goals in 44 seconds – a tournament record. BU defeated Lowell 1–0, with goaltender Kieran Millan earning tournament MVP honors with the shutout.\nBU was ranked #1 in the country for most of the season, thanks in part to non-conference victories over powerhouses such as Michigan, North Dakota, Michigan State and Denver. But Northeastern held the top spot in Hockey East play for most of 2008–09, thanks to a better conference record. BU finally overtook Northeastern on the final day of the season, clinching the Hockey East regular season title by one point with a 3–0 victory at home over Providence.\nAt the end of the season, Gilroy was awarded the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top NCAA men's ice hockey player each year. Colin Wilson had also been among the three finalists. Kieran Millan was named the national Rookie of the Year. During the celebratory parade in Boston a few days after the national championship game, it was announced that Parker had been voted NCAA coach of the year.\n2007–2008.\nBU struggled through the first half of the 2007–2008 season. Inconsistency was a major problem, BU lost to Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot, but played well in the second half of the season to finish in 2nd place in Hockey East. BU's season ended with a loss to Vermont in the Hockey East tournament semifinals. With a 19–17–4 record, BU was not ranked high enough to make the NCAA Tournament.\n2006–2007.\nBU went 20–10–9 in 06-07, finishing in third place in Hockey East and advancing to the NCAA tournament. The team won its 28th total and third consecutive Beanpot tournament title, defeating rival Boston College in overtime. At the end of the season, BU continued their surge for the NCAA tournament by earning home ice in the Hockey East quarterfinals and knocking off the University of Vermont two games to one. BU advanced to the Hockey East semifinals at the TD Banknorth Garden but suffered a devastating 6–2 loss to Boston College, the eventual tournament champions and national runners-up. Boston University was then placed in the NCAA tournament as the 2nd seed in the Midwest Regional (Grand Rapids, MI) and 9th seed overall. BU met 10th overall seed Michigan State University in the first round and lost 5–1. Michigan State eventually went on to win the national championship. Highlights from the season include multiple awards by senior goaltender John Curry, including Hockey East Player of the Year, All-America First Team, national leader in shutouts, and Hobey Baker Award finalist. Senior Sean Sullivan and sophomore Matt Gilroy were named to the All-America Second Team. Junior Pete MacArthur finished first on the team in all scoring categories with 36 total points off 16 goals and 20 assists.\n2005–2006.\nThe first full season in Agganis Arena was in many ways a return to glory for the BU hockey program. The Terriers finished 26–10–4, winning the Beanpot, Hockey East regular season title, the Hockey East tournament championship, and a first-round game in the NCAA tournament. BU won hard-fought games against rival Boston College in the Beanpot and Hockey East title game, ultimately winning 18 of their final 21 games heading into the NCAA tournament (with one loss and two ties). The regular season title was BU's first since 2000 and the HE tournament title was its first since 1997.\nBU defeated Nebraska-Omaha 9–2 in the first round of the NCAAs, but suffered a 5–0 loss to BC in the regional final. The 2006 squad was led by seniors such as John Laliberte and captains Brad Zancanaro and David Van der Gulik, and received many contributions from underclassmen such as junior goalie John Curry and sophomore forward Pete MacArthur.\nThe season was also notable for the entrance of six freshmen who would make significant contributions in their inaugural season and ultimately win a national title as seniors. Three of these first-year players – Jason Lawrence, Chris Higgins and Brandon Yip – collaborated to set up perhaps BU's biggest goal of 2006, an overtime strike to win the Hockey East championship over Boston College (Yip tipped in the goal off assists from Lawrence and Higgins).\n2004–2005.\nAfter a disappointing 2003–2004 season in which BU lost the Beanpot and finished with a losing record, the Terriers were able to turn it around with a 23–14–4 record and an appearance in the 2005 NCAA tournament. BU won the Beanpot over Northeastern with an overtime goal by freshman Chris Bourque, son of Boston Bruins defensemen and Hockey Hall of Famer Ray Bourque.\nBU opened the new Harry Agganis Arena midway through the season, with a Jan. 3, 2005 victory over Minnesota, which was ranked number one in the country at the time. Agganis Arena replaced Walter Brown Arena, which had been BU's home ice since 1971.\nBU Terriers in the Olympics.\nBU Terriers on the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team.\nThe' Miracle on Ice' team that defeated the Soviet Union and won the gold medal during the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, featured four Boston University players including Olympic team captain Mike Eruzione. Along with Dave Silk, Jack O'Callahan, and goalie Jim Craig, these Terriers played key roles and were the only players from eastern schools on a U.S. squad composed predominantly of Minnesotans.\nEruzione scored the famous winning goal against the Soviets with 10 minutes remaining, and Craig made 36 saves to preserve the 4–3 victory. Silk, who assisted on the United States' second and third goals, was mentioned in sportscast Al Michaels' final call: \"Eleven seconds, you've got ten seconds, the countdown going on right now! Morrow, up to Silk. Five seconds left in the game. Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\"\nO'Callahan, who had injured his left knee in an exhibition match, returned for the famous \"Miracle on Ice\" game and in his first seconds on the ice, delivered a massive hit on a Soviet player that turned the puck over to the Americans near the Soviet defensive zone. The hit caught the Soviets off guard and set up a goal scored by William \"Buzz\" Schneider to tie the game at 1–1.\nAfter defeating the Soviet Union squad, the U.S. players went on to defeat Finland to secure the gold medal.\nBoston University Olympians.\nThis is a list of Boston University alumni who have played on an Olympic team.\nRivals.\nBoston College.\nBoston University's biggest rival is Boston College. Referred to as the Green Line Rivalry or The Battle of Commonwealth Avenue because of the proximity of the schools and the means of transportation to get from one campus to another, the Terriers and Eagles have played each other well over 200 times since their first meeting in 1918. The rivalry is considered one of the best in NCAA hockey, both in terms of intensity and quality. The schools have combined for ten national championships and even played each other in the NCAA championship game in 1978, with BU skating off to a 5–3 victory.\nAfter the 1978 national championship victory over Boston College, BU co-captain Jack O'Callahan was quoted as saying \"We shouldn't have to beat BC for the nationals. Hell, we can do that anytime.\" But every game between the teams is highly anticipated. \"You could wake up both teams at three o'clock in the morning and tell 'em we're playing on Spy Pond in Arlington, and they'd be there,\" BU coach Jack Parker once said.\nBU and BC have played at least once a year since 1946, and at least twice a year since 1949. They usually play two Hockey East regular season games each year, and typically face each other once more in February during the Beanpot, with BU holding a substantial edge in tournament and head-to-head victories. The teams have twice played each other for the Hockey East Championship, in 1986 and 2006, with BU winning both titles. In 2005–06, BU and BC played six games—three in the Hockey East regular season, and once each in the Beanpot, Hockey East tournament, and NCAA tournament. At every game, regular season and playoffs, the spirited student sections – BU's nicknamed the Dog Pound and BC's the Superfans – are seated in proximity to each other and hurl insults and chants back and forth. BU and BC ratcheted up their rivalry on Jan. 8, 2010, when they played each other at Fenway Park in front of 38,000 fans, the biggest crowd to ever watch the teams play. BU won the game, 3–2.\nSports Illustrated columnist Steve Rushin went so far as to call BU-BC the biggest rivalry in all of sports. Despite substantial bitterness between the fan bases of the two schools, the hockey teams and coaches generally agree that the magnitude of the rivalry has benefited both hockey programs. \"The best thing that ever happened to BU hockey was BC,\" Parker told Rushin.\nThe first varsity ice hockey game BU ever played was a 3–1 loss to Boston College on February 6, 1918. As of the 2010–11 season, BU led the all-time rivalry 125–112, with 17 ties.\nCornell.\nThe rivalry between Boston University and Cornell dates to 1925 when Boston University beat Cornell 7–2. The teams played each other in the NCAA championship game in both 1967 and 1972, with Cornell defeating BU 4–1 in '67 and the Terriers taking the '72 title with a 4–0 win. Between the years 1967 and 1977, Boston University and Cornell won the ECAC crown five times each.\nThe schools renewed the rivalry over Thanksgiving weekend of 2007, with a sold out game dubbed \"Red Hot Hockey\" at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY. After scoring three goals in the first several minutes of play, BU went on to win 6–3. Red Hot Hockey returned to Madison Square Garden on November 28, 2009, with the two teams skating to a 3–3 tie after one overtime period. The event again sold out the arena. The third meet up on November 26, 2011, resulted in a 2–1 win for BU in overtime.\nUniversity of Maine.\nIn the first half of the 1990s, the BU-Maine rivalry was one of the most talked about in college hockey, with the teams battling each other both for eastern and national college hockey supremacy. Boston University defeated Maine in the 1991 Hockey East championship game, in overtime, and Maine returned the favor by soundly beating BU in the HE title game in 1993. In the '93 season, Maine won the national title and lost only one game all year, and it came at the hands of their rivals at BU. Maine had to forfeit most of its wins in the 1994 season because of recruiting violations. BU coach Jack Parker criticized the Maine program, calling the use of ineligible players a \"black mark on the league.\" In 1995, both teams were at the top of their games and faced off in the NCAA championship game in Providence, R.I., which BU won 6–2.\nHarvard and Northeastern.\nBU's rivalries with Harvard and Northeastern stem mainly from regular meetings in the Beanpot, the tournament in which Boston bragging rights are on the line. BU also plays Northeastern three times each year in conference regular season play, and sometimes plays the ECAC-based Harvard in a nonconference game early in the season. BU, BC, Northeastern and Harvard formerly played their home games in the Boston Arena, the site of the first Beanpot in 1952 and the current home of Northeastern. BU stopped playing home games in Boston Arena when it opened the Walter Brown Arena in 1971.\nAwards and honors.\nHobey Baker Award winners.\nThe Hobey Baker Award is an annual award given to the top National Collegiate Athletic Association men's ice hockey player. It is named for hockey player and World War I hero Hobey Baker.\nForward Chris Drury became BU's first Hobey Baker award winner after a senior campaign in which he scored 28 goals and assisted on 29 more. Drury's 113 career goals are the most in BU history. Drury has gone on to a successful NHL career, which included the 1999 rookie of the year award and a 2001 Stanley Cup championship with Colorado. After captaining BU as a senior, Drury has also worn the captain's \"C\" for both the Buffalo Sabres and New York Rangers.\nDefenseman Matt Gilroy won BU's second Hobey Baker award after a senior season in which he scored eight goals and posted 29 assists. Gilroy came to BU as a walk-on and became a three-time All-American. After winning the Hobey and national championship, Gilroy signed a two-year contract with the New York Rangers.\nForward Jack Eichel won the Hobey Baker in 2015, after putting a 71-point year in only 40 games, becoming the third BU player to win the award. He edged the two others nominees that year, Zane McIntyre from North Dakota, and Jimmy Vesey from Harvard University. Vesey went on and won it the year after. Following his stellar first year in BU, Eichel went on to be drafted second overall by the Buffalo Sabres, and would sign his entry level contract after, putting an end to his short NCAA career.\nForward Macklin Celebrini won the Hobey Baker award in 2024, after recording 38 goals and 32 assists in 38 games, becoming the fourth BU player to win the award. At 17, he became the youngest player to win the award and the fourth freshman, following Paul Kariya in 1993, Jack Eichel in 2015 and Adam Fantilli in 2023.\nOther awards.\nUSA Hockey College Player of the Year\nWalter Brown Award (Best American-born Div. 1 player in New England)\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nTim Taylor Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-American teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year\nECAC Hockey Outstanding Defenseman\nECAC Hockey Most Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-ECAC Hockey.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nHockey East Player of the Year\nBob Kullen Coach of the Year\nLen Ceglarski Award\nHockey East Best Defensive Defenseman\nHockey East Best Defensive Forward\nHockey East Scoring Champion\nHockey East Three-Stars Award\nHockey East Goaltending Champion\nHockey East Rookie of the Year\nWilliam Flynn Tournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Hockey East.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nAll-Rookie Team\nTravis Roy.\nOn Oct. 20, 1995, BU raised its fourth national championship banner as it opened a new season, yet just moments later the program suffered its greatest on-ice tragedy. On that night Travis Roy, a freshman recruit who grew up in Maine, was paralyzed from the neck down just eleven seconds into his first college shift. The 20-year-old Roy crashed head-first into the boards after a University of North Dakota player, Mitch Vig, avoided his check. Roy cracked his fourth vertebra and was left a quadriplegic.\nRoy missed a year of college, but ultimately returned to BU, earning a degree in communications in 2000. Roy has remained a presence with the BU hockey program, attending games and on several occasions joining his teammates on the ice to celebrate Beanpot championships. Roy, (now deceased), has become an inspirational figure for sufferers of spinal cord injuries. In 1997 he founded the Travis Roy Foundation to raise money for research and individual grants, and in 1998 he published an autobiography titled \"Eleven Seconds.\" Roy remains close with Coach Jack Parker.\n\"It's very special to be a part of the BU hockey family,\" Roy wrote in a new afterword in the 2005 edition of his autobiography. \"Coach Parker looks after his players long after they have played their last game for him.\"\nIn October 1999, Roy's #24 was retired, and raised to the rafters of Walter Brown Arena. Roy was the only BU hockey player to have been honored with a retired number until former head coach Jack Parker's number was retired in March 2014, though Roy was the only player to have his number retired under Parker's long tenure.\nRoy died on October 29, 2020, at the age of 45.\nAll-time scoring leaders.\nCareer points leaders.\nSingle-season points record:\nCareer goals leaders.\nSingle-season goals record:\nCareer assists leaders.\nSingle-season assists record:\nGoaltending leaders.\nCareer save percentage leaders (min. 40 games):\nSingle-season save percentage record:\nCareer goals against average leaders:\nSingle-season goals against average record:\nNotable coaches.\nWayland Vaughan.\nWayland Vaughan coached Boston University from 1928 until 1943, compiling an 87–82–8 record. Vaughan was far from the most successful coach in terms of winning percentage, but maintained the Terriers program in the face of both the Great Depression and World War II. Without any conference affiliation, Boston University played erratic schedules, with anywhere from 10 to 15 games per season.\nHarry Cleverly.\nHarry Cleverly, the BU coach from 1945 until 1962, guided the Terriers into the era of the NCAA tournament, which began in 1948, and brought BU to its first national championship game in 1950 and an additional three appearances in the tournament, which consisted of just four teams in those years. Under Cleverly's watch, BU helped create the Beanpot tournament and joined the ECAC hockey league.\nJack Kelley.\nJack Kelley was the first coach to bring BU to the summit of college hockey. Kelley coached just ten seasons but appeared in four NCAA tournaments and won back-to-back titles in 1971 and 1972, his final years behind the bench. Kelley also won three ECAC regular season titles, one ECAC tournament title, and six Beanpots. Kelley recruited Jack Parker, who captained the Terriers in 1968 and became an assistant coach under Kelley.\nLeon Abbott.\nLeon Abbott succeeded Kelley, and picked up where Kelley left off with a sterling 22-win season in 1972–73. However, eleven of his wins were forfeited due to an ineligible player. Six games into his second season, Abbott was abruptly fired for withholding information about two Canadian players who had played junior hockey in their home country. The ECAC had ruled them ineligible, only to be cleared to play by a judge. At a conference meeting, Abbott admitted not pressing the players to disclose the compensation they received as juniors. Although the judge hinted that the eligibility rules were unconstitutional, BU's administration was concerned enough about possible sanctions that it fired Abbott and named his assistant, Jack Parker, his successor.\nJack Parker.\nJack Parker is the longest-tenured and winningest coach in Boston University history. Parker's accomplishments are almost unparalleled in college sports. In 40 years, he won 876 games, the highest tally for a hockey coach who has spent his whole career at just one school, while winning 21 Beanpot titles, 11 conference tournament titles and three national championships in 1978, 1995, and 2009. Parker helped found Hockey East in 1984, when several teams broke away from the ECAC to form their own conference, and played a crucial role in building Boston University's state-of-the-art arena. The ice sheet at Agganis Arena bears his name – Jack Parker Rink. Parker was voted NCAA hockey coach of the year in 1975, 1978, and 2009, and his 30 NCAA tournament wins are among the most of all time. At the conclusion of the 2012–2013 regular season, on his birthday, Parker announced his retirement.\nTerriers in the NHL.\nWHA.\nAdditionally, three former Terriers played in the World Hockey Association, a rival league that folded and merged with the NHL in 1979.\nTerriers in the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\"Craig, Eruzione, O'Callahan and Silk were inducted as members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team.\"\nNHL first round draft picks.\nThe Terriers have had twenty two players who were chosen in the first round of the NHL Entry Draft as of the 2022–2023 season:\nAgganis Arena.\nBU plays its home games at Agganis Arena (capacity 6,150) in Boston, Massachusetts. The hockey rink at the arena is named Jack Parker Rink after the team's longtime coach. Agganis Arena first opened its doors on January 3, 2005, for a hockey game versus the University of Minnesota. The student section at BU, also known as “The Dog Pound,” is located in sections 117–119 and 107–109 at Agganis Arena."

        "text": "The (outdoor) men's singles competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics was part of the tennis program for the games. There were 49 competitors from 12 nations. Nations were limited to 8 players each. The event was won by Charles Winslow in an all-South African final over Harold Kitson; they were the nation's first medals in the men's singles. Oscar Kreuzer of Germany won the bronze-medal match against Bohemian Ladislav Žemla.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the men's singles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984. 1912 was the second and last time an indoor version was held concurrently.\nThe 1908 Official Report's recommendation to schedule Olympic tennis not so close to Wimbledon was not acted upon; indeed, the scheduling issue was worse in 1912. Rather than starting three days after the end of Wimbledon, the Olympic outdoor tennis events were now at the same time as Wimbledon. The indoor events, held in May, were thus attended by top-flight players, while the outdoor competitions were not.\nDenmark, Norway, Russia, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. France and Germany both made their fourth appearance, tied for most among all nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-five sets.\nSchedule.\nThe tournament was beset by withdrawals; there were 67 entries, necessitating drawing up a bracket for seven rounds, but only 49 men actually started."

        "text": "The Malaysia men's national field hockey team (nicknamed Speedy Tigers) represents Malaysia in international field hockey competitions. As of August 2023, the team is ranked 9th in the world, and 2nd in Asia, by the International Hockey Federation. The governing body for the sports is the Malaysian Hockey Confederation.\nHistory.\nHockey has a long-standing history in Malaysia, with the first formal match taking place in Kuala Lumpur on November 30, 1898, between Harris' XI and Whitley's XI, just 12 years after the first regulated game was played in England in 1886. Malaysia's first international game occurred in 1932 against the Indian Olympic squad, who had recently clinched Olympic gold. Predictably, the visitors emerged victorious with a 7-0 scoreline. Malaysia formed a national hockey body in 1947, and in 1956, they represented Malaya (as it was then known) at the Melbourne Olympics, finishing ninth. Their most notable Olympic performance to date was at the 1972 Games, where they secured eighth place and recorded victories against Spain and Argentina.\nMalaysia has qualified for the Hockey World Cup on seven occasions, including the most recent edition. Their best finish to date was in 1975 when they hosted the tournament and achieved a remarkable fourth-place finish, which included a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands.\nIn recent years, the Malaysian national hockey team has faced challenges in maintaining their past success. They have struggled to replicate their previous achievements at major international tournaments. However, the team has remained competitive in the Asian region.\nThe crown jewel of Malaysian hockey is the annual Sultan Azlan Shah tournament, held in Kuala Lumpur. Named after the ninth King of Malaysia, Sultan Azlan Shah, a devoted hockey enthusiast, this invitation-only event has been a key highlight since 1983, becoming an annual affair in 2003. In 2022, Malaysia won their first Sultan Azlan Shah Cup after defeating South Korea 3-2.\nKuala Lumpur had the honor of hosting the first Commonwealth Games to include hockey as a sport in 1998. Malaysia's national team showcased their talent by securing a silver medal, narrowly losing 4-0 to Australia in the final. Another significant achievement was Malaysia's hosting of the 2002 World Cup, which featured 16 nations, making it the only single World Cup to adopt this format. This edition also permitted squads of 18 players instead of the usual 16, accommodating the hot and humid conditions.\nMalaysia has also played host to the Junior World Cup three times, with the most recent occurrence in 2009. Although Malaysia has achieved fourth place on four occasions, they continue to strive for further success in this prestigious tournament.\nThe Malaysian national hockey team continues to strive for success and aims to regain its past glory in international field hockey. The team's development and performance are supported by the Malaysian Hockey Confederation (MHC) and its efforts to promote the sport at various levels, including grassroots development and talent identification programs.\nCompetition history.\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within Malaysia and best results\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following 18 players were named on 29 December 2022 for the 2023 World Cup in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela, India from 13 to 29 January 2023.\nHead coach: Arul Selvaraj\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have been called up for the national team in the last 12 months."

        "title": "Closer (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, a closing pitcher, more frequently referred to as a closer (abbreviated CL), is a relief pitcher who specializes in getting the final outs in a close game when his team is leading. The role is often assigned to a team's best reliever. Before the 1990s, pitchers in similar roles were referred to as a fireman, short reliever, and stopper. A small number of closers have won the Cy Young Award. Eight closers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Mariano Rivera, Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter and Hoyt Wilhelm.\nUsage.\nA closer is generally a team's best reliever and designated to pitch the last few outs of games when his team is leading by a margin of three runs or fewer. Rarely does a closer enter with his team losing or in a tie game. A closer's effectiveness has traditionally been measured by the save, an official Major League Baseball (MLB) statistic since 1969. Over time, closers have become one-inning specialists typically brought in at the beginning of the ninth inning in save situations. The pressure of the last three outs of the game is often cited for the importance attributed to the ninth inning.\nClosers are often the highest paid relievers on their teams, making money on par with starting pitchers. In the rare cases where a team does not have one primary pitcher dedicated to this role, mainly due to an injury or poor performance of primary closer candidates, the team is said to have a \"closer by committee\".\nHistory.\nNew York Giants manager John McGraw in 1905 was one of the first to use a relief pitcher to save games. He pitched Claude Elliott in relief eight times in his ten appearances. Though saves were not an official statistic until 1969, Elliot was retroactively credited with six saves that season, a record at that time. In 1977, Chicago Cubs manager Herman Franks used Bruce Sutter almost exclusively in the eighth or ninth innings in save situations. While relievers such as Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage were already being used mostly in save situations, Franks's use of Sutter represented an incremental change. Sutter was the first pitcher to start the ninth inning in 20 percent of his career appearances. Clay Carroll in 1972 was the first pitcher to make a third of his season's appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning, which would not be repeated until Fingers in 1982. John Franco in 1987 was the first to be used over 50 percent of the time in the beginning of the ninth in a season; he had a then-record 24 one-inning saves. Lee Smith in 1994 was the first to be used over 75 percent of the time in that situation. Using the save leader from each team in the league, the average closer made his appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning 10 percent of the time in the 1970s to almost of the time by 2004.\nTony La Russa while with the Oakland Athletics is frequently named as the innovator of the position, making Dennis Eckersley the first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth inning situations. La Russa explained that \"[the Oakland A's would] be ahead a large number of games every week ... That's a lot of work for somebody throwing more than one inning ... Also, there was the added advantage of [Eckersley] not getting overexposed. We tried to get [him] to only face three or four batters an outing.\" Baseball teams often copy one another, following a strategy based on one team's success. In 1990, Bobby Thigpen set a record with 57 saves while breaking Franco's one-inning saves record with 41. Francisco Rodríguez set the current record with 54 one-inning saves in 2008.\nAs late as 1989, a team's ace reliever was called a \"fireman\", coming to the rescue to \"put out the fire\", baseball terminology for stopping an offensive rally with runners on base. They were occasionally referred to as \"short relievers\", \"stoppers\" and \"closers\". By the early 1990s, the top late-inning reliever was called a \"closer\". The firemen came in whenever leads were in jeopardy, usually with men on base, and regardless of the inning and often pitching two or three innings while finishing the game. An example of this is that Goose Gossage had 17 games where he recorded at least 10 outs in his first season as a closer, including three games where he went seven innings. He pitched over 130 innings as a reliever in three different seasons. For their careers, Sutter and Gossage had more saves of at least two innings than saves where they pitched one inning or less. Fingers was the only pitcher who pitched at least three innings in more than 10 percent of his saves. The game evolved to where the best reliever was reserved for games where the team had a lead of three runs or less in the ninth inning. Mariano Rivera, considered one of the greatest closers of all time, earned only one save of seven-plus outs in his career, while Gossage logged 53. \"Don't tell me [Rivera's] the best relief pitcher of all-time until he can do the same job I did. He may be the best modern closer, but you have to compare apples to apples. Do what we did\", said Gossage.\nStrategy.\nESPN.com writer Jim Caple wrote that closers' saves in the ninth \"merely conclude what is usually a foregone conclusion.\" Dave Smith of Retrosheet researched the seasons 1930–2003 and found that the winning percentage for teams who enter the ninth inning with a lead has remained virtually unchanged over the decades. One-run leads after eight innings have been won roughly 85 percent of the time, two-run leads 94 percent of the time, and three-run leads about 96 percent of the time. Baseball Prospectus projects that teams could gain as much as four extra wins a year by focusing on bringing their ace reliever into the game earlier in more critical situations with runners on base instead of holding them out to accumulate easier ninth inning saves. In \"The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball\", Tom Tango et al. wrote that there was more value to having the ace reliever enter in the eighth inning with a one- or a two-run lead instead of the ninth with a three-run lead. \"Managers feel the need to please their closers—and their closers' agents—by getting them cheap saves to pad their stats and their bank accounts\", wrote Caple. Tango et al. projected that using a great reliever over an average one to start the ninth with a three-run lead resulted in a two percent increase in wins, versus four percent for a two-run lead or six percent for a one-run lead. Former Baltimore Orioles manager Johnny Oates once told Jerome Holtzman, the inventor of the save statistic, that he created the ninth-inning pitcher by inventing the save. Holtzman disagreed, saying it was baseball managers who were responsible for not bringing in their top reliever when the game was on the line, in the seventh or eighth inning, which had been the practice in the past. He noted that managers' usage of closers can \"abuse the pitching save ... to favor the closer.\"\nLa Russa says it is important that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, \"Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important.\" Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth.\" Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. \"Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong when you go to the closer\", said Beane. He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation \"is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation.\" Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. \"There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more\", said Gillick.\nCriticism.\nLa Russa noted that losing clubs risk their closer being under-worked, if they stick to the strategy of saving them for ninth inning situations where the team is ahead. An instance of this was Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who did not call upon closer Jonathan Papelbon in high leverage situations during the 2012 season, including six games where the score was tied during the late innings, which may have cost the team seven wins by midseason. Jonah Keri suggested \"fear of using pitchers in anything but the most predictable circumstances, or simple inertia, closers get used far more often in easy-to-manage, up-two, bases-empty, ninth-inning situations than they do in tie games with runners on and the game actually on the line\" and said of Papelbon \"unless the Phillies start using him in situations where he’s actually needed, rather than almost exclusively in spots that nearly any pitcher with a pulse can handle successfully 85–90 percent of the time, Papelbon will remain the $200,000 Aston Martin that never leaves the garage\".\nSome critics have noted that the 9th inning closer strategy is illogical during playoff games, especially when the club is facing elimination. During Games 4 and 6 of the 2010 NLCS, each a late-inning situation with the score tied, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel did not call upon closer Brad Lidge and both times the selected relief pitcher surrendered the game-winning run. Similarly in Games 3 and 6 of the 2010 ALCS, each where the New York Yankees were trailing by two runs during a crucial inning, manager Joe Girardi did not go to Mariano Rivera, and both times the chosen relief pitcher gave up several runs which put the game out of reach for the Yankees; ESPN's Matthew Wallace lamented that \"Girardi used Rivera in the ninth inning of Game 6, with the Yankees trailing 6–1, their ship long sailed to sea\".\nHall of Fame.\nEight pitchers who were primarily relievers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm was the first to be elected in 1985, followed by Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Lee Smith, and Mariano Rivera. Eckersley was the first closer in the one-inning save era to be inducted. He believed that he was inducted because he was both a starter and a reliever. \"If I came up today as a closer and played 20 years, would I have made it [into the Hall of Fame]? These pitchers did the job they were supposed to do for 20 years. What else are they supposed to do?\" said Eckersley. Rivera was elected in 2019 and was the first player in MLB history to be elected unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, appearing on all 425 ballots."

        "text": "Sagesse Sports Club (French: \" Club Sportif de la Sagesse\"), known as Hekmeh in Arabic, is a Lebanese sports club based in Beirut. The basketball team currently plays in the first division, the Lebanese Basketball League.\nThe basketball team was established in 1992, as part of the Club Sagesse which was known mainly for its football (soccer) team.\nHistory.\n\"Al-Hikma\" in classical Arabic, \"El-Hekmeh\" in Lebanese dialect stands for \"wisdom\", thus also the French alternative name of the club, Sagesse (meaning wisdom in French).\nThe historical Hekmeh club was founded in Beirut in 1943 under the patronage of the late father Boulos Kik, supported by late Mgr. Jean Maroun, with affiliation to the Collège de la Sagesse of the Maronite Catholic Church, a leading educational institution in Lebanon and the East since 1875, despite the affiliation with the Sagesse College, the club has its own independent administration. \nThe basketball program was founded in 1992, when the club was headed and financed by media tycoon also widely dubbed as the Godfather of Lebanese basketball, president Antoine Choueiri, he was elected president following the passing of late president Henri El Asmar. \nChoueiri wanted a team that will achieve unprecedented success and popularity in a bid to change Lebanese sports history forever and unite all Lebanese behind a successful team that will represent Lebanon and Lebanese basketball in every possible competition on a national and international level.\nAfter the Choueiri takeover in 1992 Hekmeh/Sagesse included on its roster some of the most impactful players including Lebanese national basketball team legends who formed one of the most successful and historic partnerships in Asia at the time, Elie Mechantaf and Fadi El Khatib, African stars Assane N'diaye and Mohammed Acha, and other notable foreigners that at the time were among the elite of foreign basketball players in the East, being top ex-NBA players, FIBA Continental and World Cup participants, a high level of players that was never seen before in the Lebanese league and the neighbouring countries, and under the management of the most decorated national basketball coach Ghassan Sarkis, a dominant dream team was born taking Lebanese basketball, sports in Lebanon and the region, and Lebanon to new heights, achieving the goals that were set by Choueiri, such as the ones mentioned in the previous passage.\nSagesse became one of the most successful basketball clubs in Lebanon, the MENA region and Asia with 8 Lebanese Basketball League Championships, 7 Lebanese Basketball Cups, 2 Arab Club Basketball Championships, and 3 FIBA Asia Champions Cup titles.\nHekmeh made history by being the first Lebanese club to win the Arab Club Basketball Championship and the first Lebanese and first Arab club to win the FIBA Asia Champions Cup.\nSagesse are the only Arab and only Asian club to ever participate in the basketball club world championship, the McDonald's Championship organized by FIBA and the NBA, it was at the 1999 edition when Sagesse went as the Asian champions. The 1999 McDonald's Championship was the first and only time FIBA Asia was represented in the tournament.\nThis exceptional participation and the way Sagesse represented Asia at the Mcdonald's Championship in Milano was praised by then Commissioner of the NBA David Stern and by former Secretary General of the FIBA Borislav Stanković among other officials.\nIn 2012, Sagesse won a friendly game against Turkish &amp; EuroCup winners Galatasaray S.K. during a training camp that the club was holding in Turkey, where Sagesse played a series of games against turkish first division teams, this was the most significant game and win for a Lebanese team or any team in the region against a European team in recent times.\nHekmeh are often present in international tournaments and camps, playing against a selection of the best clubs and national teams from different countries.\nIn the post Choueiri era, from 2004 onwards, which was the last year the team won the Lebanese Championship, the club struggled to find consistency at the administrative level despite the involvement of many businessmen and political figures, these involvements were seen as well as a possible reason for the club's struggles rather than being helpful gestures; and despite having the finances to build a good team the club was still struggling with debt; compared to the Choueiri era the club has achieved mediocre success with inconsistent overall form through the seasons in spite of reaching many finals in different competitions.\nIn the 2019 election of the club's general assembly \"Choueiry Group\" top official Mr. Elie Yahchouchi was elected club president; he was Antoine Choueiri's vice president during the late tycoon's tenure at the club.\nAlso Deputy Prime Minister of Lebanon H.E. Ghassan Hasbani was elected head of the board of trustees.\nMany reforms, overhauls and major investments have been made since\nin addition to constructive future plans that were announced in the club's huge team presentation ceremony ahead of the 2019/20 season.\nSince October 2023, a new administration has been elected led by the club's honorary president M.P. Jihad Pakradouni with Lawyer and Beirut City council member Ragheb Haddad as club president.\nRivalries.\n\"Beirut Derby\".\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in the Lebanese basketball league, where the classical game between Club Sagesse and Riyadi is known as \"Beirut Derby\".\nFrom the start of the national league the clubs were seen as successful representatives of two different sides in Lebanon and the two most popular teams in the country.\nHonours.\nSource:\nMedals and decorations.\n National Order of the Cedar\n Knight in 1999 \n Officer in 2000 \nAwarded to the club for its unprecedented success in the Lebanese, Arab and Asian basketball championships that highly contributed into the development and rise of the Lebanese basketball and sports in Lebanon on many levels.\nNotable players.\nA sample list of notable foreign players."

        "title": "World Series of Poker Europe",
        "text": "The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas. From its inception to the 2013 tournament, players from 19 countries — USA (10), France (4), UK (3), Denmark (3), Canada (2), Norway (2), Portugal (2), Italy (2), Afghanistan, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Tunisia, Switzerland, Australia, Italy and Finland — have won bracelets.\nHistory.\nIn 2004, Harrah's Casinos purchased the rights to the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area—Playboy, Empire Casino, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a \"style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe.\"\nThe WSOPE was entering a crowded field as many major poker tournaments were already established in Europe. Pollack, however, believed that brand recognition of the WSOP and that the \"WSOP bracelet is the most recognized poker hardware globally will allow the WSOPE to quickly catch up.\"\nHighlights.\n2007 World Series of Poker Europe.\nIn marketing the WSOPE, Harrah's Casino did not rely upon the reputation of Harrah's or the WSOP alone. On July 5, 2007, Harrah's announced its alliance with England-based Betfair, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. The agreement builds on Betfair's European reputation in advertising the WSOPE while creating the largest agreement between a web-based and brick-and-mortar casinos. Due to changes in U.S. laws, effective in 2007, the WSOP could no longer accept money from online gambling companies. This prevented the WSOP from acknowledging WSOP qualifiers from online events. The WSOPE is not bound by this limitation. The United Kingdom Gambling Act of 2005 allows for legal regulated online poker sites. Furthermore, as the laws that govern the age of gambling differ in England than the U.S., the WSOPE admits younger players. In 2007, four of the five finalists at the first event of the WSOPE had won bracelets. Thomas Bihl, however, outlasted each of them to claim the first-ever WSOPE bracelet. No previous bracelet winners played at the second final table; Dario Alioto won the bracelet. Annette \"Annette_15\" Obrestad, became the youngest player to win a WSOP bracelet event at age 18 years, 364 days in the final event of the tournament.\n2008 World Series of Poker Europe.\nIn 2008, the WSOPE added a fourth event and was held at the Empire Casino in Leicester Square, London. The 2008 WSOPE was particularly notable, as Jesper Hougaard became the first person to win a bracelet at both the WSOP and WSOPE, let alone winning both in a single year. The WSOPE Main Event included several big name stars including Ivan Demidov, John Juanda and Daniel Negreanu. Demidov's appearance at the WSOPE final table was of particular interest. While sitting at the WSOPE Main event final table, he was one of the November Nine players scheduled to play in November for the WSOP Main Event. This meant that for a period of time there was a chance that the same person could win both Main Events. As it was, he was the first player to make it to the final table at both the WSOP and WSOPE Main Events. Three-time bracelet winner John Juanda won his fourth bracelet in the WSOPE Main Event. Theo Jørgensen, who made it to the 2007 WSOPE Main Event final table, won his first bracelet in the £5,000 Pot-Limit Omaha event. Sherkhan Farnood, undoubtedly had the most challenging final table as four of his final six opponents (Ivo Donev, Howard Lederer, Phil Ivey, and Jeff Lisandro) had a combined 9 WSOP bracelets between them. The 2008 WSOPE also marked a technological advance with the advent of the mobile hole card camera. At previous tournaments, the viewing audience could only see the hole cards at select tables. In 2008, a special camera was used that enabled roaming camera crews to capture the action at adjacent tables.\n2009 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2009 WSOPE was held from September 17 to October 1 at the Empire Casino in London, England. It consisted of four bracelet events including a £1,000 No-Limit Hold'em, a £2,500 Pot Limit Hold'em/Pot-Limit Omaha, a £5,000 Pot Limit Omaha, and a £10,000 World Championship No-Limit Hold'em Main Event.\n2010 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2010 World Series of Poker Europe was held from September 14 to September 28 at the Empire Casino in London, England. There were five bracelet events, culminating in the £10,350 WSOPE Championship No Limit Hold'em event which was won by James Bord, the first WSOPE bracelet winner from the UK.\n2011 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2011 WSOPE Event was held at the Majestic Barrière Cannes and the Le Croisette Casino Barrière in Cannes. There were seven bracelet events.\n2012 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2012 WSOPE Event returned to Cannes – again with seven bracelet events.\nThe greatest player of all time Phil Hellmuth won the main event to become the first player to win both the main event of Wsop and Wsope\n2013 World Series of Poker Europe.\nFor 2013 the tournament moved to the Casino Barriere in Enghien-les-Bains, France. From October 11 to October 23 there were eight bracelet events.\n2014 World Series of Poker Europe.\nIn November 2013 it was announced that the WSOP Europe and WSOP Asia Pacific will begin rotating annually beginning in 2014, with WSOP APAC being held in even-numbered years and WSOPE in odd-numbered years. Therefore, the WSOP Europe was not held in 2014 or 2016.\n2015 World Series of Poker Europe.\nFor 2015 the tournament moved to Spielbank Berlin in Berlin, Germany. From October 8 to October 24 there are ten bracelet events.\n2017 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2017 WSOPE took place from October 19 – November 10 in at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 11 bracelet events, including the €111,111 High Roller for One Drop, the largest buy-in in WSOPE history. The €10,350 No Limit Hold'em Main Event attracted 529 entries and was won by Spanish qualifier Marti Roca de Torres.\n2018 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2018 WSOPE is scheduled from October 9, 2018 through November 2, 2018 at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 10 bracelet events, including a €5 million guarantee for the €10,350 No Limit Hold'em Main Event.\n2019 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2019 WSOPE took place from October 13, 2019 through November 4, 2019 at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 15 bracelet events, including a €5 million guarantee for the €10,350 No Limit Hold'em Main Event. Live event and on demand coverage streamed exclusively on PokerGO.\n2021 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2021 WSOPE was the 13th edition of the series of poker tournaments. It took place from November 19 to December 8 at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic and featured 15 WSOP bracelet events.\nOn November 25, the Czech government declared a state of emergency as a result of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. The WSOP Europe proceeded as planned, but all events had to conclude by 10 p.m. local time to comply with curfew restrictions.\n2022 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2022 WSOPE took place from October 26, 2022 through November 16, 2022, at King's Resort in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 15 WSOP bracelet events and $12 million in prize pool guarantees. The 2022 WSOP Europe Main Event would be the largest ever, with the 763-entrant field breaking the record set in 2021 of 688 entrants.\n2023 World Series of Poker Europe.\nThe 2023 WSOPE took place from October 25, 2023 through November 15, 2023, at King's Resort in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 15 bracelet events and €15 million in prize pool guarantees.

        "title": "Hong Kong Golf Club",
        "text": "The Hong Kong Golf Club is a private golf club. It is home to the Hong Kong Open, a tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours.\nFounded in 1889 as the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, the club originally played in Happy Valley, a location shared with many other activities. As the club expanded, the need for a more permanent home was addressed with the building of a small 9-hole course at Deep Water Bay, before the club eventually moved to its current location in Fanling, most of which is leased from the Hong Kong government. According to the club annals, the Deep Water Bay location opened in 1898; and the 18-hole Old Course was completed in 1911. To expand the facility, in 1968, the club negotiated the lease of around 30 acres of land at Beas River with which it expanded the Eden Course into a full 18-hole championship course. The 'Royal' was dropped from the name of the club in 1996, in advance of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China.\nThe club paid a one-off premium to lease the land, and is wrongly labelled to pay only a peppercorn rent annually. In 2012, the club paid HK$1.9 million for rent and HK$3.2 million for rates. In Year 2013–2014, the Government Rent Payable is HK$2,538,000.\nHistory.\n1889–1910.\nOn 8 May 1889, a notice was published on the Hong Kong Daily Press:\nThen, the \"Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\" was started in 1889 by \"thirteen golfing enthusiasts\" in a shared location in Happy Valley. According to \"History of the Royal Hongkong Golf Club\", which was written by T.F.R. Waters, of these thirteen, with the exception of Robert Murray Rumsey R.N. (then Hong Kong Harbour Master and the Rumsey Street was named after his name.) and Gershom Stewart (afterwards Knighted and a member of parliament for Hoylake) very few had much notion of the game but readily agreed to do what they could to established a foothold for it in the Colony. Although Captain Rumsey and Stewart had clubs and balls and had in fact been driving these balls within the race track at Happy Valley before 1889, the opinion of the Meeting was that attempts should be made to acquire land then in possession of the military in Kowloon. Rumsey had been elected captain of the new club and had secured the consent of the Governor – Sir William Des Voeux – to accept the presidency. Despite this influence at Court the military authorities could not be persuaded to become cooperative, and after some months the proposition had to be dropped. However, on 30 September 1889 permission was eventually obtained from Hong Kong Government to use ground at Happy Valley. Money was raised and work was started making the greens and tees. The architect of the course at Happy Valley was Captain (afterwards Colonel) H. N. Dumbleton R.E. The work progressed rapidly, and it is recorded that in May 1890 a match of six a side was played between the club and the 91st Regiment of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, which the Club won easily.\nIn 1896, Captain Rumsey and Captain Dumbleton examined the possibilities of Deep Water Bay as a possible solution to the ever-increasing pressure from the ladies for extension of their very restricted privileges at Happy Valley as imposed by Commodore Boyes. Negotiations were opened with Government in June 1897 and with the not inconsiderable assistance of the Governor himself, Sir William Robinson, \"the best friend the Club ever had\", a lease of land for a small nine-hole course at Deep Water Bay was concluded with Hong Kong government in 1898.\nOn 1 September 1897 as a result of a letter addressed to Queen Victoria's Lord Chamberlain the following reply was addressed to Sir William Robinson G.C.M.G. Governor of Hong Kong: \"Sir, With reference to your dispatch of 20th July addressed to the Right Honorable The Lord Chamberlain, The Earl of Lothian, I have the honour to inform you that on your application being laid before The Queen, Her Majesty was graciously pleased, in view of your recommendations, to give Her permission to the Hong Kong Golf Club being called 'The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club'.\" This announcement was received with great acclaim and duly celebrated by a banquet at which Sir William was an honoured guest.\nIn 1903, the club obtained exclusive use of Happy Valley ground except for Wednesdays and Saturdays, when soccer and cricket were played. From the start, use by ladies was heavily restricted. And when the club gained exclusive use of Happy Valley in 1903, ladies were allowed to play on Sundays only.\nIn connection with this sharing of the ground at Happy Valley there is on record this remark made by the Captain at the Annual General Meeting of 1903 in connection with the playing of the final of the Club Championship at Happy Valley \"The thanks of the Players are due to the Cricketers who so kindly stopped their game to let the Golfers through on each round.\"\nThe proximity of the Golf Course to the football ground on occasions lead to misdirected shots landing in the football arena but no one seems to have been hit. There was however one occasion when the late \"Auntie\" Maitland misdirected her drive from the 1st tee and caused serious injury to the eye of a Marine.\n1911–1945.\nAccording to the club annals, \"protracted negotiations\" with the government and local farmers resulted in sufficient land being obtained in Fanling, its current location, to build its first full 18-hole course that was completed in 1911. The first idea was to use the Sun Wei valley but the Army Authorities opposed this. Messrs. T. S. Forrest, K. M. Cumming, L. S. Greenhill and M. A. Murray were appointed by the club to view this grazing land. Their report was enthusiastic and favourable. Negotiations with Government were opened (1908) for a lease of sufficient land for a full-size 18-hole course to be constructed. These negotiations with Government were protracted despite the club receiving a great deal of assistance from the Governor, Sir Henry May, in dealing with the local farmers in the matter of acquiring certain extra pieces of land considered essential by the course architects. It was said that E.R. Hallifax, the then Tai Po District Officer, was the man more than any other responsible for the construction of a course at Fanling golf course. The relationship of the District Officer with the village elders everywhere was avuncular or, indeed, almost paternal. In 1916, Sir Henry May arranged for the club to acquire additional land to form a Relief Course for the use of the Ladies.\nAt the time the Old Course was laid out, there were no trees at all on the course except down by the 3rd green and one or two near the clubhouse site. Much forestry work was undertaken during the period 1915–1919 but there was still very little to show yet except beautiful clumps of lilies and cannas on the hillsides. Grave mounds, or \"pimples\", as they were known, plus innumerable jars of human bones, existed on many of the fairways, but these were for the most part removed in 1920 as the result of a generous grant through Sir Henry May of $50,000, which was paid out as compensation to the families owning them. There was a particularly large number of the \"jars\" at the base of the \"saddle\" or, as it is known today, \"Tommy Tucker\" (derived from the Cantonese \"Mm ta-ka ()\" – don't strike). These jars unfortunately were in direct line from the tee and got broken one by one by duffed tee-shots. The penalty for picking out was one stroke but the picking was usually left to the caddie.\nTrees were conspicuous by their absence, but then so was the grass on the fairways which were more rolled mud than anything else. This made the fairways very dusty especially on a windy day. The Greens were turfed with local grass, much of it 'cabbage', which made putting difficult whilst a great deal of trouble was constantly experienced from worms which fed upon the young fresh roots and didn't give the Green keepers a chance. The course was almost devoid all that there was a great deal of room for improving the original layout. The Committee appointed Mr. L.S. Greenhill to work out with Mr. Kerr (who had been general manager of the club since 1914 and resided in the Orme Bungalow) on a new lay out and new bunkering.\nIn 1919, a caddies union was discovered called \"Po Tai Ngoi Yue\" – Golf Caddies Club – which turned out to be a semi-triad society. The first caddie strike took place in April 1922 and was eventually settled.\nOn 2 November 1931, the New Course which had been designed by L.S. Greenhill some years before, was officially opened by Sir William Peel.\nIt was said that Sir William Peel, the Governor of Hong Kong in early 1930s, was a keen golfer. Little was allowed to interfere with his weekly round of golf or his regular rides with the Fanling Hunt. He rode hard, plunging across the terraced rice fields, bogging down at times in the waterlogged mud.\nIn 1933, George Bernard Shaw visited the club.\nIn 1936, Mr. Stanley H. Dodwell presented a \"Captain's Chair\" for the bar room to commemorate the disappearance of the last of the Pimples on the Old Course. Whenever the Captain is at Fanling and any other member or subscriber sits in the chair by mistake, the penalty will be one round of drinks at that particular table in memory of the departed pimples. It was fortunate that although this chair was looted during WWII, it was spotted being used as a Sedan Chair slung between two poles and recovered for the club.\n1945–1989.\nDuring the 1950s, all the greens remodelled and planted with Gezira or Uganda grass. This grass has all come from a shoebox full of seeded soil taken from Uganda to Cairo during the war and one more sod of this grass was flown from Cairo to Hong Kong in 1951.\nSir Sidney Gordon, C.B.E., J.P., former President of the club, recalled his stopover at Cairo airport in 1951. \"During the usual one-hour stopover and, as relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt were rather strained, the customs officer was somewhat suspicious of this damp, sackcloth-wrapped, parcel and insisted on it being opened. The contents made him even more suspicious but the intervention of the air crew enabled us to get it on board just before take-off.\"\nBy the end of 1956, the indebtedness of the club had been reduced to $40,000 – a reduction of $387,000 in eight years.\nThe first Hong Kong Open took place at the club in 1959.Negotiations with the Jockey Club started in 1967 and, in due course, the Stewards of the Jockey Club agreed to recommend to their members that approximately 30 acres of land at Beas River, between the Jockey Club's West Paddock and Hang Tau Village Road, should be leased to the Golf Club. In return, the Golf Club would provide a 'ride' of about four or five miles, which would be laid out around the perimeter of the Golf Club property and would be available at all times for members of the Jockey Club. During the autumn of 1968, John Harris's proposals for the extension of the Eden Course were considered. The members approved expenditure of HK1.3 million on improvements to the Eden Course. On 10 October 1971, the 6,142-yard par-71 Eden Course was officially opened by Sir David Trench.\nSir David Trench, Governor of Hong Kong from 1964 to 1971, was keen on golf. He had insisted on his regular game of golf even during the political turmoils in late 1960s. In October 1968, Sir David Trench was pairing with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to play a round of golf against Mr Gordon Macwhinnie, the club's Captain and Mr W.C. Choy at Fanling.\n1990–now.\nIn 1996, in advance of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China, the club dropped 'Royal' from its name.\nIn 2015, the club celebrated its 125th anniversary by offering Hong Kong residents a special HK$125 green fee rate on selected days.\nThe first Hong Kong Ladies Open took place at the club in June 2015.\nTiffany Chan, a member of Hong Kong Golf Club, was qualified to play 2016 Summer Olympics. She finished for a four over total of 288 (71-75-73-69) and ranked 37 among the 60 players.\nPublic Housing.\nIn 2018, after 5 months of public consultation, the Task Force on Land Supply recommended that land from the Fanling site be used for public housing. A land parcel of 32 hectares to the east of Fan Kam Road of the golf course, which is on the short-term tenancy, will be resumed by the government for housing development. In August 2022, shortly after the election of a new Hong Kong Chief Executive, the \"South China Morning Post\" reported that Legislative Council of Hong Kong member Regina Ip, also a member of the golf club, had called for the plans be abandoned; it was also reported that the club itself had been lobbying various groups in an attempt to overturn the plans on environmental grounds. In total, 7 of 16 members of the Executive Council have declared themselves members of the golf club, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. Executive Council member Ronny Tong also criticized the plan to build public housing on the course. In September 2022, the president of the Hong Kong Golf Club argued that it would not be cost effective to build public housing on the site. The Golf Club hosted an event with hundreds of dogs in an effort to rally public support against redevelopment of the land. \"Ta Kung Pao\", a newspaper aligned with Beijing, said that \"If the golf course development plan is thwarted, the public impression of 'business colluding with government officials' will only get worse.\"\nJohn Lee has said that he respected the plan to build public housing.\nIn May 2023, after Hong Kong's environmental authority gave conditional approval for building public housing on part of the golf course, the Golf Club said \"The approval... represents a great set-back to the city's efforts to enhance its liveability and combat climate change.\" In response, a member from Liber Research Community refuted the Golf Club's statement and said \"If the ecological value or the environmental value of the land was so great, it does not make sense for it to be used as a golf course, as they use a lot of water and have been called 'toxic green', meaning a lot of agrochemicals are used for their upkeep.\"\nIn July 2023, after development chief Bernadette Linn confirmed the government planned to move forward with the plan to build public housing, the Golf Club applied for UNESCO recognition in order to block the government's plan. In addition, the Golf Club also filed a judicial review to the Court of First Instance.\nIn August 2023, the government offered to halt construction until legal proceedings were over; the Golf Club rejected the offer, with the Golf Club's lawyer saying the offer did not ensure that the public housing plan would be stopped.\nPresident.\nThe club has been led by a president since its founding in 1889. Due to war, financial ruin, and poor management, the list of presidents is not complete; the following list is a partial list. \nMembership.\nIn 1897, the club's membership reached 250.\nBy 1923, the club's membership reached 800.\nIn July 1964, it was decided to close the membership. All applicants, regardless of nationality, were put on the waiting list. The policy was to put the emphasis on giving membership to established golfers as opposed to beginners.\nThe club currently has 2,510 members, including 365 corporate nominee memberships.\nSt. George's v St. Andrew's.\nPrior to 1921, there had been several matches of Scotland versus the Rest with usually very unsatisfactory results for the members of Scottish origin. In 1921, the first St. George's versus St. Andrew's Match was played in the month of January with, until 1926, a return match in December. After 1926, the December game was dropped probably due to the many other competition taking place in that month. Those playing for the Societies must be members of the club as well as members of one of the Societies. Entries are not limited except in so far as it is possible to pair off. The losing team in the morning Singles matches pays for lunch. The record of these matches are as follows:\nDebentures and nominee membership.\nAfter WWII, the Fanling property had badly suffered from general neglect which was understandable in the circumstances. The trees had been cut down for fuel and parts of the course including most of the greens had been used for vegetable cultivation. The New Course had been used for training and a large number of fox holes had been built. The clubhouse was requisitioned by the British Army after the war. The rehabilitation was as expensive as had been forecast. The Club not only spent all its account balances but had to arrange for an overdraft which at one time was over $400,000. (The price of daily newspaper in Hong Kong was 20 cents in 1947–48.) To reduce this liability a debenture issue was authorised on the basis of HK$500 per member. A few of the long established firms such as the Hong Kong Bank and Jardines also took up a number of the debentures to aid the club.\nIn 1963, an EGM was called and a Fanling Development Scheme was approved. Two resolutions were passed authorising the committee to proceed with a scheme for the extension of the Fanling clubhouse and the issue of debentures to the amount of HK$900,000 to cover the costs. A building levy of HK$5 per month for all members was also introduced. Actual and estimated capital expenditure on the improvement to the clubhouse totalled HK$1,214,000.\nIn early 1970s, to raise capital for the new complex, including the swimming pool and the mixed accommodation, a scheme of Nominee Memberships was introduced. On payment of HK$5,000 – soon raised to HK$10,000 – a firm became entitled, after approval by the club, to nominate an employee to membership. The Nominee Memberships were transferable, again subject to the club's approval, on payment of a commission to the club.\nAt the AGM in 1980, it was decided to issue 30 Nominee Memberships to meet the expense of a redevelopment scheme to include a swimming pool and squash courts in Deep Water Bay. The new building at Deep Water Bay was completed in early 1983 at a cost of about HK$25 million.\nThe financial problems were eventually overcome. Following many years of loss, a profit was reported in 1984 for the third year running. Since then, the club has remained in the black.\nIn 1986, 10 Nominee Memberships were issued in the price of HK$1.1 million to raise fund for the building of the automatic irrigation system, which piping secondary treated effluent from the sewage treatment plant belonging to one of those estates of the new town, Shek Wu Hui. This was the last time that the club issued Nominee Membership.\nVisitors and green fees.\nThe club welcomes non-member Hongkongers on weekdays at HK$1,200 per round and HK$500 if they play after 3 pm. The number of rounds is unlimited The club offers practice sessions on the night range in 30-minute intervals from 6 pm until 11 pm seven days a week (including public holidays). These either start on the hour or half-hour allowing players unlimited use of range balls during these time periods. The night range fee for 60 minutes is HK$70 on weekdays and HK$100 on weekends and public holidays.\nAn agreement was formed where rural villagers could also play on some parts of the golf course for free, with one villager saying he had been allowed to do so for decades. Approximately 800 villagers were registered under the program.\nFacilities.\nBesides golf, the club offers swimming and tennis facilities, as well as restaurants and accommodation.\nHappy Valley Club House.\nIn 1896, the Club House was officially opened by Commodore Boyes. This Club House had been designed by Major Edward Albert Ram, entirely on a voluntary basis, as a keen golfer. It was built of stone with the main entrance facing the racecourse; lockers lined the walls and at one end there was a stone tablet recording the Club Champions since 1894. There was a Dressing room, bar and a caretaker's room. Mrs. Rumsey unfurled the club flag and as a special gesture a Ladies' competition was played after the opening despite the heavy rain which was falling. The women who played in this historic event were Mesdames O'Gorman, Dalrymple, Eccles, Boyes and Miss Boyes and Miss Gordon. The winner was Mrs. O'Gorman. A few months later, portraits of Sir William Des Voeux and Sir William Robinson were presented to the club and hung in the main entrance.\nIn 1918, the disastrous fire broke out in matsheds near the Club House at Happy Valley. The flames spread so rapidly that it proved impossible to save any of the club's records or stocks. Nothing but ashes.\nFrom that date the club had been lent club room space once again by the Jockey Club but notice that this particular building was to be pulled down was given to the Golf Club at the end of 1928 and these rooms were consequently handed back to the owners in February 1929. The club decided to build a new club House at Happy Valley at a cost of HK$30,000 and this was duly completed in November 1930 and officially opened early in 1931.\nAfter the World War II, the Club House had been thoroughly looted by the mobs during the hand-over interval as had every unoccupied residence in the Hong Kong and the club decided to surrender this property to Government for many reasons not the least of which was financial.\nDeep Water Bay Club House.\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 1898, it was decided to erect a single story Club House at Deep Water Bay and this was built in 1899. Major Edward Albert Ram, who designed the Happy Valley one, once more came to the club's aid as he had by that time become a partner of Messrs Dennison, Ram and Gibbs' architects.\nDuring the war and after the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day 1941, Deep Water Bay was used by the Japanese for various purposes for the most part as a transport depot but they also built piggeries and these provided the excellent flagstones which now surround the south and east sides of the Club House. The rehabilitation of Deep Water Bay was not undertaken until 1947–48 when Frank Groves and Hector Mundy did an excellent job.\nFanling Club House.\nBy 1911, the old course had been laid out and once more Edward Albert Ram of Messrs. Dennison, Ram &amp; Gibbs designed the clubhouse, which was not however completed until 1914 and was originally known as the Dormie House.\nHalf Way House.\nThe Half Way House at Fanling is a Grade III historic building. It is located on Fanling Golf Course. Inscriptions on a board over the entrance indicate that the building was erected in 1916 by Sir Henry May and T.S. Forrest Esq. Frank Hunter, Club Captain in 1950, donated money to form the garden at the Half-way House on the occasion of his retirement from Hong Kong. The pavilion is built in traditional Chinese Qing Vernacular style consisting of a partly open-sided structure formed of columns spaced at regular internals supporting a pitched and hipped Chinese tiled roof. One end of the pavilion has been enclosed to form a kitchen. The roof is decorated with curving end ridges to the hips, and a colourful ridge-board supporting two green dragons competing for the Pearl for Wisdom. Ornamental finials in the shape of fish, dripper tiles and a colourful eaves board complete the decorations to the roof which is supported on traditional Chinese roof trusses. The plinth is formed of unusual knapped stones. There are three flights of steps. The pavilion is a rare piece of Qing architecture. It was restored in 1998 and some alternations have been made.\nIrrigation System.\nIn 1980s, the club introduced the recycling of domestic waste water collected from Fanling town centre to use as irrigation – making the courses more playable in winter.\nEnvironmental Stewardship and Heritage Trees.\nAccording to the club's tree survey, there are nearly 100 different species of tree on the property including three species that are deemed by the Hong Kong Government as being Old and Valuable ones. Some of the tree species at Fanling include banyan, many of which are over 80 years old, eucalyptus (there are some particularly special examples of these by the right side of the 16th tee of the Old Course) as well as indigenous camphor trees, acacias, ironwoods, Norfolk pines and paper barks. In 2015, the club launched educational guided tours for local schools and organizations on specially designed tree trails over the three courses in Fanling. Besides, the club also announced to join the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Programme for Golf.\nWildlife and Ecology.\nThe Fanling golf course is around 44% forested, the rest consisting of road and fairway. The vegetation cover includes 75 hectares of mature lowland secondary forest, an extremely rare habitat in Hong Kong. The forest's age as well as its position on low-lying terrain has led to a high level of biodiversity. A survey from the Asia Ecological Consultants in 2018 logged over 150 bird species, over 30 reptiles and amphibians and 16 species of mammals. Collared scops owl, Pallas's squirrel, bamboo pit viper and common rose butterflies are commonly seen depending on the season and time of day. The golf course is home to several internationally endangered species such as Chinese pond turtle, Chinese swamp cypress，and freshwater crab species Somanniathelphusa zanklon which is endemic to Hong Kong and is threatened by the development of the course.\nCharity events.\nMany charities hosted fundraising golf days at the club's courses, including the Community Chest, Po Leung Kuk and the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals. For example, in 2014 alone, golf events held at the club raised over HK$11.5 million for charity. Additionally, since 1987 the club has hosted its own charity golf event – the annual Cup of Kindness. Money was raised for the Sheung Shui-based Home of Loving Faithfulness, a residential care home for mentally and physically disabled young people; the Buddhist Po Ching Home for the Aged Women in Fanling and the Heep Hong Society, a multi-faceted children's training and therapy charity with centres across Hong Kong.\nIn addition, Chinese University of Hong Kong Golf Day has been held at Fanling since 2013.Hong Kong Baptist University held its golf day in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012 &amp; 2014.\nThe Community Chest Charity Golf Day.\nCommunity Chest has held its golf day at Fanling since 1999. From 1999 to 2009, DHL Express was the title sponsor.\nSince 2010, Bank of China (Hong Kong) has become the title sponsor of the golf day. The participants concerted efforts helped render tangible support to the Chest's member agencies in providing a wide range of supportive and integrated services for the Mentally ill and Ex-mentally ill. From 2010 to 2015, the event raised from HK$1.6 million to HK$1.8 million. In 2016, the Bank of East Asia acted as title sponsor of the tournament and raised HK$2.3 million."

        "title": "Women's rugby union",
        "text": "Women's rugby union is a full contact team sport based on running with the ball in hand. The same laws are used in men's rugby union with the same sized pitch and same equipment. Women's rugby has become popular recently. These days, women's rugby is gaining a higher profile thanks to international tournaments' exposure and financial investment.\nHistory.\nThe early years: 1880–1950s.\nThe origins of women's rugby are unclear. Initially, public reaction to women playing contact sports proved negative. In 1881, when two teams played exhibition \"football\" games in Scotland and northern England, several games had to be abandoned due to rioting.\nWhile most of these games appear to have been played to the new association football rules, it is clear from reports in the \"Liverpool Mercury\" of 27 June 1881 that at least one of these games, played at the Cattle Market Inn Athletic Grounds, Stanley, Liverpool on the 25th, involved scoring goals following \"touchdowns\" and may therefore have been played to at least a version of rugby rules.\nA series of sporting cigarette cards published 1895 in Liverpool includes an image of a woman playing what looks like rugby in kit similar to that described in reports of the 1881 team. It is therefore possible that exhibition games similar to those in 1881 may have continued (with no press reporting) or the pictures may have been reprints for earlier illustrations inspired by the 1881 games, or they may just be an \"amusing\" cartoon or an illustration of a sport that was not actually being played.\nOther than this the official record is silent for most of the nineteenth century. Some girls played the game unofficially as part of their school teams—and the earliest confirmed record of any woman or girl definitely playing rugby at any level anywhere in the world comes from a school game.\nThis happened at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. Emily Valentine's brothers were responsible for the formation of the school's first rugby team in c1884. Emily practised with the team and in c1887 she played for the school, scoring a try.\nThe first documented evidence of an attempt to form a purely women's team is from 1891 when a tour of New Zealand by a team of female rugby players was cancelled due to a public outcry.\nThere are also early reports of women's rugby union being played in France (1903) and England (1913) but in both cases the game was largely behind closed doors.\nDuring the First World War some women's charity games were organised, the most well documented taking place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. The Cardiff team (who all worked for Hancocks a local brewery) all wore protective headgear, which predates their male counterparts by some decades.\nIn Sydney in 1921, two women's teams played a game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000—a photograph appeared in \"The Times\" in 1922—but pressure from authorities ensured that they did not play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called \"barette\" was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both barette and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s.\nIn 1930 a women's league playing the full game was formed in Australia, in the New South Wales areas of Tamworth and Armidale, which ran until halted by World War Two. Photographs of women's teams also exist from New Zealand from the same period and during the war Maori women took up the game. After the war in 1956 The \"Belles of St Mary’s\"—an Australian women's rugby league team—played games in New South Wales—but even as late as the 1960s Women's rugby was banned in Samoa.\n1960s–1990.\nThe 1960s was the decade in which the game finally began to put down roots, initially in the universities of Western Europe. In 1962 the first recorded UK women's rugby union team appears at Edinburgh University, in 1963 female students participate in matches against male students in London, and in 1965 university sides are being formed in France.\nAs the pioneering students left university an adult game began to evolve. Initially (1966) this tended to be confined to charity matches between male and female teams (especially at Worthing RFC, England), though the UK's \"Daily Herald\" newspaper includes photographs of girls' teams training in Thornhill, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire in 1965, and at Tadley in Hampshire in 1966—and appealing for fixtures. It is not recorded whether these teams did arrange any games, and so it is not until 1 May 1968 that the first fully documented and recorded women's club match takes place, in France, at Toulouse Fémina Sports in front of \"thousands of spectators\". The success of the event lead to the formation of the first national association for women's rugby union—the \"Association Francaise de Rugby Feminin\" (AFRF) at Toulouse, in 1970.\n1970 also saw the first reports of women's rugby union in Canada, and by 1972 four universities in the United States were playing the game: University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. By 1975 university students at Wageningen in the Netherlands were playing, and in the same year clubs appeared in Spain (Arquitectura in Madrid and Osas in Barcelona). The first non-university clubs formed in 1978 in Canada and Netherlands, and in Italy (Milan) a year later.\nBy 1980 there were club championships in the United States and Sweden, and provincial championships in New Zealand. The game first appeared in Japan in 1981 and in February 1982 University College, London's women's team went on a tour to France playing, amongst other teams, Pontoise—the first recorded overseas tour by a UK team (and possibly the first international tour by any team). A few months later on 13 June 1982 the first women's international—Netherlands 0, France 4—took place at Utrecht (see Women's international rugby union for more details on the history of the international game).\nIn the UK 1983 saw the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU) formed to govern the game across the British Isles. Founder member clubs are: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, University College London, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University.\nThe game began to be organised on a more formal basis elsewhere, including:\n1990 also saw the first international tournament—\"RugbyFest\" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four \"national\" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined \"World XV\".\nA world game in the making: 1990–1998.\n\"Rugbyfest 1990\" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's Rugby World cup, which took place in Wales the following year. \nTimed to coincide with the second men's World Cup being held in England, it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part, and there were also teams from Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands.\nThe competition was run on a shoestring: Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches, the first world champions were crowned: the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow.\nIn 1994 a second World Cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support, there was a fear that many unions would not send teams, which would threaten the not only the tournament, but the insolvent Dutch union's viability. In fact, the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions, players and officials who did take part: with this threat, New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this, and the risk of major financial losses, the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go.\nIt was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second World Cup was in the end, a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 competing teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by an invited Scottish Students XV. \nThe final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite the events beforehand, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow.\nIn 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world:\nAcceptance and growth: 1998–present.\nWidespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations commenced in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU, but there were still set-backs: in 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport for 2004, and amid criticism by the Australian players, this was reversed two years later.\nDespite this, women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002, Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield, and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.\nIn 2006, the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby— \"Women's Rugby — A Work in Progress\", and the same year the Women's Rugby World Cup was broadcast live on the internet.\nThe growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby, and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport, but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions.\nRugby World Cup.\nThe highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2022, to be hosted by New Zealand.\nThe most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, who have won it five times, and England, who have reached the final seven times.\nWomen's rugby sevens.\nThe primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.\nWomen's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand did not send a team).\nThe inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.\nWomen's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal.\nWomen's rugby sevens has also been added to several regional multi-sport tournaments, including the Pan American Games in 2015 and the Commonwealth Games in 2018."

        "text": "Thomas Peebles (March 18, 1857 – March 10, 1938) was the father of American cheerleading and the first college football coach at the University of Minnesota, in 1883. Peebles coached the team in three games in that early season. They lost two and won one.\nPeebles was born in Ireland and emigrated to the United States when he was 13. He graduated from Princeton University in 1882 and moved to Minneapolis the following year. There he taught philosophy at the University of Minnesota for five years. He was later president of a construction firm.\nCareer.\nPeebles was a professor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota, and coaching was something he did without pay. After several students found out he knew football from his time at Princeton, they coaxed him to give them pointers. After the initial practice in preparation for a game against Carleton College, Peebles \"devoted many of his evenings to instructing the students in the rudiments of the game.\"\nFor practices, Peebles would often split the team in two for scrimmages. He coached one side while an appointed player coached the other. When Peebles' side scored (which was more often), he would cheer \"Sis-Boom-Ah, Princeton!\" Two players desired a cheer to respond to the East coaster and developed \"Rah Rah Rah, Ski \"OO\" Mah!\" The school paper printed the cheer in 1885, and it cemented the tradition for the Gophers team.\nPeebles continued to assist in the expansion of the game within the university until 1888. He would later help other local teams learn the game, and then compete against the Frederick S. Jones-coached Gophers. Since Jones was from Yale, the games were \"lively,\" as they were \"a case of rivalry between Princeton and Yale.\"\nWhile there, he transitioned to law as a career, passed the bar and began practicing in Minnesota. He used his knowledge and skills to manage companies in other states, including a phone company (The Mississippi Valley Telephone Company), and two agriculture firms: the Goose Lake Valley Irrigation Company in southern Oregon, and the New Mexico-based Arlington Land Company.\nIn his later years, he founded a building company. The Thomas Peebles and Sons building company put up many homes in Minneapolis as the city expanded. Many of the houses still stand today. Later in life, Peebles lived in a house north of Cedar Lake in Minneapolis. Now the street behind his old house is named \"Thomas Avenue\" and the area is the \"Peebles Addition to Minneapolis.\"\nDeath.\nPeebles died on March 10, 1938, at his home in Minneapolis."

He played for the Cincinnati Reds in 57 games during the 1914 and 1915 seasons.\nBiography.\nLear was born in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, on January 23, 1891. He attended high school at Mercersburg Academy, and he attended college at Princeton University, pitching for the Tigers from 1910 to 1913. During the 1912 collegiate baseball season, Lear pitched every inning of the four Big Three (referring to Princeton, Harvard, and Yale) games, defeating Yale University in both games and defeating Harvard University in one.\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Lear fielded offers from the New York Giants and other teams before signing with the Cincinnati Reds on January 3, 1914. He was noted in his time as one of the early pitchers of the knuckleball. Lear made his major league debut on May 2, 1914, for the Reds, and remained on the roster for the season as a relief pitcher. He finished the 1914 season having pitched in 17 games for the Reds, starting four and finishing nine. He won one game, lost two, threw three complete games, one shutout, and had an earned run average (ERA) of 3.07.\nLear's most productive season came in 1915 when he pitched 40 games. He was again the primary relief pitcher for the Reds squad, though he did start 15 games. He pitched innings for the Reds in 1915, winning six games, losing 10, finishing 20 games, pitching nine complete games, and finished the season with an ERA of 3.01. His final major league appearance came on September 29, 1915. Lear was slated to be a part of the Reds' roster in 1916. However, he injured his throwing arm during training camp, which brought his professional baseball career to an early end.\nRogers Hornsby had his first plate appearance against Lear on September 10, 1915. Lear pitched a complete game victory that day, whereas Hornsby said of his nerves against Lear, \"Naw, why should I be nervous? The other birds was hittin' him.\"\nLear died on October 31, 1976, after being hit by a car while walking in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, and is buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Greencastle, the city of his birth."

        "text": "This is a list of Kent County Cricket Club Twenty20 cricket records; that is, record team and individual performances in Twenty20 cricket for Kent County Cricket Club.\nKent played their first Twenty20 match in the domestic 2003 Twenty20 Cup against Hampshire at Beckenham. The club has played in each of the domestic Twenty20 competitions since, winning the competition in 2007 and 2021 and finishing as runners-up in 2008. The club plays Twenty20 cricket under the name \"Kent Spitfires\", an allusion to the role of the Supermarine Spitfire in the Battle of Britain during 1940, much of which took place in the skies over the county. As of July 2021 the club has played over 220 Twenty20 matches, including two matches against touring international teams.\nTeam records.\n\"All records last updated 10 December 2023\"\nPartnerships.\nThe highest partnership for Kent is 207 runs scored for the 1st wicket by Daniel Bell-Drummond and Joe Denly against Essex at Chelmsford in 2017. This set a new highest first-wicket stand in all Twenty20 cricket globally and became the third highest partnership for any wicket in the form of the game and the highest in the English domestic T20 competition. It surpassed the 163 runs the same players had scored earlier in the season against Surrey at The Oval which had, in turn, bettered Kent's previous highest partnership of 151 made the previous season by Bell-Drummond and Sam Northeast and the county's highest opening partnership of 150 scored between Bell-Drummond and Denly, also in 2016.\nIndividual batting records.\nSix batsmen have scored centuries for Kent in Twenty20 cricket, with two having done so on more than one occasion. Joe Denly has scored five centuries for the side in T20 cricket and Daniel Bell-Drummond two. Ten players have scored more than 1,000 runs for the county in the format with Denly recording the two highest individual scores in 2017 with 116 not out made against Surrey at The Oval in July followed by a score of 127 made against Essex at Chelmsford in August.\nAndrew Symonds scored Kent's first T20 century in 2004, scoring 112 runs against Middlesex at Maidstone. Symonds scored his century in 34 balls, at the time a record for the fastest century in T20 cricket. As of June 2021 it is the fourth quickest century scored in top-level T20 matches worldwide and the fastest scored in the UK. The other Kent centurions in T20 matches are Azhar Mahmood, Sam Northeast, and, most recently, Zak Crawley.\nIndividual bowling records.\nFive bowlers have taken five wickets in a Twenty20 innings for Kent, Wahab Riaz in 2011, Mitchell Claydon in 2013, Adam Milne in 2017, Imran Qayyum in 2019 and, most recently, Matt Milnes in 2021. Adam Milne's five wickets for the cost of 11 runs in against Somerset in 2017 is the best bowling analysis for a Kent player.\nWahab Riaz, Ryan McLaren, Matt Coles, Joe Denly, Adam Milne and Grant Stewart have all taken hat-tricks for Kent in the format, McLaren doing so in the 2007 Twenty20 Cup final against Gloucestershire, Kent's first Twenty20 final success. Wahab Riaz's hat-trick was taken in 2011 against Gloucestershire as part of his five-wicket haul, Coles took his in 2017 against Middlesex and Denly, primarily a batsman, took his in 2018 against Surrey in a match in which he also scored a century. Milne's hat-trick was taken from the final three balls of a match against Surrey in 2021 and Stewart's was taken across two overs against Middlesex during the 2023 season.\nOnly James Tredwell and Darren Stevens have taken more than 100 T20 wickets in total for the county as of June 2023."

In 1896 he was asked by another Yale graduate from Harrisburg, Vance McCormick, to coach the football team McCormick had organized at the nearby Carlisle Indian School. The team went 5-5 against a challenging schedule that included the leading Ivy League powers.\nFor the game against his alma mater, Hickok also served as a referee (a common practice at the time) along with an official provided by the Yale side. In a memorable moment, the Indians appeared to have scored a late touchdown to potentially tie the game when one of their players broke free with a handoff after the team's halfback had dived into the line. However, Hickok blew his whistle to call it back on the grounds that the play was dead prior to the handoff, causing his own team to protest. One newspaper covering the contest would compare his action to that of a corrupt Indian agent.\nHickok Manufacturing Company.\nOther than serving as an assistant coach at Yale, Hickok spent most of his remaining life in Harrisburg. He married Avis Cochran and eventually served as president of the Hickok Manufacturing Company. After his death in 1933, the position passed to his brother Ross."

She fought off a head-to-head sprint challenge from Japan's Mai Nakamura on the final stretch to hit the wall first in a new Olympic standard of 1:00.21, the second-fastest of all time, cutting off Krisztina Egerszegi's 1992 record by nearly half a second (0.50). Meanwhile, Nakamura seized off an early lead under a world-record pace (29.17), but ended up only with a silver medal in a Japanese record of 1:00.55. Competing previously for the Unified Team and Russia in two Olympics (1992 and 1996), Nina Zhivanevskaya made a surprise packet with a bronze for Spain in a sterling time of 1:00.89.\nFrance's Roxana Maracineanu finished off the podium in fourth place at 1:01.10, and was followed in fifth by Nakamura's teammate Noriko Inada in 1:01.14.

From this small beginning the cricket fraternity has grown to such an extent that there are now 128 teams representing 82 clubs participating in the BCA's competitions.\nThe Barbados Cricket Association organizes cricket from the level of Under-13 Juniors to Test matches which it coordinates on behalf of the West Indies Cricket Board. The traditional domestic season now begins in May and concludes in December, the regional first-class season runs from January to March, and the international season begins in March and now extends through June.\nFrom its earliest days Barbados has been renowned for the quality and calibre of its cricketers producing cricketers such as Challenor, Martindale, Weekes, Sobers, Hall.

        "title": "List of National Rugby League golden point games",
        "text": "The golden point, a sudden death overtime system, is used to resolve drawn rugby league matches in the National Rugby League, Australasia's top competition in the sport. The term is borrowed from the golden goal system formerly employed in association football (soccer). The golden point is used to determine a winner when scores are level at the end of regular time. Prior to its introduction into the National Rugby League competition at the beginning of the 2003 season, normal season games were left as draws; in finals matches, 20 minutes extra time ensued (10 minutes each way), with a replay in the event of a draw. If the scores are level at the end of 80 minutes, five minutes are played, the teams swap ends with no break, and a further five minutes are played. Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in this 10-minute period secures a win for the scoring team, and the game ends at that point. If the scoring event is a try, no conversion is attempted. If no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn and each team receives one competition point. \nAs of 15 April 2024, 157 golden point games have been played, with 18 remaining a draw after the ten minutes of golden point extra-time. Daly Cherry-Evans has scored the winning points on six occasions, more than anyone in the NRL, with Johnathan Thurston and Valentine Holmes behind him on four. The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks have played the most golden point games with 22 in total, while Canterbury have played the least with 13. The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are the most successful team under the format, having won nine of their 13 golden point matches (including a draw), whilst the Wests Tigers are the worst, having lost 15 of their 20 matches. The St. George Illawarra Dragons were the final club to win their first golden point match, after five previous failed attempts. The South Sydney Rabbitohs, New Zealand Warriors and Brisbane Broncos have all featured in the most drawn matches with four.\nOnly one match up has occurred on four occasions, the Rabbitohs v the Tigers, with Souths winning all four. Match ups which have occurred on three occasions are: The North Queensland Cowboys vs. the Penrith Panthers, the Sydney Roosters vs. the New Zealand Warriors, the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles vs. the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, the Brisbane Broncos vs. the North Queensland Cowboys, the Melbourne Storm vs. the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, the Melbourne Storm vs. the Sydney Roosters, and the Newcastle Knights vs. the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. The Panthers have a 2–1 record over the Cowboys, Souths have a 4–0 record over the Tigers, the Warriors have a 2–0–1 record over the Roosters, the Bulldogs have a 3–0 record over Manly, the Cowboys have a 2–1 record over the Broncos, the Storm share a 1-1-1 record against Manly, the Roosters have a 2–1 record over Melbourne, and the Knights have a 2-0-1 record over Manly.\nThe first golden point game in a grand final occurred in 2015, between the Brisbane Broncos and the North Queensland Cowboys, which was won 17–16 by the Cowboys after a Johnathan Thurston field goal sealed the win and a first premiership title for the Cowboys. \nFollowing the 2015 NRL Grand Final the rules for tied NRL finals matches reverted to two five minute periods of extra-time, followed by golden point extra time if required.\nThe first golden point game in a NRL Women's Premiership match occurred during the fifth season of the competition in 2022, with Rachael Pearson of the St. George Illawarra Dragons scoring a field goal to defeat the Brisbane Broncos 19–18.\nTally.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Michael Dennis Armstrong (born March 7, 1954) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played from 1980 to 1987, mainly as a relief pitcher. He played college baseball for the University of Miami.\nCareer.\nArmstrong originally was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the ninth round of the 1972 draft, but did not sign. He was then drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round (24th overall) of the 1974 amateur draft. While still in the minors, Armstrong was traded to the San Diego Padres in 1979. He made appearances in the majors with the Padres in 1980 and 1981, but mainly played in the minor leagues. Prior to the start of the 1982 season, Armstrong was purchased by the Kansas City Royals. There, Armstrong pitched regularly, with over 100 innings in his two years with the team and had an earned run average under 4.00.\nArmstrong played in the pine tar game between the Royals and the Yankees on July 24, 1983, earning the victory; a victory it took him almost a month to pick up. \"It was wild to go back to New York and play these four outs in a totally empty stadium,\" Armstrong said. \"I'm dressed in the uniform, and nobody's there.\" He went 10-7 that season in 58 appearances, notching career highs in wins and games.\nThe 6-foot-3 right-hander was traded to the Yankees after the 1983 season in a deal that brought Steve Balboni to the Royals. While Balboni went on to slug over 100 home runs and contributed to the Royals 1985 World Series triumph, Armstrong reported to spring training in 1984 with a sore arm, limiting him to two Grapefruit League appearances. As a result, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner filed a grievance with Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Despite efforts to get another pitcher other than him from the Royals, Armstrong remained with the Yankees, though he spent most of his time with their AAA Columbus farm club from 1984 to 1986. Armstrong finished his Major League career with the Cleveland Indians in 1987.\nIn parts of 8 seasons he had a 19–17 win–loss record, pitching in 197 games with 1 start, 11 saves, 94 games finished, 338 innings pitched, 300 hits allowed, 170 runs allowed of which 154 were earned, 42 home runs allowed, 155 walks allowed, 221 strikeouts, 6 hit batsmen, 16 wild pitches, 1,439 batters faced, 20 intentional walks, 2 balks and a 4.10 ERA. His career WHIP was 1.346.\nFollowing his playing career, Armstrong remained involved in baseball. He moved to South Boston, Virginia, where he helped found an adult baseball league and ran a local sporting goods store for five years. Then he worked in the construction business and as a painter until he turned 45, when his major league pension kicked in. He moved to Oconee County, Georgia, close to where his second wife Monica was from. A severe car accident left him with a rod in his right leg, but as of 2006, he was still pitching in a wooden bat league."

        "text": "An English cricket team toured Australia in 1861–62. This was the first-ever tour of Australia by any overseas team and the second tour abroad by an English team, following the one to North America in 1859. The team is sometimes referred to as H. H. Stephenson's XI.\nOrganisers.\nThe idea for the tour came from the English proprietors of a Melbourne catering company called Spiers and Pond, which ran the Café de Paris in the city. Spiers was Felix William Spiers and Pond was Christopher Pond. Their representative in England, a Mr Mallam, had tried to interest Charles Dickens in a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand but without success. Instead, having noted the success of the 1859 venture, and the growing popularity of cricket in Australia, Spiers and Pond decided to attract a team of leading English cricketers. Mallam therefore journeyed to Birmingham in September 1861 to watch the North v. South game at Aston Park.\nDuring the game, Mallam met the cricketers at the nearby Hen and Chicken Hotel to make a business proposal. As a result, 12 players agreed to tour Australia the following winter, on terms of £150 per man plus expenses.\nSquad.\nThe team was captained by H. H. Stephenson (Surrey) who was joined by William Caffyn, Will Mortlock, George Griffith, William Mudie, Tom Sewell junior (all Surrey); Roger Iddison, Ned Stephenson (both Yorkshire); Tom Hearne, Charles Lawrence (both Middlesex); George Wells (Sussex); and George Bennett (Kent). Stephenson and Caffyn had toured America in 1859.\nTour.\nThe team sailed from Liverpool on 20 October in the , arriving in Melbourne on 24 December. The visit created enormous interest in Australia with a vast crowd greeting the team's arrival at Sandridge (Port Melbourne).\nAs a team, they played 12 matches that were not first-class, winning 6 and losing 2 with 4 drawn. All but one of these games were against odds of at least 18 to 11. The exception was a one-day single innings match.\nThe first match of the tour, against Victoria in Melbourne, drew 45,000 spectators over three days, enabling Spiers and Pond to pay the tour's expenses after just one match. Later in January 1862, the team played New South Wales on the Sydney Domain; the Secretary for Lands, John Robertson controversially allowed the promoters to charge admission to the public while arranging a free stand for parliamentarians.\nThe team divided for a match in March 1862 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground that has been called The World v Surrey XI and is rated first-class. The six Surrey players were joined by five locals, who reportedly had Surrey affiliations, to form the Surrey XI; the World XI was formed of the six non-Surrey tourists and another five locals. The World XI won by 6 wickets thanks to an outstanding all-round performance by George Bennett who scored 72 and then took 7-30 and 7-85. This game drew a good attendance of about 8,000. One of the World XI locals was John Conway of Victoria who later managed the first Australian team to tour England.\nThe tour was certainly successful in the long-term sense that it inspired later English teams to visit Australia. The team arrived back in England on 12 May 1862.\nThis first tour greatly promoted the development of Australia cricket. Charles Lawrence (sometimes spelled as Laurence) remained in Sydney as a professional coach with the Albert Cricket Club. He captained New South Wales in intercolonial matches and captain-coached the famous Aboriginal cricket team that completed the first cricket tour of England in 1868. After the 1863/64 tour Billy Caffyn also stayed on in Australia, first as a professional with the Melbourne Cricket Club, and then with the Warwick Club in Sydney.\nBoth men had an enormous influence on the development of the new generation of Australian cricketers."

        "text": "The 1935 Giro d'Italia was the 23rd edition of the Giro d'Italia, organized and sponsored by the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race began on 18 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Cremona, finishing back in Milan on 9 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Vasco Bergamaschi of the Maino team, with fellow Italians Giuseppe Martano and Giuseppe Olmo coming in second and third respectively.\nThis Giro saw the last participation of Alfredo Binda and the first of Gino Bartali, then 20 years old, who won the mountains classification.\nParticipants.\nOf the 101 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 18 May, 62 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 9 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team; 55 riders competed as part of a team, while the remaining 46 competed independently. There were eight teams that competed in the race: Bianchi, Dei, Fréjus, Gloria, Helyett, Legnano, and Maino.\nThe peloton was primarily composed of Italians. The field featured seven former Giro d'Italia champions in five-time winner Alfredo Binda, two-time champion Costante Girardengo, and single race winners, Francesco Camusso, Luigi Marchisio, Antonio Pesenti, Learco Guerra, and Vasco Bergamaschi. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Giuseppe Olmo, Raffaele Di Paco, Remo Bertoni, and Domenico Piemontesi. French cyclist and two-time Tour de France champion André Leducq entered the Giro d'Italia for the first time in his career. Other notable non-Italian riders included: Maurice Archambaud, Jef Demuysere, and René Vietto.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe highest ranked non-Italian cyclist in the general classification and the highest ranked isolati cyclist in the general classification were tracked.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "title": "History of baseball team nicknames",
        "text": "This is a summary of the evolution of names of the current professional Major League Baseball teams in the National League (organized 1876) and subsequent rival American League (established 1901), and also of selected former major and minor league teams whose names were influential, long-lasting, or both. The sources of the names included club names, team colors, and city symbols. The names have sometimes been dubbed by the media, other times through conscious advertising marketing by the team, or sometimes a little of both.\nMost sources today, including such authoritative references as The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball, The Baseball Encyclopedia, Total Baseball, baseballreference.com, the Library of Congress and even the Baseball Hall of Fame itself usually adhere to an artificial naming convention, dating from 1951, which conforms references to 19th-century teams to modern usage (City + Plural Nickname), and which is misleadingly anachronistic: few teams before 1900 had names, and adopting them only really caught on in the first decades of the 20th century. Team nicknames like the \"Boston Beaneaters\" and \"Brooklyn Bridegrooms\" were never official; they were the invention of inventive sportswriters. A few of these coinages actually did catch hold with the contemporary fan base, such as \"Robins\" and \"Browns,\" and some remained popular long enough to be adopted officially, like \"Giants\" and \"Pirates;\" but many of the others were either ephemeral quips, like \"Rustlers\" and \"Ruby Legs,\" or never existed at all, like \"Pilgrims.\"\nOverview.\n\"See also Team names and colors\"\nAthletic teams have long used colors and nicknames as a form of team identity. This echoes the use of colors and nicknames in other activities such as heraldry, the military, and the flags of states, provinces and nations.\nBaseball teams began to use nicknames early in the development of the sport. Not all teams felt the need for a nickname. The supposed first recorded game of baseball took place between two teams called \"New York\" and \"Knickerbocker\", in the mid-1840s. Both teams were actually based in New York City.\nAfter the American Civil War (1861-1865), interest in highly skilled games of baseball resulted in many hundreds of local organized clubs springing up, many under the umbrella of the new National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) from 1857 to 1870, also sometimes referred to as \"the amateur association\". These were often with names that were the club's official name, now often erroneously retrofitted as the \"nickname\". However, all of these club names had the words \"Base Ball Club\" listed after them (\"baseball\" was usually spelled then as two words). Examples:\nNew York\nBrooklyn\nPhiladelphia\nCleveland\nAlthough many of the players on these clubs were de facto professionals, the first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati \"Red Stockings\", an amateur team that turned professional and began a successful barnstorming tour in 1869. The fame of this team spelled the end of the high-level amateur version of the game. It was followed by a second \"National Association\", that of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) during 1871–1875, with an increasing number of local clubs and for the first time, professional franchise teams. The Cincinnati Red Stockings team's newfangled uniform of knee-length \"knickers\" with bright colored high-topped socks or stockings also inspired the use of team colors serving a dual role as a team nickname for the sportswriters of the day, who could add variety to their prose by referring to, e.g., the Hartford club or \"Hartfords\" alternately as the \"Dark Blues\" based on their obvious characteristic clothing. None of these early 'color' nicknames were official or used by the teams themselves, however. According to the Association and then the League, the teams were simply e.g. the \"Brooklyn B. B. C.\"\nExamples:\nSuggesting an awareness of the significance of colors, seven seasons after its 1876 founding, the following National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known simply as the National League) in 1882 passed a rule requiring specific stocking colors for each team:\nWhile the 1882 rules prescribed stocking colors according to club, they also prescribed jersey and cap colors, but according to player position rather than according to club. Thus, on a single player's uniform, his cap and jersey would designate his position, and only his stockings would designate his club.\nAs the news and developing sports media (primarily newspapers) began covering games extensively and assigning specialists to write about them, the inventive scribes might use the established names, or they might invent some new ones. Initially, they often referred to a club in the plural form, either by its city name or by its club name. Examples:\nAs the writers and reporters became more inventive, they began to refer to teams by some characteristic that made the team or the city unique. Examples:\nWhen two or more major leagues existed simultaneously in one city, the writers often appended the league name, which occasionally had the chance of evolving also into a team nickname, especially in the then frequent cities of the Northeast with two teams, a representative in each league. (\"The Encyclopedia of Sports\", p. 32) Examples:\nIn some cases, such as the Cleveland Indians, the team actually solicited help from the media in inventing a new nickname.\nSome of those nicknames changed over time or died with the team, while some are still in use today. All of the nicknames of the \"classic 8\" NL teams of 1900-1952 were originally unofficial. But once an unofficial nickname became popular enough, it might be adopted by the team and become official. This practice was already coming into vogue by 1901 and the formation of the American League; four of the upstart league's eight franchises had official team names right from the start. A couple of teams stuck with a name for several years and then changed it to something else, such as the Cleveland Napoleons &gt; Indians, but most teams have never changed their names once officially adopted (other than teams which relocated to a new city). Some teams have had \"two\" popular nicknames simultaneously for many years. Examples:\nIn the modern era of sports franchise expansion, nicknames are no longer assigned in a haphazard way by the news media, but rather are chosen by the teams for marketing and advertising purposes. The names are chosen in order to establish a strong team identity, and to have an attractive logo to encourage sales of merchandise to fans, such as caps and shirts. Often the nickname will have some sort of historical, geographical, cultural or economic symbolic connection or representation of the city and more recently, the surrounding state.\nNonetheless, fans and media sportswriters may still apply informal tags in the old manner, such as the&lt;br&gt; \n\"Redbirds\" (St Louis Cardinals)&lt;br&gt; \n\"Birds\" or the \"O's\" (Baltimore Orioles)&lt;br&gt; \n\"Bronx Bombers\" (New York Yankees)&lt;br&gt; \n\"Friars\" (San Diego Padres)&lt;br&gt;\n\"Halos\" (Los Angeles Angels)&lt;br&gt;\n\"Tribe\" (Cleveland Indians).\nAtlanta.\nFor years the minor league team in Atlanta was called the Crackers.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Braves nickname originated in Boston in 1912. (See the Boston, Massachusetts, entry below.) The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee before the 1953 season and were known as the Milwaukee Braves from 1953 to 1965. The team moved again to Atlanta before the 1966 season, and have been known as the Atlanta Braves since.\nBaltimore.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nEarliest official adoption: 1901\nThe team's nickname is taken from the Baltimore oriole (\"Icterus galbula\"), a small blackbird of the passerine family of fowl in the eastern United States. The bird received its name in about 1808 from the fact that the male's colors resembled those on the coat of arms of Sir George Calvert (1579-1632), the first Lord Baltimore, who was senior of the Calvert family that established the Province of Maryland colony in the 17th century. The Baltimore oriole is also the state bird symbol of modern Maryland.\nMost of the professional baseball (and a few other sports) teams in Baltimore have been dubbed the \"Orioles\", with a few exceptions.\nThe earliest Baltimore clubs, in the early 1870s, were called \"Lord Baltimore\" and \"Maryland\" respectively. These clubs were short-lived. The \"Lord Baltimore\" team chose the unusual team color of yellow or a variation of gold, and was often called the Canaries or the Yellow Stockings. The Maryland club was simply called the \"Marylands\", in the pluralized style of the day. The names and colors were also used by other local jurisdictions and schools/colleges/universities.\nThe first club to be called the Baltimore Orioles was a charter member of the old American Association in 1882. When the AA league folded after the 1891 season, four of its teams were brought into the expanded National League (organized previously 1876), including Baltimore. This club became a dominant team in the older league during the 1890s under player-manager Ned Hanlon, in part because of their innovations and their tough, relentless play. The nickname \"Orioles\" first appears in the Spalding Guide in the 1895 edition which covered their first championship season, 1894; notably, the previous year's Guide never used the name at all. The term \"Old Oriole\" is sometimes used to describe a player whose aggressive style fits the legacy of those 1890s teams. The competitive famous team's fortunes took a downturn in 1899 when many of its stars were transferred to the Brooklyn Superbas/Dodgers, and Baltimore was one of the four teams contracted out of existence in 1900 when the NL reduced from 12 franchises to just 8, an arrangement lasting for over a half century.\nThe newly formed American League of 1901 wanted to compete directly with the National League's New York Giants, but the Giants used their political clout to block the American League from placing a club there. Instead, one of its 8 charter member franchise teams was placed in Baltimore in 1901. Their \"Orioles\" nickname was acknowledged in an unusual way that year, with an orange letter \"O\" on their uniform shirts, probably the only major league team ever to sport a symbol that looked like a \"zero\". The 1902 shirts substituted a more conventional block letter \"B\". In 1903, after the American and National leagues settled their 2 year old \"baseball war\" dispute with a \"peace pact\", the National League allowed the American league to have a competing New York club in the nation's largest city and the Baltimore club, which was originally meant to have been located in New York from the beginning was bought by former player/manager, the legendary John McGraw and transferred to New York City abandoning the Orioles name and, since 1913, known as the New York Yankees.\nA top-level minor league version of the Baltimore Orioles replaced the departed major league club, and it would be a force to be reckoned with in the \"Triple AAA\" high minors for 50 years, winning a number of International League championships and also providing a famed local boy, George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth to the major leagues in 1914.\nAnother Baltimore team was the rival third-party Federal League entry of 1914–1915, which called itself the Baltimore Terrapins, after the diamondback terrapin, the state reptile of Maryland now primarily associated with the University of Maryland, College Park Maryland Terrapins sports teams. The Federal League Terrapins opened Terrapin Park across the street from the IL minor league and previous AL club's own ballpark, which was acquired by the Orioles after the \"Fed\" folded. That began a chain of events which led to Baltimore's return to major league status, a story covered in more detail in the article on Memorial Stadium.\nIn 1954, the St. Louis Browns of the AL, another of the charter \"original 8\", moved to Baltimore, and the team adopted the city's old traditional baseball nickname.\nMany fans, and the team itself, also refer to the team as the \"O's\" or the \"Birds\".\nBoston.\n\"Neither team had a nickname [in 1901], nor would they for several more seasons. Both were simply called 'the Bostons,' although to differentiate between the two clubs, fans, sportswriters, and players commonly began referring to the NL entry as 'the Nationals,' and their American League counterparts as 'the Americans.' Other nicknames, such as the Pilgrims, Puritans, Plymouth Rocks, Somersets (so named after owner Charles Somers), or Collinsmen (after manager Collins) for the AL team and the Beaneaters, Triumvirs, or Seleemen (after manager Frank Selee) for the Nationals, were convenient inventions of the press. Their subsequent use by many historians is misleading. None of these nicknames was ever widely used by either fans or players.\"\nBoston Braves.\nEarliest official adoption: 1912\nFour players from the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–1870 regrouped in Boston in 1871 (Robert Smith, \"Baseball in America\", Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1961, p. 36), which they would call home for the next 83 seasons. In the newly formed National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, the Boston Red Stockings would continue to dominate as they had in Cincinnati, winning 4 of the league's 5 pennants and joining the new National League in 1876.\nSome sources (such as TSNBBG) say they were renamed the \"Red Caps\", presumably in deference to the revived Red Stockings entry in Cincinnati. Local newspapers referred to the club as both \"Red Stockings\" and \"Red Caps\". In any case, in the 1880s a few sportswriters (not in Boston) referred to them as the Beaneaters on a couple of occasions, a term used for Bostonians in general due to the prevalence of the staple dish baked beans. Boston itself is often called \"Beantown,\" but generally not by residents. The media-invented nickname \"Beaneaters\" was still in occasional use in the early 1900s, and was even applied to the newly formed American League entry from time to time. The National Leaguers continued to include red trim in their uniforms until 1907, when they temporarily switched to an all-white uniform. The press promptly labeled them the Doves, reinforced by their owner being named Dovey. (Similarly, they were called the Rustlers in 1911 for new owner William Hepburn Russell (baseball).)\nIn 1908, the Americans adopted those colors and became the Red Sox. The Nationals reverted to their red trim and slowly looked for a name of their own. They found one when James Gaffney bought the club.\nThe Tammany Hall political organization was named after an American Indian chief and used an Indian image as its symbol, hence the \"Braves\". The 1912 team wore an Indian-head logo, and in 1915 the name \"Braves.\" Over the years that name has stuck, despite occasional controversy about its stereotyping of Native Americans, and has followed the team through two moves — to Milwaukee in 1953, and to Atlanta in 1966.\nWhile still in Boston, the Braves fell into severe doldrums in the 1930s, and were looking for ways to reinvent themselves.\nThe name \"Bees\" did nothing to improve the team's fortunes, and was abandoned by the end of World War II. In 1935 the uniform shirts had read \"BRAVES\" and in 1936 they merely said \"BOSTON\" on the home as well as the road version. They switched to a block \"B\" on home shirts the next year, which remained the pattern most years until the block-letter \"BRAVES\" reappeared in 1945. At no point did they wear anything on their uniforms which suggested an actual bee other than the homonym of the letter \"B\". In 1946, the script version of \"Braves\", complete with tomahawk, made its first appearance and has been on most of the uniform shirts since then. (Okkonen)\nThe Washington Redskins of the NFL began in 1932 as the Boston Braves. They renamed themselves the Redskins the next year, having moved from Braves Field to the Red Sox' Fenway Park, serving the dual purpose of sounding similar to their new baseball co-tenants while allowing them to keep the Native American-logoed uniforms they had worn as the Braves, and in 1937 they moved to Washington, D.C., bringing the nickname with them.\nBoston Red Sox.\nEarliest official adoption: 1912 (1908)\nFor years many sources have called the early Boston AL teams \"Pilgrims\" or \"Puritans\" or \"Plymouth Rocks\" or \"Somersets\" for owner Charles Somers or even the \"Speed Boys\". Research by SABR writer Bill Nowlin demonstrated that none of those names was used very often and that \"Pilgrims\", the most popular revisionist nickname today, was barely used at all.\nIn 1901, the American League, led by Ban Johnson, declared itself equal to the National League and established a competing club in Boston. For seven seasons, the AL team wore \"dark blue\" stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \"Boston\" or \"the Bostons\"; or the \"Americans\" or \"Boston Americans\" as in \"American Leaguers\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 shirts, both home and road, simply read \"Boston\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \"B\" and \"A\" denoting \"Boston\" and \"American\".\nThe temporary decision by the Boston National Leaguers to drop the color red from their uniforms led to a history-making decision:\nThe problem with part of that story is that the \"Doves\" went through the entire 1907 season wearing white (except for a red old-English \"B\" on their shirts) while the American Leaguers continued to wear their dark blue during the 1907 season. (Okkonen)\nOn December 18, 1907, owner Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The name \"Red Sox\" is non-standard English for \"Red Socks\", short for \"Red Stockings\". For the 1908 season, the AL team shirts featured a red stocking across the front labeled \"BOSTON\". They also wore red stockings, along with white caps. Meanwhile, for 1908, the NL team returned to wearing red stockings as well as red caps, while retaining the old-English \"B\". So the primary visual differences between the two teams' uniforms in 1908 were the caps and the shirt fronts.\nThe red stocking on the shirt front was a one-year innovation before returning to the plain \"BOSTON\". The familiar \"RED SOX\" first appeared in 1912, coincident with the opening of Fenway Park. Through the years, the Red Sox have continued to wear red somewhere in their uniforms. By the 1930s, the color blue was re-added to the mix. (Okkonen)\nHeadline writers often call the team \"Bosox\", to contrast with the Chicago White Sox or \"Chisox\". As with Chicago, when the team's fans are talking about their own team, they are apt to call them simply \"The Sox\".\nThe National Football League Boston team, who played their first season at Braves Field and called themselves the \"Braves\" after their hosts, moved into Fenway Park in 1933. Since the old name would no longer do, they changed their Indian-inspired name to \"Redskins\" to harmonize with \"Red Sox\".\nBrooklyn.\nTogether with New York City across the East River, Brooklyn was the cradle of organized baseball, producing some of the strongest clubs of the amateur and early professional era; these included Atlantic, Eckford and Excelsior. Atlantic turned pro in 1869 and became nationally famous by ending the Cincinnati Red Stockings' winning streak in 1870.\nBrooklyn Dodgers.\nEarliest official adoption: 1916\nThe Dodgers have had a number of nicknames through the years.\nThis team began as the Brooklyn Atlantics in the American Association of the 1880s, its name a reference to the storied amateur club of the 1860s. Reporters also tagged them the Grays, the typical uniform-color reference of the day. These however were very occasional; overwhelmingly newspaper writeups simply called them \"Brooklyn\" or, more often, \"the Brooklyns.\"\nIn 1888, six members of the team were married during the season, and the press tagged the club as the Bridegrooms or just the Grooms. (TSNBBG)\nIn the early 1890s, the club had switched to the National League. The city of Brooklyn installed the transportation innovation called the trolley system. Its citizens thus became \"trolley dodgers\" to the newswriters. By association, the team itself acquired that nickname, as the honeymoon for the \"Grooms\" was over after several years. (TSNBBG) Officially, however, the team remained the Brooklyn Base Ball Association, \"sans\" nickname.\nBrooklyn was a separate city from New York until 1898, and its teams retained the name \"Brooklyn\".\nDuring the late 1890s, when Ned Hanlon was the manager and the Dodgers won the pennant (thanks in part to raiding the Baltimore Orioles roster), there happened to be a stage or circus act called \"The Hanlons' Superba\". The New York press, in their usual creative way, began calling Ned Hanlon's Dodgers the Superbas. (TSNBBG)\nAround 1910, the club was briefly tagged as the Infants, from a remark by president Charles Ebbets, who had declared in a speech that \"Baseball is in its infancy.\" In the words of TSNBBG, \"The monicker clung until Thomas J. Lynch, then president of the National League, asked baseball writers to accept waivers on it.\"\nOnce Wilbert Robinson was well established and beloved as the Dodgers manager, the team was called the Robins as often as anything. The nickname \"Dodgers\" continued to be used also. After Robby retired, the team became just the \"Dodgers\" again. The club finally acknowledged its informal nickname in 1916, when the home World Series programs were boldly titled \"Dodgers vs Red Sox;\" and yet, that same season, the Brooklyn Eagle used \"Superbas\" in its box scores, years after Hanlon's retirement, and a cartoon on the record 26-inning game vs Boston that year used a robin to represent the team. In 1933, the team put the word \"Dodgers\" on their shirts for the first time, in block letters. The famous script \"Dodgers\" first appeared in 1938. (Okkonen)\nWhen the club moved to the west coast in 1958, they brought their nickname with them, although it had no particular meaning in Los Angeles.\nThe \"Bums\" nickname arose due to the cartoons of Willard Mullin, characterizing the citizenry of Brooklyn in an unflattering but humorous way.\nChicago.\nChicago is unique in Major League Baseball in that both of its charter member clubs have remained in their original cities. Various other clubs had brief lifespans in the Windy City also.\nThe entry in the one-year wonder called the Union Association was called the Chicago Browns by some writers. The club lasted half a season and then transferred to Pittsburgh where, continuing their color scheme, they were called the Stogies.\nThe Players' League was a one-year rebellion by players. The entry in the Windy City, called the Chicago Pirates, were led by Charles Comiskey, who would return to the South Side nine years later, as an owner, and with a decidedly more conservative attitude toward player salaries.\nWhen the Federal League began its two-year experiment, it placed a team in Chicago. Although the Fed was known for colorful nicknames, the best anyone could come up with for the Chicago Federals' first year, 1914, was the Chi-Feds. For the second and final Fed season, which proved to be a pennant winner for the Chi-Feds, the name Chicago Whales was used, despite the lack of any known whales in Lake Michigan. The uniforms featured a whale icon inside a large round \"C\", suggestive of the Cubs' logo of that time, a large round \"C\" encircling a bear cub. (Okkonen) The Chi-Fed Whales' lasting legacy is Wrigley Field, which the Cubs moved into after the Federal League collapsed and have played there ever since.\nChicago Cubs.\nFirst official use: 1907\nIn 1870, the first openly professional team in Chicago, officially named simply the Chicago Ball Club, was dubbed the White Stockings, in reference to the team colors and in contrast to the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The team carried that nickname along to the NA in 1871 and into the NL in 1876. The Chicago club was indeed frequently referred to in newspaper articles as the White Stockings right from the 1870 season onward, making it one of the few \"real\" nicknames among those artificially retrofitted to the era's teams by sportswriters.\nAfter the team's successes in the first half of the 1880s, the club began trading away its stars, and by the end of the decade the team was populated by young players, with the exception of long-time player–manager Cap Anson. By the late 1880s, local newspapers had started to call the team \"Anson's Colts\", or just \"Colts\". With the advent of the Players' League in 1890, what little talent the club still had was drained away, and the nickname, though never \"official\", became standard. (\"The Golden Era Cubs: 1876–1940\", Eddie Gold and Art Ahrens, Bonus Books, 1985, p. 2) and \nIn any case, 1890 is the usual date given for the replacement of \"White Stockings\" with \"Colts\" as the club's predominant nickname. The 1894 Spalding Guide refers to the team - once - as \"Anson's so-called Chicago 'colts'.\"\nThe Colts name would stick around, off and on, for the next 15 years. It was reinforced by a squad of many young players, contrasting with the veteran Anson, who had become known as \"Pop\" by the 1890s. Anson left the team after the 1897 season, and the local papers called the team the Orphans for a while, because they had lost their \"Pop\". They apparently still had some \"pop\" in their bats, finishing fourth in a twelve-team league.\nThe 2007 Arcadia book called \"Chicago Cubs: Tinker to Evers to Chance\", by Art Ahrens, contains a series of facts in various places on pages 9–56 that add up to an explanation of the gradual transition from \"Colts\" to \"Cubs\":\nBy the time the Chicago National Leaguers played their cross-town World Series with the White Sox in 1906, the \"Chicago Cubs\" nickname was well established. An editorial cartoon after the Series showed a cabin with an unknown figure inside, with only his white socks visible, up on a footrest, with the skin of a bear nailed to the wall outside, and six more white socks hanging on a clothesline (the Sox had beaten the Cubs in six games). (John Devaney and Burt Goldblatt, \"The World Series: A Complete Pictorial History\", Rand McNally, 1975, p. 27).\nBy 1907, the name \"Cubs\" was appearing on the team's scorecards. (Ahrens) The first uniform acknowledgment of the nickname came in 1908, when a bear cub holding a bat was placed inside the round \"C\" that was already on the uniform shirt. The 1908 World Series home programs used both the Cubs name and image frequently. The familiar \"C\" encircling \"UBS\" first appeared the following year, on the road shirts. With this official acknowledgment, the old nickname of \"Colts\" was gone for good. Either a bear cub symbol or the word \"CUBS\" has appeared on home and/or road shirts ever since then. (Okkonen)\nDespite the best efforts of the MLB Promotion Corporation, which began in the late 1960s, the Cubs did not trademark this iconic circle-C-UBS logo (which has been a steady fixture on uniforms and publications since 1937) until the late 1970s.\nThe nickname \"Cubbies\", a diminutive of something already small or young, gained favor in large part due to Harry Caray's famous rendering of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". Instead of drawing out the single-syllable \"Cubs\" into two syllables in place of \"home team\", Caray used \"Cubbies\" to make the line flow better.\nThe Chicago Bears of the National Football League played their games at the Cubs' Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970, and were renamed (from \"Staleys\") in honor of their hosts.\nChicago White Sox.\nFirst official use: 1906 (Stockings); 1912 (Sox)\n\"Anson's National Leaguers had been known as the White Stockings, and when Charles Comiskey brought his St. Paul Saints team into the city of his birth in 1900, Carl Green of Detroit and Irving E. (Si) Sanborn, covering baseball in the Windy City, revived the name White Stockings.\" (TSNBBG)\nThe new American League entry adopted the abandoned colors and nickname of their National League rivals. They were initially called the \"White Stockings\", a nickname quickly shortened to White Sox by the press. The transition can be seen in the 1906 Spalding Guide, in which both \"White Stockings\" and \"White Sox\" appear. In 1912, the team started wearing the first incarnation of its \"SOX\" logo on the shirts. (Okkonen)\nThe team is often called the \"Chisox\" by headline writers, to distinguish from \"Bosox\". The synonym \"Pale Hose\" is also used. Within the city, as with Boston, the team is often just plain \"Sox\". The Hispanic community of Chicago calls them \"Las Medias Blancas\", Spanish for \"The White Stockings\".\nCincinnati.\nCincinnati Red Stockings.\nThe first openly all-professional team was the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–1870. They began as an amateur organization in the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1866, as interest in baseball grew substantially after the American Civil War. Interest in the Red Stockings themselves grew as they compiled an impressive winning streak while mostly on a road tour or \"barnstorming\". The nickname \"Red Stockings\" was originally a press appellation based on their uniforms, in fact the 1869 Cincinnati club inaugurated the baseball tradition of wearing knickers with knee socks instead of long trousers, a style some contemporary prudes considered shocking and immoral; but player/manager Harry Wright quickly saw its appeal for marketing purposes and by midseason the club had adopted the name and called itself the Red Stockings Base Ball Club of Cincinnati.\nThe Red Stockings went through 1869 and partway into 1870 undefeated, their streak finally ending on June 14, 1870. Interest in the team waned after that, and while the club gained much fame and acclaim, the team's profit margin was slim. The club's executives decided to disband the team for 1871. But the influence of this team was substantial. By 1870, professionalism was wide open, spelling the end of the \"amateur era\", and paving the way to the first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, which began operating in 1871.\nWith the Cincinnati Red Stockings dissolved, four of its players regrouped in Boston to join the new National Association (often called the NA for short, by modern historians). Manager Harry Wright and his brother George Wright (baseball's version of the \"Wright brothers\") brought along Cal McVey and Charlie Gould to form the Boston Red Stockings, which eventually evolved into the Atlanta Braves (q.v.)\nCincinnati Reds.\nFirst official use: 1911\nDue to the influence of the Red Stockings, nearly every professional team in Cincinnati since then has worn red as their primary trim color. The Cincinnati teams have also tended to associate themselves with the 1869-70 club, but there is no direct connection other than the name.\nWhen the NA folded, the best teams, and some new ones, regrouped to form the National League in 1876. One of the new teams was called the Cincinnati Red Stockings, reclaiming the old name. The team was expelled from the National League in 1880 for selling beer at games and playing on Sundays.\nIn 1882 a new league formed to challenge the established NL: The American Association. The AA appealed to a different, rowdier market than the stoic NL, by offering cheaper admission prices as well as alcoholic beverages, which at that time were forbidden in the NL ballparks. Ironically, this \"AA\" became known as \"The Beer and Whisky League\", and was criticized by the NL leadership for placing so many of its teams in \"river towns\", characterizing the AA cities as being populated by low-class citizens: Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis.\nThe new version of the Cincinnati Red Stockings (later shortened to Cincinnati Reds; the earliest mention of \"Reds\" in the Spalding Guide dates from the 1895 edition) became prosperous. The team won the first American Association pennant, and survived most of Association's ten-year existence, transferring to the National League in 1890. For 1891, a short lived \"Cincinnati Reds\" entry joined the Association, otherwise known as \"Kelly's Killers\". The club failed to finish the season and was replaced by Milwaukee. By then the Association was floundering, and collapsed after the season ended. The NL Reds continue to play in Cincinnati to this day.\nThe team first used the single \"C\" on its uniforms in 1905. The word \"Reds\" was placed inside the \"C\" for the first time in 1911. Variants on that style have been used in most years since then. (Okkonen)\nHaving shortened their name brought them some trouble in the 1950s, or more accurately the \"fear\" of trouble. The term \"Reds\" in the political arena had long been a synonym for \"Communist\". During the McCarthy era, even though there was no connection between professional baseball and Communism, the team was concerned that their traditional club nickname would \"associate\" them with the Communist Threat and the Cold War, so they officially changed their name to the \"Cincinnati Redlegs\". From 1956 to 1960, the club's logo was altered to remove the term \"REDS\" from the inside of the \"wishbone \"C\"\" symbol. The \"REDS\" reappeared on the 1961 uniforms, although habits being what they were, by then they were often called \"Redlegs\", and that name took a few years to totally fade out. (Okkonen)\nAn NFL entry that played briefly in the early 1930s was called the Cincinnati Reds.\nThe nickname \"Red Stockings\" and its descendants reflect one of the oldest nicknames in baseball, topped only by the Athletics, originally of Philadelphia and now in Oakland, and \"Mets\", a variation of \"Metropolitans\", a name that goes back to an amateur baseball club in New York in the 1850s.\nCleveland.\nCleveland is known as \"The Forest City\", and its early-1870s pro team was called the Forest City Base Ball Club or just the \"Forest Citys\", in the style of the day. During the 1871 season, \"Cleveland\" was often part of their name in newspapers, to distinguish from the Rockford Forest Citys of the same league.\nThe National League entry of the 1890s was dubbed the Cleveland Spiders by the press, supposedly because of its long-limbed players. One player during 1897–1899 was Louis Sockalexis, a Native American. His ballplaying skills caught a great deal of attention, though his career was short. During those three seasons, the team was sometimes called the Cleveland Indians.\nCleveland Indians.\nFirst official use: 1915\nAfter the 1899 debacle of 20 wins and 134 losses, in which the once-proud Spiders were redubbed the \"Wanderers\" and the \"Exiles\" due to being relegated to a road franchise, the NL contracted the Cleveland club out of existence. A new team formed the very next year in the young American League. The uniforms featured dark blue, and the team was labeled the \"Blues\" and \"Bluebirds\" by the media, among other short-lived nicknames.\nIn 1903 club ownership conducted a newspaper contest to choose a name for the team, and selected Napoleons for newly acquired star player-manager Napoleon Lajoie; in popular usage this was quickly shortened to \"Naps.\" The fact that they would go to the papers is a reflection of where most of the team nicknames of that era came from. During the tenure of manager Deacon McGuire, the team was also sometimes facetiously called the \"Molly Maguires\". (TSNBBG)\nThe team was strong in the early 1900s, but lapsed in the 1910s and \"Naps\" began to be taken as a joke equated to \"sleeping\". When Lajoie was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics in early January 1915, owner Charles Somers asked the local newspapers again to come up with a new name for the team. \nLegend has it that the team specifically honored Louis Sockalexis when it assumed the name \"Indians\" in mid-January 1915. Another version is that the media and the team chose Cleveland Indians as a play on the name of the Boston Braves, then known as the \"Miracle Braves\" after going from last place on July 4 to a sweep in the 1914 World Series. The informal \"Indians\" name sometimes used during Sockalexis' time with the club reinforced the new name.\nWith the artificial connection to Native Americans, the Cleveland Indians were also often called \"The Tribe\".\nIn the movie \"Major League\", the Cleveland Indians are referred to by many names, including \"The Erie Warriors\", \"The Sons of Geronimo\" and \"The Fighting Braves of the Cuyahoga.\"\nCleveland Guardians.\nFirst official use: 2022\nIn 2020, the club joined other sports franchises with Native American names in exploring whether to modify or change their names. It was announced that the team would cease using the name \"Indians\" following the 2021 baseball season, after which they would change their name to the Cleveland Guardians.\nThe name \"Guardians\" was inspired by the eight \"Guardians of Traffic\" Art Deco statues displayed on the Hope Memorial Bridge near their home field.\nDallas–Fort Worth.\nThere have been minor league clubs in the Dallas – Fort Worth area since at least 1888. One was the Dallas Rangers of the Pacific Coast League, and the other was the Fort Worth Cats/Panthers of the Texas League. In 1965, the Dallas club left the city, and the Fort Worth club moved to Arlington, a city about halfway in between the two major cities. The renamed Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs operated for seven years in Arlington before the majors came knocking.\nTexas Rangers.\nFirst official use: 1972\nThe 1961 expansion version of the Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, in 1972 and took on the nickname Texas Rangers. The name refers to the famous Texas Ranger Division, the law enforcement agency that was created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823. Up until the end of the 2008 season, the team bore the word \"RANGERS\" on their home jerseys and \"TEXAS\" on their road jerseys. Since then, the team has worn \"TEXAS\" at home \"and\" on the road.\nDenver.\nColorado Rockies.\nThe Colorado Rockies became a new franchise into Major League Baseball in 1993. The nickname \"Rockies\" alludes to the Rocky Mountains which cover much of the western half of Colorado. The name Colorado Rockies had been used by a National Hockey League team that lasted from 1976 to 1982, before the team relocated and became the New Jersey Devils.\nDetroit.\nThe first major league team in the city was dubbed the Wolverines, who contended in the National League during 1881–1888. The nickname, which is now primarily associated with the University of Michigan teams, came from Michigan's nickname, the \"Wolverine State\".\nThe club's ownership spent a great deal of money to bring a championship team to Detroit, and the team won an early World Series in 1887. However, Detroit at the time did not have a large enough population to sustain a major league franchise, and the team folded after one more season.\nSeveral minor league clubs came and went over the next few years, typically tagged as Wolverines.\nDetroit Tigers.\nFirst official use: 1901\nThe new minor league entry in the Western League was also called the Wolverines. This club came to stay. The league was renamed the American League in 1900, and the Detroit franchise is still in the league, the one Western League franchise still in its original city, nurtured as it was by the growth of the auto industry in the 20th century.\nThere are various legends about how the Tigers got their nickname. One involves the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings:\nAnother legend concerns a sportswriter equating the 1901 team's opening day victory with the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers.\nThe earliest known use of the name Detroit Tigers in the news was in the \"Detroit Free Press\" on April 16, 1895.\nRichard Bak's 1998 book, \"A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium\" has the full story. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as \"The Tigers\". They had played significant roles in certain Civil War battles and in the Spanish–American War. The baseball team was called both the \"Wolverines\" and the \"Tigers\" in the newspapers. Upon entry into the major leagues in 1901, the ballclub sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use its trademark, and from that day forth the team has been officially the \"Tigers\". Certainly when the team started major-league play in 1901, they were already wearing a tiger logo on their caps.\nIn short, the Tigers most likely wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which was the conventional story. In fact, the Tigers wore a \"red\" stripe on their socks in 1901, and generally avoided stripes after that until beginning to wear orange stripes for a while in the 1920s. (Okkonen)\nThe Detroit Lions of the NFL were named in reference to their then-landlords, the Tigers.\nThe Detroit Red Wings of the NHL were originally called the \"Cougars\", but that referred to their point of origin as the Victoria Cougars. Their early name's apparent relationship to the Tigers and/or Lions was coincidental.\nThe University of Detroit, the main predecessor to today's University of Detroit Mercy, initially used \"Tigers\" as its athletic nickname. The school changed its nickname to Titans in 1919 or 1924, depending on the source. This nickname remained in use for the rest of UD's separate existence, and was inherited by UDM upon the 1990 merger with Mercy College of Detroit that created the current university.\nHouston.\nThe minor league teams of first the Texas League and then the American Association were primarily known as the Houston Buffaloes, or often just \"Buffs\". They were named after Houston's Buffalo Bayou, which has always been a geographic and culturally significant hallmark of the city.\nHouston Astros.\nHouston joined Major League Baseball in 1962 when the National League expanded and placed a franchise in Texas for the first time. The team's original nickname was the Houston Colt .45s, a reference to the famous Colt firearms company. The team itself used a Colt .45s logo, but was most often called just the \"Colts\", a somewhat ambiguous term as it also applies to young horses and skirted the legal issues that eventually influenced the name's abandonment by the club.\nIn 1965 the team changed its nickname to Houston Astros, a name that had more futuristic overtones (\"astro\" is Greek for \"star\") as since 1961 Houston was the city where NASA trained (and continues to train) all the American astronauts. The team also used the nickname as part of its new home, the Astrodome, which opened in 1965.\nThis name change was driven in part by legal considerations. \"The Sporting News Official Baseball Guide\" for 1965 explained why the team was renamed: \"Late in the year 1964 the Harris County Domed Stadium was officially named the Astrodome after the Houston club changed its nickname, December 1, from Colt .45s to Astros. The move resulted from objections by the Colt Firearms Company to the club's sales of novelties bearing the old nickname.\"\nThe nickname 'Stros is often used as a familiar name.\nKansas City, Missouri.\nBeing at the fringe of the old west, and thus connected with cowboys and cattle, several of Kansas City's teams have had nicknames reflecting that culture.\nThere were three different short-lived major league teams in the 1800s, members of the Union Association in 1884, the National League in 1886, and the American Association in 1888 and 1889. The 1880s were the peak years of the great western cattle drives, and Kansas City the biggest of all cow-towns; it was inevitable that sportswriters would tag these men from the Wild West as \"Cowboys.\"\nThe minor league entry in the Western League (original) in the late 1890s was the first to be called the Kansas City Blues, presumably from their team colors. The Western League became the American League in 1900, still a minor league. When the American went major in 1901, the Kansas City entry was dropped.\nA revived minor league club also called the Kansas City Blues operated in the American Association during the first half of the 20th century. The team became a New York Yankees farm team in the 1930s. The team transferred to Denver in 1955 when the Philadelphia Athletics came to town as the Kansas City Athletics. Ironically, that \"Yankees Kansas City farm club\" situation continued, as the A's ownership fed numerous quality players to the Yankees until the 1960s when Charles O. Finley acquired the team. Finley soon incurred the wrath of Kansas City fans also, and transferred the team to Oakland in 1968.\nPerhaps the most famous team in Kansas City was the Kansas City Monarchs, the longest-running of the various Negro league baseball teams that operated as an apartheid culture until major league baseball was integrated in 1947 by one-time Monarch Jackie Robinson. Continuing the dubious Kansas City tradition, the Monarchs effectively served as a \"farm club\" for all of the major leagues in their waning years, supplying a number of star black players to the majors before folding in the 1960s.\nKansas City Athletics.\nIn 1954, the club's last year in Philadelphia, the \"A\" was replaced for the first time with the word \"Athletics\", on both home and road shirts. At no time in their 54-year tenure in Philadelphia did the word \"Philadelphia\" appear on their shirts. The team transferred to Kansas City in 1955 and continued to wear \"Athletics\" on both home and road shirts. The city name finally appeared on road shirts for the first time in 1961, after Charles O. Finley had acquired the team. Finley began a well-documented series of influential uniform innovations that are beyond the scope of this article. He moved the A's to Oakland in 1968, where they have remained to this day. (Okkonen) In 1972 Finley changed the team's official name to the longstanding nickname \"A's\"; \"Athletics\" was restored in 1981.\nKansas City Royals.\nThe American League expanded in 1969, and made good on a pledge to return the majors to Kansas City, by creating the Kansas City Royals. Pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman won the bidding for the new Kansas City team, which was named the Royals after the American Royal Livestock Show held in Kansas City every year since 1899. Some sources have incorrectly reported that the team was named in honor of the Kansas City Monarchs. Apparently it is just a happy coincidence. Also, in an unspoken and possibly coincidental continuation of tradition, the Royals' uniforms carry blue trim.\nLos Angeles area.\nThe minor league teams had been known as the Los Angeles Angels since the founding of the Pacific Coast League in 1903, named after the city itself. That team name contained a built-in redundancy if fully translated into English: \"The The Angels Angels\".\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe minor league team and the nickname were displaced when the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League moved coast-to-coast in 1958. The Los Angeles Dodgers carried their successful ways, and there were no trolleys to be dodged in Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nWhen major league baseball expanded in 1961, a new entry in the American League revived the old nickname. The team was renamed the California Angels in 1965, anticipating their move to Anaheim.\nAfter 32 years as \"California\", the team became the \"Anaheim Angels\" starting with the 1997 season, as a result of a contractual agreement connected with renovations to their stadium.\nStarting with the 2005 season, the club again changed its name. The ownership wanted to revert to the original name, Los Angeles Angels, for marketing reasons. This caused legal problems with the city of Anaheim, since the franchise was contractually required to keep \"Anaheim\" in the team name. As a result, the official designation became the wordy \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\" and the geographic location has been removed from the team's jerseys.\nThe Angels are commonly nicknamed \"the Halos\".\nMiami.\nFlorida / Miami Marlins.\nMinor league teams had been known as the Miami Marlins for several decades, referencing the marlin, a popular sport fish. There were the Miami Marlins of the International League (1956–60) and the Miami Marlins (1962–70) and Miami Marlins (1982–88) of the Florida State League.\nWhen the major leagues expanded to the Miami area in 1993, the old nickname was revived, but the team was initially known as the Florida Marlins. By identifying with the entire state instead of the city, the name's alliterative quality was lost. However, the team officially adopted the Miami Marlins name on November 11, 2011. This was part of a funding agreement between the team and the city of Miami for the team's new stadium which opened in 2012.\nThe Marlins are commonly nicknamed \"the Fish\".\nMilwaukee.\nMilwaukee's various professional teams, going back to the 1870s, had names like the Cream Citys and the Brewers, in reference to the local unique cream brick industry and brewing industry respectively. In particular, some famous breweries included Schlitz (\"The beer that made Milwaukee famous\"), Blatz, Pabst, and later Miller Beer, which held naming rights to the current stadium from its construction in 2001, until it was rebranded American Family Field in 2020.\nThere was a short-lived major league entry, sometimes called the Milwaukee Grays, which operated in the National League in 1878.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nThe Brewers of the minor Western League of the 1890s were retained during the league's inaugural major league season as the American League in 1901, before being moved to become the St. Louis Browns.\nThe revived minor league club in the American Association was then called the Milwaukee Brewers for some 50 years before being displaced by the transplanted Boston Braves in 1953. The major league club retained their traditional nickname as the Milwaukee Braves during their stay in Milwaukee, before moving on to Atlanta in 1966.\nThe city was mostly without professional baseball for a few years. Future team owner and later Commissioner Bud Selig began a lobbying group originally called \"Team, Inc.\" and then renamed \"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.\" The Chicago White Sox played some home games in Milwaukee in that interval.\nThe current Milwaukee Brewers began as the Seattle Pilots, a 1969 expansion team in the American League. After one year of significant financial losses, the team was transplanted to Milwaukee, under the new ownership of Selig, whereupon they revived the traditional name \"Brewers\". The team was switched to the National League in 1998 as part of the expansion and reorganization of the major leagues.\nMinneapolis – Saint Paul.\nThe two adjacent cities have had a long-standing, mostly-friendly rivalry, and each city had high-level minor league clubs, including teams in the American Association for the better part of five decades. The Minneapolis clubs were usually called the Minneapolis Millers, Minneapolis being known as the \"Mill City\". St. Paul, as the state capital, avoided the usual stereotype of teams called \"Senators\", \"Solons\" or \"Capitals\", and instead went for a more direct stereotype. The city's early teams were typically called the St. Paul Saints or Apostles, including the city's short lived Union Association entry in 1884. Later the city's minor league clubs adopted the St. Paul Saints nickname, a self-contained redundancy. The Western League club from the 1890s moved to Chicago in 1900 and became the Chicago White Sox. The revived minor league Saints joined their cross-river rivals in the American Association for much of the first half of the 1900s. The Saints name was revived by an independent minor league club in 1993.\nMinnesota Twins.\nMinneapolis – St. Paul is commonly known as the \"Twin Cities\". The formal name of the team, which transferred from Washington, D.C., in 1961, was initially the Twin Cities Baseball Club, now known as Twins Sports, Inc. The Millers caps had featured an \"M\" and the Saints caps an interlaced \"StP\". The newly transferred Minnesota Twins club wore a cap featuring \"TC\" for \"Twin Cities\" to honor both St. Paul and Minneapolis. The shirts included a sleeve patch with an outline of the state and two ballplayers (known as \"Minnie and Paul\") shaking hands across the Mississippi River.\nBy 1987 the Twins were regionally established, and a cap featuring an \"M\" for \"Minnesota\" was adopted. The \"TC\" logo migrated to the sleeve in place of the previous patch. The team won the World Series that year, so the \"M\" cap became a symbol of success and continued to be used exclusively for a number of years afterward. The \"TC\" cap reappeared in the late 1990s, and was switched off with the \"M\" cap until the 2009 season, retired after the team's 2010 move to Target Field. (Okkonen) \"TC\" is usually used as the team's home cap, with \"M\" as the road cap, though the cap, as with other elements of the team's uniform, is chosen at the whim of the starting pitcher.\nAnother nickname used by fans and writers, but not by the team, is \"Twinkies\", though that name is used more as an insult by the fans of competing teams, or by disgruntled local fans when the team is performing poorly.\nMontreal.\nBefore Major League Baseball expanded to Montreal in 1969, minor league teams in Montreal were usually named the \"Royals\", in reference to Mount Royal (), a volcanic plug immediately west of today's downtown after which the city was named. Hence another redundancy, the \"Mount Royal Royals\".\nMontreal Expos.\nThe Montreal Expos were named in honor of Expo 67, a World's Fair held two years before the Expos began play. The Expos moved to Washington in 2005, and the \"Expos\" name was retired.\nNew York City.\nAs the cradle of organized baseball, New York City had many clubs in the \"amateur\" era leading up to 1869–1870, and the \"professional\" era after that. Knickerbocker, Mutual and Gotham were some of the more prominent clubs.\nThe short-lived Federal League entry in New York was the Brooklyn Tip-Tops. The Fed teams had some innovative names, and this was probably the only major league team ever named for a loaf of bread.\nNew York Mets.\nSince the amateur Metropolitan Base Ball Club was founded in New York as far back as 1857, three years before Athletic of Philadelphia, the Mets can claim to have the oldest team name in major-league baseball.\nThe first professional Metropolitan Baseball Club was a member of the 19th Century American Association, a club which lasted until 1887 but could not compete with the Giants. They were normally listed as \"Metropolitan\" in the standings, and writers would sometimes use the pluralized \"Metropolitans\" or just \"Mets\" in the style of the day, to distinguish them from the \"New Yorks\", their next-door neighbors. The Metropolitans were never referred to as \"New York.\"\nWhen major league baseball expanded in 1962, the old name was revived in the form of the Metropolitan Baseball Club of New York, otherwise known as the New York Mets. \"Met\" is a common short form of \"Metropolitan\", as in \"The Met\" for the Metropolitan Opera; \"MetLife\" for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and so on.\nThe New York Jets of the NFL, originally known as the New York Titans, were the first of several New York area teams whose names rhymed with \"Mets\". Others included the New York Nets of the NBA (now Brooklyn Nets), and the New York Sets of the short-lived Team Tennis league.\nNew York Giants.\nFirst official use: 1911\nThe early entry of this team in 1883 was simply the New Yorks, also sometimes called the Gothams, \"Gotham\" being a synonym for New York City. According to legend, manager Jim Mutrie was bragging to newspaper reporters about the stature of his players, \"My big fellows! My giants!\" and by about 1885 the name was stuck on the team for good.\n\"Giants\" was one of the only team nicknames used with any frequency at all in 1886 newspaper writeups, and the only team nickname, \"period,\" found in Spalding's Official Guide for 1889. However, the team's official name, as printed on its scorecards, remained simply the New York Base Ball Club. Although the \"Giants\" nickname was well established, it wasn't endorsed by the franchise until they put it on the home programs for the 1911 World Series; the prosaic \"NEW YORK\" or simple block letters \"NY\" were used on uniform shirts until 1918 when \"GIANTS\" first appeared. (Okkonen)\nEventually the alternate nickname \"Jints\" (rhymes with \"pints\") was picked up as a colloquial pronunciation of the team name. It followed them, along with their real nickname \"Giants\", when they moved to the west coast in 1958.\nThe New York Giants of the NFL were named for the baseball team which was once their landlord. Even though the baseball Giants moved in 1958, the NFL team to this day displays a sign at MetLife Stadium proudly indicating that the team's official name remains the \"New York Football Giants.\"\nNew York Yankees.\nModern writers tend to refer to the New York AL club as the \"Highlanders\" for its 1903–1912 era and as the \"Yankees\" from 1913 onward. The two nicknames actually developed in parallel starting around 1904, with \"Highlanders\" initially more often used, and \"Yankees\" becoming the predominant nickname before \"Highlanders\" was fully dropped in 1913.\nInitially the team was simply the \"Greater New York Baseball Club\", a designation imposed on them as part of the \"deal\" allowing the Baltimore club to transfer to New York. Giants fans considered them to be \"Invaders\", and publisher William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Evening Journal\" initially referred to the new club by that name in 1903.\nBoth \"Highlanders\" and \"Yankees\" were also initially inventions of the press. The first president of the new New York American League entry was Joseph Gordon, who served from 1903 to 1906. There was a noted British military unit called The Gordon Highlanders. The new team built its new ballpark on a high point of Manhattan called \"The Hilltop\" (hence the informal nickname \"Hilltop Park\" for the American League Park), which contrasted especially with the altitude of the Giants, whose Polo Grounds was in the bottomland in the shadow of Coogan's Bluff. Creative members of the press, who liked to make artificial connections between disparate elements of popular culture, dubbed the team \"Gordon's Highlanders\" (e.g. New York \"World\", April 15, 1903), soon shortened to just \"Highlanders\", and the name stuck with them for the better part of a decade.\nThere is no evidence that \"Highlanders\" was ever officially adopted by the team itself. The uniforms only sported a large block \"N Y\", which eventually evolved into the well-known curving NY logo of the Yankees. (Okkonen)\nA prophetic letter to the editor of the New York \"Sun\", May 7, 1903, p. 8, raised this question: \"Name for the American New Yorks. If the new baseball team is to have a name that is in keeping with the 'Giants,' does it not seem reasonable that if they are the 'New York Americans' they might be called the 'Yankees' or 'Yanks'?\"\nThe alternate nickname \"Yankees\" first appeared regularly in the press in 1904. The term \"Yankee\" or \"Yank\" is a synonym for \"American\". The new team was in the American League, and the papers for cities with two teams (such as Boston) would often call their teams \"Nationals\" or \"Americans\" to distinguish them. The term \"Yankee\" was also in the news frequently at that time, especially with the success of George M. Cohan's Broadway musical, \"Little Johnny Jones\", and its centerpiece number, \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\". To the creative writers of the New York press, the connection was easy to make.\nOn April 7, , a spring training story from Richmond, Virginia carried the headline \"Yankees Will Start Home From South To-Day.\" The \"New York Evening Journal\" screamed: \"YANKEES BEAT BOSTON\".\n\"The Sporting Life\" for a game of April 4, 1905, discussing the acquisition of Hal Chase, referred to the team as the \"Americans\" and the \"Highlanders\" in the same writeup.\nAs the decade progressed, the nickname \"Yankees\" began to be used more and more often. \"The New York Times\" writeup about Cy Young's no-hitter of June 30, 1908, referred to the club exclusively as \"Yankees\" or \"Yanks\" throughout the article, with no mention at all of \"Highlanders\". The \"Times\" also consistently referred to the Hilltop by its formal name, \"the American League Park\". (\"The Complete Book of Baseball: A New York Times Scrapbook History\", Arno Press, Bobbs-Merrill, 1980, p. 8)\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" for a game of April 21, 1912, an exhibition between the two New York clubs, was headlined \"Giants wallop Yanks\", while in the article the teams were referred to as the \"Nationals\" and the \"Giants\"; and \"the American League team\", \"Americans\", and \"Highlanders\"; respectively.\n\"The New York Times\" for opening day 1912 reported that \"The Yankees presented a natty appearance in their new uniforms of white with black pin stripes.\"\nIn 1913, the American Leaguers left the Hilltop after ten years, and began what would become a ten-year sub-lease with the Giants at the Polo Grounds. At that point the term \"Highlanders\" made no logical sense, and was dropped by the press. The club was exclusively the \"Yankees\" from then onward.\nIt is uncertain exactly when the Yankees began referring to themselves by their popular nickname. By the time of Babe Ruth's arrival in 1920, the \"Yankees\" nickname was well established, but the name still did not appear on the uniforms. In fact, the Yankees have seldom carried their nickname on their uniforms. The only time was during 1927–1930, when the word \"YANKEES\" first appeared, in lieu of \"NEW YORK\" – on the \"road\" shirts. This was continued through the 1930 season, and then \"NEW YORK\" was restored to the road uniforms. (Okkonen) The name must have been considered 'official' at least by 1923, when the team named its new ballpark Yankee Stadium.\nThe popular and successful Yankees have acquired many other unofficial nicknames through the years, such as the \"Pinstripers\" for obvious reasons, and jokingly as the \"Evil Empire\", a term originally applied to the Soviet Union by President Ronald Reagan. Probably the longest-lasting unofficial nickname has been the \"Bronx Bombers\", which was applied many decades ago in reference to the Yankees' power hitting, dating back to the Ruth era. One early newspaper usage came in July 1928.\nOakland.\nThe Pacific Coast League entry was typically called the Oakland Oaks (PCL) and sometimes the Acorns as an unofficial variant.\nOakland A's.\nThe Oakland Athletics, who began in Philadelphia and resided in Kansas City for a few years, settled on the west coast in 1968. The nickname \"Athletics\" is among the oldest in baseball, dating to the early 1860s.\nPhiladelphia.\nAside from the enduring teams called the \"Athletics\" and the \"Phillies\", other professional teams in Philadelphia over the years included the Philadelphia White Stockings (also sometimes called the \"Pearls\" or even the \"Phillies\"), who played in the National Association in the early 1870s in direct competition with the A's; and the Keystone club of the one-year Union Association experiment in 1884.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nFirst official use: 1901\nIn the peak of the amateur era of baseball in the 1860s, the strongest team in the Quaker State was the Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia, or just \"Athletic\" for short. Prior to the early 1900s, this club was typically always listed in standings as \"Athletic\" rather than \"Philadelphia\". When called the \"Athletics\" it was the pluralized style of the day, just as the National League entry would have been called the \"Philadelphias\".\nAs early as 1866, the Athletics uniform shirts featured the stylized letter \"A\" that is still used by the team's nominal descendants today. The team had turned professional by the late 1860s, and continued playing through the first year of the National League in 1876, before disbanding.\nThe team name \"Athletic\" was revived by the American Association, and again by the charter Philadelphia entry in the American League in 1901.\nThe AL team was originally listed in the standings in the traditional way, \"Athletic\", but soon evolved into the \"Philadelphia Athletics\". Another enduring symbol of the team soon emerged:\nThe 1905 World Series pitted the Giants against the A's, and before the first game the A's captain presented a small white elephant toy to McGraw, photos capturing one of the few times McGraw was caught grinning.\nThat \"first of many flags\" characterization, first written about 1940, was from a time when the A's were still thought of as winners or at least contenders. The team's decline, from the mid-1930s clear into the mid-1960s, would result in the franchise being transferred twice. The elephant logo first appeared on uniforms in 1918, and evolved into a circus elephant of varying colors, depending on the trim chosen for the uniform in a given year.\nAs the team typically wore a stylized \"A\" on both their home and road shirts, and eventually on their caps, the nickname \"A's\" also arose. The first break with the \"A\" tradition came in 1920, when the team featured the elephant logo on shirts for the first time, displacing the \"A\", albeit in a dark blue. The elephant, worn as a badge of defiance following McGraw's remarks, had previously appeared on just the warmup weathers and then on the uniform sleeve. The elephant was changed to its titular white in 1924, and in 1928 the team went back to the traditional \"A\". (Okkonen)\nAfter owner Charles O. Finley moved the team to Oakland in 1968, he dropped \"Athletics\" and made \"A's\" the official team name. \"Athletics\" was restored in 1981.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\n\"They've been the Phillies ever since the team entered the National League in 1883.\" (TSNBBG).\n\"Phillies\" or \"Phils\" is a short form of \"Philadelphias\", in the style of the 19th century, when a city would be referred to by writers that way. The city itself is often called \"Philly\" for short. Other uses of that term include the Philly Cheesesteak and the popular Phillies Blunt cigar. \"Phillies'\" earliest appearance in the Spalding Guide was in 1894, in the context of \"Bostons,\" \"Chicagos\" etc.\nBob Carpenter acquired the Phillies in the late fall of 1943. The following spring, a new name, \"Blue Jays\", was selected in a fans' contest. (TSNBBG) This change never caught on with the general public, especially as the uniform shirts continued to say \"Phillies\", albeit with a blue jay shoulder patch. That experiment was dropped after a couple of years.\nIn 1900, the team's road shirts said \"PHILA\", a common abbreviation of \"Philadelphia\". The Phillies' uniforms otherwise carried only a simple block or stylized letter \"P\" for several decades. The first time the word \"Phillies\" appeared was 1933, in a script-style that has appeared frequently in the decades since then. 1942, the word \"Phils\" appeared on the road shirts and the block letter \"P\" re-appeared on the home shirts, just for the one season. The script \"Phillies\" continued until 1970 when, in anticipation of the move to Veterans Stadium, the team returned to a stylized letter \"P\" on their shirts. In 1992, the script \"Phillies\" was restored to the shirts. (Okkonen)\nPhoenix.\nPrior to its entrance to the Major Leagues, Phoenix used several different nicknames for its ball clubs. They were first known as the Phoenix Senators, then the Phoenix Giants after their big league affiliate, and lastly the Phoenix Firebirds, for the mythologic bird synonymous with the city's name.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nA Diamondback, specifically \"Crotalus atrox\", is a rattlesnake which is a very common sight in the Arizona desert and a fearsome symbol. The club adopted the symbol upon its formation in 1998. A baseball field is also called a \"diamond\". The team is often called the \"D-backs\" for short, and as of 2007 the team is wearing shirts that read \"D-backs\". On the left sleeve is a stylized \"db\" which forms the head of a snake.\nPittsburgh.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe original Pittsburgh club, formed in 1882, was in the then-separate city of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, across the Allegheny River northwest of downtown Pittsburgh. Thus the club was called \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and in the style of the day, the \"Alleghenys\" (note that it was \"not\" \"Alleghenies\"). The Alleghenys played in the American Association during 1882–1886, then transferred to the National League in 1887. However, out-of-town newspapers tended to list the team as \"Pittsburg\" (as it was often spelled at the time) rather than \"Allegheny.\" The club wore \"Pittsburgh\" (variously spelled with or without the final \"h\") on its uniforms by 1890, although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907.\nThe club was accused of \"pirating\" Lou Bierbauer in the Players' League settlement following the 1890 season, which led to their nickname. This fact is a detail of the larger story of what was happening in professional baseball around that time.\nIn 1888, baseball owners established rules to categorize players and pay them according to rank. Since the owners set the categories themselves, their new system at first lowered, and then eventually froze players salaries. Shortly before this, in 1885, John Montgomery Ward, a current Major League pitcher and Columbia Law School graduate, had founded the \"Brotherhood of Base Ball Players\" an association to protect and promote players interests. Baseball owners had instituted their new rules in the off-season without talking with the players, and this led to a rift between them and the players. Despite yearlong efforts to negotiate with the owners over these new restrictions on players, Ward could not get them to bargain or even recognize the Brotherhood. Players revolted and in 1890 they started a new league called the Players' League. The Players' League was spearheaded by Ward, who not only gained financial backers, but he also solicited star players to jump from the National League and American Association to the new league.\nWith three professional leagues competing, many in the same cities, there was not enough revenue to go around, and each league lost money. Although the Players' League's attendance was the best of the three leagues, it folded after one year. The financially hemorrhaging American Association folded one year later, and the National League absorbed four of its teams.\nIn 1890, Philadelphia Athletics players Lou Bierbauer and Harry Stovey had jumped to the Players' League. After the Players' League collapsed, through a clerical error the Athletics had failed to reserve Bierbauer's and Stovey's services. Pittsburgh signed Bierbauer and Stovey to contracts. The Athletics protested losing these players, and this led to an impartial Arbitration Board, which included American Association President Allen W. Thurman. The board ruled in Pittsburgh's favor. Despite the ruling, the Athletics still grumbled at the decision, and ridiculed their cross-state rivals by calling them \"Pirates\" for \"stealing\" their players. The \"Pirates\" tag stuck and the alliterative name was eventually adopted as Pittsburgh's official team nickname. The Spalding Guide was using \"Pirates\" occasionally by its 1894 edition. By the time of the 1903 World Series, the team (officially the Pittsburgh Athletic Company) was commonly known as \"Pirates\", and represented in cartoons by a pirate figure, although the club did not acknowledge it on their uniforms until 1912.\nAlternate nicknames such as \"Bucs\" or \"Buccos\", short for \"buccaneer\", have been used through the years. \"Buccaneer\" is typically used synonymously with \"pirate\", although historically \"buccaneer\" is a more specific term for pirates who operated in the Caribbean, especially along the Spanish Main coast.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL began as the Pittsburgh Pirates, in reference to the baseball team from which they rented Forbes Field in their early years. There was also a short-lived NHL entry from 1925 to 1930 called the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nSt. Louis.\nIn the National Association of 1875, St. Louis fielded two entries, called the St. Louis Brown Stockings (or Browns); and the St. Louis Red Stockings, (or Reds). The Reds did not survive the season. The Browns were better organized and were carried forward into the new National League in 1876. The club abandoned League ball after the 1877 season due to a betting scandal, but continued to play as an independent semipro team.\nThe St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association in 1884, and the NL in 1885–1886, continued the reddish color scheme during their brief tenure. For the 1886 season they wore uniforms sporting a large black diamond shape on the chest, and some reporters referred to them as the \"Black Diamonds\" that year. In 1887 they decamped for Indianapolis, where they played three losing seasons before folding.\nThe St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League of 1914–1915 were the only major league club in St. Louis that eschewed being named for a color.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe old Browns were bought by St. Louis grocery magnate Chris von der Ahe in 1882 and became a charter member of the American Association. The team continued with brown stockings and trim, and was one of the most successful in the AA's ten-year existence under the leadership of 1st baseman/captain Charles Comiskey, and was carried forward into the NL in 1892. In 1893 their jerseys were blazoned \"St. Louis Browns\" (in white, on navy blue uniforms; only their belts and socks were brown).\nIn 1899, the club decided it was time for a makeover. They rebuilt the stands at Robison Field after a fire; they stripped the Cleveland Spiders of their star players, hoping to take a major leap in the standings; and, according to most sources, changed their uniform color that year, from brown to red. The refreshed team was labeled the Perfectos by a perhaps over-optimistic press. The team jumped from twelfth to fifth, rather short of its lofty goal.\nThe team was also being called Cardinals by season's end. According to TSNBBG, it was William McHale, baseball writer for the \"St. Louis Republic\", who dubbed the red-trimmed team the St. Louis Cardinals. By 1900, that name was in universal usage, and they have been known by that nickname to this day.\nThe term \"Cardinal\" for both the bird and the color originated from the traditional vestments of the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe red-trimmed uniforms at first were only labeled \"ST. LOUIS\", on both home and road shirts, later replaced by the familiar interlocking \"StL\" logo. The word \"Cardinals\" first appeared on both home and road shirts in 1918. The term went from just being a color to also being a symbol in 1922, with the first incarnation of the two cardinal birds perched on a bat across the word \"Cardinals\". (Okkonen)\nThe synonym \"Redbirds\" and the abbreviation \"Cards\" are also in broad usage today.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL transferred from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960, and from St. Louis to Phoenix in 1988. The Football Cardinals were not named after the Baseball Cardinals, but for the same reason that the Baseball Cardinals acquired their name — from the color of their jerseys, which were originally hand-me-downs from the University of Chicago Maroons.\nSt. Louis Browns.\nThe nickname St. Louis Browns was revived in 1902 by the AL entry that transferred from Milwaukee. Moving from one major brewing city to another, they could have retained the nickname \"Brewers\", but for marketing reasons they chose to adopt the recently abandoned colors of their established rival.\nThe Browns were the better team in the Mound City for the first 25 years or so of their co-existence, but the Cardinals returned to winning form in the mid-1920s and the Browns struggled after that. The club was looking for a city to transfer to in the early 1950s. They considered coincidentally returning to their roots in Milwaukee, but the Braves beat them to it. They settled for a move to Baltimore in 1954, where they were renamed the \"Orioles\", ending the life of the \"Browns\" nickname.\nAlthough known from the beginning as the \"Browns\", and wearing brown trim most of the time (except for 1906 when they experimented with all-black trim), the club did not wear the word \"BROWNS\" on their shirts until 1934. (Okkonen) The team had various logos. In the early years they had an interlaced \"StL\", as with the Cardinals. In the 1930s, they began wearing a patch featuring an illustration of the famous statue of the royal Saint. In 1952 they began wearing a sleeve patch with a cartoon face of a \"Brownie\".\nThe Cleveland Browns of the NFL have no connection to the St. Louis Browns, although their color scheme (orange and brown) and their use of a \"Brownie\" coincide.\nSan Diego.\nSan Diego Padres.\nThe minor league team called the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League operated during 1936–1968. The name \"Padre\" was taken from the Spanish word for \"Father\", a term of respect used for Spanish missionaries; San Diego was founded as a mission by Franciscan friars. When Major League Baseball expanded to San Diego in 1969, the old nickname was retained for the new team.\nThe team is frequently called the \"Pads\" or \"Pods\" in the media, which rhymes with the first syllable of \"PAHD-rays\". \"Friars\" has also been a longtime team nickname.\nSan Francisco.\nThe San Francisco Seals operated from the inception of the Pacific Coast League in 1903 through 1957. The name \"Seals\" was revived by a professional hockey team in 1961 which eventually became the California Golden Seals before departing the Bay Area.\nA second, shorter-lived club was the Mission Reds, who played in San Francisco during 1925–1937. They were sometimes called the \"Missions\".\nSan Francisco Giants.\nThe well-established Seals, which had once been Joe DiMaggio's team, moved after the 1957 season to make way for the arrival of the New York Giants, who followed the Dodgers from the east coast. The San Francisco Giants have lived up to their name, with sluggers like Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Barry Bonds rocketing baseballs out of the San Francisco ballparks just as Mays and Mel Ott did in New York.\nSeattle.\nThe original Pacific Coast League minor league club in Seattle was initially called the Indians, due to the Native American legacy of the area. The team was later named the Seattle Rainiers, directly in reference to the Rainier Brewing Company, and indirectly in reference to Mount Rainier, for which the brewery was named. The Rainiers operated through 1968, when the major leagues expanded. After the one-year major league experiment, a new Rainiers ball club was formed and played during 1972–1976, when the majors were ready to try Seattle again. Since 1995, the Rainiers name has been used by the Seattle Mariners' Triple-A affiliate in nearby Tacoma.\nSeattle Pilots.\nThe AL expansion team in 1969 was named in reference to the prominence of marine activities in the Puget Sound area, primarily after ship pilots who guide large ships into the ports of Puget \nSound. The caps even featured the \"scrambled eggs\" golden-leaf symbol of a ship's captain. The ambitious but underfunded club sank in a sea of red ink, and became the first major league club since the 1901 Milwaukee Brewers to switch cities after one year. Ironically, the Pilots moved to Milwaukee, and became the new Milwaukee Brewers.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe AL again expanded to Seattle, in 1977, with the formation of the Seattle Mariners. The nickname again alluded to fishing and other marine activities. The Mariners have been in Seattle for over 40 years with no indications of leaving anytime soon.\nTampa Bay Area.\nSeveral minor league teams played in the Tampa Bay area prior to the introduction of the American League ball club in 1998. Named after the local cigar industry, the Tampa Smokers existed in several leagues from 1919 until 1954. Also bearing the Tampa city name were the Tampa Tarpons who existed from 1957 until 1988, and were named after the Atlantic-native fish. The St. Petersburg Saints, who were named as such because of their city name, played mostly in the Florida State League from 1920 until 1928 and again from 1947 until 2000.\nOther teams still exist in the area including a new iteration of the Tampa Tarpons and the Dunedin Blue Jays (named after their MLB affiliate), the Clearwater Threshers (after the thresher shark), the Bradenton Marauders (a nod to their MLB affiliate, the Pittsburgh Pirates), and the Lakeland Flying Tigers, who similarly named as a nod to their MLB affiliate, the Detroit Tigers.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays.\nThe club was an expansion franchise in the American League in 1998. The team's logo included an illustration of a manta ray, also called a devilfish or devil ray. The team was also called the D-rays or the Rays for short. As of 2007, one version of their home uniforms said \"Rays\", and no version said \"Devil Rays\", although a patch illustrating a manta ray was used. On November 8, 2007, the club announced that they were dropping the \"Devil\" part in order to identify themselves primarily with the rays of the sun, Florida being the Sunshine State, and their redesigned logo reflects that theme. As noted in the MLB article the club stated that they would continue using the manta ray patch as an acknowledgment of their previous identity – a feature easily visible on their uniforms in the super-closeups used by television in the 2008 World Series, as the former league doormats turned into the American League's champion team in 2008. The club would also retain its furry mascot, called \"Raymond\", strictly for humorous reasons, as that name has no etymological connection to either the old or the new usage of \"ray\".\nToronto.\nThe original minor league club in Toronto was the Toronto Maple Leafs, which operated from 1896 through 1967 in the International League.\nThe National Hockey League club renamed itself the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927 and has been known by that name ever since.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nBy the time the American League expanded to Toronto in 1977, the NHL club's strong identification as the Maple Leafs precluded any chance of reviving that name for the baseball team.\nThe Toronto franchise was originally owned by Labatt Breweries, with Imperial Trust and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as minority owners. The name \"Blue Jays\" came about in 1976, when the team held a \"name the team\" contest, which involved more than 4,000 suggestions. 154 people suggested the name \"Blue Jays\" and Dr. William Mills, a periodontist from Etobicoke, was selected from a draw as the grand winner. Mills stated that it was traditional for a Toronto-based sports team to have the colour blue as its primary colour and following the leads of the Baltimore Orioles and St. Louis Cardinals that the team be named after a bird. \nAlthough the team was officially named via the contest, another theory was that \"Blue Jays\" was chosen by majority owner Labatt Breweries—an apparent tie-in with its feature brand, Labatt Blue. (Labatt's sponsored broadcasts of the games, providing an on-air opportunity for TV commentators to take a microscopic pause when saying \"You're watching Labatt's Blue...Jays baseball on CBC.\") Many others have taken unofficial credit for the name: former Ontario Premier John Robarts, a member of the team's board of directors, claimed the name came to him as \"I was shaving this morning and I saw a blue jay out my window.\"\nCoincidentally, the nickname \"Blue Jays\" was used briefly by the Philadelphia Phillies (the team that Toronto beat in the 1993 World Series), from 1944 to 1945.\nThe short form \"Jays\" has been used extensively for much of the team's history.\nWashington, D.C..\nBaseball clubs in Washington, D.C. have been known by a variety of nicknames since the first professional teams appeared in 1870. One team was called the \"Olympics\", another was called the \"Nationals\". Both of those names persisted through the 1870s. Later teams in the 19th Century were called the \"Nationals\" and also obvious other Capital City nicknames such as \"Statesmen\" and \"Senators\". By the 1890s, \"Senators\" was commonly used in the media for the National League entry, and it appears in the 1894 Spalding Guide.\nWashington Nationals/Senators.\nThe \"Senators\" nickname carried over to the new American League entry in 1901. The team was generally called the Senators from 1901 to 1904, as the old National League club had been. \"Washington Star\" newspaper owner Thomas C. Noyes, along with an ownership group of Benjamin Minor, Harry Rapley and others bought the team in 1905.\nBefore the 1905 season, Noyes solicited fans and writers for a new nickname. In an effort to remarket the team Noyes decided to officially name the club the \"Nationals\", reverting to the older nickname.\nDuring 1905 and 1906, the team wore \"Nationals\" on their new shirts, the first team to wear a full team name. Otherwise, the shirts either read \"Washington\" or carried a plain block \"W\". (Okkonen)\nSome reluctance could have been due to the inherent ambiguity of the name. Writers frequently referred to individual major league teams as \"Americans\" or \"Nationals\" in reference to their league affiliation—and the Washington \"Nationals\" were in the \"American\" League.\nNewspaper articles for decades used the names \"Senators\" and \"Nationals\" (or \"Nats\") interchangeably, often within the same article. Baseball guides even said \"Nationals or Senators\" when listing the nickname. This was long before teams made nicknames registered trademarks for marketing purposes.\nThus the Washington ballclub was known by two nicknames for most of its history prior to moving to Minnesota. Although there have been other teams with dual nicknames, such as the Brooklyn \"Robins\"/\"Dodgers\", or the New York \"Highlanders\"/\"Yankees\", the longevity of this dual nickname was unique.\nThe nickname \"Senators\" was kept alive especially by out-of-town writers. World Series programs in the same year referred to the team by different names: In 1933, the programs for the games played in New York City advertised \"Giants vs. Senators\", while programs for the games played in Washington included a photo of Washington manager Joe Cronin with the caption \"Nationals' Manager\".\nAlthough \"Nationals\" or \"Nats\" was still used on baseball cards issued by Topps as late as 1956, by the 1950s, the name \"Nationals\" was pretty much passé. For example, the popular 1955 Broadway musical \"Damn Yankees\" referred to the club primarily, if not exclusively, as the \"Senators\".\nFollowing the 1956 season, owner Calvin Griffith decided to officially change the name to Senators, but it wasn't until 1959 that the word \"Senators\" finally appeared on their shirts. (Okkonen) They and their expansion-replacement in 1961 would remain officially the \"Senators\" for good, although space-saving headline writers continued to refer to them as \"Nats\" frequently.\nWashington Nationals.\nThe Washington Nationals of the National League, transplanted from the Montreal Expos in 2005, revived the old Nationals name, and with modern marketing techniques it appears the name will stick this time. The time-honored headline abbreviation \"Nats\" has also been revived. Any possibility of using the name \"Washington Senators\" was prohibited by the Texas Rangers still owning the rights to that trademark. Although there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators, political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise's \"official\" nickname used from 1905 to 1956. Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting representation in Congress. Although the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name, the Nationals were able to acquire the rights to the curly \"W\" from the Rangers.\nGeneral references.\nThese books about baseball parks also contain a lot of information about the minor league teams:\nReference books specific to one team's history are embedded."

        "text": "The San Gil climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa nicefori), also known as the San Gil mushroomtongue salamander, is a species of salamander belonging to the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Colombia, and its natural habitats are tropical highly humid forests; it has also been reported from a coffee plantation. The greatest threat posed to this species is habitat loss, however they are currently nowhere near the risk of extinction. The species' name honors Antoine Rouhaire (Brother Nicéforo María), a French naturalist who collected the species holotype.\nDescription.\n\"B. nicefori\" have webbed hands and feet with no ventral pads on their digits. They are reddish brown with irregular pale blotches dorsally and brown with irregular cream markings ventrally. They range in size from 29 to 77 mm SVL. Adult females are generally larger than males.\nHabitat.\nThe general habitat for \"B. nicefori\" consists of various locations throughout the East Andes of Colombia including the municipalities of Piedecuesta (Micro-cuenca La Venta, and Vereda la Amarillas) and Los Santos (Hacienda El Roble) in Santander department. They are found on the western slopes of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental between the elevations of 1400 m and 2400 m. This highly disturbed tropical forest habitat has an average rainfall per year of 1160 mm and an average temperature of 17.36 °C.\nThis species inhabits both arboreal and terrestrial sites. The majority of them (85%) have been found on herbaceous plants such as coffee plants of large plantations in Colombian municipalities. Preovulatory and pregnant females exclusively inhabit the leaf litter between January and March.\nDiet.\nTheir diet consists of a wide range of arthropods. Their most prominent prey are ants, beetles, and larval flies. In rare cases, small traces of vegetation have been found in their stomachs. They either actively hunt or 'sit and wait' to catch their prey. Overall their hunting has only a small effect on even their most prominent food source species.\nReproduction.\nMales of \"B. nicefori\" are capable of sexual activity year round, continually undergoing spermatogenesis. Females on the other hand reproduce seasonally between the dry months of April and June. \"Eggs are laid and brooded during the dry season, and hatchlings emerge during the rainy season when moisture is favorable to growth and dispersal.\" Climate, microhabitat, and availability and abundance of resources can all have an effect on this process. Females produce one clutch (eggs) per year, consisting of anywhere between 20-50 eggs, and matings occur around the same general time of egg-laying.\nThe population exhibits strong sexual dimorphism in body size between male and female \"B. nicefori\". Males reach a standard length of 29–50 mm at maturation, whereas females are considerably larger reaching a standard length of 39–75 mm. The overall time it takes for these salamanders to completely mature is thought to be approximately 6 years."

        "title": "Obsolete golf clubs",
        "text": "Early golf clubs were all made of wood. They were hand-crafted, often by the players themselves, and had no standard shape or form. As the sport of golf developed, a standard set of clubs began to take shape, with different clubs being fashioned to perform different tasks and hit various types of shot. Later, as more malleable iron became widely used for shorter-range clubs, an even wider variety of clubs became available.\nMany of the clubs manufactured between 1901 and 1935 came from Scotland, but more and more started coming from larger US manufacturers.\nThese early clubs had hickory shafts and wrapped leather grips. To secure the joins between the shaft and the head of the club, and between the grip and the shaft, whipping of black, waxed linen thread was used. Pre-1900 clubs (smooth-faced gutty era) used 7-ply thread. Clubs from the era 1900 to 1935 required 4-ply thread.\nFrom 1924 golf clubs started to be manufactured with shafts of steel, pyratone, aluminum, and fiberglass or resin; many of them were given a wood-look coating.\nWoods.\nWooden clubs generally had a metal base-plate and were made heavier with a lead insert into the back of the head; often the face of the club had an insert of bone or ivory to reduce the wear from impact on the wood.\nThey were:\nThese were made of wood and were used until they were replaced by the numbered system used today.\n20th century wood-shafted irons.\nThey were:\n\"Mashie\" is derived from French \"massue\", \"club\", while \"niblick\" is diminutive of , \"little nose.\"\n19th century irons.\nThe traditional set of irons was invented by Archibald Barrie, and was used from 1903 until about the 1940s. The introduction of the standardized numbered iron set produced by the Spalding Sporting Goods Company in the early 1930s caused the traditional set of irons to give way gradually to the numbered set.\nThe traditional irons varied greatly in loft (± 5°). The shape of the head determined some of the playing characteristics of the club; most traditional heads were roughly egg-shaped.\nSabbath sticks.\nSunday sticks or sabbath sticks were the golf enthusiast's answer to the Church of Scotland's discouragement of golfing on Sundays. Clubs were disguised as walking sticks, the club head comfortably fitting into the palm of the golfer's hand, until when the golfer was unobserved, the stick was reversed and a few strokes were played."

Beginning in 1988, the tournament was divided into two four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was made for broadcast television, with the final game on CBS on Saturday afternoon. CBS paid approximately $500,000 for the broadcasting rights to the championship game.\nThe end of CBS' coverage.\nIn 2003, the tournament was shifted entirely to cable on ESPN, which had begun covering all of the other games of the CWS since 1982 (and a partial schedule since 1980). The championship final became a best-of-three series between the two bracket winners, with games scheduled for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings.\nIn 2015, college baseball returned to CBS Sports in the form of a multi-year agreement between the American Athletic Conference and CBS Sports Network. Under the terms of the package, CBS Sports Network would air three Houston Baseball games in 2015, as well as the first two contests of the 2015 American Athletic Conference Baseball Championship. Carter Blackburn provided play-by-play for all seven games of the package, while analyst duties would be handled Darryl Hamilton and Ray King along with Brandon Tierney."

Captained by Ivo Bligh, the team was on a quest \"to recover those Ashes\", a reference to the famous RIP notice that was published in the aftermath of England's defeat by Australia at The Oval in the previous English season.\nOriginally, three matches were arranged between Bligh's XI and a Combined Australia XI. Bligh's XI won two of these after losing the first. Although the actual sequence of events has never been completely confirmed, it was after winning the third match that Bligh was somehow presented with a small urn which is believed to contain the ashes of a burnt bail. He brought this back to England and it is now the most famous exhibit in the museum at Lord's Cricket Ground. England and Australia have been contesting these mythical Ashes ever since. A. fourth match was arranged \"ad hoc\" after the original series had been completed, and was won by the Australians. Following publication of Clarence P. Moody's proposed Test cricket list in 1894, all four matches were retrospectively recognised as Test matches.\nTest matches.\nThese matches were not called Tests at the time but they were retrospectively recognised after they were included in \"Australian Cricket and Cricketers, 1856 to 1893–94\" (1894) by Clarence P. Moody. The original title of each match was Combined Australia XI v I. F. W. Bligh's XI.\nPlayers.\nEngland was captained by Ivo Bligh and had Edward Tylecote as its specialist wicket-keeper, the other players being Billy Bates, Dick Barlow, A. G. Steel, Charles Leslie, Walter Read, Charles Studd, Fred Morley, Billy Barnes, George Vernon and George Studd.\nAustralia was captained by Billy Murdoch and had Jack Blackham as wicket-keeper. Other players to represent Australia were Billy Midwinter, Alec Bannerman, George Bonnor, Tom Horan, Percy McDonnell, George Giffen, Harry Boyle, Edwin Evans, Hugh Massie, Eugene Palmer, Tom Garrett and Fred Spofforth.\nCeylon.\nThe team used Colombo as a stopover during its long sea voyage and played two matches against local sides in October 1882 that were not first-class. This was the first time that an overseas team visited Ceylon.\nOther matches in Australia.\nBesides the four against Combined Australia, Bligh's XI played in fourteen matches against colonial and club teams. Some of these were scheduled for two days' play, others for three days."

The game was held on Sunday, August 9, 1981, at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, the home of the Cleveland Indians of the American League. As of 2023, it is the only MLB All-Star Game that was played on a Sunday.\nThis was one of only two All-Star Games to be played outside the month of July (the other being the second 1959 game). The game was originally to be played on Tuesday, July 14, but was cancelled due to the players' strike lasting from June 12 to July 31. It was then brought back as a prelude to the second half of the season, which began the following day. At 72,086 people in attendance, it broke the stadium's own record of 69,751 set in 1954, setting the still-standing record for the highest attendance in an All Star Game.\nCleveland Stadium set a new All-Star Game record by hosting its fourth (and ultimately, final) Midsummer Classic. By the time Indians played host to the All-Star Game for the fifth time in 1997, they had moved to Progressive Field (then known as Jacobs Field), where they also hosted the 2019 game.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nThe American League started with four shutout innings, two apiece by starter Jack Morris and Len Barker. Meanwhile, Fernando Valenzuela, only the second rookie pitcher to start an All-Star Game, pitched a scoreless first with two strikeouts. The AL got on the board in the second when Ken Singleton homered off Tom Seaver.\nGary Carter broke the scoring drought for the NL and tied the game with a shot off Ken Forsch in the fifth. Dave Parker gave the senior circuit the lead with a homer in the sixth off Mike Norris.\nBurt Hooton came in for the NL in the AL-half of the sixth and promptly loaded the bases on three successive singles by Singleton, Dwight Evans, and Carlton Fisk. Fred Lynn lined another single, but only Singleton came home to tie it at 2-2. Buddy Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to give the AL a 3-2 lead. Eddie Murray then bounced what looked to be a double-play grounder to Steve Garvey at first, but Garvey's low throw combined with a great play by Ozzie Smith at second and a rolling slide by Lynn resulted in only a force at second. Fisk went to third and Ted Simmons singled him in to make it 4-2. Al Oliver then lifted a bloop fly ball to left that looked like it would drop, but Dusty Baker hustled in and made a sliding catch for the third out, saving a run and possibly more.\nIn the seventh, Carter got one of the runs back with his second homer, this one off Ron Davis. Then, in the eighth, Rollie Fingers walked Ozzie Smith. Smith stole second and attempted to take third when Bo Díaz' throw went into center field. Dave Winfield hustled the ball back to the infield and Smith was caught in a rundown and tagged out by Fingers. Mike Easler walked and Mike Schmidt homered off Fingers to give the National League their winning runs."

Batsmen can get out in six different ways, including being bowled out, or being \"caught out\" by hitting the ball near the symbolic fielders.\nRuns are scored by hitting the ball into designated side panel areas for 2, 4 or 6 (maximum) runs. Wide balls are penalized with 4 runs to the batting team.\nInfrastructure.\nThe indoor game is played in England, Australia and South Africa. The England and Wales Cricket Board presides over an annual national tournament funded and organized by the charity Lord's Taverners - the Lord's Taverners National Table Cricket Competition, based on 10 regional tournaments, with the final being played at the Indoor Cricket School, Lord's Cricket Ground. The 2006 finals were attended by the Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar.\nThe recreational table top game.\nThe recreational table top cricket game was made popular by a British table top game manufacturer \nSubbuteo from the 1960s, which has inspired numerous versions and clones over the years. The goals of the game are the same as that of cricket. It was developed by the table top game entrepreneur Peter Adolph, being marketed as early as 1949.\nEquipment.\nThe batsman and bowler are spring loading equipment where the direction and speed of the ball, power, timing and positioning of the batsman's shot can be controlled. The ball is a small metal ball-bearing. The playing field is typically a large green sheet or carpet of cloth which is laid out on the table, and on which the game is played. The playing field has demarcations for the pitch, as well as zones of 1,2,3 and 4 runs. 10 fielders - besides the bowler - with ball-channeling mouths at the base of the miniature statuettes can be placed on the field.\nRules.\nThe bowler pre-sets the location of the bowling mechanism at the edge of the pitch. The bowler loads the ball onto the release mechanism (spring or gravity controlled), whereupon the ball rolls towards the batsman. The batsman has to pre-set the angle of the face of the bat shown, and the location of the batting mechanism. He controls the power and timing of the shot in real time. After hitting the bat, the ball may roll and rest in one of the marked run zones on the playing carpet (in which case the batsman obtains runs), or be channelled into the base of a fielder's statuette (in which case the batsman is deemed out caught). The batsman could also be out bowled (inc. played on) or hit wicket. Wides and byes may also be scored."

        "text": "James William Anderson (December 1, 1930 – March 10, 2013) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and head coach. Anderson played 7 games with the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL), and was the first head coach of the Washington Capitals. He was born in Pembroke, Ontario.\nPlaying career.\nJim Anderson spent the majority of his 16-year minor league career with the Springfield Indians franchise of the AHL, and remains the all-time leader in games played, goals and points for the franchise. In his first season with Springfield, Anderson scored 39 goals and was awarded the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award as AHL rookie of the year in 1954–55. In the early 1960s, Anderson scored 35 or more goals for Springfield for five straight years, helping lead the team to three consecutive Calder Cup championships, to this day the only AHL franchise to win three straight. In 1960–61, Anderson was named an AHL Second Team All-Star, scoring 81 points (the most of his career) with a league-leading 43 goals. The 40 goals he scored in 1963–64 earned him the Willie Marshall Award as the AHL's leading goal scorer, and also led again to be named a Second Team All-Star.\nIn the 1967–68 season, the National Hockey League expanded to twelve teams, and the new Los Angeles Kings took over the Springfield franchise as their top minor league affiliate, rebranding them as the Springfield Kings. That season, Anderson finally made his first NHL appearance with the parent Kings, playing in 7 games, and scoring 1 goal and 2 assists.\nAnderson's AHL career concluded with 426 goals and 821 points in 943 games, at the time in the top five all-time in each category in the AHL. As of the 2015 season, he remains 11th all-time in games played, fifth in goals scored and ninth in points scored.\nCoaching career.\nAnderson was twice Springfield's head coach (1969-70 and 1975-76), and was the first head coach in the history of the NHL's Washington Capitals. After being replaced mid-season by George Sullivan, Anderson became a professional scout for the Los Angeles Kings' organization for 19 years.\nIn November 2008, Anderson's career was recognized with induction into the fourth class (2009) of the AHL Hall of Fame. He continued to make his off-season home in the Springfield area, and after retirement was a local skating instructor until shortly before his death."

        "text": "Bobby Ray Franklin (born October 5, 1936) is a former American football player and coach. He played college football as a quarterback at the University of Mississippi and professionally as a safety in the National Football League (NFL) with the Cleveland Browns. Franklin served as the head football coach at Northwest Mississippi Community College from 1981 to 2004, leading his teams to NJCAA National Football Championships in 1982 and 1992. He has been named to seven Halls of Fame for his athletic and coaching accomplishments.\nAfter retiring as a player, he coached at [Georgia Tech]] and then became the defensive backs and special teams for the Dallas Cowboys from 1968 to 1972. He later coached for the Baltimore Colts and scouted for the Seattle Seahawks.\nEarly years.\nFranklin was a four-sport letterman at Clarksdale High School in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was also named All-State, All-Southern Team and All America.\nFranklin was recruited by both Mississippi State and Ole Miss. After initially committing to play at Mississippi State, he ultimately chose Ole Miss and was provided a full scholarship, attending the school from 1956 through 1960. He starred at quarterback for the Rebels, and led the team to three consecutive bowl game appearances. He was chosen MVP in the 1958 Gator Bowl in which his team defeated the Florida Gators 7-3. He was also named the MVP in the 1960 Sugar Bowl, throwing two touchdown passes in a 21-0 victory as the second-ranked Rebels defeated defending national champion and third-ranked LSU. Franklin had been injured earlier in the season and had been replaced in the lineup by Jake Gibbs. LSU had defeated the Rebels in an October 31 regular season game 7-3 with the only touchdown scored on Billy Cannon's famous \"Halloween Run\" punt return.\nWhile Gibbs passed for one touchdown in the Sugar Bowl game, Franklin led the attack, completing 10 of 15 passes for 146 yards. The team was named NCAA national champions by various selection committees.\nProfessional playing career.\nCleveland Browns.\nFranklin was an 11th round selection by the Cleveland Browns in the 1960 NFL Draft, and was also selected by the Los Angeles Chargers of the newly-formed American Football League (AFL). The Browns also selected Ole Miss teammates Johnny Brewer in the fourth round and offensive lineman/placekicker Robert Khayat in the sixth round. Brewer played for the Browns until 1967 as a tight end and linebacker. Khayat never played for the Browns as he was packaged with offensive tackle Fran O'Brien in an April 1960 trade with the Washington Redskins for running back/placekicker Sam Baker. Khayat played for Washington through 1963, primarily as a placekicker. He achieved greater fame by returning to the University of Mississippi in 1995 as its 15th Chancellor.\nIn joining the Browns, Franklin was reunited with former Ole Miss teammate, guard Gene Hickerson, drafted by the Browns in 1957. The two became lifelong friends and Franklin delivered the presenting speech on behalf of Hickerson when the latter was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Hickerson, suffering from dementia, was unable to make his own acceptance speech.\nThe Browns utilized Franklin in the defensive backfield, where he played right safety. Prior to joining the team as rookie, he played in the 1960 College All-Star Game. Franklin led the Browns with eight interceptions in 1960, finishing fourth in the league. Three of those came in a single game, and two were returned for touchdowns of 31 and 37 yards in a 42-0 victory over the Chicago Bears on December 11, a day in which the Browns intercepted seven passes in handing the Bears their worst defeat ever. The two touchdown returns stood as a single game team record until David Bowens repeated the feat in 2010.\nIn 1961, the Browns employed Franklin as a kickoff specialist in addition to his defensive duties.\nFranklin, who also served as the holder for field goals and extra points at Ole Miss, performed the same duties throughout his years with Cleveland, teaming with kickers Baker (1960) and Hall of Famer Lou Groza (1961-1966). In his rookie season, he scored the game's first touchdown with a 19-yard run on a fake field goal in the Browns' final exhibition game, a 14-10 home victory over the Detroit Lions. He repeated the feat in a 1961 league game against the St. Louis Cardinals, going 12 yards to score in a 21-0 victory.\nHe was a member of the 1964 world's championship Browns team that defeated the Baltimore Colts, 27-0 and paired with Groza for three extra points and two field goals in the game. Franklin, who served as Cleveland's backup punter throughout his career with the team, punted four times for the Browns in 1965 and appeared in that season's championship game against the Green Bay Packers, which the Browns lost, 23-12.\nExposed by the Browns in the 1966 NFL Expansion Draft to stock the new Atlanta Falcons franchise, Franklin was selected along with teammates Larry Benz and Dale Memmelaar. Released by Atlanta prior to the start of the regular season, Franklin joined Georgia Tech as a freshman coach. He rejoined the Browns in late September. He remained with the team through the rest of the season after which he announced his retirement to rejoin the coaching staff at Georgia Tech.\nCoaching career.\nNFL.\nIn 1968, Franklin joined the Dallas Cowboys coaching staff under Tom Landry, serving as defensive backfield coach for four seasons, from 1968 to 1971, and as special teams coach in 1972. He coached in Super Bowl V and Super Bowl VI, earning his second NFL Championship ring in the second game.\nFranklin served as the defensive backfield coach of the Baltimore Colts for the 1973 season and scouted for the Seattle Seahawks from 1980 to 1985.\nNorthwest Mississippi.\nFranklin purchased Best Dollar Store in Tunica, Mississippi and operated it as Bobby Franklin's Dollar Store for three years before accepting an offer to join the coaching staff of Northwest Mississippi Community College in 1979. He served as offensive coordinator for two seasons under head coach Ray Poole. He was named head coach in 1981, a post he held for 24 years, leading the Rangers to eight bowl games, finishing with a record of 201–57–6 before retiring after the 2004 season. Under Franklin, the team won the NJCAA National Football Championship in 1982 and 1992 and was runner-up in 1991. As head coach, Franklin helped to develop 35 players who went on to have careers in the NFL or the Canadian Football League (NFL). Franklin was named to the school's Hall of Fame in 2003. The school named its football stadium Bobby Franklin Field in tribute to Franklin in 2005.\nHonors.\nFranklin has been named to seven halls of fame:"

He later would be inducted in the International League Hall of Fame.\nWilson entered the majors late in the year with the New York Yankees, playing for them in part of two seasons before being traded along with Jackie Jensen and Spec Shea to the Washington Senators in the same transaction that brought Irv Noren to the Yankees. His stay in Washington was brief because he was sent to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Ken Wood.\nIn a 51-game Major League career, Wilson was a .221 hitter (31-for-140) with nine runs, five doubles, three triples, and 17 RBI without any home runs. After his Major League career, he returned to the minor leagues, where he played until 1962, including seven seasons for Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs.\nWilson died in Decatur, Alabama, at the age of 83."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 2000 Summer Olympics took place on 19–20 September at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre in Sydney, Australia. There were 73 competitors from 66 nations. Nations have been limited to two swimmers each since the 1984 Games.\nSummary.\nNetherlands' Pieter van den Hoogenband stormed home on the final length to claim his second Olympic gold medal at these Games. He posted a time of 48.30 to hold off Russia's defending Olympic champion Alexander Popov by almost two-fifths of a second (0.40). It was the Netherlands' first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle. Failing to attain a third straight triumph in the same event, Popov settled for the silver in 48.69. Popov became only the second man to win three medals in the 100 metre freestyle, the first since Duke Kahanamoku in 1912–1924. Meanwhile, U.S. swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. took bronze with a 48.73 time. Hall was the 11th man to win two medals in the event.\nAfter breaking a split world record in the 4×100 m freestyle relay on the opening night, Australia's overwhelming favorite Michael Klim missed out the podium in a close race against Hall by a hundredth of a second, finishing with a time of 48.74. Klim was followed in fifth by Hall's teammate Neil Walker (49.09), and in sixth by Sweden's three-time Olympian Lars Frölander (49.22). Russia's Denis Pimankov (49.36) and another Aussie Chris Fydler (49.44) rounded out the finale.\nEarlier in the semifinals, Van den Hoogenband cleared a 48-second barrier to set a new world record of 47.84, slashing 0.34 seconds off the mark set by Klim from the relay.\nOne of the most popular highlights in the event took place in the first heat. Dubbed as \"Eric the Eel\", Equatorial Guinea's Eric Moussambani received a dubious honor of being the slowest Olympic swimmer in history. Two other swimmers, Niger's Karim Bare and Tajikistan's Farkhod Oripov, plunged into the pool and were cast out of the race under a no false-start rule, leaving Moussambani as the last man standing. Cheered by a large crowd, he finished a one-man heat in 1:52.72, nearly seven seconds slower than a winning time by Van den Hoogenband over double the distance a day before.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nSeven of the eight finalists from the 1996 Games returned: two-time gold medalist Alexander Popov of Russia, silver medalist Gary Hall, Jr. of the United States, bronze medalist (and 1992 silver medalist) Gustavo Borges of Brazil, fourth-place finisher Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, fifth-place finisher Fernando Scherer of Brazil, sixth-place finisher Pavlo Khnykin of Ukraine, and eighth-place finisher Francisco Sánchez of Venezuela.\nPopov had recovered from a near-fatal stabbing in 1996 to win the 1997 European championship and repeat as world champion in 1998. His 1994 world record had stood until the start of the Games; in the freestyle relays, however, hometown hopeful Michael Klim (the 1998 world championship runner-up) had broken that record with his first leg split. Van den Hoogenband won the 200 metre freestyle earlier in Sydney.\nThe Republic of the Congo, the Czech Republic, Equatorial Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Mongolia, Niger, Nigeria, Slovenia, and Tajikistan each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 22nd appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition returned to the three-round format used from 1948 to 1980, abandoning the A/B final format used between 1984 and 1996. The competition consisted of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The swimmers with the best 16 times in the heats advanced to the semifinals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties for advancement to the next round.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nPieter van den Hoogenband set a new world record of 47.84 seconds in the second semifinal."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 2000 Summer Olympics took place on 17–18 September at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre in Sydney, Australia. There were 51 competitors from 44 nations, with each nation having up to two swimmers (a limit in place since 1984).\nDutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband edged out Australia's top favorite Ian Thorpe on the final lap to claim a gold medal in the event. Stunning a massive home crowd, he touched the wall first in 1:45.35 to match his own world record from the semifinals. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe ended up only with a silver in 1:45.83, while Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino added a bronze to his hardware from the 400 m freestyle in a time 1:46.65. The medals were the first in the men's 200 metre freestyle for both the Netherlands and Italy.\nU.S. swimmer Josh Davis missed the podium by six hundredths of a second (0.06), finishing with a new American record of 1:46.73. Davis was followed in fifth and sixth by British duo Paul Palmer (1:47.95) and James Salter (1:48.74). Canada's Rick Say (1:48.76) and another Aussie Grant Hackett (1:49.46) closed out the field.\nEarlier in the semifinals, Van den Hoogenband blasted a new world record of 1:45.35, slashing 0.16 seconds off the mark set by Thorpe from the Australian trials. One heat later, Thorpe powered home with a second-fastest time of 1:45.37, but missed taking the record back by two hundredths of a second (0.02). He also erased Yevgeny Sadovyi's 1992 Olympic record by 0.14 seconds to pick up a top seed from the prelims (1:46.56).\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nFour of the 8 finalists from the 1996 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, sixth-place finisher Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy, seventh-place finisher Josh Davis of the United States, and eighth-place finisher Paul Palmer of Great Britain. Rosolino had taken silver at the 1998 World Championships, with van den Hoogenband bronze. Australia's Michael Klim had won those World Championships, but the Australian team in Sydney was Grant Hackett and world record holder and home country favourite Ian Thorpe.\nAndorra, Belarus, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, India, Lithuania, and Trinidad and Tobago each made their debut in the event. Australia made its 11th appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition altered the format that had been used since 1984. The tournament expanded to three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. Instead of having the top 16 swimmers divided into a Final A for the top 8 and Final B for 9th through 16th, as was done in from 1984 to 1996, the 2000 competition added semifinals. The top 16 swimmers from the heats competed in the new semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final (there was no longer a classification final for 9th through 16th). Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe top 16 across all heats advanced to the semifinals."

Cheered by a massive home crowd and rocketed to the chants of \"Thorpie\" by his swimming fans, Thorpe maintained a strong lead from start to finish before hitting the wall first in a new world record of 3:40.59.\nMassimiliano Rosolino earned a silver medal for Italy in a European record of 3:43.40, finishing almost three seconds behind Thorpe. Meanwhile, U.S. swimmer Klete Keller (another 17-year-old) stormed home from last place in the 200 m lap to wrest a bronze in 3:47.00, an American record, edging out Rosolino's teammate Emiliano Brembilla (3:47.01) by a hundredth of a second (0.01).\nRomania's Dragoș Coman finished fifth with a national record of 3:47.38, and was followed in the sixth spot by another U.S. swimmer Chad Carvin in 3:47.58.

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 2000 Summer Olympics took place on 20–21 September at the Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre in Sydney, Australia. There were 45 competitors from 38 nations. Each nation had been limited to two swimmers in the event since 1984. The event was won by Lenny Krayzelburg of the United States, with his countryman Aaron Peirsol taking silver. It was the second consecutive Games that Americans had finished one-two in the event (Brad Bridgewater and Tripp Schwenk had done so in 1996). Bronze went to Matt Welsh of Australia, the nation's first medal in the event since 1980.\nSoviet-born American Krayzelburg became the fourth swimmer in Olympic history to strike a backstroke double, since Roland Matthes did so in 1968 and 1972, John Naber in 1976, and Rick Carey in 1984. He powered past his nearest rivals Peirsol and Australia's overwhelming favorite Welsh to hit the wall first in a new Olympic record of 1:56.76. At only 17 years of age, Peirsol trailed behind by over half a second (0.59) to take a silver in 1:57.35. Meanwhile, Welsh settled only for the bronze in an Oceanian record of 1:57.59.\nIceland's Örn Arnarson came up with a spectacular swim to earn a fourth spot in 1:59.00, holding off Italy's Emanuele Merisi (1:59.01), bronze medalist in Atlanta four years earlier, by a hundredth of a second (0.01). Romania's Răzvan Florea finished sixth with a time of 1:59.05, while Brazil's Rogério Romero (1:59.27), competing at his fourth Olympics, and Croatia's Gordan Kožulj (1:59.38) closed out the field. For the first time in Olympic history, all eight swimmers went under a two-minute barrier.\nEarlier, Krayzelburg established a new Olympic standard of 1:58.40 on the morning prelims to cut off Martin López-Zubero's eight-year record by seven hundredths of a second (0.07). He lowered it to 1:57.27 in the semifinals.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1996 Games returned: bronze medalist Emanuele Merisi of Italy and seventh-place finisher Mirko Mazzari of Italy. The medalists at the 1998 World Aquatics Championships had been Lenny Krayzelburg of the United States, Ralf Braun of Germany, and Mark Versfeld of Canada. Krazyelburg and Braun were competing in Sydney; Versfeld was not.\nThe Dominican Republic, Kyrgyzstan, Slovenia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their 10th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition altered the format that had been used since 1984. The tournament expanded to three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. Instead of having the top 16 swimmers divided into a Final A for the top 8 and Final B for 9th through 16th, as was done in from 1984 to 1996, the 2000 competition added semifinals. The top 16 swimmers from the heats competed in the new semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final (there was no longer a classification final for 9th through 16th). Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition, with Krayzelburg setting a new Olympic record each time he swam. All three medalists swam faster than the old Olympic record.\nSchedule.\nThe expansion of the event to three rounds also resulted in the event now taking place over two days instead of a single day.\nResults.\nHeats.\nKrayzelburg had the fastest time in the heats, setting a new Olympic record."

He maintained a lead from start to finish and posted a European record of 2:10.87, the second-fastest of all time, making him the first ever swimmer in Olympic history to strike a breaststroke double. South Africa's Terence Parkin, a deaf mute since birth, enjoyed the race of his life to take a silver medal in an African record of 2:12.50. Fioravanti's fellowman Davide Rummolo gave Italy a further reason to celebrate, as he powered home with the bronze in 2:12.73.\nAcknowledging a massive cheer from the home crowd, Australia's Regan Harrison swam his lifetime best, but finished outside the podium by 15-hundredths of a second in 2:12.88. Czech Republic's Daniel Málek pulled off a fifth-place finish in a national record of 2:13.20, while Kyle Salyards, the only U.S. swimmer in the final, earned a sixth spot with a time of 2:13.27. France's Yohann Bernard (2:13.31) and another Aussie Ryan Mitchell (2:14.00) rounded out the finale. Notable swimmers failed to reach the top 8 final, featuring Hungary's Norbert Rózsa, the defending Olympic champion, who placed thirteenth (2:14.67), and Canada's Morgan Knabe, who had the fastest 100-metre split, but faded badly on the final lap to place tenth (2:14.01).\nShortly before the next Olympics, Fioravanti was forced to retire from swimming after failing a routine medical test carried by the Italian National Olympic Committee.

        "title": "Climbing mantella",
        "text": "The climbing mantella (Mantella laevigata) is a species of diurnal poison frog of the genus \"Mantella\" that resides in the subtropical regions of northeast Madagascar. Although it spends a significant amount of time in trees or bamboo forests, this frog species is not fully arboreal and actively seeks areas with a water source.\nLike others in the \"Mantella\" genus, the climbing mantella has aposematic coloration, which warns predators of its toxic secretions. The lipophilic alkaloids, the building blocks of the poison, are derived from dietary arthropods. The climbing mantella consumes a variety of small insects, and its diet changes dramatically with varying seasons.\nClimbing mantella engage in unique reproductive behaviors that revolve around arboreal oviposition sites. Males compete with one another over the shallow pools of water where females lay their eggs. Climbing mantella exhibit a high degree of parental care, which is unusual among frogs. \nDescription.\nConsidered a small frog, adult climbing mantella range from and weigh . Like other poison frogs, the climbing mantella is brightly colored. The anterior portion of its back is bright yellow or pale green. The arms, legs, abdomen, and posterior are black, with blue spots on the limbs. Its eyes are completely black. The climbing mantella has discs at the tip of its fingers and toes, which are webbed. The males are slightly smaller than the females, but it is difficult to identify the frog's sex using physical characteristics. Males are best recognized by their mating calls.\nSpecies that resemble this frog are \"M. betsileo\", \"M. viridis\", and \"M. expectata\"; however, these frogs are differently colored and often have blue spots on their throats rather than limbs. Unlike the climbing mantella, these species have a faint line running along their upper lip. \nHabitat and distribution.\nThe climbing mantella is found in the northeast coastal region of Madagascar in lowland rainforests and bamboo groves. This species can be found in several protected areas of Madagascar, including Mananara-Nord National Park, Marojejy National Park, Masoala National Park, Nosy Mangabe Special Reserve, and Betampona Natural Reserve. The favorable humidity level is 80% to 100%. Climbing mantella can withstand a temperature range, which is relatively large compared to other amphibian species. However, the most suitable temperature level is .\nConservation.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) listed the climbing mantella as least concern in 2016, due to its wide geographical distribution and presumed large population. The IUCN Red List previously listed it as near-threatened in 2004 and 2008.\nDespite its listing, the climbing mantella population is suspected to be decreasing. Regions of Madagascar outside of protected reserves are at increased risk of deforestation. Greater demand for cattle grazing areas, farmland, and space to build cities may jeopardize the climbing mantella’s natural habitat. Currently, the international pet trade levels for this frog species do not present a serious threat to the population, though continued trade regulation is necessary to maintain local populations of climbing mantella.\nTaxonomy.\nThe climbing mantella belongs to the family Mantellidae and the genus \"Mantella\". Mantellidae are endemic to the islands of Madagascar and Mayotte. The climbing mantella's closest relative is likely the green mantella (\"M. viridis\"). \nDiet.\nClimbing mantella eat ants, insect larvae, mites, and other insects. Unlike similar frogs from the family Dendrobatidae, the climbing mantella is not an ant specialist; its food consumption volume and diet composition vary dramatically based on seasonality. Climbing mantella do not seem to prefer a specific type of prey and consume whatever is readily available in leaf litter.\nAnts comprise approximately 84% of the frog’s diet during the dry season, but only 35% during the wet season. Over half of all consumed ants were of the genus \"Pheidole\". During the dry season, climbing mantella consume approximately 44% more in absolute volume compared to the wet season. Overall, climbing mantella have a more varied diet during the wet season. Wet-season frogs consume significantly more insect larvae, mites, and other arthropods (including spiders and small beetles) compared to dry season counterparts. Diet shifts may be a result of varying prey availability during seasons, rather than specific behavioral changes.\nClimbing mantella tadpoles will consume unfertilized or fertilized eggs of their own species. Tadpoles are only known to consume conspecific eggs, and ignore mosquitoes or other small arthropod larvae.\nMating.\nMale-male competition.\nMales compete with one another for territory. Fighting bouts over territory take the form of wrestling, chasing, and leaping. These conflicts last anywhere from 10 seconds to over 1.5 hours. The resident male, usually the aggressor, typically wins the fight. When not in their own territory, male frogs will infrequently invade the territory of other males, hoping to mate with more females. On rare occasions, the intruder can convince females to mate in a well possessed by another male. If the territory resident discovers the intruder, the intruder can either initiate a fighting bout or submissively yield to amplexus. Resident males will not attempt to mate with an unresponsive frog, and the resident will leave the submitted invader after a couple of minutes.\nFemale-male interactions.\nAlthough it is the only semi-arboreal member of the \"Mantella\" genus, the forest environment plays an important role in the climbing mantella’s reproductive behavior. Males are highly territorial, claiming a given area of approximately . Each territory contains at least one water-filled well (phytotelmata; often found in tree holes or broken bamboo stalks), and male frogs defend these possible oviposition sites from their rivals. Male climbing mantella choose wells based on the presence of crane flies, which prey on frog eggs, and other frog species. A greater amount of crane flies and other frog species correlates to a less desirable well. \nFemale frogs will approach male frogs who advertise their territory with a two-tone call. Female frogs are either mute or have weak calls. Upon hearing the mating calls, female frogs will approach the well occupied by males. The male frog adopts a softer single-note courtship call, and the female frog proceeds to judge the well. The mating calls only attract female frogs to the male’s territory, and have no bearing on mate selection. Instead, mate selection from the perspective of the female is entirely based on the quality of the male’s well. Female frogs frequently abandon a male frog after inspecting the location. Thus, well sites are a limiting resource. The most desirable well sites often have eggs from multiple different mating pairs. The climbing mantella is the only member of the \"Mantella\" genus to use phytotelmata for breeding purposes.\nParental care.\nEgg-laying.\nClimbing mantella usually only lay one large egg (), characteristics common among frogs with a high degree of parental care. Female frogs lay their eggs at the side of wells or above the water line, exhibiting a form of terrestrial oviposition–another indicator of high parental investment. The climbing mantella is the only member of the genus \"Mantella\" where parent frogs care for oophagous tadpoles.\nSite selection for egg-laying.\nFemale climbing mantella engage in trophic egg laying, and care for their young by feeding them their unfertilized eggs (a behavior known as oophagy). When engaging in maternal care, female frogs ignore male mating calls and climb wells alone, depositing their unfertilized eggs at or below the water line in the well. The tadpole that resides in the well will then consume the trophic eggs. It is believed that maternal care is not obligatory, depending more on circumstance and environment than natural behavior.\nTerritory defense as paternal care.\nMale territorial defense is also considered a form of paternal care. The presence of a male climbing mantella in a well dissuades other species of frogs (esp. \"Plethodontohyla notostica\" and \"Anodonthyla boulengeri\") from laying their eggs there. It is also possible that male frogs discourage land crabs, which have been observed from eating climbing mantella eggs, from entering wells.\nMales also engage in parental care considered to be reproductive parasitism. If a male possesses a desirable well containing one of his offspring, he will always benefit: a male’s reproductive success increases with each reproductive event, because it either produces another one of his offspring or results in the creation of a new egg that will feed his existing offspring. Thus, males will often take females to wells that already contain their developing eggs or tadpoles.\nReproductive parasitism.\nBoth male and female frogs contribute to the tadpole’s sole diet of conspecific eggs. Female frogs will lay unfertilized eggs into wells that contain their offspring. Male frogs exhibit a form of reproductive parasitism by luring female frogs to wells that often contain offspring only belonging to the male. Any fertilized egg resulting from the courtship subsequently serves as food for tadpoles that are only related to the male. Female frogs develop mechanisms to defend themselves against parasitism and avoid laying their eggs in wells containing other tadpoles. In response, tadpoles evolve ways to evade detection by females.\nDefense.\nThe evolution of chemical defense in members of the genus \"Mantella\" (including the climbing mantella) is an exceptional example of convergent evolution. Dendrobatidae and \"Mantella\" have developed similar behavioral and physiological adaptations, despite being relatively unrelated.\nPoisonous lipophilic alkaloids stored in skin glands are the effective defensive chemicals. 41 different potent alkaloids have been found in climbing mantellas' skin. Captive frogs lose their toxicity over time, indicating that the climbing mantella’s wild diet of arthropods contains the chemicals needed to construct the alkaloids. Alkaloids are retained in frogs for long periods of time, and thus the link between seasonality and alkaloid composition is still unclear. While some researchers have found that seasonality plays a significant role in the absence or presence of alkaloids, other studies show that this did not lead to dramatic changes in climbing mantellas' overall alkaloid profile."

The riders were divided into teams based on the region of Italy they were from. The calculation of the standings was the same for the team classification. At the end of the race, a trophy was awarded to the winning team and it was then stored at the Federal Secretary of the P.N.P. in their respective province.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

Nations were limited to 4 pairs (8 players) each. The event was won by South African team Harold Kitson and Charles Winslow, defeating Austrians Felix Pipes and Arthur Zborzil in the final. It was the first medal in the event for both nations. France earned its first men's double since 1900 as Albert Canet and Édouard Mény de Marangue defeated Jaroslav Just and Ladislav Žemla of Bohemia in the bronze-medal match.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the men's doubles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. A demonstration event was held in 1968. 1912 was the second and last time an indoor version was held concurrently.\nThe British brothers Laurence Doherty and Reginald Doherty had been dominant for the late 1890s and early 1900s, winning the 1900 Olympic championship and eight consecutive Wimbledon titles. Both had retired by 1912, however, and there was no dominant doubles team.\nThe 1908 Official Report's recommendation to schedule Olympic tennis not so close to Wimbledon was not acted upon; indeed, the scheduling issue was worse in 1912. Rather than starting three days after the end of Wimbledon, the Olympic outdoor tennis events were now at the same time as Wimbledon. The indoor events, held in May, were thus attended by top-flight players, while the outdoor competitions were not.\nDenmark, Norway, Russia, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Germany made its fourth appearance in the event, most among nations, having missed only the 1900 event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match.

        "title": "Colne Cricket Club",
        "text": "Colne Cricket Club is a cricket club who play in the Lancashire League, which plays its home games at The Horsfield in Colne. For the 2023 season, their club captain is Tom Bradshaw, their 2nd XI captain is Martin Kegg, their 3rd XI captain is Thomas Ellacott and their T20 captain is also Tom Bradshaw. Their professional is Geeth Kumara of Sri Lanka. The club has won the league on five occasions and won the cup six times, achieving a league and cup double in 1959. It has employed professionals including Amar Singh, Bill Alley, Joe Scuderi and Collis King.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1830, making it the oldest club in the Lancashire League and among the oldest in the area. The club folded after around ten years but was reformed in 1848, soon employing its first professional and playing its first recorded matches against other clubs. The club folded again in 1854 before reforming once more in 1860, folding in 1871 and reforming again in 1874. In the years following the club attracted crowds in the thousands and began charging for admission, employing two full-time professionals.\nIn 1891 Colne CC became founder members of the North East Lancashire Cricket League, which became the Lancashire League the following season. Colne finished as runners up in the first season but experienced no similar success in the 19th century. In 1898 the club president Richard Sager who had been intimately involved in every incarnation of the club died. The early 20th century saw success for Colne, winning the league in 1902, 1905 and 1910 and finishing second on three further occasions, losing a 1903 title play-off to local rivals Nelson. The 1904 match with Nelson drew a crowd of 10,000 to the Horsfield.\nWhen the league resumed after the First World War Colne found little success, though the club did twice win the Worsley Cup in 1919 and 1924. In 1921 Colne played a match against probably the strongest side ever to play on the Horsfield - a Yorkshire team containing seven test players, losing by 22 runs. In 1935 Colne employed its first ever overseas professional, Amar Singh. He was seen as a rival to Nelson's Learie Constantine and his arrival caused the club's gate receipts and membership to double. Also that year Colne played against the largest crowd ever to watch the team. 14,000 people watched the fixture with Nelson at Seedhill which ended in a tie after Amar Singh took Nelson's last wicket with the scores level.\nIn 1948 Colne almost completed a league and cup double, winning the Worsley Cup and finishing second in the league by one point after falling just five runs short of victory in their final league match. Colne's professional in this period was Bill Alley who became the first player to score 1000 runs in a season for Colne, which he did in five successive seasons, the only player to achieve this feat in the Lancashire League's history. He went on to play for Blackpool and joined Somerset CCC at 38 Years of age setting records there and being the last player to score 3000 runs in a season, retiring at 49 to umpire at Test level. The club's fortunes declined after this point and in 1957 Colne finished bottom of the league for the first time.\nInternational players could not join County teams and many came to play League cricket to gain experience of playing conditions for later tours and some gained residency to play for Counties. Learie Constantine, Everton Weekes, Clyde Walcott, Lance Gibbs, Charlie Griffiths, Wesley Hall and Ray Lindwall are just a few who would visit Horsfield. Colne could not afford these and depended on talent spotters suggesting younger players.\nIn 1959, an inexperienced Colne team completed the League and Cup double with a Celonese (Sri Lankan) professional Stanley Jayasinghe, who outscored Everton Weekes to 1000 runs. Colne were victorious over Bacup in the Worsley Cup final and won the final match of the season at Todmorden to take the title ahead of Todmorden and Nelson. Jayasinghe went on to play county cricket for several years with Leicester CCC\nThe club won the cup again in 1969 but achieved no further success for thirty years. The late eighties and early nineties were particularly difficult for Colne, with the club finishing bottom of the league in five out of six seasons and at one point winning just three matches over two seasons.\nThe club has moved forwards since the mid nineties. Financial stability enabled Colne to employ better professionals including Ben Johnson who scored a league record 1,716 runs in the 1996 season. In 1999 the club again won the Worsley Cup, beating East Lancs. in a match which went down to the last ball. By the end of the 20th century Colne were regularly finishing towards the top of the table, though this performance has declined in the 21st. However, a fantastic 2019 season saw Colne win the Division 2 Lancashire League table. This meaning Colne were the first ever team to win the second division title after the split at the end of the 2018 season. A fantastic season by professional James Price of South Africa followed by some dominant individual performances by the amateurs throughout the season meant Colne led the table from the first day to the end. Despite being favourites to finish bottom of the second division, Colne defied all odds to be crowned champions on the last day at Enfield.\nColne amateur players who have gone on to play County Cricket include Alan Wharton 1945 - 61 Lancashire and Leicester 1961 - 1963 ( 2 England caps in 1949) http://www.pcboard.com.pk/Archive/Players/0/857/857.html and Andrew Kennedy 1970 - 82 and the then Minor Counties side Durham. Andrew was 1975 Cricket writers young cricketer of the year. \nGround.\nColne play at the Horsfield in the east of Colne. This has been the club's home since its early years and has seen crowds of 10,000 people. A new pavilion was built in 1888 and this remained unaltered through much of twentieth century before being replaced in 1965 at the cost of £10,000. This structure was destroyed in a fire in 1974 and a new pavilion was built. This remains in use today, though it was extended in 2001."

        "text": "Robert T. Fisher (December 3, 1888 – July 7, 1942) was an American football player and coach. He played college football at Harvard University and was a consensus All-American in 1910 and 1911. He served as the head football coach at Harvard from 1919 to 1925, compiling a record of 43–14–5 and winning the 1920 Rose Bowl. His 1919 team was retroactively recognized as a national champion by a number of selectors. Fisher was one of the original trustees for the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1973.\nPlaying career.\nFisher was born on December 3, 1888, in Boston. He grew up in Dorchester and played tackle at Phillips Academy, where he was a teammate of John Kilpatrick. He played guard on Harvard’s freshman team in 1908 and on the varsity team from 1909 to 1911. He was captain of the 1911 Harvard Crimson football team. He was a second team All-American in 1909 and a consensus first team All-American in 1910 and 1911.\nMilitary service.\nIn 1917, Fisher was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Aviation Section of the United States Army Signal Corps and assigned to the San Antonio Aviation General Supply Depot. In 1918 he was transferred to Wilbur Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he was later promoted to captain. While at Wright he met Louise Winters and they married when he was discharged in March 1919. The Fishers had four sons and one daughter. After the war, Fisher returned to C. F. Hovey.\nCoaching.\nAfter graduating in 1912, Fisher went to work for the C. F. Hovey department store, but remained involved with the Crimson as an assistant football coach. On June 13, 1919, it was announced that he would succeed Percy Haughton as Harvard's head football coach. He was chosen after Haughton's lead assistant, Leo Leary, turned down the job to focus on his business interests. His 1919 team went undefeated and won the 1920 Rose Bowl over Oregon and was retroactively recognized as a national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Houlgate System, and as a co-national champion by the College Football Researchers Association, National Championship Foundation, and Parke H. Davis. The following year, Harvard went 8–0–1 and was retroactively named as the co-national champion by the Boand System, however the majority of selectors have chosen California as the national champion for 1920. In 1921, Harvard lost to Center College in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history. \nOn February 3, 1925, Fisher informed the Harvard Athletic Committee that he would not return as head coach. He was convinced to reconsider and on March 4, 1925, it was announced he would return as head coach. After the season, Fisher announced he would not return as head coach. Fisher compiled a record of 43–14–5 in his seven seasons as Harvard's coach. He had a 4–2–1 record in the Harvard–Yale game. He had less success in the annual game against Princeton, amassing a 1–4–2 record and losing by a combined score of 70 to 0 in his final two seasons as coach.\nLater life.\nFisher worked at Lee, Higginson &amp; Co. until 1927, when he and Francis Ouimet were chosen to head the Boston office of the stock and commodities exchange house Harriss, Irby &amp; Vose. In 1931 he joined Spencer Trask &amp; Co. and in 1940 was promoted to manager. On July 7, 1942, Fisher died of a heart attack at Newton Hospital. He was survived by his wife, daughter, and four sons. Fisher's four sons played together at his alma mater, Phillips Academy and went on to play for Harvard. Three of them played together on the 1942 team while the fourth was unavailable due to military commitments. At the time of his death, Fisher resided in Weston, Massachusetts."

He was a four-year starter for the Penn Quakers, from 1893 to 1896, and played guard and end. During his time at Penn, the school's football teams won consecutive national champions with undefeated seasons in 1894 and 1895. He also earned All-American honors from Walter Camp in 1894, 1895, and 1896. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1960. In 1912, Jack Kofoed, writing in the \"Philadelphia Record\", named Gelbert to his all-time All-America team.\nHowever Gelbert also played football at the professional level. From 1898 until 1899, he played for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club. A year later, he was in the line-up for the 1900 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team. In 1902, he played for the Philadelphia Phillies of the first National Football League. After the Phillies season ended, he played for the \"New York team\" during the 1902 World Series of Football The team was heavily favored to win the five team tournament, and featured professional football stars Blondy Wallace, Walter E. Bachman and Ben Roller. However, the team was eliminated in the opening match in a 5–0 loss to the Syracuse Athletic Club.\nGelbert also took part in gymnastics. It was said that his acrobatic play would help his defensive play in football when facing off against much larger men. Outside of football he worked as a veterinary surgeon in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\nFinally, Charlie was the father of Charlie Gelbert, an infielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, who would go on to win the 1931 World Series."

        "text": "Charles H. Green (born March 14, 1943) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Wittenberg Tigers. From 1962 to 1964, he led Wittenberg to three consecutive Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) championships and three consecutive undefeated seasons (25–0–1), including an Associated Press small college national championship in 1964. After the 1964 season, he was selected as the first-team quarterback on the Little All-America team. \nHe also played professional football for the Oakland Raiders in 1966. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002.\nEarly years.\nGreen grew up in West Milton, Ohio, located northwest of Dayton. He played high school football at Milton-Union High School, leading the team to a 10–0 record as a senior.\nWittenberg.\nGreen enrolled at Wittenberg University in 1961 as \"a scrawny, youngster.\" While at Wittenberg, he grew and gained .\nHe became Wittenberg's starting quarterback as a sophomore, leading the 1962 Wittenberg Tigers football team to a perfect 9–0 record, an OAC championship, and the No. 2 spot in the final Associated Press (AP) small college poll. During the 1962 season, Green completed 79 of 147 passes for 1,227 yards with 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He was selected by the AP as the first-team quarterback on the 1962 All-OAC football team.\nAs a junior, he led the 1963 Wittenberg football team to an 8–0–1, an OAC championship, and the No. 3 spot in the final AP small college football poll. Green had his best statistical showing in 1963, completing 114 of 182 passes for 2,181 yards, 19 touchdowns, eight interceptions and a 188.9 passing efficiency rating. He set OAC season records for completions (114), passing yards (2,181), and total offense (2,224 yards), and also set an OAC single-game record with 411 passing yards against Heidelberg. For the second consecutive year, he was selected by the AP as the first-team quarterback on the All-OAC team. He was also voted by the conference coaches as the best back in the OAC. His top receiver, Bobby Cherry, was named best lineman in the OAC.\nAs a senior, he led the 1964 Wittenberg Tigers to its third consecutive OAC championship with a perfect 8–0 record. The Tigers were again ranked No. 1 in the AP's final small college football poll. During the 1964 season, Green completed 117 of 198 passes for 1,811 yards, 21 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. At the end of the season, he again received the award as the best back in the OAC. He was also selected as the first-team quarterback on the 1964 Little All-America college football team. \n\"Sports Illustrated\" ran a feature story on Wittenberg's football team in November 1964 and noted Green's popularity: \"[M]ention the name of Charlie Green and you will be saluted by a peal of bells from every one of the town's 143 churches.\" The magazine also praised Green's ability: Green undoubtedly is the year's best small-college quarterback and possibly one of the best in any category—big or small. His most imposing credential is a right arm that can get rid of a football so rapidly and with such accuracy that one opposing coach insists he is being aimed by an IBM computer.\nAt the end of his playing career at Wittenberg, he held 14 OAC conference records, including the career records for passing yards (5,575) and touchdown passes (61).\nGreen also handled punting for Wittenberg and played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. He was the most valuable player on the baseball team, compiling a 0.67 earned run average in 1964.\nProfessional football.\nGreen was selected by the Boston Patriots in the 13th round of the 1965 AFL Draft. He spent the 1965 season on Boston's taxi squad. He also played in 1965 for the Boston Sweepers, leading them to the North Atlantic semi-pro league championship.\nIn March 1966, he was acquired by the Oakland Raiders. During the 1966 season, he served as the Raiders' third-string quarterback, behind Tom Flores and Cotton Davidson. He appeared in 14 games, none as a starter, and completed both of his pass attempts for a total of 17 yards.\nIn 1967, the Raiders acquired two new quarterbacks, Daryle Lamonica and George Blanda. In late August 1967, the team placed Green on waivers and, when he was unclaimed, sent him to the San Jose Apaches of the Pacific Coast Division of the Continental Football League. He played the 1967 season with the Apaches, sharing quarterback duties with Chon Gallegos. The Apaches were coached in 1967 by Bill Walsh.\nGreen returned to the Raiders for their 1968 training camp. However, he did not make the Raiders' final roster for the 1968 season. The following year, he tried out with the Denver Broncos but was released in July 1969.\nLater years and honors.\nIn the mid-1980s, Green was living in Phoenix, Arizona, working as a funding specialist for Merchant Banking Services. He later worked in the insurance business. He was also active in the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program in Arizona. His son Tyler Green was a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1990s.\nGreen, his coach Bill Edwards, and his top receiver Bob Cherry were among the first 12 people inducted into the Wittenberg University Athletics Hall of Honor when it was established in 1985. \nHe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He was the first Wittenberg player to be inducted into the Hall.\nIn 2017, he was ranked No. 3 by the \"Springfield News-Sun\" on its list of the top football players in Wittenberg history. (Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductee Ron Lancaster took the No. 1 spot.)"

The race began on 21 May in Palermo with a stage that stretched to Catania, finishing in Monza on 12 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by Fausto Coppi of the Bianchi team, with fellow Italians Gino Bartali and Giordano Cottur coming in second and third respectively.\nCoppi won the overall by way of the memorable 17th stage (from Cuneo to Pinerolo), in which he escaped from the group and climbed alone the Maddalena Pass, the Col de Vars, the Col d'Izoard, the Col de Montgenèvre and the Sestriere Pass, arriving in Pinerolo 11'52\" ahead of Bartali, his tenacious antagonist during those years.\nTeams.\nA total of 15 teams were invited to participate in the 1949 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 105 cyclists. Out of the 105 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 65 riders made it to the finish in Monza.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe main favorites entering the race were Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi. Vito Ortelli, who placed fourth the year prior did not participate as he was suffering from an illness and stayed home. \"l'Unità\"'s Attilio Camoriano wrote that Coppi's form entering the race could allow him to gain the lead early on and hold it from Bartali, who was known to take several stages to warm up and adjust to the race. Camoriano added that Bartali would likely not let that happen as he was known to find strength and referenced previous Tours de France. He further stated that Coppi's Bianchi team was stronger and better organized than Bartali's eponymous team. Aside from the aforementioned contenders, Fiorelli's Jean Goldschmit was thought to be the team's best contender as Ganna–Ursus's Albert Dubuisson was known to fade on climbs.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for this edition of the Giro d'Italia was announced on 7 February 1949. The stages involving the Piedmont region were finalized on 24 March. The race was scheduled to begin at 8 am at the Villa Giulia in Palermo. Attilio Camoriano of \"l'Unità\" stated that the riders were likely to use their heavy, thicker tires because after the Santo Stefano junction, the roads contained lava rocks from Mount Etna throughout and those were known to cut tires easily. The Sicilian government offered race organizers ten million lire to host the start of the Giro.\nPrior to the start of the race, bandit Salvatore Giuliano who had been on the run near Sicily's Montelepre was being searched for by police as the area was in a state of emergency for several weeks. It was rumored that Giuliano threatened to line the race route in the mountains and shoot at the participants with machine guns if the police did not call off their search for him. Specifically Giuliano threatened to interrupt the first stage along its route from Palermo to Catania. Due to these threats, there were discussions to cancel the two planned stages in Sicily, but the stages remained. Instead, the normal police escort for the Giro d'Italia caravan that travels with the race would be increased from 6 to 10 cars and cars would not be allowed to stop along the route throughout the two stages on the island except in cases of \"force majeure.\" The added police were not due to the rumors of the attack, but allegedly to prevent a potential escape by Giuliano.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 1949 Giro d'Italia there were two major classifications. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.\nIn the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. This classification did not award a jersey to the leader. The highest climb of the race was the Col d'Izoard in stage seventeen, which was 2360m. The other stages that included categorized climbs were stages: 1, 3, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19.\nA white jersey was awarded to the rider from a non-major \"industrial\" team with the lowest total time.\"\nThere was a black jersey (maglia nera) awarded to the rider placed last in the general classification. The classification was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nThere was a classification for sprints called the \"Gran Premio Tappe Volanti\" classification. This consisted of a sprint line that was marked in eight stages of the race, stages 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 19. Specifically the eight sprints were located in the following places Taormina, Castrovillari, Terni, Ferrara, Trieste, Verona, Chiavari, and Novara, respectively.\nFor placing in the top three for each classification, on the final stage placings, the \"Gran Premio Tappe Volanti\", or crossing a categorized climb for the mountains classification, time bonuses were awarded. One minute time bonus was given to the first placed rider, thirty seconds to second place, and fifteen second to third."

The race began on 15 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Turin, finishing back in Milan on 6 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Fiorenzo Magni of the Wilier Triestina team, with fellow Italians Ezio Cecchi and Giordano Cottur coming in second and third respectively.\nTeams.\nA total of eleven teams entered the 1948 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 77 cyclists. Out of the 77 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 44 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nRace organizer and newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" released the preliminary route for the Giro d'Italia on 27 October 1947. The race was originally planned to start on 22 May and finish on 13 June, while covering over nineteen stages.\nRace overview.\nDuring stage 9 from Bari to Naples, Magni –who was down nine minutes at the time– joined the day's breakaway.\nDuring the Giro, the French and Belgian teams left the race because they thought it was made impossible for foreign riders to ride the Giro. When the leader Magni was punished with only two minutes after being pushed up a mountain, Fausto Coppi and his Bianchi team also left the race out of protest. As a result, only forty riders finished the Giro. Stage seventeen featured several climbs including the Pordoi Pass. Coppi won the stage, but Magni–who had a reputation for struggling on big climbs–finished in time to retain the lead. It was discovered that Magni had been helped up the Pordoi, while some state he was pushed by spectators others say he was pulled by a car. Coppi and Bianchi requested Magni to be thrown out. As there were no photos, the race jury had to go based on testimonies. It was officially declared that the pushing Magni received was planned. The punishment was a two-minute penalty in the general classification, which still allowed him to remain in the lead. Coppi and his team decided to withdraw after that decision.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first. The winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nThere was a black jersey (maglia nera) awarded to the rider placed last in the general classification. The classification was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nThe prize money for the winner of the race was one million lire. The prize money increased to one million this year because Totip, a horse race betting company, sponsored the race.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nAftermath.\nThe Italian cycling federation gave Coppi a suspension of one month because he refused to finish the Giro. After being caught cheating, Magni was the subject of the tifosi's animosity, he was frequently booed and writing on the road included the phrase \"Abbasso Magni\" (). After winning the final stage into Milan's Vignorelli Velodrome, the crowd's behavior (whistles, boos, and anti–Magni banners) reduced him to tears. The Communist Mayor of Prato sent Magni a telegram congratulating him on the victory, stating that his victory brought \"honor to [their] city.\" Later in his life, Magni said that the telegram pleased him greatly."

The contest was televised on ABC, the 20th straight year the network aired the Rose Bowl, starting at 4:30pm EST. The game's main sponsor was Citi.\nThe 2008 Rose Bowl featured the 7th-ranked USC Trojans hosting the 13th-ranked Illinois Fighting Illini. As with the previous year's game, the contest was a semi-traditional Rose Bowl in that while it was a Big Ten versus Pac-10 matchup, the Big Ten representative was an at-large team because the conference champion, Ohio State, which lost to Illinois earlier in the season, was selected to play in the BCS National Championship Game.\nUSC was making its third straight appearance in the Rose Bowl, while Illinois had not played in the game since 1984. Though Illinois won the Big Ten Conference title in 2001, the then-rotating BCS title game moved them to the Sugar Bowl.\nGame summary.\nUSC took an early 21–0 lead, including a touchdown pass by backup quarterback Garrett Green on a trick play. Illinois verged on closing to 21–10 midway through the third quarter, but receiver Jacob Willis fumbled into the end zone after a catch and Trojans linebacker Brian Cushing recovered for a touchback. USC converted that miscue into a touchdown and then cornerback Cary Harris intercepted Illinois quarterback Juice Williams's pass on the first play of the ensuing possession. Five plays later, Trojans freshman Joe McKnight scored on a 6-yard run, making the score 35–10. USC gained a Rose Bowl-record 633 yards of offense in defeating Illinois 49–17.\nGame records.\nMost TD passes career, Rose Bowl History- 7, John David Booty"

The seven teams that partook in the race were: Bianchi, Dei, Fréjus, Ganna, Gloria, Legnano, and Maino.\nThe peloton was composed of only Italian riders due to the political situation involving Italy at the time. The field featured two former Giro d'Italia winners with Costante Girardengo who won the race in 1919 and 1923 and the returning champion Vasco Bergamaschi. Other notable Italian riders included Gino Bartali, Giovanni Valetti, and Giuseppe Olmo.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe highest ranked isolati cyclist in the general classification were tracked.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

He was a two-time All-American, Academic All-American, and 3-time Academic All-Big Ten player.\nHe began his professional career in 1969 with the American Football League's Kansas City Chiefs, with whom he won the fourth and final AFL-NFL World Championship Game after the 1969 pro football season. Speaking of that game, he said: \"I will always remember guys like Jerry Mays, Johnny Robinson, Budde, Tyrer, Arbanas, Buck, Bobby Bell, etc. nearly crying in our locker room before Super Bowl IV when Hank Stram surprised us with the AFL patch on our jerseys. After 10 years of the AFL being called an inferior league, winning that Super Bowl was particularly meaningful.\"\nStein, at 21, was the youngest player to play in the Super Bowl for a decade.

The race began on 6 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Turin, finishing back in Milan on 28 May after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by Alfredo Binda of the Legnano team (his fifth triumph in the Giro). Second and third respectively were the Belgian Jef Demuysere and Italian Domenico Piemontesi.\nThis 20th edition covered 3,343 km at an average speed of 30.043 km/h, for a total of 17 stages.\nParticipants.\nOf the 97 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 6 May, 51 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 28 May. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team; 51 riders competed as members of a team, while the remaining 46 were independent riders. There were nine teams that competed in the race: Bestetti-d'Alessandro, Bianchi-Pirelli, Dei-Pirelli, Ganna-Hutchinson, Girardengo-Clément, Gloria-Hutchinson, Legnano-Hutchinson, Maino-Clément, and Olympia-Spiga.\nThe peloton was primarily composed of Italians. The field featured five former Giro d'Italia champions in four-time winner Alfredo Binda, two-time champion Costante Girardengo, single race winners Luigi Marchisio and Francesco Camusso, and reigning winner Antonio Pesenti. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Learco Guerra, Giuseppe Olmo, Remo Bertoni, Felice Gremo, and Domenico Piemontesi. Notable non-Italian entrants included: Previous year podium finisher Jef Demuysere, Spanish climber Vicente Trueba, and renowned French cyclist René Vietto. Of all the entrants, Guerra was seen as the favorite to win the race after his victory in the Milan–San Remo earlier in the season.\nRoute and stages.\n\"La Gazzetta\" announced the route in March 1933.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. Race organizers chose to remove time bonuses for the sprint stage winners, the \"winner for detachment,\" the first riders who cross a mountain. The winner of the individual time trial – where riders contest the course starting in three minute increments – awarded a time bonus of two minutes and one minute to the first and second-place finishers, respectively.\nThe race organizers allowed isolated riders to compete in the race, which had a separate classification calculated the same way as the general classification. For the leader of this classification, a white jersey was awarded.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first. There were four mountains that were given points towards the mountains classification: the Passo del Tonale, the Osteria della Crocetta, the Castelnuovo della Daunia, and the Castelnuovo Val di Cecina. Alfredo Binda was the first rider to cross each of the four mountains.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nIl Trofeo Magno () was a classification for independent Italian riders competing in the race. The riders were divided into teams based on the region of Italy they were from. The calculation of the standings was the same for the team classification. At the end of the race, a trophy was awarded to the winning team and it was then stored at the Federal Secretary of the P.N.P. in their respective province.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nReferences.\nBibliography"

The Giro started in Campione d'Italia, on 20 May, with a stage and concluded in Naples, on 11 June, with a mass-start stage. A total of 130 riders from 13 teams entered the 22-stage race, which was won by Belgian Eddy Merckx of the Faema team. The second and third places were taken by Italians Vittorio Adorni and Felice Gimondi, respectively.\nTeams.\nAt the route's announcement on 21 March, the organizers announced twelve teams of ten would participate; however, one more team (Peugeot) was later invited. Each team sent a squad of ten riders so the Giro began with a peloton of 130 cyclists. Out of the 130 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 98 riders made it to the finish in Naples where eight riders were subsequently disqualified for testing positive for drugs leaving the general classification tally at 90 riders. The starting peloton consisted of 70 Italians, 16 Belgians, 15 Frenchmen, 11 Spanish, 7 Swiss, four Germans, three Dutch, two Danes, one English, and one Luxembourgian rider. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on 20 May, in the Campione d'Italia at 9:30 AM local time.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did include the previous year's winner Felice Gimondi. Eddy Merckx was confirmed to participate with his Faema team. Eight-time Grand Tour winner Jacques Anquetil did not participate in the race because of a dispute over pay.\nRoute and stages.\nThe race route was revealed to the public on 21 March 1968 by race director Vincenzo Torriani. The starting date of the event was moved from 18 or 19 May to the 20th because of the general election taking place within Italy that ended on 19 May. The race was broadcast by RAI throughout Italy. \"l'Unita\" writer Gino Sala's felt the route was geared towards climbers, referencing the inclusion of Tre Cime di Lavaredo which had been the previous year and eliminated several riders. Former racer Cino Cinelli felt the Tre Cime di Lavaredo would be the decisive stage, while three-time champion Gino Bartali felt the Spanish would benefit from the route. The average length of the stages was . The second individual time trial, in San Marino, was seen as an important stage as it featured inclines of 5-6%. Gianni Motta commented that \"I've never seen so many mountains in a row one after another.\" Four mountains approached or exceeded : Monte Grappa, Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Rocca di Cambio, and Blockhaus. Following the route's unveil, \"El Mundo Deportivo\" author Juan Plans Bosch wrote that the Giro would always be second to the Tour de France as it was the first premier bike race, while he felt the Giro had better \"historical and geographical illustrations.\"\nTo begin race festivities there was a parade through the streets of Campione d'Italia before the prologue started during the night. The race started with a prologue, which consisted of a circuit being crossed twice. The times from this stage were not included in the final times for the general classification, but were just done to determine the first person to wear the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" (). This was the first Giro d'Italia to have a prologue to open the race. The 130 starting riders were divided into thirteen groups of ten, with each group of ten contesting the course at the same time. The times of the fastest riders from each group were put together and the fastest of those times was the rider that would wear the first pink jersey. The route finished for the first time in Naples near Mount Vesuvius along the Mediterranean Ocean.\nRace overview.\nThe race's twelfth stage saw heavy rain from the start of the stage in Gorizia, which turned to snow as the race began to elevate into the Dolomites. Police lined the sides of the roads of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo as the riders passed through due to incidents that had occurred on the slopes the previous year. The leading group on the road had a ten-minute advantage on Eddy Merckx. Merckx was able to traverse the ten-minute gap, win the stage, and take the lead of the race.\nDoping.\nAt a presentation in Campione d'Italia, Torriani announced the measures for doping controls. This was the first Giro d'Italia to administer tests in attempt to catch riders doping, To determine whether a not tests would be administered, a set of twenty-two envelopes were made with each envelope having a slip of paper inside that read either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Following the finish of each stage one envelope was opened, if it read \"No,\" then all riders could leave immediately. If it read \"Yes,\" then riders with high placings on the stage and in the overall classification were tested. The results from these tests, however, would be available fifteen days after the conclusion of the race. On 15 June, the Italian Cycling Federation announced that nine riders had tested positive during the race. The riders were Gimondi, Motta, Franco Balmamion, Franco Bodrero, Raymond Delise, Peter Abt, Victor van Schil, Mariano Diaz, Joaquin Galera. Balmamion was cleared of the charges as the substance found in his urine had not been officially banned. Gimondi's ban was overturned on 13 July as he persuaded the authorities he had used Reactivan. Years later, author John Foot wrote \"Doubts remain about how much the influence of Gimondi's fame and his ability to employ expensive lawyers and experts had on his case,\" casting further doubt on the legitimacy of Gimondi's claims of innocence. The Tour de France organizers adopted the Giro's doping control scheme for their 1968 race.\nClassification Leadership.\nTwo different jerseys were worn during the 1969 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a red jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15. The mountains classification leader. The climbs were ranked in first and second categories. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. There were a total of nineteen categorized climbs, of which the highest one, the \"Cima Coppi\", was the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nFranco Bitossi (Filotex) won the \"traguardi tricolori\" classification and Merckx won the \"Trofeo dei Circuiti\"."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1984 Summer Olympics was held in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center in Los Angeles on July 31, 1984. There were 34 competitors from 25 nations, with each nation limited to two swimmers (down from three in previous Games). The event was won by Rick Carey of the United States, the nation's third victory in the men's 200 metre backstroke. Frédéric Delcourt of France took silver and Cameron Henning of Canada earned bronze; it was the first medal in the event for each of those two nations.\nCarey won by 1.52 seconds at 2:00.23, an easy victory but a disappointing time for Carey. He did not celebrate and did not smile or acknowledge the crowd during the medal ceremony. His demeanor was heavily criticized, resulting in him issuing an apology.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nOne of the 8 finalists from the 1980 returned: sixth-place finisher Michael Söderlund of Sweden. The medalists at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships had been Rick Carey of the United States, Sándor Wladár of Hungary (who was also the 1980 Olympic champion), and Frank Baltrusch of East Germany; with Hungary and East Germany joining the Soviet-led boycott of the Games, only Carey competed in Los Angeles—and was heavily favoured. Carey was also the world record holder, having broken John Naber's record in 1983 and then improved on his own time at the 1984 U.S. Olympic trials.\nThe Bahamas, the People's Republic of China, Egypt, Greece, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, New Zealand, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event. Australia, Great Britain, and Sweden each made their sixth appearance, matching the Netherlands (absent for the first time) for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. A \"consolation final\" was added in 1984. There were 5 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The next 8 (9th through 16th) competed in a consolation final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A, while the next eight to final B."

The German city had hosted the championships previously in 1979, 1987, and 1995. It tied Duisburg with Belgrade, Serbia (then Yugoslavia) who hosted in 1971, 1975, 1978, and 1982.\nMen race as individuals, pairs and quads over 200 m, 500 m and 1000 m in both Canoe (Canadian) (C) and Kayak (K) events, giving a total of 18 gold medals. Women compete for only 9 gold medals as they race in kayak events only.\nThis was the 36th championships in canoe sprint.\nHighlights.\nBoth German and Hungarian paddlers won 9 gold medals. With 6 silver Germany topped the medal table, while Hungarians finished first on the point table.\nIn the women's events the two nations shared all world titles. Since Natasa Janics left the legendary pair with Katalin Kovács all K-2 races were ruled by the German paddlers. However, Katalin Kovács won K-1 1000 m and 500 m, and gained two silvers in the K-4 events, while former partner Natasa Janics won the individual over 200 m. Hungarian team won the K-4 on 1000 m, and Germans the 500 m and 200 m.\nIn the men's races, the C-2 500 m final saw György Kolonics win his fifteenth and final championship title which is an outstanding record in the history of canoe sprint. Ronald Rauhe and Tim Wieskötter of Germany won their sixth K-2 500 m title in a row.\nMedal summary.\nMen's.\n Non-Olympic classes\nWomen's.\n Non-Olympic classes"

        "text": "The curling competition of the 2010 Olympics was held at Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre in Vancouver. It is the fifth time that curling was on the Olympic program, after having been staged in 1924, 1998, 2002 and 2006. For the 2010 Winter Olympics the competition followed the same format that was used during the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, with 10 teams playing a round robin tournament, from which the top four teams advance to the semi-finals.\nThe women's competition concluded on Friday, February 26, 2010. In the bronze medal match, the Chinese team made history by becoming the first team from Asia to win an Olympic curling medal. The gold medal match was one of the closest medal games in Olympic competition. Team Canada won the silver medal, their best performance since the 1998 Nagano Olympic Games when Sandra Schmirler skipped the Canadians to gold. Team Sweden won the gold medal. Anette Norberg, Eva Lund, Cathrine Lindahl, and Anna Le Moine (née Anna Bergström [Anna Svärd in Torino]) became the first curlers to win two gold medals at the Olympic Games.\nThe men's competition concluded on Saturday, February 27, 2010. In the bronze medal match, Markus Eggler of Switzerland became the first male curler to win two Olympic medals. The gold medal final was a rematch between Canada and Norway of the 2002 Olympics men's final (although only one athlete from each team participated in both finals). The only disturbance was when an unsportsmanlike spectator deliberately blew a horn while the Norwegians were delivering their stones. The crowd promptly booed the man and the horn was not blown again until the medal ceremony. The Canadians controlled the game throughout and never relinquished the lead. Torger Nergård and Kevin Martin became the second and third men to win two Olympic medals.\nWith the conclusion of the Vancouver Olympic curling tournament, eight athletes now have two Olympic curling medals. They are in the order in which they received their medals: Mirjam Ott (SUI), Markus Eggler (SUI), Kevin Martin (CAN), Torger Nergård (NOR), Anette Norberg, Eva Lund, Cathrine Lindahl, and Anna Le Moine, all of Sweden.\nQualified teams.\nMen's.\n\"*Throws third rocks\"\n\"**Throws second rocks\"\nWomen's.\n\"*Throws second rocks\"\n\"**The World Curling Federation had Olga Jarkova listed as the Third.

Points were distributed in the following manner, with the top 9 teams (excluding hosts Canada) qualifying for the Olympics.\nIn case of a tie during the 2007 World championships, the points were split (for example, if two teams tied for tenth place, they would receive 2.5 points). For the 2008 and 2009 championships, such ties were broken according to head-to-head matchups, and if necessary, by the draw shot challenge. Canada, as the host nation, qualified automatically. Scotland's points counted as Great Britain (Scotland does not compete at the Olympic level separately)."

        "title": "South African Formula One Championship",
        "text": "The South African Formula One Championship, was a Formula One motor racing championship held in South Africa between 1960 and 1975, including races in Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique.\nThe front-running cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines, and from the late 60s Formula 5000 added to grids with Formula Two cars joining in 1973. Front-running drivers from the series usually contested their local World Championship Grand Prix, as well as occasional European events, although they had little success at that level.\n1967 also saw a remarkable result by Rhodesian driver John Love with a 2.7 litre four-cylinder Cooper-Climax; Love was in his forties and, although seen as one of the finest drivers in Southern Africa, was not a major star. He led and finished second in that year's South African Grand Prix. Love's Cooper was originally designed for the short races of the Tasman Series, and to run a full Grand Prix, he added two auxiliary gas tanks. Unfortunately, the auxiliary tanks' fuel pump failure forced him to refuel after having led most of the race.\nLove and Dave Charlton both won the South African Formula One championship for six consecutive seasons, Love from 1964 to 1969 and Charlton from 1970 to 1975. In 1975 Ian Scheckter raced the Tyrrell 007 that had been campaigned by brother, Jody, in the previous year's world championship and won five of the season's races, including four on the trot. However, he only had one other points finish, fifth place at the False Bay \"100\" on 5 July, giving him a points total of 47 for the season. Charlton proved more consistent with three victories and five second-place finishes to give him a points total of 57. By winning the Natal Spring Trophy at Roy Hesketh Circuit on 1 September, Charlton joined Rhodesian John Love as a six-time winner of the South African National Drivers Championship. Charlton ended the South African Formula One Championship by winning the final race of the season, the Rand Spring Trophy at Kyalami on 4 October after the faster Scheckter retired with a driveshaft problem.\nPrimarily owing to cost and dwindling grids, the Formula One championship was replaced at the end of the 1975 season with Formula Atlantic. The South Africans had tried to build interest by padding the field with Formula 2 and Formula 5000 cars, but viewership was in a steady decline, not helped by a somewhat Byzantine points system. 1976 would see the start of the domination of South Africa's National Championship by Ian Scheckter. Indeed, had it not been for youthful exuberance, Scheckter may have won the 1975 title. He won more races than Charlton, but Charlton was more consistent. Scheckter won the first four championships in a row for Lexington Racing before United Tobacco Company withdrew their teams (Lexington, Gunston and Texan). With Gunston returning in 1983, Scheckter returned to the Championship and won a further two championships to join Love and Charlton as a six-time winner."

        "title": "Snorkel (swimming)",
        "text": "A snorkel is a device used for breathing atmospheric air when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either a separate unit, or integrated into a swimming or diving mask. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for underwater activities such as spearfishing, freediving, finswimming, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and for surface breathing while wearing scuba equipment. A standard snorkel is a curved tube with a shape usually resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and made from plastic, synthetic elastomers, rubber, or light metal. The snorkel may have a loop or a clip to attach it to the head strap of the diving mask or swimming goggles, or may be tucked between the mask-strap and the head.\nSome snorkels are fitted with a float valve at the top to prevent flooding if the top opening is immersed, and some are fitted with a water trap and purge valve, intended for draining water from the tube.\nThe current European Standard specifies limits for length, bore and internal volume for separate snorkels. Some types of integrated mask-snorkel combinations and anti-flooding valves are banned from manufacture and sale in some countries as unsafe.\nSnorkels constitute respiratory dead space. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in hypercapnia. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the tidal volume of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly increases the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging of the viewport. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and work of breathing.\nTypes and nomenclature.\nThe basic snorkel types are those which are completely separate from the mask, which are variously called \"separate\", \"simple\", \"plain\", \"tube\", \"pipe\", or \"independent\" snorkels, or just \"snorkels\", and which are curved tubes with a bite-grip mouthpiece, and \"integrated\" snorkels, which are part of a \"snorkel mask\", which can be a half mask covering the eyes and nose or a full-face mask covering the eyes, nose and mouth.\nFunction.\nA snorkel is used to allow the user to breathe atmospheric air when their face is immersed in water while swimming or floating at the surface. To work effectively, the snorkel must allow the user to inhale and exhale comfortably over an extended period, and provide a sufficient volume of air with appropriate oxygen and carbon dioxide content to maintain a sufficient and comfortable respiratory gas exchange in the lungs. Atmospheric air has a very consistent composition, so variations of inhaled air quality are almost entirely a consequence of how much exhaled air is inhaled on the next breath. The volume of air exchanged during a breathing cycle is called the tidal volume, and the volume of exhaled air that is inhaled on the next breath is called the dead volume.\nDead space reduces the amount of fresh air which reaches the alveoli during each breath. This reduces the oxygen available for gas exchange, and the amount of carbon dioxide that can be removed. The buildup of carbon dioxide is usually the more noticeable effect. The body can compensate to some extent by increasing the volume of inspired gas, but this also increases work of breathing, and is only effective when the ratio of dead space to tidal volume is reduced sufficiently to compensate for the additional carbon dioxide produced due to the increased work of breathing. Continued buildup of carbon dioxide will lead to hypercapnia and respiratory distress.\nA longer tube would not allow breathing when snorkeling deeper, since it would place the lungs in deeper water where the surrounding water pressure is higher requiring significantly greater effort to inhale, and overtaxing the muscles that expand the lungs. The pressure difference across the tissues in the lungs, between the blood capillaries and air spaces during negative pressure breathing would increase the risk of pulmonary edema.\nOperation.\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is held in the mouth, and allowed to flood when underwater. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (\"blast clearing\") or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (\"displacement clearing\") and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.\nExperienced users tend to develop a breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil of the lungs is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard.\nSingle snorkels and two-way twin snorkels constitute respiratory dead space. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly increases the dead space. When the user inhales, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the dead space is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, which increases the risk of hypercapnia, a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. The greater the volume of the dead space, and the smaller the tidal volume of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead space, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging of the inside of the mask. Twin integrated snorkels with one-way valves eliminate the dead-space of the snorkels themselves, but are usually used on a full-face mask, and even if it has an inner orinasal section, there will be some dead space, and the valves will impede airflow through the loop to some extent. Integrated two-way snorkels include the internal volume of the mask as dead space in addition to the volume of the snorkels unless there is a one way flow enforced by non-return valves and internal ducting. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply, as this reduces the dead space ratio. Slower breathing will reduce the effort needed to move the air through the circuit. There is a danger that a snorkeler who can breathe comfortably in good conditions will be unable to ventilate adequately under stress or when working harder, leading to hypercapnia and possible panic, and could get into serious difficulties if they are unable to swim effectively if they have to remove the snorkel or mask to breathe without restriction.\nSome snorkels have a sump at the lowest point to prevent a small volume of water remaining in the snorkel from being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Most of these also have a non-return drain valve in the sump, to drain water from the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is similar to the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is slightly less, and effective blast clearing may require a higher flow rate. When the water level in the snorkel drops sufficiently for exhaled air to bypass over the water, much of the effectiveness of the drain valve is lost, and the remaining water may not all be ejected. The full-face snorkel mask may have a double airflow passage with non-return valves to reduce dead space in the tubes, one tube providing inflow and the other for outflow, but the interior of the mask remains a large dead space unless an orinasal pocket is included. The full-face mask encloses the nose and mouth in the same volume which is connected to the snorkel tube or tubes, which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth. A few models of separate snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of water that splashes over the top of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water at the surface.\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing, or both.\nModern snorkels use silicone rubber in the mouthpiece and valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. Natural rubber was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. Natural rubber can also cause an allergic reaction in some people. In older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"ping pong\" balls in a cage mounted to the upper open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous, and are illegal to manufacture or sell in some countries.\nDiving masks with a built-in snorkel are not used for scuba diving. The snorkel is useless during the dive and increases the risk of dislodging and flooding the mask.\nApplications.\nSurface snorkelling.\nSnorkelling is the practice of swimming face down on or through a body of water while breathing the ambient air through a snorkel, usually with swimming goggles or a diving mask, and swimfins. In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn. The snorkel may be an independent item or integrated with the mask. The use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe the underwater environment for extended periods with relatively little effort, and to breathe while face-down at the surface.\nSnorkeling is a popular recreational activity, particularly at tropical resort locations. It provides the opportunity to observe underwater life in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort is involved.\nFinswimming.\nFinswimming is competitive swimming using fins. The surface disciplines also use a snorkel.\nFinswimmers generally use a front-mounted snorkel for lower drag and stability at speed. The rigid forehead bracket and central position minimise off-centre loads and keep the snorkel stable at relatively high speeds. They do not normally use snorkels with a sump valve, as they learn to blast clear the tube on most if not all exhalations, which keeps the water content in the tube to a minimum, and the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing, and elimination of water traps, allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede their competition performance.\nFreediving.\nFreediving is a form of underwater diving that relies on breath-holding until resurfacing rather than the use of breathing apparatus. A snorkel is not generally used for competitive freediving, as the additional work of breathing and dead space reduce performance, but they are normally used for non-competitive snorkel-diving, spearfishing and breathhold underwater sports like underwater hockey where the ability to breathe while viewing the underwater scene from the surface is a big advantage for planning the next descent.\nScuba diving.\nA snorkel can be useful when scuba diving as it is a convenient way to conserve the compressed breathing gas supply while swimming face down at the surface for extended periods, or for use in a contingency situation at the surface when there is a problem with either gas supply or diving regulator. Many dives do not require the use of a snorkel at all, and some scuba divers do not consider a snorkel a necessary or even useful piece of equipment, and it can be a snagging hazard in some environments, so the usefulness of a snorkel depends on the dive plan and the dive site. If there is no requirement to swim face down at the surface and see what is happening underwater, then a snorkel is not useful. If it is necessary to swim over heavy seaweed which can entangle the pillar valve and regulator if the diver swims face upward, to get to and from the dive site, then a snorkel is useful to conserve breathing gas. A scuba diver may carry a collapsible snorkel in a pocket to keep it safely out of the way when not in use during a dive.\nHistory.\nBreathing surface air through a tube was mentioned by Aristotle in his \"Parts of Animals\". He referred to divers using \"instruments for respiration\" resembling the elephant's trunk. Some evidence suggests that snorkeling may have originated in Crete some 5,000 years ago as sponge divers used hollowed out reeds to submerge and retrieve natural sponge for use in trade and commerce, though more recent breathhold sponge-diving practice used the skandalopetra diving weight system. In the fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci drew designs for an underwater breathing device consisting of cane tubes with a mask to cover the mouth at the diver end and a float to keep the tubes above water at the surface end. The following timeline traces the history of the swimmers' snorkel during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n1927: First use of swimmer's breathing tube and mask. According to Gilbert Doukan's 1957 \"World Beneath the Waves\" and cited elsewhere, \"In 1927, and during each summer from 1927 to 1930, on the beach of La Croix-Valmer, Jacques O'Marchal ( \"Jacques Aumaréchal\" is the name of a 1932 French swim mask patentee) could be seen using the first face mask and the first breathing tube. He exhibited them, in fact, in 1931, at the International Nautical Show. On his feet, moreover, he wore the first 'flippers' designed by Louis de Corlieu, the use of which was to become universal.\"\n1929: First swimmers' breathing tube patent application filed. On 9 December 1929, Barney B. Girden filed a patent application for a \"swimming device\" enabling a swimmer under instruction to be supplied with air through a tube to the mouth \"whereby the wearer may devote his entire time to the mechanics of the stroke being used.\" His invention was registered as US patent 1,845,263 on 16 February 1932. On 30 July 1932, Joseph L. Belcher filed a patent application for \"breathing apparatus\" delivering air to a submerged person by suction from the surface of the water through hoses connected to a float; US patent 1,901,219 was awarded on 14 March 1933.\n1938: First swimmers' mask with integrated breathing tubes. In 1938, French naval officer Yves Le Prieur introduced his \"Nautilus\" full-face diving mask with hoses emerging from the sides and leading upwards to an air inlet with a ball valve which opens when it is above water and closes when it is submerged. In November 1940, American spearfisherman Charles H. Wilen filed his \"swimmer's mask\" invention, which was granted US patent 2,317,237 of 20 April 1943. The device resembles a full-face diving mask incorporating two breathing tubes topped with valves projecting above the surface for inhalation and exhalation purposes. On 11 July 1944, he obtained US design patent 138,286 for a simpler version of this mask with a flutter valve at the bottom and a single breathing tube with a ball float valve at the top. Throughout their heyday of the 1950s and early 1960s, masks with integrated tubes appear in the inventories of American, Australian, British, Danish, French, German, Greek, Hong Kong, Israeli, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish, Taiwanese, Turkish and Yugoslav swimming and diving equipment manufacturers. Meanwhile, in 1957, the US monthly product-testing magazine Consumer Reports concludes that \"snorkel-masks have some value for swimmers lying on the surface while watching the depths in water free of vegetation and other similar hazards, but they are not recommended for a dive 'into the blue'\". According to an underwater swimming equipment review in the British national weekly newspaper The Sunday Times in December 1973, \"the mask with inbuilt snorkel is doubly dangerous (...) A ban on the manufacture and import of these masks is long overdue in Britain\". In a decree of 2 August 1989, the French government suspended the manufacture, importation and marketing of ball-valve snorkel-masks. By the noughties, just two swim masks with attached breathing tubes remained in production worldwide: the Majorca sub 107S single-snorkel model, and the Balco 558 twin-snorkel full-face model, both manufactured in Greece. In May 2014, the French Decathlon company filed its new-generation full-face snorkel-mask design, which was granted US design patent 775,722. on 3 January 2017, entering production as the \"Easybreath\" mask designated for surface snorkeling only.\n1938: First front-mounted swimmer's breathing tube patent was filed. In December 1938, French spearfisherman Maxime Forjot and his business partner Albert Méjean filed a patent application in France for a breathing tube worn on the front of the head over a single-lens diving mask enclosing the eyes and the nose and it was granted French patent 847848 on 10 July 1939. In July 1939, Popular Science magazine published an article containing illustrations of a spearfisherman using a curved length of hosepipe as a front-mounted breathing tube and wearing a set of swimming goggles over his eyes and a pair of swimming fins on his feet. In the first French monograph on spearfishing \"La Chasse aux Poissons\" (1940), medical researcher and amateur spearfisherman Raymond Pulvénis illustrates his \"Tuba\", a breathing tube he designed to be worn on the front of the head over a single-lens diving mask enclosing the eyes and the nose. Francophone swimmers and divers have called their breathing tube \"un tuba\" ever since. In 1943, Raymond Pulvénis and his brother Roger obtain a Spanish patent for their improved breathing tube mouthpiece design. In 1956, the UK diving equipment manufacturer E. T. Skinner (Typhoon) marketed a \"frontal\" breathing tube with a bracket attachable to the screw at the top of an oval diving mask. Although it eventually fell out of favour with underwater swimmers, the front-mounted snorkel remains the breathing tube of choice in competitive swimming and finswimming because it improves the swimmer's hydrodynamic profile.\n1939: First side-mounted swimmers’ breathing tube patent filed. In December 1939, expatriate Russian spearfisherman Alexandre Kramarenko filed a patent in France for a breathing tube worn at the side of the head with a ball float valve at the top to exclude water and a flutter valve at the bottom. Kramarenko and his business partner Charles H. Wilen refiled the invention in March 1940 with the United States Patent Office, where their \"underwater apparatus for swimmers\" was granted US patent 2,317,236 on 20 April 1943; after entering production in France, the device was called \"Le Respirator\". The co-founder of Scubapro Dick Bonin is credited with the introduction of the flexible-hose snorkel in the mid-1950s and the exhaust valve to ease snorkel clearing in 1980. In 1964, US Divers marketed an L-shaped snorkel intended to outperform J-shaped models by increasing breathing ease, cutting water drag and eliminating the \"water trap\". In the late 1960s, Dacor launched a \"wraparound big-barrel\" contoured snorkel, which closely follows the surface of the wearer's head and has a wider bore to improve airflow. The findings of the 1977 report \"Allergic reactions to mask skirts, regulator mouthpieces and snorkel mouthpieces\" encouraged diving equipment manufacturers to fit snorkels with hypoallergenic gum rubber and medical-grade silicone mouthpieces. For underwater swimming and diving, the side-mounted snorkel has long been the norm, although new-generation full-face swim masks with integrated snorkels are beginning to grow in popularity for use while floating and swimming at the surface.\n1950: First use of the word \"snorkel\" to denote a breathing device for swimmers. In November 1950, the Honolulu Sporting Goods Co. introduced a \"swim-pipe\" resembling Kramarenko and Wilen's side-mounted ball-float- and flutter-valve breathing tube design, urging children and adults to \"try the human version of the submarine snorkel and be like a fish\". Every advertisement in the first issue of \"Skin Diver\" magazine in December 1951 uses the alternative spelling \"snorkles\" to denote swimmers' breathing tubes. In 1955, Albert VanderKogel classed stand-alone breathing tubes and swim masks with integrated breathing tubes as \"pipe snorkels\" and \"mask snorkels\" respectively. In 1957, the British Sub-Aqua Club journal features a lively debate about the standardisation of diving terms in general and the replacement of the existing British term \"breathing tube\" with the American term \"snorkel\" in particular. The following year saw the première of the 1958 British thriller film The Snorkel, whose title references a diving mask topped with two built-in breathing tubes. To date, every national and international standard on snorkels uses the term \"snorkel\" exclusively. The German word \"Schnorchel\" originally referred to an air intake used to supply air to the diesel engines of U-boats, invented during World War II to allow them to operate just below the surface at periscope depth, and recharge batteries while keeping a low profile. First recorded in 1940–45.\n1969: First national standard on snorkels. In December 1969, the British Standards Institution published British standard BS 4532 entitled \"Specification for snorkels and face masks\" and prepared by a committee on which the British Rubber Manufacturers' Association, the British Sub-Aqua Club, the Department for Education and Science, the Federation of British Manufacturers of Sports and Games, the Ministry of Defence Navy Department and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents were represented. This British standard sets different maximum and minimum snorkel dimensions for adult and child users, specifies materials and design features for tubes and mouthpieces and requires a warning label and a set of instructions to be enclosed with each snorkel. In February 1980 and June 1991, the Deutsches Institut für Normung published the first and second editions of German standard DIN 7878 on snorkel safety and testing. This German standard sets safety and testing criteria comparable to British standard BS 4532 with an additional requirement that every snorkel must be topped with a fluorescent red or orange band to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. In November 1988, Austrian Standards International published Austrian standard ÖNORM S 4223 entitled \"Tauch-Zubehör; Schnorchel; Abmessungen, sicherheitstechnische Anforderungen, Prüfung, Normkennzeichnung\" in German, subtitled \"Diving accessories; snorkel; dimensions, safety requirements, testing, marking of conformity\" in English and closely resembling German Standard DIN 7878 of February 1980 in specifications. The first and second editions of European standard EN 1972 on snorkel requirements and test methods appeared in July 1997 and December 2015. This European standard refines snorkel dimension, airflow and joint-strength testing and matches snorkel measurements to the user's height and lung capacity. The snorkels regulated by these British, German, Austrian and European standards exclude combined masks and snorkels in which the snorkel tubes open into the mask.\nSeparate snorkels.\nA snorkel may be either separate from, or integrated into, a swim or dive mask. A separate snorkel, or tube snorkel, typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is submerged.\nAlthough snorkels come in many forms, they are primarily classified by their dimensions and secondarily by their orientation and shape. The length and the inner diameter (or inner volume) of the tube are important ergonomic considerations when matching a snorkel to the requirements of its user. The orientation and shape of the tube must also be taken into account when matching a snorkel to its use while seeking to optimise ergonomic factors such as streamlining, airflow, water retention, interrupting the field of vision, and work of breathing.\nDimensions.\nThe total length, inner diameter and internal volume of a snorkel tube are important because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally and ventilate adequately through the tube. Internal volume represents the dead space of the snorkel, and inside diameter and length are used as proxies for the internal volume. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. A long or narrow snorkel tube, or a tube with abrupt changes in direction, or internal surface irregularities will have greater breathing resistance due to friction, while a wide tube will have a larger dead space for the same length and may be hard to clear of water. A short tube or a tube aligned at the wrong angle, will be more susceptible to swamping by waves.\nTo date, all national and international standards on snorkels specify two ranges of tube dimensions to meet the health and safety needs of their end-users, whether young or old, short or tall, with low or high lung capacity. These dimensions are the total length, the inner diameter and/or the inner volume of the tube. The specifications of the standardisation bodies are tabulated below.\nThe table above shows how snorkel dimension limits have changed over time in response to better understanding of the effects of dead space and breathing resistance on carbon dioxide retention.\nOrientation and shape.\nSnorkels are made for two orientations: Front-mounted and side-mounted. The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels were popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when they were largely superseded by side-mounted snorkels for general use. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining and load balance. Front-mounted snorkels are attached to the head with a forehead bracket fitted with adjustable straps to be buckled around the head.\nSide-mounted snorkels are generally worn by scuba divers on the left-hand side of the head because the scuba regulator hose is routed over the right shoulder. They come in at least four basic shapes: J-shaped; L-shaped; flexible-hose; contour.\nIndependent snorkel construction.\nAn independent snorkel consists essentially of a curved tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips and gripped by the teeth.\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the demand end at the bottom where the mouthpiece is attached. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and curvature all affect breathing resistance.\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a red or orange band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak if done carelessly, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head can be seen in the illustration of connection methods.\nAttached to the demand end of the snorkel at the bottom of the barrel, the mouthpiece serves to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, typically natural rubber and latterly silicone or PVC. The commonest of the multiple designs available features a curved flange with two lugs to be gripped between the teeth:\nA disadvantage of mouthpieces with lugs is the presence of the teeth when breathing. The tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs, the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe.The lugs are meant to hold the teeth apart allowing the passage of air through the gap.\nAmong recent innovations is the \"collapsible snorkel\", which can be folded up in a pocket for emergencies for scuba divers who may not need a snorkel on every dive. One for competitive swimmers is a lightweight training snorkel with twin inlet tubes, which exhausts through a valve underwater, similar to the exhaust valve of a diving demand valve, so the dead space is restricted to the mouthpiece volume; another is a \"restrictor cap\" placed inside a snorkel barrel \"restricting breathing by 40% to increase cardiovascular strength and build lung capacity\". Some additional snorkel features such as shut-off and drain valves fell out of favour decades ago, only to return in the contemporary era as more reliable devices for incorporation into \"dry\" and \"semi-dry\" snorkels.\nIntegrated snorkels.\nIntegrated snorkels are single or multiple tubular devices integrated with, and opening into, a swim or dive mask, and a snorkel-mask is a swim or dive mask with single or multiple integrated snorkels. The integrated snorkel mask may be a half-mask, which encloses the eyes and nose but excludes the mouth, or a full-face snorkel mask, which covers the eyes, nose, and mouth. Early designs of snorkel-mask typically comprised a tube for breathing with an immersion-activated shut-off valve at the top, and the bottom opening into the mask, which might cover the mouth as well as the nose and eyes. Such snorkels tended to be permanent fixtures, but a minority could be detached from their sockets and replaced with plugs allowing the masks to be used without their snorkels.\nThe 1950s were the heyday of older-generation snorkel-masks, first for the pioneers of underwater hunting and then for the general public who swam in their wake. One authority of the time declared that \"the advantage of this kind of mask is mainly from the comfort point of view. It fits snugly to one's face, there is no mouthpiece to bite on, and one can breathe through either nose or mouth\". Another concluded that \"built-in snorkel masks are the best\" and \"a must for those who have sinus trouble.\" Yet others, including a co-founder of the British Sub-Aqua Club, deemed masks with integrated snorkels to be complicated and unreliable: \"Many have the breathing tube built in as an integral part of the mask. I have never seen the advantage of this, and this is the opinion shared by most experienced underwater swimmers I know\". These designs tend to have a large dead space in the mask in addition to the dead space of the snorkels. Six decades on, a new generation of snorkel-masks has come to the marketplace.\nLike separate snorkels, integrated snorkels come in a variety of forms. The assortment of older-generation masks with integrated snorkels highlights certain similarities and differences:\nIntegrated snorkels are tentatively classified here by their tube configuration and by the face coverage of the masks to which they are attached.\nEarly manufacturers and retailers generally classed integrated snorkel masks by the number of breathing tubes projecting from their tops and sides. Their terse product descriptions often read: \"single snorkel mask\", \"twin snorkel mask\", \"double snorkel mask\" or \"dual snorkel mask\".\nIntegrated snorkel construction.\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve to block water ingress during immersion, and opening at the bottom into the interior of a modified diving mask via sockets moulded into the rubber of the skirt or the plastic of the frame.\nIntegrated snorkel tubes are made of strong but lightweight rigid materials, usually a tough plastic. At the top end, they are fitted with valves made of plastic, rubber, or more recently, silicone. Three typical first generation shut-off valves are illustrated.\nIntegrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged or water will pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\nThe skirt of the diving mask attached to the snorkel is made of rubber, a synthetic elastomer, or latterly a silicone elastomer. First-generation snorkel masks have a single oval, round or rounded triangular lens retained in a groove in the skirt of the mask by a metal clamp. An adjustable head strap or harness ensures a snug fit on the wearer's face. The body of a mask with full-face coverage is fitted with a chinpiece to enable a complete leak-tight enclosure of the face, and to prevent the buoyancy of the mask from lifting it up the face and exposing the mouth.\nSome designs had unusual features. One design separated the eyes and the nose into separate mask compartments to reduce fogging and dead space. Others enabled the user to remove integrated snorkels and insert plugs instead, converting the snorkel-mask into an ordinary diving mask. Second generation snorkel-masks may enclose the nose and the mouth within an inner orinasal pocket which may be directly connected to the single snorkel with its float valve at the upper end.\nHalf-face snorkel masks.\nHalf-face snorkel-masks, or integrated snorkel half-masks, are based on standard diving half-masks with built-in breathing tubes topped with float valves. They cover the eyes and the nose only, excluding the mouth altogether. The integral snorkels enable swimmers to keep their mouths closed, inhaling and exhaling air through their noses instead, while they are at, or just below, the surface of the water. When the snorkel tops submerge, their float activated valves are supposed to shut off automatically, blocking nasal respiration and preventing mask flooding.\nApart from the integral tubes and their sockets, older snorkel-half-masks generally used the same lenses, skirts and straps used for standard diving masks without snorkels. Several models of this kind could be converted to standard masks by replacing their detachable tubes with air- and water-tight plugs. Conversely, the 1950s Typhoon Super Star and the modern-retro Fish Brand M4D diving half-masks came with sealed but snorkel-ready sockets at the top of the skirt moulding. The 1950s US Divers \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage only and a separate snorkel for the mouth.\nThere are numerous mid-twentieth-century examples of commercially available snorkel-masks covering the eyes and the nose only, requiring the user to breathe through the nose while face down on the surface, but allowing immediate mouth breathing in an emergency if the head is lifted so that the mouth clears the water. New-generation versions remain relatively rare commodities in the early twenty-first century.\nFull-face snorkel masks.\nFull-face snorkel masks (FFSMs) allow users to breathe nasally or orally and can avoid gag reflex in response to standard snorkel mouthpieces. The breathing air path through a full-face snorkel mask can vary depending on basic layout and internal details.\nSome first-generation snorkel masks were full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others excluded the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only. They did not use an orinasal pocket, and had a two-directional airflow, with a large dead space, and mixing of fresh and exhaled air in the mask volume.\nMost second-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth. The integral snorkel of a second generation full-face snorkel mask may have separate channels for inhaled and exhaled air to minimise mechanical dead space, which is the volume of exhaled air inhaled on the next breath. It is not practicable to eliminate all mechanical dead space.\nIn all cases fresh air enters through the snorkel tube at the top of the mask when the user inhales. This passes into the upper part of the mask and over the inner face of the viewport. If there is an inner divider isolating an orinasal pocket, air from the upper section will pass into it via holes provided for that purpose. These holes may be fitted with non-return valves. The air then enters the user's nose or mouth into the anatomical air passages, and some reaches the alveoli of the lungs, where gas exchange with the blood occurs. On exhalation, air passes back into the orinasal pocket, and if there are non-return valves on the inlet ports, and the orinasal pocket seals correctly against the user's face, it is constrained to pass through the exhaust ducting, either to an alternative exhaust tube in the snorkel, or to exhaust ports in the body of the mask, and out into the surroundings, either above or into the water. If there are functioning non-return valves in the exhaust ducting at any point, and no leaks to other air spaces, the exhaled air will not return to the orinasal pocket by this route on inhalation. The exact positioning of the non-return valves in the inhalation and exhalation parts of the circuit may affect the effective dead space to some extent, but their presence in both parts, and a small orinasal pocket volume, are critical to minimising carbon dioxide buildup, and consequent hypercapnia. It is also necessary that the orinasal pocket skirt seal against the face between the two inner compartments is effective if the mask relies on non-return valves in the orinasal moulding to prevent backflow to the upper compartment.\nThe orinasal pocket and one way airflow prevent warm, moisture saturated, exhaled air from flowing over the inside surface of the viewport, which reduces the amount of fogging. \nThe exhaust ports lead from the orinasal pocket to the outside of the mask, either directly, or through ducting in the sides of the mask. An exhaust port at the bottom of the orinasal pocket can drain moderate quantities of water from inside the orinasal chamber. \nOther positions for exhaust ports have been through alternative snorkel channels, and at the temples, which reduce hydrostatic back pressure at the cost of a longer flow path with more frictional resistance. Manually blocking temple exhaust ports and forcibly exhaling will drain water from the mask interior through a chin drain port. Design details of ducting and valves will affect breathing effort at different flow rates. Variations on this system are used by several manufacturers with a history of manufacturing breathing apparatus for scuba diving and industrial breathing apparatus. They generally provide warnings that the masks are not suitable for freediving or extended exertion.\nUnless the snorkeler is able to equalize their ears without pinching their nose, a full-face snorkel mask can only be used at or near the surface, since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose. A full-face snorkel mask with an orinasal pocket using non-return valves in the ports between the orinasal and main chambers to force a one-way flow of air to minimise dead space cannot be equalised by partially exhaling through the nose or mouth during descent, so will cause mask squeeze if used for diving.\nA problem with all full-face breathing masks is that the skirt must fit around the whole face well enough to form a reliable watertight seal, and since no two faces are the same shape, it is necessary for each user to test each model of mask for a good fit. Small amounts of water can be purged through the lower exhaust port where present, but in the event of major flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing, which requires quick release straps.\nFull-face masks are easy to use in ideal conditions, without special knowledge or training, so the user may not learn the skills of quick removal and clearing which may be necessary when conditions are less ideal, and the mask floods or necessary exertion increases carbon dioxide levels. Under these conditions the untrained and unskilled user may react inappropriately or panic, with a risk of drowning. FFSMs are considerably bulkier than half masks, and quite light for their size because of the tough plastic viewport, but the viewport is also easily scratched. Some models can be fitted with optional frames with corrective lenses, and wireless voice communications systems.\nAs a result of an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii in 2019, there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess carbon dioxide, particularly in cheaper versions of full-face snorkel masks marketed by manufacturers with no track record in breathing equipment. High carbon dioxide levels are known to induce discomfort, a feeling of suffocation, an urgent need to breathe, and panic, which may be combined with irrational responses and a high risk of drowning. It is not certain that the masks are at fault, or which models, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some makes of the masks, have excessive dead space and are difficult to quickly remove in an emergency, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment, and that ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack basic skills and experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.\nDuring the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic related shortages, some full-face snorkel masks were adapted to use as oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by using 3D printed adaptors and carrying out minimal modifications to the original mask. French sportwear and snorkel masks producer Decathlon temporarily discontinued its sale of snorkel masks, redirecting them toward medical staff, patients and 3D printer operations.\nAssociated equipment.\nVision aids\nIf a separate snorkel is used, the user will usually wear a diving half mask or swimming goggles to improve underwater vision. By creating an airspace in front of the cornea, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. Scuba- and freediving masks consist of flat lenses, also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold the mask in place. There are different styles and shapes, which range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose, as there is no need to equalise the internal pressure. In this case a nose clip may be used if needed.\nSwimming aids\nThe most common swimming aids used by snorkellers are swimfins. A snorkelling vest may be used for buoyancy.\nEnvironmental protection\nIt is common for snorkellers to wear protection against exposure to cold water and the ultra-violet in sunlight. A wetsuit is most popular for thermal protection, and a wetsuit, diving skins or a rash vest provide various levels of UV protection. Often worn by snorkellers during the 1950s and early 1960s, dry suits have seen something of a resurgence in the new millennium for surface snorkelling in lakes and rivers.\nSafety and competition standards.\nTo comply with the current European standard EN 1972 (2015), a tube snorkel for users with larger lung capacities should not exceed 38 centimeters (15\") in length and 230 cubic centimeters (14 cu. in.) in internal volume, while the corresponding figures for users with smaller lung capacities are 35 cm (14\") and 150 cc (9¼ cu. in.) respectively.\nThere is currently (2023) no definitive standard for performance of full-face snorkel masks or other forms of integrated mask and snorkel, but there are standards for similar equipment which may be partially applicable, and may be useful to estimate probable safety in the absence of legal requirements.\nCurrent World Underwater Federation (CMAS) Surface Finswimming Rules (2017) require snorkels used in official competitions to have a total length between 43 and 48 cm (17\" and 19\") and to have an inner diameter between 1.5 and 2.3 cm (½\" and 1\").\nA full-face snorkel mask may be considered as combining the technology of tube snorkels and gas masks, and to a considerably lesser extent, of full-face scuba masks, which combine the technology of gas masks and scuba regulators, but the snorkel mask does not contain a pressure reducing mechanism for breathing gas, and is not intended for use at significant depths underwater. The safety and ergonomic requirements for gas masks are logically the most directly applicable, and some of the requirements for snorkels, such as EN 1972 (Diving equipment - Snorkels - Requirements and test methods), will also apply. Specifically, the maximum dead space volume of 230 cc is relevant, as tube bore and length are not relevant if the breathing passage is a one-way circuit for the tube component, and breathing effort limit of 10 mbar (100 mm water column, 0.1 msw) for both inhalation and exhalation is relevant.\nMost functional requirements for compressed air breathing apparatus, such as specified in EN 250 (Respiratory equipment. Open-circuit self-contained compressed air diving apparatus. Requirements, testing, marking), are not logically relevant as the snorkel mask does not use compressed air or supply air at raised ambient pressures.\nEN 136 (Respiratory protective devices - Full-face masks - Requirements, testing and marking) has relevance for some aspects of performance, and gives a maximum limit for concentration of carbon dioxide in masks with orinasal pockets of 1% at a ventilation rate of 50 litres per minute The carbon dioxide limit is the same for EN 1972 and EN 136. This criterion has been used by at least one manufacturer of FFSMs.\nFor comparison, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set limits for the acceptable concentration of carbon dioxide in workplace environments. These are 0.5% by volume (5000 ppm) for continuous exposure, (10 hour shift periods in 40 hour working weeks), and a short term exposure limit of 3% (for periods of up to 15 minutes)."

During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing .\nMajor League career.\nCleveland Indians.\nLocke made his Indians' debut in 1959 against the Boston Red Sox. He was the starting pitcher for the Indians, and his first pitch was to Don Buddin. After recording two outs, the first hit he gave up was to Vic Wertz, which resulted in Gene Stephens scoring the first run against Locke. In his debut he pitched for 5 2/3 innings and gave up five runs, but still managed to walk away with the no-decision. However, his main contribution to his debut was hitting a home run off Frank Sullivan, which resulted in three runs being scored. This was to be the only home run of his career.\nIn 1959 overall, he posted a 3.13 ERA in 24 games, seven of them started. He struck out 40 batters, walked 41 and posted a record of 3–2.\nIn 1960, Locke posted a 3–5 record, with an ERA of 3.37.

Opened in May 1974, it consistently ranks as one of the country’s top resorts. \nThe resort is home to The Sanctuary at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, a Forbes Five Star/AAA Five Diamond 255-room hotel and spa. The resort also manages nearly 500 private villas and homes and has more than a dozen restaurants. \nBest known for its golf courses, the resort also contains the Roy Barth Tennis Center, which features 22 tennis courts and is home to the Barth-Hawtin Tennis Academy.\nGolf.\nKiawah Island Golf Resort is home to five championship golf courses, most notably The Ocean Course, added in 1991.\nThe Ocean Course.\nThe Ocean Course is the most famous course at Kiawah Island, and was designed by Pete and Alice Dye. The course was designed so that players have a view of the shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean, but also to expose golfers to the often-strong winds in the area. The Ocean Course has been consistently named as one of the best courses in the world by several publications such as \"Golf Digest\" and \"Golf Magazine\" as well as being named a \"Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary\" by Audubon International for its design protecting native bird species. , the Ocean Course was rated 25th in \"Golf Digest\"'s 100 Greatest Golf Courses in America.\nThe Ocean Course is a par 72 course and from the championship tees, it stretches to with a slope rating of 155 and a course rating of 79.1, the highest in the country according to the United States Golf Association. Because of its large slopes, numerous bunkers, and challenging Bermuda grass, it was named the toughest course in America in 2010 by \"Golf Digest\".\nThe Ocean Course was featured in the 2000 film \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\". In October 2008, the Ocean Course became the first course to be available to play in the online video game that was developed by World Golf Tour. Helicopters equipped with cameras and GPS tracking devices were used to photograph and record the entire course to produce a geographically accurate simulation.\nTournaments held.\nThe Ocean Course first became well known in its first year when it hosted the Ryder Cup in 1991. The United States team defeated Europe 14½–13½. The windy Ocean Course made for difficult playing conditions, and the United States team only won when Bernhard Langer of Germany missed a par-saving putt that would have defeated Hale Irwin, tied the overall score at 14-all, and retained the cup for Europe.\nIn 1996, the Ocean Course hosted a match on Shell's Wonderful World of Golf between Annika Sörenstam and Dottie Pepper. The course hosted the World Cup of Golf twice – in 1997 and in 2003. In 1997, Pádraig Harrington and Paul McGinley won the team title, with Colin Montgomerie winning the individual title. When the World Cup returned in 2003, Trevor Immelman and Rory Sabbatini won the team competition.\nThe Ocean Course hosted the PGA Club Professional Championship in 2005, won by Mike Small, the golf coach at the University of Illinois, with a score of 289. It also hosted the Senior PGA Championship in May 2007, when Denis Watson won his first golf tournament in twenty-three years, beating Eduardo Romero by two strokes.\nThe PGA Championship was played at the Ocean Course in August 2012 with Rory McIlroy winning by a record eight strokes. The championship returned to the Ocean Course in May 2021, and was won by Phil Mickelson, who became the oldest major champion in history at the age of 50.\nTurtle Point.\nThe Turtle Point course was designed by Jack Nicklaus and has also received accolades from \"Golf Digest\" magazine. Turtle Point has hosted regional tournaments such as the Carolina Amateur.\nThe Turtle Point course is a par 72 course. From the tournament tees, it measures and has a slope rating of 73/134.\nOsprey Point.\nThe Osprey Point course at Kiawah Island was designed by Tom Fazio.\nThe Osprey point course is a par 72 course. It measures from the tournament tees, and it has a slope rating of 72.8/135.\nOak Point.\nDesigned by Clyde Johnston, the Oak Point course was purchased by the Kiawah Island Resort in 1997. \nOak Point plays to a par of 72, and it measures from the tournament tees with a slope rating of 71.9/130.\nCougar Point.\nThe Cougar Point golf course was originally named Marsh Point, and Gary Player redesigned it in 1996. It is a par 72 course and from the tournament tees it measures with a slope rating of 72.7/134.\nExpansion.\nBeginning spring 2018, Kiawah Island Golf Resort launched a three-year development that includes a new clubhouse at Cougar Point Golf Course, a non-denominational chapel at The Sanctuary, the West Beach Village Conference Center, a new villa check-in facility in West Beach, four cottages near The Ocean Course Clubhouse, and a complete renovation of Night Heron Park."

        "title": "Triple-A (baseball)",
        "text": "Triple-A (officially Class AAA) has been the highest level of play in Minor League Baseball in the United States since 1946. Currently, two leagues operate at the Triple-A level, the International League (IL) and the Pacific Coast League (PCL). There are 30 teams, one per each Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, with 20 in the IL and 10 in the PCL. Triple-A teams are generally located in smaller cities as well as larger metropolitan areas without MLB teams, such as Austin, Jacksonville, Columbus, and Indianapolis. Four Triple-A teams play in the same metro areas as their parent clubs.\nAll current Triple-A teams are located in the United States; before 2008, some Triple-A leagues also fielded teams in Canada, and from 1967 to 2020 the Mexican League was classified as Triple-A. Reasons for the relocation of these teams were solely because of costs and attendance. Other than the current two Triple-A leagues, only three other leagues have ever held the classification.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1946, the top level of Minor League Baseball was Double-A, which had been established in 1912. The Triple-A classification was created before the 1946 season, and began with all three leagues then in Double-A moving up to the new level:\nThis structure persisted for the next 75 years with only a few changes:\nThe IL, PCL, and Mexican League continued as Triple-A leagues until Major League Baseball reorganized the minor leagues prior to the 2021 season. At that time, the IL and PCL were temporarily renamed Triple-A East and Triple-A West, respectively. The Mexican League continues to operate, independently. Following MLB's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, they announced on March 16, 2022, that the leagues would once again be called the International League and the Pacific Coast League, effective with the 2022 season.\nCountries.\nWhile all current and the majority of past Triple-A teams have been located in the United States, Triple-A teams have also been based in:\nPurpose.\nThe main purpose of Triple-A teams is to prepare players for the major leagues. In 2010, ESPN wrote:\nBoth young players and veterans play for Triple-A teams:\nMost, if not all, of the players on an MLB team's \"expanded roster\" who are not currently on the team's \"active roster\" are assigned to the team's Triple-A club. Expanded rosters consist of 40 players, while active rosters generally consist of 26 players as of the 2021 season. Most Triple-A teams are located geographically close to their MLB parent club, as activating a Triple-A player as an injury replacement is a common occurrence.\nThe term \"AAAA player,\" pronounced \"four-A\" or \"quadruple-A,\" refers to a player who is consistently successful when playing for Triple-A teams, but is not successful at the major league level. The term is usually used derisively and has itself been criticized as flawed. Major league team executives and managers disagree whether AAAA players exist.\nLeagues.\nTeams at this level are divided into two leagues: the International League and the Pacific Coast League. The International League fields teams primarily in the Eastern United States, while the Pacific Coast League fields teams mostly in the Western United States. Each of the 30 major league teams has an affiliation with one Triple-A team in the United States.\nTriple-A All-Star Game.\nThe Triple-A All-Star Game was a single game held between the two affiliated Triple-A leagues—the International League and the Pacific Coast League. Each league fielded a team composed of the top players in their respective leagues as voted on by fans, the media, and each club's field manager and general manager. The event took place every year since 1988 when the first Triple-A All-Star Game was played in Buffalo, New York. Prior to 1998, a team of American League-affiliated Triple-A All-Stars faced off against a team of National League-affiliated Triple-A All-Stars.\nTraditionally, the game was held on the day after the mid-summer Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Such games mark a symbolic halfway-point in the season, despite occurring later than the actual halfway-point of most seasons. Both Triple-A leagues shared a common All-Star break, with no regular-season games scheduled for two days before the All-Star Game itself. Some additional events, such as the All-Star Fan Fest and Triple-A Home Run Derby, were held each year during this break in the regular season.\nWhile the 2021 schedule originally included a three-day All-Star break of July 12–14, this was removed after Opening Day was pushed back one month. Team schedules for the 2021 season were subsequently issued without an All-Star break.\nTriple-A Championship.\nBeginning in 2006, the annual Triple-A National Championship Game was held to serve as a single championship game between the champions of the International League and Pacific Coast League to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball. It was originally held annually at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, and known as the Bricktown Showdown. Starting in 2011, the game was held in a different Triple-A city each year. Previous postseason interleague championships include the Junior World Series (1932–34, 1936–62, 1970–71, 1973–74), Triple-A World Series (1983, 1998–2000), and Triple-A Classic (1988–91).\nFor the 2021 season, in place of the National Championship Game, Minor League Baseball extended the Triple-A regular season to October 3, with league champions determined based on regular-season records through the original end date of the season (September 19 for Triple-A East, and September 21 for Triple-A West). The final 10 games of the season, played after those dates, were deemed the \"Final Stretch\", with the team posting the best winning percentage during that period (the Durham Bulls, who went 9–1) winning a cash prize. Since the 2022 season, the Triple-A National Championship Game has been played between the champions of the International League and the Pacific Coast League. In 2023, the Triple-A Championship game was played at the Las Vegas Ballpark. The winner of this game were the Norfolk Tides.\nPace-of-play initiatives.\nAs a part of professional baseball's pace of play initiatives implemented in 2015, 20-second pitch clocks entered use at Triple-A stadiums in 2015. In 2018, the time was shortened to 15 seconds when no runners are on base. Other significant changes implemented in 2018 included beginning extra innings with a runner on second base and limiting teams to six mound visits during a nine-inning game. For the 2019 season, the number of mound visits was reduced to five, and pitchers were required to face a minimum of three consecutive batters unless the side is retired or the pitcher becomes injured and is unable to continue playing."

Taylor, and Rhode Island casino owner Ferdinand Abell formed a group that raised the money to found the Brooklyn ball club in 1883, known originally as simply the \"Brooklyns\". They leased land on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn to build Washington Park, the team's original home, which cost $30,000. In its first year, the team played in the minor-league Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs, winning the league championship. Having attracted a following, the owners moved the franchise in 1884 to the American Association (AA), a competitor to the more established National League (NL), that catered to a more working-class crowd.\nAfter managing the team from 1885 to 1887, Byrne saw the franchise join the National League in 1890, and remained in the ownership group until his death in 1898. Under his tenure, the team, known variously as the Brooklyns, Bridegrooms and Grooms, posted a record of 567-506 and won two league championships (the AA in 1889 and the NL in 1890).\nByrne was in ill health at the time of the National League meeting in November 1897, but he insisted on making the journey from Virginia, where he had been recovering, to the event in Philadelphia.

        "text": "The 2008 British Grand Prix (officially the 2008 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 6 July 2008 at the Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, England. It was the ninth race of the 2008 Formula One World Championship. The race was held over 60 with a practice and qualifying round preceding the race.\nHeikki Kovalainen started from pole position alongside Mark Webber in second and Kimi Räikkönen in third on the . On the first corner, Lewis Hamilton rose from fourth on the grid to second overtaking Webber and Räikkönen. Hamilton shadowed Kovalainen for the early stages of the race, until he took the lead on lap five. The race was won by Hamilton, racing for McLaren Mercedes ahead of Nick Heidfeld for BMW Sauber in second and Rubens Barrichello third in a Honda. Räikkönen made the fastest lap of the race on lap 18. Hamilton's drive was widely acclaimed as one of Formula One's finest wet-weather drives.\nOf the 20 drivers competing, 13 finished the race, with eight receiving world championship points. Hamilton's win tied him for the lead of the Drivers' Championship, alongside Felipe Massa and Räikkönen. In the Constructors Championship, Ferrari's lead was reduced to 14 points over BMW Sauber, with McLaren a further 10 behind.\nBackground.\nThe 2008 British Grand Prix was held on 6 July 2008 at the Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, England. The grand prix was contested by 20 drivers, in 10 teams of two. The teams, also known as \"constructors\", were Scuderia Ferrari, McLaren Mercedes, Renault F1, Honda Racing F1, Force India-Ferrari, BMW Sauber, Toyota F1, Red Bull Racing-Renault, WilliamsF1-Toyota and Scuderia Toro Rosso-Ferrari.\nBefore the race, Ferrari driver Felipe Massa led the Drivers' Championship with 48 points, BMW driver Robert Kubica trailed by two points, and Massa's teammate Kimi Räikkönen was third on 43 points. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton was fourth with 38 points, 10 points ahead of Kubica's teammate Nick Heidfeld. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari led with 91 points, BMW Sauber were second with 74 points, and McLaren were third with 58 points. Red Bull Renault were in fourth with 24 points, one point ahead of Toyota in fifth. Ferrari were the dominant team prior to the race: their drivers had won five out of eight races, including finishes at the Bahrain, Spanish, and in the previous race, the . Kubica had performed consistently for BMW Sauber, only failing to score once, and had won his first race four weeks earlier at the .\nDespite wins for Hamilton at the Australian and , he was facing pressure approaching Silverstone. He had fallen from first to fourth in the Drivers' Championship after failing to score in the previous two races. At the Canadian Grand Prix, he had after making contact with a stationary Raikkonen who was waiting at a red light in the pit lane. This led to a ten-place grid penalty for the following race at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours where he failed to score after receiving a for overtaking Sebastian Vettel by missing a chicane. After the race he responded angrily and to the negative press coverage he had been receiving, saying: \"There's nothing you can do that can distract me. You can keep on giving me penalties, whatever you want. I'll keep battling, and trying to come back with a result.\" However, he remained upbeat about his likelihood of winning the championship and was \"confident\" going into the weekend.\nThree days of testing took place at the Silverstone circuit, from 25 to 27 June. Massa set the fastest time on the first day with a 1:20.188, 0.3 faster than Heikki Kovalainen, but was unable to escape the track after suffering a mechanical failure with 30 minutes to go which forced the session to be red-flagged. Kovalainen improved on the second day to go fastest with a 1:20.015. Strong winds caused Giancarlo Fisichella to crash heavily at Becketts corner; he was uninjured, although medical checks meant he was unable to do further testing in the afternoon. On the third and final day, Hamilton set the quickest time with a 1:19.170, over 0.6 seconds ahead of second-fastest Timo Glock.\nBefore the race, the FIA announced that Donington Park had been awarded a ten-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010, providing major renovations were completed. The British Racing Drivers' Club, owners of the Silverstone circuit, were disappointed with the announcement stating that development plans for the circuit had been progressing well. They were also critical of the timing of the announcement, being made on the weekend the circuit celebrated its 60th anniversary of hosting the British Grand Prix. Also before the race, Red Bull driver David Coulthard announced he was to retire at the end of the season, saying: \"My decision was taken earlier this year and is based on a desire to stop while I am still competitive\". He also explained the timing of his retirement saying \"the decision to make this announcement at the British Grand Prix should be an obvious one for all to understand, as I have achieved two of my F1 victories at Silverstone and I am a member of the British Racing Drivers' Club, which hosts this event.\"\nPractice and qualifying.\nThree practice sessions were held before the race held on Sunday. Two of the practice sessions were held on Friday, both lasting 90 minutes; and one on Saturday morning, lasting an hour. Massa was fastest in the first session, with a time of 1:19.575, despite a crash forcing him to miss the last 30 minutes. Fernando Alonso's Renault engine failed, leaving slippery oil on the racing line at Stowe corner. Massa approached the corner and lost control of his car, spinning off the circuit colliding with the barriers. He was unhurt, but his car was too damaged to continue. The session was stopped for 18 minutes to recover his car and cover the oil with cement dust. This left track conditions difficult, and nobody could beat Massa's time in the remainder of the session. It finished with Massa ahead of Kovalainen and Hamilton by less than one-tenth of a second; Raikkonen and Kubica were fourth and fifth-fastest, respectively.\nIn the second session, Kovalainen was fastest, over half a second ahead of Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Hamilton, and Webber's teammate David Coulthard. Massa missed the first half of the session as his car was still being repaired, and was eighth-fastest. Both Toyota drivers had problems: Timo Glock stopped on the track with a clutch problem; and Jarno Trulli crashed heavily at Stowe after a problem with his rear wing, although he was not hurt. Alonso set the fastest time in the final practice session, which took place in damp conditions following rain earlier in the morning. Early laps were attempted on extreme wet tyres, but the track dried throughout the session, prompting a move to intermediate wet tyres and, with around 20 minutes left, a further switch to dry tyres. Webber finished the session in second place, a quarter of a second slower than Alonso, and Kovalainen was third fastest ahead of Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel.\nThe qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three rounds. The first lasted 20 minutes and eliminated the cars which finished the session 16th or lower. The second lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars which finished in positions 11 to 15. The final round of qualifying determined the order of the top ten drivers. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and so they carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.\nKovalainen took his first Formula One pole position with a time of 1:21.049, half a second faster than anyone else. Webber would start alongside him on the front row, the Red Bull team's best qualifying result to date, and Räikkönen would start from third. Hamilton qualified fourth, opting for a more conservative approach to his second flying lap after he had pushed too hard on his first run and slid into the gravel. Nick Heidfeld was fifth quickest for BMW Sauber, ahead of Alonso, Alonso's teammate Nelson Piquet Jr., and Vettel. Championship leader Massa could only qualify ninth after a slow tyre change in the final session left him unable to record a second timed lap.\nKubica did not set a time in the final session due to a technical problem with his car, meaning he started from tenth; the first race all season he had qualified behind teammate Heidfeld. Webber's teammate David Coulthard qualified eleventh for his final British Grand Prix, narrowly missing out on the last part of qualifying, and blamed problems with his car earlier in the day which had reduced his practice time. Sébastien Bourdais was thirteenth splitting the two Toyota cars of Glock and Trulli. Kazuki Nakajima was the slowest of the cars to make the second round of qualifying, and would start the race fifteenth. Both Honda drivers failed to get past the first stage of qualifying, but were ahead of Rosberg in eighteenth, who had suspension problems. Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella finished in the last two positions for Force India.\nRace.\nThere was persistent rain in the morning, leaving standing water on the track, although it had abated by the time the race began. The track temperature was and the air temperature was . All drivers chose to start on the intermediate wet tyres. Rosberg started from the pit lane after a number of set-up changes.\nThe front three drivers (Kovalainen, Webber and Räikkönen) all struggled for grip off the start, allowing Hamilton to edge ahead into the first corner. Kovalainen who had the better line, however, retook the lead after brushing tyres with Hamilton, who tucked in behind his teammate. A number of drivers struggled with the standing water on the first lap: Webber spun coming onto the Hangar straight, falling from fourth to last place; Massa spun going into Bridge, where he was passed by everyone except Webber; and Coulthard and Vettel ended up in a gravel trap after a collision, forcing them both to retire and bringing out the safety car, which was deployed for one lap and pulled off into pit-lane on lap two.\nAlonso showed good early pace, passing Piquet and Heidfeld on laps two and three respectively, and setting the fastest time of any driver on laps four and five. Massa spun for the second time during his third lap, dropping him to the back of the field. Hamilton shadowed Kovalainen closely for several laps, and passed him going into Stowe on lap five. Hamilton quickly extended his lead over Kovalainen, and there was already a six-second gap by the tenth lap when Kovalainen spun and was passed by Räikkönen. However, as the track dried, Räikkönen showed the better pace—particularly in the last two sectors—and the gap was under a second by the time they both pitted on lap 21.\nMcLaren gave Hamilton a new set of intermediate wet tyres; in contrast, Ferrari gambled that the track would continue to dry and refuelled Räikkönen without changing his tyres. Despite his pit stop being longer by half a second, Hamilton exited just in front of Räikkönen (Heidfeld briefly took the lead until his pitstop the following lap). McLaren were vindicated in their decision almost immediately: the rain returned and Räikkönen was unable to find grip, falling back from Hamilton by up to eight seconds a lap. By lap 27, Kovalainen and Heidfeld had caught the struggling Räikkönen. As Kovalainen overtook Räikkönen, Heidfeld passed them both to take second place. On the same lap, Fisichella spun out and retired; his Force India teammate Sutil had already retired after a spin on lap 11. After being passed by Kubica and Piquet, Räikkönen finally pitted for fresh tyres on lap 30, dropping him to eleventh place.\nKubica overtook Kovalainen for third place, shortly before Kovalainen pitted for the second time. Despite the rain getting heavier he opted for a new set of intermediate tyres. Both Kubica and Glock left the track and rejoined; however Glock lost a place to his teammate Trulli. On lap 37, both Hondas elected to change onto the extreme wet-weather tyres, Button queuing behind his teammate in the pitlane while waiting to be serviced. Nelson Piquet Jr. spun off the track and beached his car in a gravel trap, ending his race, while in separate incidents within a few moments of each other Hamilton, Kubica, and Massa all lost control of their cars and travelled over the grass before rejoining the track, without any damage. Räikkönen also spun off on the same lap again rejoining the circuit without damaging the car. Hamilton, leading the race by around 30 seconds, made a pitstop to change tyres and take on fuel on lap 38, opting for a new set of the intermediate wet-weather tyres, as the weather forecast predicted the rain would ease. Second-placed driver Heidfeld pitted the following lap, opting for the same tyre choice as Hamilton. The gap between the two leaders was 36 seconds. Kimi Räikkönen spun off in his Ferrari for the second time in as many laps, again though he avoided contact with the barriers and was able to rejoin the track.\nWith 20 laps of the race remaining, Rubens Barrichello on the extreme wet weather tyres was around nine seconds a lap quicker than the majority of the field and quickly moved his way up to fourth place by passing Kovalainen and Alonso. Robert Kubica retired from the race after losing control of his car and ending up beached in a gravel trap. Nico Rosberg ran into the back of eighth-placed Timo Glock as he attempted to overtake. The collision damaged Rosberg's front wing, and he was forced to make a pit-stop to change it. By now the rain had stopped, but the track surface was still wet. Barrichello caught and passed Trulli and Heidfeld for second place, however a refuelling problem at his earlier pit stop meant that he would need to stop again. He built up a twenty-second gap over Heidfeld before making his pit stop on lap 47, opting to change to the intermediate wet weather tyres. He rejoined in third place, behind Heidfeld. Kovalainen passed Alonso for fifth place at the Bridge corner. Trulli then pitted, promoting Kovalainen to fourth. Felipe Massa spun on the exit of Woodcote corner, managing to recover without any damage. A few moments later Mark Webber made a similar error at the same location. The following lap saw a spin from Kovalainen, which allowed Alonso and Räikkönen to get past while he recovered to the circuit.\nMassa, the last car on the road still running in 13th position, spun for the fifth time during the race. He continued without any damage, and made a pit stop the following lap for new tyres and fuel. The final few laps saw a battle for fourth place, as first Räikkönen and then Kovalainen passed Alonso. Hamilton crossed the finish line on lap 60 to win the Grand Prix by 68 seconds from Nick Heidfeld in second. The margin of victory was the largest since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Rubens Barrichello finished in third position for Honda's best finish of the 2008 season. Kimi Räikkönen finished in fourth ahead of Kovalainen and Alonso. Räikkönen had also set the fastest lap in the early stages of the race, the sixth consecutive race in which he had done so. Jarno Trulli finished in seventh position, and Kazuki Nakajima finished the race in eighth.\nPost-race.\nThe top three finishers appeared on the podium to receive trophies and took part in the subsequent press conference. Hamilton commented on the difficult conditions, comparing them to the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, and the limited visibility: \"I couldn't see through my visor, so through turn one and two I had to clean visor, put it up and back down again. I had to do that on every lap especially when it was rained. I couldn't see anything. It was so extreme, so tough, a real mental challenge.\" He also thanked the fans for their support.\nHeidfeld said it was vital to make the correct tyre decisions, and also spoke about the challenging weather: \"The most difficult moments in the race were when cars were overtaking me who had been lapped, but were just on better tyres for the conditions at that time. There was so much water and I couldn't see where it was lying.\" Barrichello, who took his first podium since the 2005 United States Grand Prix, described it as a \"perfect race\". He said that after he switched to extreme wet tyres, he was \"passing people from inside to outside, it was just magic\".\nAfter the race, Hamilton tied with Massa and Räikkönen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship all on 48 points. Kubica dropped behind Räikkönen and Hamilton but remained two points behind the championship leaders, with Heidfeld remaining fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, BMW reduced Ferrari's lead to 14 points. McLaren made up six points on BMW, although they were still 10 points behind."

        "text": "James Zell McDonald (born October 19, 1984) is an American former right-handed professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nMcDonald was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 11th round of the June 2002 MLB Draft, and as a draft and follow pick, he played at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, California.\nEarly life.\nMcDonald attended Long Beach Poly High School, where he played baseball, basketball and football. He played in the infield and pitched, however, he was selected by the Dodgers in 2002 more for his ability as a first baseman instead of a pitcher. But in junior college, McDonald's pitching improved so exponentially that he was signed by Los Angeles.\nProfessional baseball career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nHe made his professional debut pitching for the Gulf Coast Dodgers in , where he compiled a modest 3.33 ERA with 47 strikeouts over 48.2 innings of work, although unfortunately a case of tendinitis prevented him from pitching in and most of the . But instead of opting for a rehab program, McDonald and others were still interested in his hitting ability. He made the switch to outfield, thinking he could still work with trainers while keeping occupied in left field, but after sub-.230 batting averages in '04 with the Gulf Coast Dodgers and again in 2005 with the Ogden Raptors, he expressed his desire to return to pitching. \"When I was in the outfield, I felt like I was just running around. I am a lot more competitive when I'm pitching, it's more up to me to get guys out.\" he explained to Bill Shelley. In , he was back on the hill full-time for the South Atlantic League's Columbus Catfish where he led the pitching staff with an ERA of 3.97 and 147 strikeouts in 143 innings of work but only managed to finish with a record of 5–10. McDonald started with the Inland Empire 66ers before he was promoted to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. He was named the Dodgers' Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2007. In August 2008, he was promoted to the Dodgers Triple-A affiliate, Las Vegas 51s. He went 1–0 in his first two starts, striking out 20 batters in that span. He was called up to the Dodgers on September 1, 2008. He made his major league debut on September 17, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, working one scoreless inning in relief. In February 2009, McDonald was named the #56 prospect in baseball by Baseball America. McDonald then earned a spot in the Dodgers' starting rotation to begin the 2009 season and started his first game in the majors on April 10, 2009, at Chase Field against the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing five runs in a little over two innings. He made three more starts, only lasting as many as five innings in one (April 25 against the Colorado Rockies, his first career victory), and then was demoted back to the bullpen. With an ERA of 6.75, he was optioned back to AAA on May 14, and then recalled by the Dodgers on June 19. After being recalled, he pitched exclusively out of the bullpen the rest of the season. McDonald began 2010 in the starting rotation for the Albuquerque Isotopes. He was recalled by the Dodgers to start the game on July 19 against the San Francisco Giants. He made a few additional appearances in the bullpen for the Dodgers.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn July 31, 2010, McDonald was traded along with outfielder Andrew Lambo to the Pittsburgh Pirates for reliever Octavio Dotel. In his Pirates debut, he pitched 6 innings of shutout ball against the Colorado Rockies and set a career-high with eight strikeouts in a 5–1 Pirates victory. \"I was just real excited today and ready to be on the mound and to get a chance to start every five days,\" said McDonald. \"I was having fun today. When you get ahead, pitching can be fun.\"\nMcDonald then pitched two consecutive shutouts, first on September 7, 2010 against the Atlanta Braves in a 5–0 Pirates victory and second on September 13 against the New York Mets. His streak of 20 straight scoreless innings, the longest by any Pirate pitcher since Zach Duke threw 22 straight scoreless innings in 2005, was ended against the Arizona Diamondbacks on September 18 although McDonald still earned the win to move to 4–1 at PNC Park. His performances prompted Jack Moore of Fangraphs to call McDonald an \"ace\" for the Pirates and the biggest steal of the 2010 MLB Trading Deadline.\nHe completed the 2010 with a 4–5 record with a 3.52 ERA and 61 strikeouts in Pittsburgh over a span of 11 starts.\n2011.\nMcDonald allowed 21 earned runs over his first four starts, but finished May with a 2.86 ERA while giving up no more than three runs in any start. On two consecutive starts on July 19 and 25, McDonald allowed 0 runs against the Cincinnati Reds and the Atlanta Braves. Following the Atlanta game where McDonald out-dueled Braves ace Tim Hudson and struck out nine while walking none, he spoke about his control during the first half of the season. \"It's been an issue for me this year. I told myself in the second half I was going to keep my walks down. Being ahead is a big key for me.\" The win helped propel the Pirates into a first-place tie in the NL Central with St. Louis. McDonald finished the season 9–9 with a 4.21 ERA, 142 strikeouts and 78 walks over 171 innings of work.\n2012.\nTo begin the 2012 campaign, McDonald delivered several quality starts before earning his first victory of the season on April 30 against Atlanta, a -inning, 10 strikeout performance. On May 17, McDonald set a new career-high for strikeouts with 11 against the Washington Nationals, while also taking a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. During the month of May, he posted a record of 3–1 with a sparkling 1.54 ERA. On June 21, McDonald pitched his first career complete game, against the Minnesota Twins, throwing 120 pitches and allowing one earned run. McDonald had a 2.37 ERA before the all-star break but a 7.52 ERA after the all-star break.\n2013.\nMcDonald was designated for assignment by the Pirates on September 7. He became a free agent on September 13.\nChicago Cubs.\nHe signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs on January 31, 2014. He did not pitch in a game for the team due to injury and became a free agent after the season.\nIn 2017, McDonald became a coach for the Southwest Nationals Baseball Organization, founded by former MLB pitcher Scott Elbert.\nPitching style.\nMcDonald has a variety of pitches. His primary pitch is a four-seam fastball in the 91–94 mph range. He throws a two-seam fastball with similar velocity. He features two breaking balls: a slider (79–82) and a knuckle curve (75–77). His last pitch is a changeup in the low 80s. McDonald does not mix his repertoire differently between right-handed and left-handed hitters. He throws his four-seamer about half the time and uses his curveball most often when he is ahead in the count.\nIn the early part of the 2012 season, his slider was recognized as the NL's second-best swing-and-miss pitch, only behind Cole Hamels' changeup, with whiff rate of 49% since 2011.\nPersonal.\nMcDonald's father, also named James, played basketball at USC and football for the Los Angeles Rams from 1983–87, while his uncle Ben McDonald, was a professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors. His cousins are former Chicago Cubs outfielder Darnell McDonald and former New York Yankee and Kansas City Royal outfielder Donzell McDonald."

        "title": "1955 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 1955 Giro d'Italia was the 38th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Milan on 14 May with a flat stage and concluded back in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 5 June. Fourteen teams entered the race, which was won by Italian Fiorenzo Magni of the Nivea-Fuchs team. Second and third respectively were Italian riders Fausto Coppi and Gastone Nencini.\nIn the 20th stage, arriving in San Pellegrino Terme, Magni and Coppi attacked Gastone Nencini (who was leading the general classification) taking advantage of a puncture he suffered in an unpaved road section. Coppi won the stage (his last victory in the Giro) and Magni took the lead in the general classification.\nTeams.\nIn December 1954 when the initial plans for the 1955 edition were announced, the organization announced they would invite ten Italian based teams and six foreign teams: France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and England whom by December had confirmed participation. Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and France, after missing the previous edition, sent teams to compete in the race. Fourteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1955 edition of the Giro d'Italia. The Spanish team missed the pre-race ceremony because they missed their flight into Milan and had to take a train into the city. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 98 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 72 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nFive-time champion Fausto Coppi (Bianchi) and Hugo Koblet (Faema) were named by most as the primary favorites to win the race overall. Coppi who was now 35 years old notably had won the Giro dell'Appennino and finished second at Paris–Roubaix. Serge Lang wrote that Coppi was the public's favorite to win, but most other riders did not him as much of an overall threat due his age. \"Novelliste Valaisan\" also named Pasquale Fornara () their favorites to win the race. Fornara's best finish came in 1953 when he placed third overall, while Koblet won in 1950 and had three other top ten finishes. 1948 winner Fiorenzo Magni () finished the Vuelta a España on 8 May and was viewed as contender for the general classification.\nIt was believed reigning champion Carlo Clerici (Faema) would be marked heavily this race after the nature of his victory the previous year when he gained significant time through a breakaway. Clerici was thought to be in good form. Faema did not include Fritz Schär who had injured his knee. Despite being a favorite to some, Koblet was not seen as a favorite by Swiss writer Serge Lang who believed he does not like climb he did when he won the race in 1950. \nYoung Italians including the likes of Mauro Gianneschi (Arbos), Nino Defilippis (Torpado), Giuseppe Minardi (Legnano), Agostino Coletto () were thought to be outside contenders for the general classification and were the team's leaders. Coletto was perceived by some to be the next great Italian general classification rider. Atala's best chances were seent with Giancarlo Astrua and Bruno Monti, the latter of which impressed at the Tour de Romandie. Astrua was perceived as a good climber and a rouler. Gastone Nencini () was a younger rider whom many felt showed a lot of promise and was known for his descending prowess.\nA \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" writer felt the Spanish team had riders that can climb very well, but lacked maturity and team comradery to obtain a high general classification ranking. The French team was believed to be very strong and in good shape prior to start. They were thought to have its best chances with Raphaël Géminiani and recent Vuelta a Espana winner Jean Dotto who both were in great form, but it was thought Géminiani could lose several minutes in the time trial stages. \nDoniselli, the Dutch team, was thought to have great riders who could animate the race like Wout Wagtmans, Hein Van Breenen, and Gerrit Voorting. Notably Thijs Roks, van Breenen, and Wagtmans composed the podium for the Dutch national road race championship. Doniselli sports director Kees Pellenaars stated that Wagtmans gave the best chance for the overall victory, but instead of surrounding the whole team with him throughout the race as other Italian teams do, he would allow two to three riders to attempt attacks. Expectations of the Belgian team by a \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" writer were unknown as the writer cited a previous difficulty by Belgian riders in the Giro d'Italia. A notable omission from the team was Rik van Steenbergen. The teams' young riders Joseph Schils and Carl Borgmans were expected to have a good performance. In addition, the team brought a new flahute Rik Van Looy.\nOther notable riders that did not participate were Frenchman Louison Bobet and Swiss rider Ferdinand Kübler. In addition, this was the first Giro d'Italia without two-time winner Gino Bartali participating. Bartali retired following the previous season, but returned to the Giro d'Italia to provide commentary for several newspapers.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route's general structure was announced on December 29, 1954 at the Palazzo Marino in Milan in front of local dignitaries. The finalized route was revealed on 9 March 1955. The route was designed in a counter-clockwise direction across twenty-one days of racing and two rest days,It contained two time trial events, one individual and one team event. The team time trial rode over the cobbled roads of Genoa. This race featured the first stage finish and start in France. The tenth stage utilized the route used in the 1955 UCI World Championships men's road race that were to be held in Frascati, Italy August that year in a loop that was traversed ten times. The highest climb was the Passo Pordoi. In total the route had roughly of elevation change of which five stages contained eight categorized climbs that awarded points for the mountains classification. The nineteenth stage was deemed the queen stage as it featured the climbs of the Falzarego Pass, the Col de Rolle, the Pordoi, and the Col de Brocon. Five stages ended in a velodrome. \nDue to complaints from the riders about the previous year's race, the organizers reduced the amount of kilometers in the race by approximately . Further, race organizers decided to reduce the length of the stages within the Giro d'Italia closer to , similar to the Tour de France at the time. Stages in the had become known as \"Italian stages\" for their extreme length in hundreds of kilometers, only to have the racing start in the final 10km. Through the reduction in stage length, the organizers hoped to have more attacking done by riders. The intermediate sprints or \"flying checks\" as they were known were well received and thought to have helped animate the race, with several stage winners coming from those that won the sprints of the day. The amount of intermediate sprints has been reduced by 30 this race, leaving 30 to be taken. If you win the prize you must be within the first five positions of the general classification. \nA writer for \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" felt a rouler could win the general classification if they could take advantage of the course before the race hits the Dolomites. The \"Gazzette de Lausanne\" writer Serge Lang wrote that the route was the hardest since World War II and felt the general public and most newspapers felt the route was well designed.\nClassification leadership.\nOne jersey was worn during the 1955 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe mountains classification leader. The climbs all awarded three points to the first rider and one point to the second rider to cross the summit. Although no jerseys were awarded, there was also two classification for the teams, in which the teams were awarded points for their rider's performance during the stages. One classification was for the teams based inside Italy and the other was for teams based outside of Italy."

Throughout most of the race, the Americans were trailing slightly behind the host nation Australia until Thompson dived into the pool at the final exchange. Thompson held off a sprint battle from Petria Thomas on the final stretch until she touched the wall by seven-tenths of a second (0.70) with a remarkable split of 1:59.35 to deliver the foursome of Samantha Arsenault (1:59.92), Diana Munz (1:59.19), and Lindsay Benko (1:59.34) a gold-medal time in 7:57.80. As the Americans celebrated their triumph in the pool, Thompson picked up her ninth career medal to break a tie with former East Germany's Kristin Otto for the most golds, a total of seven, and to maintain her position as the most successful woman in Olympic history.\nAfter leading three-fourths of the race, Australia's Thomas (2:00.32), Susie O'Neill (1:58.70), Giaan Rooney (1:59.37), and Kirsten Thomson (2:00.13) powered home with a silver in 7:58.52. Meanwhile, Germany's Franziska van Almsick (1:59.51), Antje Buschschulte (2:00.35), and Sara Harstick (2:00.88) helped their teammate Kerstin Kielgass produce a striking anchor of 1:57.90 to capture the bronze medal in 7:58.64. For the first time in Olympic history, all three teams finished the race under an eight-minute barrier.\nOutside the club, Romania's Camelia Potec (1:59.10), Simona Păduraru (2:01.52), Ioana Diaconescu (2:01.47), and Beatrice Câșlaru (1:59.54) missed the podium with a fourth-place time of 8:01.63, worthy enough for a national record. Canada (8:02.65), Great Britain (8:03.69), Italy (8:04.68), and France (8:05.99) rounded out the championship finale.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition."

The decision, which was formally ratified at a meeting in Melbourne in August 2005, was made after the Australian Sports Commission threatened to withdraw its financial support unless the two bodies amalgamated. The Australian Sports Commission contributed approximately A$1.5 million annually to the Australian Institute of Sport for golf funding.\nColin Phillips, the AGU's executive director since 1978, retired from his position in 2005, claiming that the way the decision to merge had been forced upon the sport by the federal government, had been a factor in his decision.\nFollowing the merger, IMG, the sports marketing company which organises the Australian Open golf event, signed a three-year deal which increased its ties to Golf Australia. Former tennis pro and new Open chairman Paul McNamee also renegotiated a deal signed by the old AGU, whereby the tournament would be hosted at the Moonah Links course in Rye, Victoria three times in every five years. That decision had been heavily criticised by golf professionals who found issue with the course layout, low attendances and poor corporate interest, but the new organisation was able to reduce its obligation to three tournaments before 2020.\nGolf Australia runs the Australian Open and the Women's Australian Open, the premier male and female golf tournaments in Australia, as well as the Australian Amateur and other national amateur events. It also runs programs promoting golf in Australia, the two major being the MyGolf for juniors and the Crown Lager Social Golf Club. Minjee Lee and Jason Day have been ambassadors for MyGolf, and Stuart Appleby has been an ambassador for the Crown Lager Social Golf Club.\nGolf Australia supports the state associations Golf New South Wales, Golf Northern Territory, Golf Queensland, Golf South Australia, Golf Tasmania, Golf Victoria &amp; Golf Western Australia who are responsible for the governance, delivery and direction of golf in their State.\nThe Golf Australia National Squad is the key component of the countries High Performance program which supports talented young golfers. Squad members have included Geoff Ogilvy, Karrie Webb, Adam Scott, Aaron Baddeley, Michael Sim and Katherine Hull.\nWith golf being readmitted back into the Olympic fold at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the role of Golf Australia was strengthened further. As part of this the Australian Sports Commission raised the funding to the sport in April 2013.\nGolf Australia owns and runs the Australian Handicapping system which operates throughout clubs nationally."

The foursome of Amy Van Dyken (55.08), Dara Torres (53.51), Courtney Shealy (54.40), and Jenny Thompson (53.62) put together a stellar time of 3:36.61 to capture the relay gold medal, shaving off China's 1994 world record by 1.3 seconds.

Robertson had a very eventful tournament at the Bluebell Wood Open as Stuart Bingham made a 72 break in the deciding frame of their second round match, before Robertson cleared the table with a 73 break to win. In the last 16 he came back from 3–0 against Vinnie Calabrese to triumph 4–3 and reach another quarter-final, where Ding Junhui defeated him 4–1. Robertson finished 20th on the Order of Merit which saw him qualify for the Finals for the first time in his career, but he lost 4–2 to John Higgins in the opening round.\n2014–15 season.\nRobertson played at the venue stage of eight ranking tournaments this year, the most he has reached in any one season. However, he was unable to win past the last 32 in any of them.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He had another good season in the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events, losing in the semi-finals of the Asian Tour's Haining City Open 4–3 to Oliver Lines which saw him finish eighth on the Order of Merit.\nHis other semi-final came on the European Tour at the Gdynia Open where he was whitewashed 4–0 by Mark Williams.

In a close match he was edged out 10–8.\n2017–18 season.\nWith his partner Hayley due to give birth to their second child, Robertson withdrew from the 2017 Riga Masters. He also spoke about how he had been frustrated with his performances in big matches and had been working with a sports psychologist during the World Championship to help him prepare for the season ahead. His best performance in the first half of the season was reaching the last 16 of the 2017 World Open, where he lost 5–1 to Mark Williams.&lt;ref name=\"2017/18\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However he did reach the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the first time at the 2018 German Masters. After qualifying victories over Rhys Clark and Peter Lines, he defeated defending champion Anthony Hamilton 5–1 in the last 32 and Gary Wilson 5-3 in the last 16 before losing out to Williams 5–3. After losing in the opening round of the next five ranking events, he once again came through qualifying for the World Championship, defeating Alex Borg 10–2, Sam Baird 10–7 and Michael White 10–7. Making his fourth Crucible appearance, it was eventual tournament winner Williams who defeated him with a 10–5 victory in the first round.\n2018–19 season: first ranking title.\nRobertson had an up and down start to the 2018–19 snooker season, failing to qualify for the Riga Masters, World Open and China Championship, but reached the last 16 at the Paul Hunter Classic where he lost 4–0 to Jack Lisowski.&lt;ref name=\"2018/19\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the European Masters, Robertson unexpectedly won the tournament and his first ranking title. After defeating Andy Lee 4–3 in qualifying, at the main stages of the tournament in Lommel, Belgium, his first three matches were also won in a deciding frame (4–3 victories against Zhang Yong, Zhou Yuelong and Anthony McGill respectively). He defeated Mark Allen 4–2 in the quarter-finals and Mark King 6–4 in the semi-finals to set up a final against Joe Perry, who had won one ranking event previously. In the first session Robertson raced into a 5–0 lead before Perry recovered to 5–3. In the second session Robertson went 7–3 ahead before Perry once again won three frames in a row to close the gap to 7–6. Robertson then managed to win the remaining two frames (with a century in the last frame) to win the match 9–6.\nDue to his victory, Robertson received an entry to the Champion of Champions for the first time. Drawn against Shaun Murphy in the opening round, he lost 4–2. The boost to his seasons's ranking points also helped him to qualify for the Players Championship for the first time in its current format; he was whitewashed 6–0 by reigning world champion Judd Trump in the first round. In the first round of qualifying for the World Championship, Robertson recorded a rare whitewash of his own with a 10–0 victory over Chen Feilong; he then lost in the second round of qualifying 9–10 to Joe O'Connor.\n2019–20 season.\nDespite starting the season ranked 24th in the world, Robertson could not build on his success of the previous season during 2019–20 as he failed to advance beyond the last 32 of a ranking event in the first half of the season until the 2019 Scottish Open, where he reached the last 16 before losing 4–0 to eventual tournament winner Mark Selby.&lt;ref name=\"2019/20\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The furthest he advanced in a ranking tournament that season was at the 2020 Gibraltar Open where he was defeated in the quarter-finals 4–3 by Xiao Guodong in a tournament seriously effected by the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. At the rescheduled qualifying for the World Championship, Robertson lost 6–4 to Ashley Carty in the first round.\n2020–21 season.\nDuring the 2020–21 season which was played almost entirely behind closed doors, Robertson endured a nightmare run of results, losing in the opening round on five occasions and leaving his place on the tour in jeopardy; his best finish was at the 2020 English Open where he reached the last 32 before losing 4–1 to John Higgins.&lt;ref name=\"2020/21\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching a career high ranking of 21st in March 2019, Robertson was ranked 61st before entering qualifying for the World Championship, and failure to win and results going against him could have resulted in Robertson dropping out of the top 64 in the rankings and being relegated from the tour. He faced Zhao Jianbo in the first round of qualifying and after trailing 3–0, won 6–5. Despite losing by the same scoreline to Lu Ning in the next round, the win was enough to narrowly maintain his place on the tour, finishing the season ranked 63rd. Robertson later revealed that working with a mind coach on his mental approach had helped him to get over the line in his decisive match and that he had \"belief\" in his ability going forward.\n2021–22 season.\nRobertson began the season with advancing to the second group phase of the Championship League.&lt;ref name=\"2021/22\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He then reached the second ranking semi-final of his career at the 2021 British Open where he lost 4–1 to eventual winner Mark Williams. After a narrow 4–3 defeat to Judd Trump at the 2021 Northern Ireland Open in the last 16, he reached the quarter-final of the 2021 World Grand Prix where he was defeated 5–2 by Ronnie O'Sullivan.\nPersonal life.\nRobertson has two children with his partner Hayley and owns O'Sullivan's Snooker &amp; Pool Club in his hometown of Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. He is a close friend and practice partner of fellow professional Mark Davis."

There were 68 competitors from 45 nations. Nations were limited to two swimmers each, down from three in prior Games. The event was won by Rowdy Gaines of the United States, the nation's third victory in four Games—with only the boycotted 1980 Olympics missing. Overall, it was the eleventh victory for an American in the men's 100 metre freestyle, most of any nation. Mark Stockwell of Australia took silver. Swedish swimmer Per Johansson repeated as bronze medalist, only the seventh man to earn multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nOne of the eight finalists from the 1980 Games returned: bronze medalist Per Johansson of Sweden. The reigning gold medalist, and 1982 world champion, Jörg Woithe of East Germany, was absent due to the Soviet-led boycott. World runner-up Rowdy Gaines had missed the 1980 Games due to the American-led boycott at the peak of his ability; four years later, he was still favored. Johansson had taken third at worlds.\nWith a large field and a reduced maximum per nation, many nations new to the event were able to compete. The Bahamas, Bahrain, the People's Republic of China, Chinese Taipei, Fiji, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, San Marino, Suriname, Swaziland, and Uganda each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 18th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used a new A/B final format. The competition consisted of two rounds: heats and finals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the A final, competing for medals through 8th place. The swimmers with the next 8 times in the semifinals competed in the B final for 9th through 16th place. Swim-offs were used as necessary to determine advancement.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A, while the next eight to final B.\nFinals.\nFinal A.\nThe Australian team protested the final, arguing that the start had not been fair.

There were 56 competitors from 36 nations, with each nation having up to two swimmers (down from a maximum of three in previous Games). The event was won by Michael Gross of West Germany, the nation's first victory in the event. His countryman Thomas Fahrner took bronze. Americans placed second and fourth, with Mike Heath earning silver and Jeff Float in fourth place.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1980 Games returned: sixth-place finisher Paolo Revelli of Italy and seventh-place finisher Thomas Lejdström of Sweden. The reigning World Champion was Michael Gross of West Germany, having beaten American Rowdy Gaines. Gross, who had also set a world record in the event earlier in 1984, was heavily favoured in Los Angeles. The host United States was represented by Mike Heath and Jeff Float, both strong medal contenders.\nThe People's Republic of China, Chinese Taipei, Denmark, Fiji, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, San Marino, Swaziland, Turkey, and Uruguay each made their debut in the event. Australia made its seventh appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 7 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The 1984 event also introduced a consolation or \"B\" final; the swimmers placing 9th through 16th in the heats competed in this \"B\" final for placing. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A, while the next eight to final B."

Rain delayed much of the action, which ended with Tiger Woods as the clubhouse leader at two under. Phil Mickelson was putting for par on the 14th hole when play was suspended at 6:35 p.m. EDT. Thomas Bjørn with four holes left and Steve Elkington with three holes left were one shot off of Mickelson. Despite being the clubhouse leader, Woods returned to his Florida home on Sunday night rather than await the tournament's completion the following day. This move was heavily criticized at the time.\n\"Monday, August 15, 2005\"\nPlay resumed Monday at 10:05 a.m., with six players on the course within three shots of the lead. Headed to the 72nd hole, Phil Mickelson was tied for the lead at three under with Thomas Bjørn and Steve Elkington. Mickelson birdied the par 5 18th to win his second major title. Mickelson flopped a chip from the deep grass some away to two feet for a birdie and a one-shot victory. Elkington and Bjorn both missed birdie putts and had to settle for par on the closing hole. Mickelson became the seventh wire-to-wire winner (though he shared the lead after the first and third rounds) at the PGA Championship and the first since Tiger Woods in 2000. The round of the day belonged to Ted Purdy, who ended up in a tie for tenth after a final round 66.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

The race began on 14 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Vicenza, finishing back in Milan on 5 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Antonio Pesenti of the Wolsit team. Second and third respectively were the Belgian Jef Demuysere and Italian Remo Bertoni.\nIt was one of the last participations of Costante Girardengo, 39 years old, who classified second in the first stage, but then retired during the fifth stage. The 47-year-old age Giovanni Gerbi, nicknamed \"the Red Devil\", also took part, but also didn't succeed in concluding the race.\nParticipants.\nOf the 109 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 14 May, 66 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 5 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were ten teams that competed in the race: Atala-Hutchinson, Bianchi-Pirelli, France Sport-Pirelli, Ganna-Dunlop, Gloria-Hutchinson, Ilva-Pirelli, Legnano-Hutchinson, Maino-Clément, Olympia-Superga, and Wolsit-Hutchinson.\nThe peloton was primarily composed of Italians. The field featured four former Giro d'Italia champions in four-time winner Alfredo Binda, two-time champion Costante Girardengo, 1920 winner Gaetano Belloni, and reigning winner Francesco Camusso. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Learco Guerra, Giovanni Gerbi, Felice Gremo, and Domenico Piemontesi. The reigning winner of the Tour de France, Frenchman Antonin Magne, raced started the Giro, along with Belgian Jef Demuysere who finished second at the 1931 Tour de France.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe race organizers allowed isolated riders to compete in the race, which had a separate classification calculated the same way as the general classification. In addition, there was a classification dedicated to only foreign, non-Italian riders, which was calculated in the same manner.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nIl Trofeo Magno () was a classification for independent Italian riders competing in the race. The riders were divided into teams based on the region of Italy they were from. The calculation of the standings was the same for the team classification. At the end of the race, a trophy was awarded to the winning team and it was then stored at the Federal Secretary of the P.N.P. in their respective province.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 66 cyclists who had completed all thirteen stages. For these cyclists, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner."

In the tournament, the team finished 12th out of 16 teams and managed 3 wins against Austria, Italy, and Hungary also with a tie against Yugoslavia. \nIn 1968, Romania lost its qualification match against West Germany 7–0 and was forced to compete in the B division again.

The US jumped out to a 2–0 lead in the first period and added two more to it to lead 4–1 after two periods. Unlike other teams that the US had faced, the Romanians fought strong in the third period, despite being outshot 15–3, and scored a goal. The final score was 7–2. Romania played Norway for their final game, who had lost all four of their past games and had no chance to advance to the Medal Round. Romania fell behind less than a minute into the game, but stormed back to take the lead 3–1 in the third period. The Norwegian team battled back though, and scored once with a minute and a half left to play, and scored once more to tie it with only 29 seconds left. This tie still gave Romania one point but they had been hoping for a win.

        "text": "John Emery (4 January 1932 – 21 February 2022) was a Canadian bobsledder who competed in the 1960s. He won a gold medal in the four-man event at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck.\nEarly life.\nJohn Emery was born on 4 January 1932 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and had a brother, Victor. Emery's father was a general in the Royal Canadian Navy, which caused his family to move frequently around locations in Canada, though they would spend time each summer in Thunder Bay, Ontario. After his death, his wife recalled that Emery developed a profound love for nature during these \"\"On Golden Pond\" type\" summers, which led to his love for the mountains.\nBobsleigh.\nVictor Emery watched a bobsleigh race at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina, Italy, and became passionate about the sport, which John soon came to love, too. In 1957, the brothers founded the Laurentian Bobsledding Association. They competed at the World Championships in Lake Placid, New York, in 1959, where they placed 13th (out of 16); they then began training at Lake Placid whenever they could, and steadily improved, but the Canadian Olympic Committee would not let their team enter the 1960 Winter Olympics, and claimed that nobody in Canada was interested in bobsleigh. They placed 4th at the 1962 World Championships. Though the bobsleigh runs at Lake Placid were available to them, they could not frequently travel, and often practiced \"dry\" at the local gymnasium.\nThey did enter the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the first time Canada contested bobsleigh. Unsponsored and with no national team, they paid for everything themselves. Spectators reportedly \"thought it was a joke\" that Canada entered a bobsleigh team that year, with several writing off the team as \"playboys who came to the Games simply to party\". These opinions prevailed as the nation had no training program or even a bobsled course, though the other teams instead saw the Canadians as intellectuals who had entered into the race by fluke, rather than playboys, as they all had advanced degrees and professional careers outside of sport.\nWhile European teams (particularly the favourites, Italy and Austria) had ample opportunities to practice on the track at Innsbruck, the Canadians had never been before and were only able to have four practice runs before the event (which itself comprises four runs). The Italian team took the Canadians under their wing, mentoring them in practice at the Games. In their first competitive run, the four-man team broke the track record; the Canadians' total time over their four runs was 4:14.46 seconds, taking gold. Emery was the driver of the four-man sleigh that won the gold medal, and the team members were inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame that year, and the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1971.\nThe Emery brothers and different teammates then won the four-man bob event at the World Championships in 1965, after which John Emery stopped competing in bobsleigh. By 1967, the whole Olympic team had retired.\nPersonal and later life.\nEmery was a reconstructive surgeon and philanthropist. He studied medicine at Queen's University, Ontario, and the University of Oxford, and took specialist reconstructive surgery studies in Scotland. In 1967, he opened a practice in San Francisco, California, and eventually settled in Sonoma, California. He met his future wife, Deborah, the year he started his practice; she was a model who had been recommended his services. They married on 17 October 1981, and were together until Emery's death. In his later years, Emery ran a vineyard. He was diagnosed with melanoma in his early 80s, and died from it on 21 February 2022, at the age of 90. He spoke five languages, and was accomplished in a variety of sports as well as bobsleigh."

        "text": "The 2006 United States Open Championship was the 106th U.S. Open, held June 15–18 at Winged Foot Golf Club West Course in Mamaroneck, New York, a suburb northeast of New York City.\nGeoff Ogilvy won his only major title by one stroke in one of the wildest finishes in U.S. Open He made clutch pars on the final two holes, including a chip-in on 17. Runners-up Jim Furyk, Colin Montgomerie, and Phil Mickelson all failed to par the 72nd hole. In the final pairing and seeking his third straight major championship, Mickelson double-bogeyed the final hole after hitting driver off the tee and failing to hit the fairway. Montgomerie double-bogeyed the same hole when his approach shot from the fairway ended up short and in the rough, then followed the difficult chip with three putts. Furyk bogeyed the 15th hole and then missed a 5-footer for par at the final hole. Tiger Woods missed the cut in a major as a professional for the first time, in his first major since the death of his father. All players finished over par for the first time in a U.S. Open since 1978. The total purse was $6.25 million with a winner's share of $1.225 million.\nHistory of the U.S. Open at Winged Foot.\nThis was the fifth U.S. Open at Winged Foot and the sixth major championship (1997 PGA Championship won by Davis Love III). Former champions include: Bobby Jones (1929), Billy Casper (1959), Hale Irwin (1974), and Fuzzy Zoeller (1984).\nThe 1974 edition was known as \"The Massacre at Winged Foot,\" as Irwin won with a seven-over-par 287, and just seven sub-par rounds were recorded over the four days. In the years following World War II, only Julius Boros' 9-over total in high winds in 1963 was a higher winning score. Some thought the difficult set-up in 1974 was in response to Johnny Miller's final round 63 at Oakmont a year earlier.\nThe U.S. Open returned to Winged Foot fourteen years later in 2020.\nCourse layout.\nWest Course\nLengths of the course for previous majors:\nField.\nMichael Campbell (8,10,16), Ernie Els (4,8,16), Jim Furyk (9,11,12,16), Retief Goosen (8,9,10,11,16), Lee Janzen, Steve Jones, Tiger Woods (3,4,8,9,11,12,16)\nDillon Dougherty (a), Edoardo Molinari (a)\nPhil Mickelson (5,9,11,12,16), Mike Weir (16)\nBen Curtis, David Duval, Todd Hamilton\nRich Beem, Shaun Micheel, Vijay Singh (8,9,12,16), David Toms (8,9,11,16)\nStephen Ames (9,11,12,16)\nAllen Doyle\nK.

Phil Mickelson, the winner of the last two majors, was just one shot behind at even-par. Former U.S. Open champion Jim Furyk was also just one shot back. Tiger Woods shot a six over 76 in his first major since his father's death, his worst start ever in a major.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 16, 2006\"\nSteve Stricker led at a major for the first time since 1998 after a one-under 69, and was the only player under par after 36 holes. One stroke back was Montgomerie, while Woods missed the cut at a major as a professional for the first time, ending his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at majors. He shot 76 for the second consecutive day missing the cut by three shots. Mickelson struggled throughout the day for 73, which put him four shots back entering \nThe best rounds of the day belonged to Arron Oberholser and David Duval who both shot 68. It was the first cut Duval had made at a major since the 2002 PGA Championship. Other notable players missing the cut included Sergio García, Retief Goosen, 1997 PGA Championship winner at Winged Foot Davis Love III, and defending U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell. The cut was at 149 (+9) and better, and no amateurs advanced to the weekend.\nAmateurs: Coe (+10), Horschel (+12), Molinari (+13), Moore (+15), Nagle (+16), Fujikawa (+18), Dougherty (+20), Baca (+21), Posey (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 2006\"\nFollowing a one-under 69 in the third round, Mickelson shared the 54-hole lead with Kenneth Ferrie, who bogeyed the 18th Ogilvy made two straight bogeys on the back and finished with a 72 that left him one shot back. Stricker led through much of the front nine but ended up at 76, three shots behind. Pádraig Harrington needed a birdie to catch Mickelson on the 18th hole, but barely made contact out of the deep rough, and moved the ball just into the fairway. Once out of a greenside bunker, he three-putted for a triple bogey seven and a disappointing 74.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 18, 2006\"\nIn one of the most exciting final rounds in U.S. Open history, Ogilvy survived a brutal final day to win his only major He took the lead early and led by two strokes after 7 holes, but lost his lead with four bogeys in seven holes. But Ogilvy finished his round with four pars, highlighted by a chip shot from the second fringe at the 17th. His tee shot on 18 found the fairway but was in a sand-filled divot, and his approach hit the green's false front and rolled back. He dropped a downhill six-footer for his final stroke as all his competitors collapsed around him. Mickelson and Montgomerie needed pars on the final hole to win, or bogeys to tie with Ogilvy, but they both double-bogeyed to hand Ogilvy a dramatic win. He became the first Australian to win a major since Steve Elkington in the 1995 PGA Championship, and the first to win a U.S. Open in a quarter century, since David Graham in 1981.\nMontgomerie holed a putt for birdie on the 17th hole for a share of the lead and was in the middle of the 18th fairway, from the hole, in prime position to do no worse than a playoff. After an extended wait and much club deliberation, he finally selected a 7-iron and proceeded to miss the green short and right, into deep rough. His difficult chip left a lengthy downhill par putt, and then three-putted for double bogey. Mickelson was in the right rough on the 16th, then the approach plugged into a greenside bunker and he bogeyed. He was well left of the fairway on the 17th into a trash can, but his slicing recovery shot found the green and he two-putted for par. On the 18th tee, Mickelson needed par to win or a bogey to tie, but could not finish off what would have been his third consecutive major championship victory. Using driver, his tee shot went so far left that it clattered through the trees by a hospitality tent. Still trying for par, he went for the green with his second shot but hit a tree, and the ball advanced just . His third faded into the greenside bunker, buried with a \"fried-egg\" lie; the fourth shot from the sand to win had no spin and rolled off the other side of the green into the rough. Mickelson's chip for bogey and a Monday playoff with Ogilvy rolled six feet past the hole. He tied Sam Snead for the most second-place finishes by a player who has never won the U.S. Open, with four. Furyk needed par to force a playoff and his tee shot was to the left in the intermediate cut; the hooking approach found a greenside bunker and he missed the five-foot putt to save par. Harrington bogeyed the final three holes and finished two strokes behind. Five different players held the lead at one point on Sunday with 15 different lead changes between them.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nQuotes.\n\"I still am in shock that I did that. I just can't believe that I did that. I am such an idiot.\" - Phil Mickelson after double bogeying the 18th hole.\n\"The biggest reason why this is so disappointing is that this is a tournament that I dreamt of winning as a kid. I spent hours practicing, countless hours practicing, dreaming of winning this tournament. I came out here months in advance to get ready and had it right there in my hand, man. It was right there and I let it go.\" - Phil Mickelson on losing the U.S. Open.\n\"I think I was the beneficiary of a little bit of charity.\" - Geoff Ogilvy after watching from the club house as Furyk, Mickelson and Montgomerie all couldn't make par on the 18th hole.\n\"I'm disappointed. I played my heart out and it didn't work.\" - Jim Furyk after runner up finish.\n\"I love this game.\" - Geoff Ogilvy after putting out on the 18th hole\n\"I switched from a 6 to a 7. I thought adrenaline would kick in. I usually hit the ball 10 yards further in that circumstance. I caught it slightly heavy and it went slightly right. It was a poor shot, no question about that, and I put myself into poor position.\" - Colin Montgomerie on club selection on final hole."

        "text": "The cricket warbler (Spiloptila clamans), also known as cricket longtail, scaly longtail or cricket prinia, is a species of bird in the family Cisticolidae. It belongs to the genus Spiloptila; it is often the only species included in the genus but sometimes the red-fronted prinia is placed there as well.\nDescription.\nThe cricket warbler is a small, perky warbler with a long tail made up of twelve grey, black and white tipped feathers with the feathers getting longer from the outside to the centre, creating a graduated tail. It is pale buffy rufous on the upperparts, with black streaks on the crown and black tips to the primaries and upper wing coverts, a pale yellow rump, a white supercilium and whitish cream underparts. The male has a greyer cast across the nape. 9–10 cm in length.\nDistribution.\nThe cricket warbler occurs in the Sahel Zone from southern Mauritania and northern Senegal east to South Sudan and northern Eritrea. They have recently been found breeding in the Western Sahara at Oued Jenna near Assouerd.\nHabitat.\nThe cricket warbler breeds in thorn scrub, especially acacia scrub, it even extends into true desert so long as there is sufficient vegetation and into savanna with broad-leafed trees but avoids grassy plains or dense bush.\nHabits.\nThe cricket warbler is quite a sociable species and is usually seen in small parties of around half a dozen birds which move restlessly from one patch of low scrub to another. When on the ground or perched it moves its tail jerkily up and down and side to side, while making its monotonous cricket like call. It usually sings from a high perch. They feed on insects which are foraged for low down in thorn scrub or in tussocks of grass. It is a partial migrant, with the northern populations moving southwards in the dry season, returning north with the rains. Breeding has been recorded in July in Mali and Mauritania, all year in Senegal and in January to April and again in August in south Sudan."

        "title": "Former Singapore Badminton Hall",
        "text": "The Former Singapore Badminton Hall (Abbreviation: SBH; ), formerly Singapore Badminton Stadium, is a former indoor sports hall for badminton located on Guillemard Road in Geylang, Singapore.\nThe old facility was previously situated at 100 Guillemard Road. The hall's nearby building (102 Guillemard Road) was formerly the headquarters of the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA). Both buildings were refurnished in May 2009 as the commercial centre Guillemard Village.\nThe current Singapore Badminton Hall is located at 1 Lorong 23 Geylang.\nHistory.\nConstruction.\nThe original Singapore Badminton Stadium was built in 1952 for the Thomas Cup Tournament. The first tournament was held in the UK in 1949, and the Malayan team won the championship. As a result, Malaya also won the right to host the next Thomas Cup, that was scheduled for 1952. As there was no suitable indoor sports hall in Malaya then, the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) decided to build one in Singapore. A fund to build the badminton hall was launched, after a ceremony welcoming the victorious Thomas Cup team at the Victoria Memorial Hall.\nIn February 1951, SBA requested from the Singapore Government a plot of land at Guillemard Road to build the badminton stadium. SBA was granted a 99-year lease on the land, effectively from 1 July the same year, and proceeded to construct the sports hall.\nThe estimated construction cost for the hall was S$200,000 to S$250,000 but the eventual cost rose to S$800,000. Donations then totalled only S$32,000. Aw Boon Haw, who was a patron of the SBA, gave a loan of S$250,000. Despite this, funds were still short by over S$400,000. Nevertheless, the Badminton Hall Management Committee, headed by Tan Ark Sye, pressed ahead with the construction of the hall. The main contractor was C. H. Tong.\nThe Singapore Badminton Stadium was completed in May 1952. However, the SBA did not have sufficient funds to cover the total construction cost. Eventually, the hall was relinquished to the Singapore Sports Council which took over its management in 1978.\nThomas Cup.\nAlthough it was completed in May 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was not ready for the 2nd Thomas Cup Tournament that was scheduled on 27–28 May that year. The tournament was held at the Happy World Stadium, where the Malayan Team, which included Wong Peng Soon, Ong Poh Lim and Ismail Marjan, successfully defended their title.\nOn 7 June 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was officially opened by the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Fearns Nicoll.\nIn 1955, the 3rd Thomas Cup Tournament was held at the Singapore Badminton Hall for the first time. The Malayan Team won its 3rd consecutive title. The 4th Thomas Cup Tournament was also held at the badminton hall in June 1958 but the Indonesian team won this time.\nPolitical events.\nIn June 1959, a crowd of nearly 7,000 workers from 63 trade unions gathered at the Singapore Badminton Stadium to celebrate the advent of the new government after the general election, which was won by the People's Action Party.\nOn 1 September 1962, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the vote counting station for a referendum to Tunku Abdul Rahman's suggestion to merge Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak, Sabah and the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia. About 71 percent of the electorate voted for the merger proposal. At 11.15am on 3 September, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew speaks of 'the clear and decisive verdict' of the people of Singapore for merger with Malaysia, and 'the awful moment of truth' for the Communists. This speech came immediately after the announcement of the Government's victory over the Barisan Socialis-led call to cast blank votes in the referendum. (See: Singaporean national referendum, 1962)\nConcerts.\nOn 7 December 1959, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the venue of Radio Singapore's all-star variety show, \"Puspawarna Singapura\", which was hosted by P. Ramlee.\nIn February 1965, the British rock group The Rolling Stones held a one-night performance at the Singapore Badminton Stadium. The crowd was so excited that a wall erected for the concert collapsed.\nSoutheast Asian Games.\nOn 1 February 1978, the Singapore Sports Council took over the management of the Singapore Badminton Stadium after acquiring a 30-year lease from the Lands Office (now the Singapore Land Authority). The hall was then renovated and renamed as the Singapore Badminton Hall and served as the venue for badminton in the 12th and 17th Southeast Asian Games, hosted by Singapore in 1983 and 1993 respectively.\nChronicles (1930s – 2024).\nBadminton sports for Singapore (since 1930s)\nThis recreational sport was first introduced to Singapore during the time of the British Colony. The game, at the beginning, was essentially played within the circle of the affluent British residents in Singapore. Then in the 1930s, the badminton sport gained its popularity among the local population but mainly the upper social class such as the white collar workforce, the social elites from English speaking background. Students from Chinese education played it as well, but badminton might seem to be less widespread for the Chinese-educated who were usually less wealthy as compared to the English-educated. Nonetheless, the sport's wide acceptance certainly had to do with the ease at which how the preparation of the game was made—a minimum of only two players are needed and the court can be anywhere where the ground is flat and the place without wind\nThe increasing passion for the sports had led to many badminton clubs formed among the local players be it professional or amateur. This was when the (SBA) was founded in 1929. The association, supported by patrons such as Tan Chin Tuan (director of the OCBC bank) and Song Ong Siang (an influential figure of the Straits Chinese community), aimed to encourage the game and to select the excellent players from various clubs by organising games among the clubs, so as to produce local athletes to participate in the renowned tournaments among the international community.\nAfter World War II, despite of the negative impact on the badminton fever due to the war, local badminton players started to shine in the international stage where the Malayan team won their first championship in the Thomas Cup in 1949.\nConstruction of The Singapore Badminton Stadium (1949–1952)\nThe winning in 1949 allowed Malaya, particularly the SBA (a sub-association of Malayan Badminton Association, to hold the next Thomas Cup Championship at its place since the winners were from Singapore. However, the sports halls available at that time were considered unsuitable for hosting any international tournaments. The President of SBA at that time, Lim Chuan Geok, thus made call for constructing new badminton hall. The construction cost was planned to be funded through public fundraising.\nThe fundraising was later found to be challenging when the government revealed its plan to construct another stadium at the same time, misleading many to think that the new badminton hall was thus replaced. The diminishing amount of public donations together with the increasing cost of construction hindered the progress of the whole project. A sponsor of SBA, Aw Boon Haw (founder of \"Tiger Balm\"), donated a huge sum of money to finance the project. The deficit was ultimately absorbed by the building contractor of the hall, C. H. Tong. However, SBA was rendered in debt by the project.\nThe entire construction was finished in 1952. The Stadium was built to accommodate changing rooms, canteens, offices, 4 badminton courts and 5500 seats]. Ironically, the hall dedicated for the Thomas Cup ended up not being used for the incoming Championship because it was thought to be a gamble to let the Malayan team to perform in a hall environment to which they might not become acclimatised yet. The Thomas Cup was held in Happy World Stadium in 1952 instead.\n1955\nThe hall had its first time hosting the Thomas Cup Championship which was also the third-time tournament. Again, the Malayan team succeeded in defending their champion title.\n1958\nThe fourth Thomas Cup Championship was, too, held in the Singapore Badminton Stadium, but this time round, the Malayan team was defeated by Indonesian team.\n1959-1960\nThe year 1959 saw mostly the non-sporting events taking place in the Stadium. The People's Action Party (PAP) had made public speech to celebrate their victory in the general election. The Hall also served to hold entertainment activities such as dramas, dances and even erotic strip dance by the famous local \"Strip Dancing Queen\" Rose Chan. In addition, from 1959 to 1960, \"Puspawarna Singapura\", live recordings of variety shows were held by the Radio Singapore with P. Ramlee (famous Malaysian singer, producer, composer) as the main host. It could be seen that the usage of the sports hall was less strict and exclusive. It might be out of an urge for SBA to increase its source of income and to clear off its debt from the construction.\n1962\nIn 1962, the Stadium was used as a counting station for the voting over matter of Malaya-Singapore merger where the People's Action Party had a clear-cut victory. The political significance of the Stadium was clear enough—the hall was a key connection spot between the ruling party and its supporters. On the other hand, during the times of trade union riots, the hall acted as a gathering spot for the unions. Such preference possibly reflected the existence of hall more than just a building but a essential space where political activities or social movements from the working class could be made widely known to the rest of the society.\n1965\nA British rock band, The Rolling Stones, conducted their one-stop performance at the badminton stadium. The over-excited spectators resulted in the collapse of a wall.\n1978\nDue to SBA's inability to pay off the debt from construction, the Stadium as well as the remaining debt was taken over by the Singapore Sports Council. Upon acquiring the stadium, it was refurbished and renamed as the Singapore Badminton Hall. The Hall was assigned to be one of the event venues for the Southeast Asian Games, which had its 12th (Year 1983) and 17th (Year 1993) games hosted in the Hall.\n1983\n12th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was hosted in the Hall.\n1986\nA tenant, the Fatty Weng restaurant, was opened at the Singapore Badminton Hall in 1986.\n1993\n17th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was held.\n1999\nThe Old Singapore Badminton Hall was declared a historical site by the National Heritage Board to acknowledge its historical significance in 2 major events—the 2 times hosting of Thomas Cup Champions and the vote-counting for 1962 Malaya-Singapore Merger Referendum.\n2008\nIn January 2008, the SBA headquarters and Singapore Badminton Hall was officially closed down after the land lease contract ended and the Singapore Sports Council decided not to renew it given the rising price of the new lease. The Hall was then returned to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n2009\nAfter a S$2-million refurbishment, the former Singapore Badminton Association building and the former Singapore Badminton Hall started its operation as Guillemard Village under the development by the Turf City Management. The site was re-developed as a centre for food and beverage as well as leisure. \n2011\nOnsight Climbing Gym, the biggest indoor climbing gym in Singapore occupied the Old Badminton Hall.\n2012\nGymKraft, the biggest gymnastics gym in Singapore occupied the Old Badminton Hall.\n2023\nIn September 2023, Singapore Badminton Association takes both the buildings on a 3 year (renewable for another 3 years) lease from Singapore Land Authority (SLA). The SBA plans to redevelop the facility into a modern Badminton stadium.\n2024\nNew F&amp;B outlets are opened. Hey Kee, a Hong Kong da pai dong style restaurant opens at 102 Guillemard Road. Vernacular Coffee opens up at 100 Guillemard Road. Getsome craft beers opens up at 100 Guillemard Road.\nAnytime Fitnessopens it's gym at 100 Guillemard Road.\nA modern Badminton hall, now renamed \"Singapore Badminton Stadium @KFF Badminton Arena\" is expected to open in June for public use. \nHistorical site.\nOn 1 September 1999, the Singapore Badminton Hall was marked by the National Heritage Board as a historical site. This was in recognition of the two significant historical events that happened at the hall—it held two Thomas Cup tournaments and was the vote counting station for the landmark 1962 referendum. The ceremony was officiated by Abdullah Tarmugi, Minister for Community Development and Sports.\nRedevelopment.\nIn July 2007, the Singapore Badminton Association announced plans to close the Singapore Badminton Hall, after the 30-year lease between the Singapore Sports Council and the Urban Redevelopment Authority ceases on 31 January 2008. The SBA's lease is for the badminton hall and its adjacent building, which houses the association's office and practice courts. Its current annual lease of under S$100,000 would be increased to S$1.164 million if the SBA were to renew it, but the association has no plans to do so. The SBA eventually relocated to the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang.\nIn January 2008, the SBA headquarters and Singapore Badminton Hall was officially closed down after the land lease contract ended and the Singapore Sports Council decided not to renew it given the rising price of the new lease. The Hall was then returned to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\nIn May 2009, after a S$2-million refurbishment, the former Singapore Badminton Association building and the former Singapore Badminton Hall started its operation as Guillemard Village under the development by the Turf City Management. The site was re-developed as a centre for food and beverage as well as leisure. The Hall was deliberately refurbished to give retain the essence of the past, hopefully reminding people of the Gay World.\nIn November 2009, a 24-hour prawn fishing restaurant known as Geylang Prawn Fishing Restaurant was opened, which occupied half of the former sports hall. In August 2011, The restaurant was closed at the hall upon its lease ended and moved to Punggol East Golf Club.\nAs of 2013 occupants of the hall included the Brawn &amp; Brains Cafe and the Onsight Climbing Gym.\nAs of 1 September 2023, the Singapore Badminton Association signed a tenancy agreement with Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to take over the premises (including the adjacent 102 Guillemard Road building) for development. SBA has plans to redevelop this building into a sports &amp; entertainment hub, with 9 world-class badminton courts, members lounge, gym, f&amp;b facilities etc. The newly redeveloped badminton hall will be renamed back to its original name as \"Singapore Badminton Stadium\", and is topped to become Singapore's most technologically advanced 'Smart Stadium' with Wifi 7, live-streaming, large LEDs etc.\nThe redevelopment is expected to be complete by May 2024."

        "title": "Major League Baseball Wild Card",
        "text": "In Major League Baseball (MLB), the wild card teams are the three teams in each of the two leagues (American and National) that have qualified for the postseason despite failing to win their division. Those teams in each league possess the three best winning percentages in their league after the three division winners. The wild card was first instituted in MLB in 1994, with one wild card team per league advancing to the Division Series in the postseason to face a division winner.\nIn 2012, the system was modified to add a second wild card team per league and pit each league's wild card teams against each other in a play-in game – the MLB Wild Card Game – the winner of which would then advance to the Division Series and play the team with the best record. The two teams with the best records outside of the division champions advanced to the wild card game. The two wild card teams could come out of the same division so there was no guarantee a team that came in second place in their division would make the playoffs.\nThe system was changed in to add a third wild card team from each league, along with replacing the play-in game with three-game series.\nOne wild card per league (1994–2011).\nFrom 1969 through 1993, the division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series, with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series. However, an expanding number of teams in MLB over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult. The new system was instituted in 1994 (but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs) when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league. In the new three-division leagues, each league had four teams in the playoffs; in addition to the three division winners, the division runner-up with the best record received a wild card spot. This assured that the team with the second-best record in its league would qualify for the postseason even if it was not a division champion.\nThus, a third postseason round was added, the Division Series. From 1995 to 1997, a yearly rotation was used to decide the match-ups in the Division Series, although the wild card team was prevented from playing its own division's champion. Beginning in 1998, the team with the best record in the league would typically face the wild card team and the other two division winners would play each other, with second-best division winner having home-field. However, if the division winner with the league's best record and the wild card team came from the same division, the wild card would face the second-best division winner in the league.\nHistoric anomalies.\nA \"wild card\" rule was used in the 1981 season after a players' strike wiped out the \"middle third\" of the season. The owners decided that the winners (in each division) of each \"half\" of the abbreviated season would make the playoffs, with the caveat that if the same team won both halves then that division's team with the second-best record from the second half would enter the playoffs as a wild card. However, the wild card rule was not actually used since all four divisions had different first half and second-half winners. As a result of the hastily contrived format, the Cincinnati Reds finished the regular season with the best record in all of baseball (66-42 .611) but failed to qualify for the playoffs because they finished 0.5 game behind the Dodgers in the first half and 1.5 games behind the Astros in the second half. The Astros finished 8 games back in the first half and the Dodgers 6 back in the second.\nFor the 2020 postseason only, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the playoff field expanded to include the second-place teams in each division, followed by the wild card teams represented by the next two best records from each league. All eight teams played in a best-of-three Wild Card Series.\nTwo wild cards per league (2012–2019, 2021).\nOn November 17, 2011, MLB announced that it would be adding two wild card teams to the postseason.\nThe two wild card teams in each league faced each other in a one-game playoff. The Wild Card Game winner advanced to play the best-ranked division winner in the Division Series. The revised playoff system began with the 2012 season. As mentioned previously, this system was not used during the 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThree wild cards per league (2022–present).\nStarting with the 2022 season, MLB added a third wild card team in each league. In the new Wild Card Series, the top two division winners in each league receive a bye to the Division Series, while the lowest-seeded division winner and three wild card teams will play in this round. A best-of-three series will take place, with the higher seed hosting all three games. Due to the expansion of the postseason beginning in 2022, the regular season tie-breaker game format has been eliminated. The winner of the 4 vs. 5 seeded matchup faces the top seeded division winner in the Division Series, while the winner of the 3 vs. 6 seeded matchup faces the second seeded division winner in the other Division Series as there is no reseeding in between rounds.\nWild card winners by year and by most wild card titles.\nFor each league's list of wild card winners by year and teams with most wild card titles, see:"

        "text": "American football, known locally as \"gridiron\", is a participation and spectator sport in Australia. The sport is represented by Gridiron Australia, a member of the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), and also Gridiron Victoria, which operates independent of Gridiron Australia \nThe sport has been played in six Australian states and territories across the country since World War II, but has only had regular league play since 1983. There is no uniform gridiron season in Australia. The various state and territory bodies play at different times of the year. There are currently 73 junior and senior teams playing gridiron in Australia. The national team has competed in the IFAF World Cup and other international competitions.\nAmerican football has an increasing media profile in Australia. The National Football League is broadcast on both free-to-air television through 7mate and subscription television through the Fox Sports and ESPN channels available on Foxtel and Austar, including the Super Bowl live on the Seven Network. Due to interest in converts from Australian rules football and Rugby League, particularly Ben Graham, Saverio Rocca and Jarryd Hayne, the game is also regularly covered by the \"Herald Sun\" and other newspapers.\nHistory.\nSome of the earliest matches in Australia involved visiting American servicemen. A match in Sydney between crews of the USS Baltimore in May 1906 attracted 14,000 people who watched the Stripes defeat Brown 10 to 1.\nOn 1 September 1908, following the Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival, Minnesota played Kentucky on the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of a crowd of 5,000. The game was not well received and was described as a \"scramble\" and criticised for its unnecessary roughness by the Melbourne press.\nIn 1925 a match was held between crews of the USS Trenton and USS Pennsylvania at the Punt Road Oval in Melbourne. A similar match was played at the Sydney Showground. Both attracted interest and crowds.\nIn 1932 rugby league administrator Harry Sunderland proposed assembling an Australian gridiron team to send to America however cyinics in the Australian media saw it as an attempt to promote rugby league in America rather than to promote gridiron in Australia.\nPost-war.\nA high-profile match in Adelaide played on American Independence Day (4 July) 1942 by American servicemen attracted a crowd of 25,000.\nSeveral matches were played in Sydney in 1943 and another high-profile match was played in Brisbane in 1944, all featuring American servicemen. Another match was held in Melbourne at an unknown date during the war.\nMatches of Austus were also played against Australian rules footballers featuring a set of compromise rules.\nHowever, the game did not take hold in Australia after the war.\nFirst local leagues.\nIn 1983 the first fully organised gridiron teams in Australia were formed in Melbourne, Victoria and further north, an ad was placed over a Sydney radio station advertising for American football enthusiasts to assemble in early 1984. The response was remarkable and several teams comprising enthusiastic amateurs who had been throwing the ball around on Sunday afternoons\nwere formed. The first season saw all games being played at a disused rubbish tip. There was no medical supervision and no insurance. The early pioneers did not wear helmets but found kick boxing protective headgear useful.\n1984 saw the first interstate clash when a team from Melbourne travelled to Sydney to play. NSW won the match 30–7. American Football had arrived in Australia.\nSoon football equipment began to be imported into Australia. Coaches came from the University of Hawaii for clinics and to help train players. These efforts helped lay the foundation for the sport to develop in Australia so that other leagues could start up around the country.\nAlso in 1984 the Australian American Football Conference was founded (later renamed the Australian American Football League). It was a high-profile team, which the media and sponsors would see as a positive entity to promote the sport, created by Randall Trudgen. The first Kookaburras embarked on an extensive tour to the US, training at US Colleges. The LA Rams assisted in hosting the Kookaburras. The Kookaburras would tour the US and Europe annually until 1992.\nIn 1985 the first organised competition was played in Queensland. The 1st year of competition of the Queensland Gridiron Football League was contested by four clubs, the Brisbane Bulldogs, the Mitchelton Warriors, the Pine Grove Steelers, and the Kenmore Centurions. Unable to gain access to the usual equipment of the game, the teams took the field in the 1st year in makeshift padding and uniforms (without helmets) while still utilising all the normal rules of the games. In the Championship game, SUNBOWL I, the Brisbane Bulldogs defeated the Mitchelton Warriors 5–2.\nIn January 1986 the inaugural South Australian Gridiron Association season commenced with 4 teams: Eastside Razorbacks, Brighton Breakers, Port Adelaide Spartans and Southern Longhorns playing Saturday double-header games at Norwood Oval which had high standard lighting to play under.\nIn November 1989 the Grand Prix Challenge was held in Adelaide, a four-way competition involving Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. New South Wales went on to win the Challenge.\nIn 1990 the Down Under Bowl tournament commenced in Australia and is still going strong. Each year individual American States are invited to field High School all-star teams, travel to Australia and\nspread the growth of the game down under. Games are played against local Australian teams and between US teams. 1998 saw the most successful year yet with 36 teams travelling to the Gold Coast in Queensland to compete in the Down Under Bowl.\nTrans Tasman competition came to Melbourne in January 1991 when Victoria played the visiting South Auckland Raiders from New Zealand, finishing in a 19–19 draw.\nA series of interstate Bowl games were to be played between all major States in October/November 1991. The Victorians were rewarded with a good win. The following week saw the NSW state team go down to the Victorian Eagles at Olympic Park. This left Victoria as the National State Champions for 1991.\nThe National Gridiron League of Australia (NGLA) was formed in January 1991 \"to govern and promote American football on the national level and to represent Australian gridiron on the international scene.\"\nGridiron Australia (GA) was formed in 1994, with the aim of replacing the old National Gridiron League of Australia. By 1995 American football was being played in every State and Territory in Australia, a total of approximately 100 teams.\nIn 1995 Darren Bennett became the third Australian to play in the NFL when he was selected as the punter for the San Diego Chargers. The first Australian to play in the NFL was Colin Ridgeway, who played Aussie Rules for Carlton Football Club in the 1960s before being picked up by the Dallas Cowboys as a punter. After him came Colin Scotts, who went to college in Hawaii before being drafted to play with the Phoenix Cardinals and then the Houston Oilers in the middle to late 1980s.\nGridiron Australia's First National Championships were held in the nation's capital, Canberra, in January 1996. Both senior and junior teams from New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and South Australia attended. South Australia won the Senior Championship 34-0 and New South Wales won the Junior Championship 12–8.\nIn 1996, 24 US teams toured Australia and New Zealand as part of Down Under Bowl VIII. Both Victoria and South Australia recorded wins over US teams.\nIn 1997 the Australia Day Championships were held in Sydney, with Queensland taking the Championship.\nIn 1997 Australia resumed its international campaign, against New Zealand. On 1 August 1997 the Australian Bushrangers played the New Zealand Haka in Auckland, New Zealand. The game, the inaugural Anzac Bowl, was a great success.\nOn 7 January the Australian American Football League (AAFL) was formed.\nOn 31 January 1998 the Bushrangers played Team Hawaii in Honolulu during the National Football League's Pro Bowl week. Trips to Europe and Japan are also planned. Australia has participated in the Gridiron World Cup since 1999.\nIn May 1998 the AAFL was dissolved, with Gridiron Australia becoming the only National body involved in the management of Gridiron matters in Australia.\nOn August 7, 1999, the first American Bowl in Australia was played in Sydney between the Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers at Stadium Australia, the first American pro football game to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. The game attendance was announced at 73,811 spectators.\nIn 2001, the 2nd Gridiron Australia National Championships were played in Canberra again with 6 states competing. Western Australia defeated New South Wales in the final.\nIn 2003 &amp; 2005 the week long Gridiron Australia National Championships were played at the Pines Hockey Stadium in Adelaide, both won by New South Wales.\nIn 2008, Ten HD announced it would televise the NFL season on free-to-air television, including the Super Bowl live.\nIn March 2012, the inaugural Australian Gridiron League series was launched, with state teams from New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia participating. Australia hosted two games of the 2012 LFL All-Fantasy Game Tour Two exhibition games between the Eastern and Western Conferences took place on Australia's east coast in Brisbane and Sydney. Queensland native and wide receiver for the Los Angeles Temptation Chloe Butler served as the ambassador of LFL Football coming to Australia and captained the Western Conference squad.\nThe first Women's Gridiron competition in Australia the Female Gridiron League of Queensland (FGLQ) was launched in 2012 with 3 teams: The Logan City Jets, The Kenmore Panthers and the Gold Coast Sea Wolves. An initiative of the Logan City Gridiron Football Club who developed the competition, the inaugural season was the very first Women's 'Full Kit' Gridiron Competition in Australia. The Logan City Jets were crowned Summerbowl I winners after defeating the Kenmore Panthers. Season 2013 saw the FGLQ expand to 4 teams: Logan City Jets, Kenmore Panthers, Gold Coast Stingrays (as the Gold Coast Stingrays organisation took over running the Gold Coast Sea Wolves) and the new Ipswich Jaguars (joining from the Ipswich Cougars club). Another successful season culminated in the Gold Coast Stingrays defeating the Logan City Jets in Summerbowl II. In season 2014 the competition looks set to expand again with new teams joining including: the Southern Steelers, Sunshine Coast Spartans and a Moreton Bay/Redcliffe side. Gridiron Queensland has taken over responsibility of the FGLQ after two highly successful years of development under the LCGFC banner.\nThe first interstate women's games were played in 2012 with the Western Foxes hosting the Tuggeranong Tornadoes from Canberra, with the Tornadoes winning. A Queensland 'All Stars', side selected from ladies who had played in the inaugural FGLQ season, soon traveled to Victoria to play the Western Foxes with the Queensland side winning.\nIn 2013, Gridiron Australia established the National Club Championship (NCC) Rankings and, on 11 August 2013, staged the first National Club Championship Game, with the #1 ranked Sydney Uni Lions defeating the #2 ranked Gold Coast Stingrays 45–13 at the Square, Sydney University.\nLFL Australia premiered in December 2013. The New South Wales Surge, Queensland Brigade, Victoria Maidens, and Western Australia Angels played in the inaugural 2013–14 LFL Australia season, but it was later replaced by the Ladies Gridiron League.\nIn August 2014, a representative team from Western Australia played the Philippines Aguilas in Manila winning 56-7 and in 2015, Gridiron South Australia celebrated its 30th season.\nSince 2014, Victoria has run its own league, Gridiron Victoria, independent and unaffiliated with Gridiron Australia. Gridiron Victoria is composed of 11 clubs, with thriving Senior Men's, Women, and Colts competitions.\nIn 2016 plans were announced for a National Gridiron League. However the inaugural season was postponed to October 2017."

        "text": "The Bowling Green Barons were a baseball team that represented Bowling Green, Kentucky, in the Class D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League (\"Kitty League\") from 1939 to 1942. The franchise was purchased from the Lexington Bees of Tennessee during the off-season. The Barons were owned by a group of local investors led by Vick Smith Sr. Their home field was Fairgrounds Park.\nWith a roster consisting largely of players from the 1938 Lexington team, the Barons (75–51) finished in a second-place tie with the Owensboro Oilers (based in Owensboro, Kentucky) in 1939. They were managed by Innes \"Rip\" Fanning, another Lexington holdover. With a three-game sweep against Owensboro, they advanced to the finals of the postseason Shaughnessy playoffs against the first-place Mayfield Browns of Mayfield, Kentucky. The series was tied at two games apiece when Fanning, seeking reassurances that he would be rehired the next season and receiving none, resigned on September 14. Kitty League veteran and former major leaguer Herbert \"Dutch\" Welch took over the reins and led Bowling Green to the Shaughnessy title, four games to two.\nExternal links.\nThis article is based on the \"Bowling Green Barons\" article at Baseball-Reference.com Bullpen.

        "text": "Richard Henry Hughes (born February 13, 1938) is an American former professional baseball player who pitched in three seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). In his rookie year, 1967, he led the National League in WHIP (walks+hits per IP), and finished second to Tom Seaver in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.\nHughes was born in Stephens, Arkansas. His family moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1946. Very near-sighted, he began wearing glasses in 7th grade, and learned for the first time that there were people who could see across the street. He graduated from C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport in 1956, and pitched for the Byrd baseball team that won the AAA state championship. He played collegiate baseball on a scholarship at the University of Arkansas for two years before beginning his professional career in 1958.\nContrary to some reports, it was Nelson Briles, not Hughes, who replaced Bob Gibson in the starting rotation for the 1967 St. Louis Cardinals when Gibson suffered a fractured leg due to a Roberto Clemente line drive. Hughes actually replaced veteran left-hander Al Jackson in the Cardinals' rotation in late May, pitching a two-hit shutout against Atlanta in his first start of the season. He went on to win 16 games that year to lead the Redbirds.\nIn spring training of 1968, Hughes was warming up in the bullpen when he felt pain in his throwing shoulder. Though undiagnosed at the time, the injury was later determined to be a torn rotator cuff. At the time, there was no surgery to fix such an injury. Despite the injury, Hughes was able to pitch 63.2 innings during the 1968 season, but those were the last he would throw as the injury ultimately ended his major league career."

        "text": "The outdoor women's singles competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics was part of the tennis program for the games. It was held from 1 to 4 July at Östermalms IP. 12 women from 5 nations entered, but only 8 players from 4 nations actually competed. The event was won by Marguerite Broquedis of France, the nation's first victory in the women's singles. Dorothea Köring of Germany took silver and Molla Mallory of Norway earned bronze; both nations were making their debut in women's singles.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nReigning Olympic champion Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers had won at Wimbledon in 1903, 1904, 1906, 1910, and 1911 (and would win two more times after the Games); she would have been heavily favoured if she had returned. Another top player that was absent was American Margaret Browne. Of the players that were present in Stockholm, German champion Dorothea Köring probably had the best resume at the time. Marguerite Broquedis (who would later win the French championship twice) and Molla Mallory (then of Norway, but who would later move to the United States and win 8 U.S. championships) were both in the early stages of their careers.\nGermany, Norway, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. France made its second appearance, matching Great Britain as the two nations that had competed in two of the three editions of the women's singles tournament to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets."

        "text": "Golf equipment encompasses the various items that are used to play the sport of golf. Types of equipment include the golf ball, golf clubs, and devices that aid in the sport.\nEquipment.\nBalls.\nOriginally, golf balls were made of a hardwood, such as beech. Beginning between the 14th and 16th centuries, more expensive golf balls were made of a leather skin stuffed with down feathers; these were called \"featheries\". Around the mid-1800s, a new material called gutta-percha, made from the latex of the East Asian sapodilla tree, started to be used to create more inexpensive golf balls nicknamed \"gutties\", which had similar flight characteristics as featheries. These then progressed to \"brambles\" in the later 1800s, using a raised dimple pattern and resembling bramble fruit, and then to \"meshies\" beginning in the early 1900s, where ball manufacturers started experimenting with latex rubber cores and wound mesh skins that created recessed patterns over the ball's surface. Recessed circular dimples were patented in 1910, but didn't become popular until the 1940s after the patents expired.\nGolf clubs.\nA player usually carries several clubs during the game (but no more than fourteen, the limit defined by the rules). There are three major types of clubs, known as woods, irons, and putters. Woods are played for long shots from the tee or fairway, and occasionally rough, while irons are for precision shots from fairways as well as from the rough. A new type of club called a hybrid combines the straight-hitting characteristics of irons with the easy-to-hit characteristics of higher-lofted woods. A hybrid is often used for long shots from difficult rough. Hybrids are also used by players who have a difficult time getting the ball airborne with long irons. Wedges are irons used to play shorter shots. Wedges are played from difficult ground such as sand or the rough and for approach shots to the green. \nPutters are mostly played on the green, but can also be useful when playing some approach shots. Putters have minimal loft, meaning the ball stays close to the ground when struck. The most common clubs to make up a set used to be a driver, 3 and 5-woods, irons numbered from 3 to 9, pitching wedge, sand wedge, and putter. Modern sets commonly include hybrids, often replacing the longer irons and 5-wood, and/or additional wedges such as a gap or lob wedge. Players may choose to play with any combination of clubs, limited by the rules to a maximum of 14.\nBall markers.\nWhen on the green, the ball may be picked up to be cleaned or if it is in the way of an opponent's putting line; there are certain other circumstances in which a ball may be lifted. In these cases, the ball's position must first be marked using a \"ball marker\"; this is typically a round, flat piece of metal or plastic that is differentiable from others in use. Ball markers are often integrated into other accessories, such as divot tools, scorekeeping tools or tee holders, and in the absence of a purpose-made marker, a small coin such as a penny is acceptable.\nTees.\nA tee is an object (wooden or plastic) that is pushed into or placed on the ground to rest a ball on top of for an easier shot; however, this is only allowed for the first stroke (\"tee shot\" or \"drive\") of each hole. Conventional golf tees are basically spikes with a small cup on the head to hold the ball, and are usually made of wood or plastic. Wooden tees are generally very inexpensive and quite disposable; a player may damage or break many of these during the course of a round. Plastic tees are generally more expensive but last longer. The length of tees varies according to the club intended to be used and by personal preference; longer tees (3–3.5\") allow the player to position the ball higher off the ground while remaining stable when planted, and are generally used for modern deep-faced woods. They can be planted deeper for use with other clubs but then tend to break more often. Shorter tees (1.5–2.5\") are suitable for irons and are more easily inserted and less easily broken than long tees. Other designs of tee exist; the \"step tee\" is milled or molded with a spool-shaped upper half, and so generally provides a consistent ball height from shot to shot. The \"brush tee\" uses a collection of stiff bristles instead of a cup to position the ball; the design is touted by its manufacturer as providing less interference to the ball or club at impact, for a straighter, longer flight.\nAlternately, the rules allow for a mound of sand to be used for the same function, also only on the first shot. Before the invention of the wooden spike tee, this was the only accepted method of lifting the ball for the initial shot. This is rarely done in modern times, as a tee is easier to place, hit from, and recover, but some courses prohibit the use of tees either for traditional reasons, or because a swing that hits the tee will drive it into or rip it out of the ground, resulting in damage to the turf of the tee-box. Tees also create litter if discarded incorrectly when broken.\nGolf bag.\nA golfer typically transports golf clubs in a golf bag. Modern golf bags are made of nylon, canvas and/or leather, with plastic or metal reinforcement and framing, but historically bags have been made from other materials. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying various equipment and supplies required over the course of a round of golf. Virtually all bags are sectioned off with rigid supports at the top opening, both for rigidity and to separate clubs of various types for easier selection. More expensive bags have sleeves or pockets within the main compartment for each individual club, allowing for the desired club to be more easily removed from the bag and then returned without interference from the grips of the other clubs or internal hardware of the bag.\nGolf cart.\nGolf carts are vehicles used to transport golf bags and golfers along the golf course during a round of golf. Hand carts are designed to hold only the bag, and are used by players while walking along the course to relieve them of the weight of the bag. Carts that carry both player and bag are more common on public golf courses; most of these are powered by a battery and electric motors, though gasoline-powered carts are sometimes used by course staff, and some courses and players are beginning to explore alternatives such as bicycle-drawn carts.\nThe traditional way to play was to walk, but the use of golf carts is very common due to a number of factors. Chief among them is the sheer length of the modern course, and the required \"pace of play\" instituted by many courses to prevent delays for other golfers and maintain a schedule of tee times. A typical par-72 course would \"measure out\" at between in total, which does not count the distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, nor the additional distance caused by errant shots. A player walking a course might traverse up to 5 miles (8 km). With a typical required pace of play of 4 hours, a player would spend 1.6 hours of that time simply walking to their next shot, leaving an average of only two minutes for all players to make each of the 72 shots for a par score (and most casual players do not score the course par). Economics is another reason why carts have become prevalent at many courses; the fee for renting a cart is less expensive than paying a caddie to carry the bags, and the private club gets the money for the cart rentals. By lessening the amount of walking required, carts also enable people who are less able to walk around the course to play the game.\nThe use of carts may be restricted by local rules. Courses may institute rules such as \"90 degree paths\", where drivers must stay on the cart path until level with their ball, and then may turn onto the course. This typically reduces the effect that the furrows from the cart wheels will have on balls. Soft ground due to rain or recent maintenance work may require a \"cart path only\" driving rule to protect the turf, and a similar policy may apply in general to the areas around tee boxes and greens (and on shorter par-3 holes where fairway shots are not expected). The use of carts is banned altogether at most major PGA tournaments; players walk the course assisted by a caddy who carries equipment.\nTowels.\nMost golf bags have a ring to which a player can tie or clip a golf towel, used to wipe hands and clean or dry balls and club faces. Some of these towels can be quite specialized, with a carabiner or other clip to attach it to the bag with a grommet used on the towel for durability, and incorporating rougher materials in certain sections of the towel for club and ball cleaning with softer weaves elsewhere for drying. Other cleaning products abound, from motorized ball cleaners to an array of brushes for various types of clubs as well as balls and shoes.\nClubhead covers.\nClubhead covers protect the clubs from striking each other and from weather and incidental damage while in the bag, make clubs more identifiable at a glance, and provide a personal touch to a player's clubs. The most common clubhead covers are for a player's driver and fairway woods, as modern designs have large hollow heads and long shafts that make them prone to damage, but covers for hybrids, putters, and even irons/wedges are also marketed.\nBall mark repair tool.\nA ball mark repair tool (also known as a pitchfork or divot tool) is used to repair a ball mark (a depression in the green where a ball has hit the ground on its approach shot). Some tees contain such a tool at the end, for pure convenience when on the green. To repair a ball mark, one pushes the tool next to the mark and pushes gently inwards from all sides, loosening the compacted turf to allow rapid regrowth of grass, and then flattens the mark with the smooth flat bottom of the putter to smooth the putting surface.\nOther aids.\nOther tools exist to aid the golfer in various ways during a round.\nTraining aids.\nVarious golf training aids have been introduced to help players improving driving, putting, impact, golf swing speed, and the mental game of golf. In general, training aids are intended for use only while practicing, with use during competitive play prohibited in the rules.\nClothing.\nGolf clothing includes gloves, shoes, and other specialized golf attire. Specialized golf attire (including shirts, pants, and shorts) is designed to be nonrestrictive to a player's range of motion and to keep the player warm or cool and dry while being fashionable, although a common stereotype of amateur golfers is that of wearing clothes that have long been out of fashion, such as plus fours. Country club dress codes typically require players to wear collared shirts and prohibit work clothes, e.g. jeans.\nGloves.\nGolfers also often wear gloves that help grip the club and prevent blistering. Gloves are sold individually and normally worn only on the players' non-dominant hand, but it is not unheard-of for a player to wear gloves on both hands to reduce chafing. The increased grip and control allows for harder swings to be made with more control, increasing distance.\nShoes.\nMany golfers wear special shoes. The shoes can be spikeless or with spikes attached to the soles. The spikes can be made of metal or plastic (plastic spikes are also known as \"soft spikes\") designed to increase traction thus helping the player to keep his/her balance during the swing, on greens, or in wet conditions. In an attempt to minimize the severity of spike marks made on greens, many golf courses have banned metal spikes, allowing only plastic spikes during play.\nSpikes on most golf shoes are replaceable, being attached using one of two common methods: a thread or a twist lock. Two sizes of thread are in common use, called a \"large thread\" and \"small thread\".\nThere are two common locking systems: Q-LOK and Tri-LOK (also called \"Fast Twist\"). The locking systems use a plastic thread which takes only about a half turn to lock."

        "title": "Harry Newman (American football)",
        "text": "Harry Lawrence Newman (September 5, 1909 – May 2, 2000) was an American professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines (1930–32), for whom in 1932 he was a unanimous first-team All-American, and the recipient of the Douglas Fairbanks Trophy as Outstanding College Player of the Year (predecessor of the Heisman Trophy), and the Helms Athletic Foundation Player of the Year Award, he was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He then played professionally for the New York Giants (1933–35), earning All-Pro honors, before joining the Brooklyn/Rochester Tigers (1936–37).\nEarly life.\nNewman was born in Detroit, Michigan, and was Jewish. He was a running back at Northern High School, where he also played center field on the baseball team, and then attended a camp where Benny Friedman was the counselor and taught him how to pass a football.\nCollege career.\nNewman attended the University of Michigan, and played for the Wolverines in football in 1930–32.\nIn Newman's three years at Michigan, the Wolverines lost only one game, won three Big Ten Conference championship, and had a combined record of 24–1–2. As a senior in 1932, Newman led the team to an undefeated season and national championship, as he played 437 out of 480 minutes of game time in Michigan's eight games. In 1932, Newman was a unanimous first-team All-American, and the recipient of the Douglas Fairbanks Trophy as Outstanding College Player of the Year (predecessor of the Heisman Trophy), and the Helms Athletic Foundation Player of the Year Award, the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference.\nNFL New York Giants.\n1933 season.\nAs a rookie with the New York Giants in 1933, Newman was an All-Pro and led the NFL in passes completed (53), passing yards (973), touchdown passes (11), and longest pass completion (78 yards). Newman's 973 passing yards stood as the NFL single-season record until 1937 when Arnie Herber threw for 1,239 yards. He also led the Giants, and was sixth in the NFL, with 437 yards rushing in 1933. With 1,547 yards of total offense (973 passing, 437 rushing and 137 receiving), Newman personally accounted for more than half of the Giants' total offense in 1933. He was named to the All-Pro team, and led the Giants to the 1933 NFL championship game.\nIn the 1933 NFL Championship Game against the Chicago Bears, Newman threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Red Badgro to give the Giants a 7–6 halftime lead. Newman's touchdown throw to Badgro was the first touchdown pass thrown in an NFL championship game. After the Bears went ahead 16–14 in the third quarter, Newman threw a second touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to give the Giants the lead, but the Bears scored the winning touchdown with less than one minute left to win the championship game, 23–21.\n1934 season.\nIn 1934, Newman was the Giant's leading rusher and passer, and was an All-Pro for the second consecutive season. The Giants went on to win their first NFL championship in 1934, but Newman's season was cut short after he broke two bones in his back during the tenth game of the season against the Chicago Bears. Newman complained after the 1934 season that the new football adopted by the NFL in 1934 was \"harder to pass\" than the old one which had greater girth. He set the NFL single-game carries record of 38 which was tied in 1966 by Jim Nance and broken in 1973 by O. J. Simpson.\n1935 season.\nIn early September 1935, there were reports that Newman might not return to the Giants' backfield, because he did not want to leave his Detroit liquor business. Newman announced he was quitting professional football and did not play the first few weeks of the season. Then, on October 15, 1935, Newman announced that he had changed his mind and signed a contract to play with the Giants beginning the following Saturday. After his return, Newman wrote: \"Football still is fun. If it weren't it wouldn't be worth while, regardless of how much they paid you for it. Believe me, I've missed it the few weeks I was out and I was mighty glad to get back into action.\" Newman played in eight games (four as a starter) for a Giants team that once again advanced to the NFL Championship Game, losing to the Detroit Lions, 26–7. With the clock ticking off the final seconds of the championship game, Newman threw an interception that was run back 36 yards and resulted in a final score by the Lions.\nIn November 1935, Newman wrote a guest column for the New York Post on the difference between the college and professional game. Newman wrote: \"Among the Giants we kid a lot about how we feel Monday morning. Sometimes it's not too good. That's when the aches and pains begin to creep up on you. Boys, how you hate to get out of bed! The only difference between pro and amateur in that respect is that you ache all over a day later in pro football.\"\nAfter the 1935 season, Newman credited his disappointing performance in 1935 to skating: \"Skating is the best thing I know of to develop hip-swinging, judgment of distance, suppleness, dexterity, pivot and angle terms. I was off form in 1935 and the main reason was because I did no skating last winter. I did a lot in 1932–33 and followed it up with a great season on the gridiron.\"\nIn 1936, Giants's president John V. Mara said that the club had paid Newman $10,000 in 1935. Mara said that the owners had found out that it did not work out to pay one star $800 a game while the rest of the team was paid $100 per game, and the resentment sometimes showed. The owners reacted by trying to evenly distribute money over the squad, such that Mara believed that the highest paid player in 1936 was paid only $500 per game.\nAmerican Professional Football League.\nBrooklyn Tigers (1936).\nIn 1936, Newman jumped to the new American Football League and signed with the Brooklyn Tigers. Newman reportedly made the move \"because he got a contract calling for a big increase in salary.\" Newman was one of the first established stars to switch to the new league, and sports writer Harry Grayson reported on Newman's move: \"Harry Newman, the former Michigan quarterback who has been the highest paid pro athlete of the last three campaigns, has left the Giants flat to perform with and be the business manager of the American League entry which plans to stage its games at the Yankee Stadium.\"\nEven before the new league got started, it was reported to be tottering on the brink and a \"big flop.\" As one report noted: \"That in spite of the fact such outstanding players as Ken Strong,Harry Newman and Gomer Jones are slated to compete for the new clubs.\"\nOn October 19, 1936, Newman scored the Tigers' only touchdown in a loss to Pittsburgh at Forbes Field.\nOn November 1, 1936, Newman made a \"sensational 45-yard run\" that \"brought the crowd to its feet\" just before the first quarter ended. Newman also kicked a field goal to give the Tigers a 3–0 lead over the New York Yankees, but the Yankees tied it with a field goal. Later in the game, Newman ran 75 yards for what appeared to be the winning touchdown, but the play was called back on a clipping penalty. In response to the penalty call, the crowd at Yankee Stadium \"booed lustily.\"\nOn November 8, 1936, Newman lateraled for both of Brooklyn's touchdowns and kicked both extra points in a 15–14 loss to the Cleveland Rams.\nRochester Tigers (1936–37).\nIn mid-November 1936, the Tigers franchise moved to Rochester, New York, where they played the final two games of the 1936 season. In announcing the move, one report focused on Newman as one of the best players in the new league: \"Headlining the Rochester cast is Harry Newman, football's greatest passer . . . Newman is the leading ground gainer in the American League, despite the fact that he is with a second division club.\"\nThe Rochester Tigers lost to the Rams again in late November by a score of 7–6 on \"a snow-swept gridiron.\" Newman put the Tigers ahead with two 35-yard field goals in the fourth quarter, but the Rams recovered a fumble behind the Tigers' goal line to win the game.\nThe Brooklyn/Rochester Tigers finished the 1936 season in last place in the new league with a record of 0–6–1, and were outscored 82–58.\nNewman closed the season on December 20, 1936 playing for the New York Yankees against the Boston Shamrocks. This was an exhibition game, as the league's regular season had ended in November. The Yankees won, 25–19, and Newman \"booted a perfect kick from placement on the 30-yard line.\"\nNewman and Mike Palm owned the Tigers franchise and moved it to Rochester for two games at the end of 1936. However, in March 1937, Newman and Palm said they expected to move the franchise out of Rochester unless a minimum of $25,000 in cash subscriptions could be raised.\nOn September 14, 1937, a group of 30 men announced the formation of the Rochester Professional Football Team, Inc. to continue operation of the Rochester Tigers. Newman and Mike Palm were named as the coaches. Newman drew a salary of $250 per game for Rochester in 1937, higher than the professional average of $100, but less than the $425 paid to Sammy Baugh. The Tigers opened with a 16–0 loss to the Boston Shamrocks, followed by a 17–14 win over the Cincinnati Red Legs. They followed with a 6–0 win over the Boston Shamrocks, as Newman kicked a field goal in the win. On October 24, 1937, Newman and Bill O'Neill led the Tigers to a 24–0 victory over the New York Yankees, as the Tigers moved into second place with a 3–2 record behind the Los Angeles Bulldogs. In the season's sixth game, Newman led the Tigers to a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, throwing three passes to account for a touchdown and then kicking the extra point in the final minute and a half. Newman and former Pitt halfback Mike Sebastian were the mainstays of the 1937 Tigers.\nOn November 14, 1937, the Tigers played the first place Los Angeles Bulldogs. The Bulldogs took a 35–0 lead before Newman launched a comeback attempt. Newman ran 25 yards for a touchdown and threw two touchdown passes, but the Bulldogs won, 48–21.\nAfter the 1937, season the American Professional Football League folded, and Newman retired from football.\nLater years.\nNewman later became an executive with Ford Motor Company and owned Ford dealerships in Detroit and Denver. He later lived in Palm Aire in Pompano Beach, Florida, and ultimately in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he died in May 2000 at the age of 90.\nHonors and accolades.\nNewman received numerous honors and accolades, including the following:"

He played professional as a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills for five seasons in the National Football League (NFL). At 6'2\" and 215 lb., Kinney was selected by the Chiefs in the first round of the 1972 NFL Draft with the 23rd overall pick. He is an alumnus of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Oxford, Nebraska, and raised in McCook, Kinney graduated from McCook High School in 1968 and played quarterback.\nNebraska Cornhuskers.\nHe played college football at Nebraska under head coach Bob Devaney, with future head coach Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator. A three-year starter (1969–71), Kinney was the tailback (I-back) on the national championship teams of 1970 and 1971, and the Huskers' leading rusher in 1969 and 1971. He wore #35, often in a tatters, as tear-away jerseys were common for collegiate offensive backs in the early 1970s.\nIn the \"Game of the Century\" against the unbeaten Oklahoma Sooners in Norman on Thanksgiving Day 1971, Kinney rushed for 171 yards, 151 in the second half, on 31 carries (5.5 avg.) and scored four touchdowns, the final one with less than two minutes remaining to put Nebraska ahead 35–31, the final score.\nThe Huskers went 13–0 in 1971 and were consensus national champions; they defeated the next three teams in the final AP poll: Oklahoma, Colorado (31–7 in Lincoln), and Alabama (38–6 in the Orange Bowl). The 1971 Nebraska Cornhuskers are considered among the most dominant teams in college football history. Kinney finished the 1971 season with 1155 yards rushing on 242 carries (4.8 avg.) and 17 touchdowns.\nNFL.\nKinney was the second of three Nebraska Cornhuskers selected in the first round of the 1972 NFL draft; QB Jerry Tagge was taken 11th by his hometown team, the Green Bay Packers, and DT Larry Jacobson was selected by the New York Giants with the 24th overall pick, immediately after.\nAt the start of his fifth season in the NFL in 1976, he was released by the Chiefs after the first game and picked up by the Buffalo Bills in mid-September. Kinney was picked up to replace the injured Jim Braxton as the blocking back for O. J. Simpson. A few weeks after being waived, Kinney gained 114 yards against the Chiefs.\nKinney was waived by the Bills in August 1977, and retired. After football, he worked in financial services."

        "text": "The Small World Cup () was a football tournament held in Venezuela between 1952 and 1975 (with some journalists considering 1952–57 the period of greatest relevance, and the second period that took place between 1963 and 1975 as of minor relevance). In most of the occasions, the competition was played by four participants from Europe and South America. In the first period, clubs from three countries would win the tournament: Spain, Brazil and Colombia. Six clubs have won the trophy in this period: Botafogo, Real Madrid, São Paulo, Millonarios, Corinthians, and Barcelona.\nWhen the Europeans Champions Clubs' Cup was started in 1955, the Venezuelan competition lost importance and was discontinued in 1957. Although the tournament was relaunched in 1963, its relevance decreased as annother competion was happenin at the time, the Intercontinental Cup (first held in 1960) was then established as the major, official intercontinental competition for both South American and European clubs. \nDuring the 1963–75 period, the trophy was also named \"Copa Ciudad de Caracas\". However, there is controversy surrounding this name, as during this period the Taça Ciudad de Caracas was named after different trophies taking place in the same city, different championships, so in 1966 Botafogo was considered the winner and competed against Santos in the grand final, winning the Trophy called Journalists Circle Cup (Copa Círculo de Pediodicos Deportivos), however Valencia also competed with Vitoria Guimares and won the Símon Bolivar trophy. Thus, the winner of the Caracas tournament that year is controversial, as the greatest relevance was the Botafogo and Santos game, where great players such as Garrincha and Pelé starred. Then, in 1967, the tournament in Caracas was between, again, the Journalists Circle Cup (Copa Círculo de Pediodicos Deportivos), where teams such as Barcelona, Botafogo and Peñarol played. And, later in the year, the so-called Copa Cuadricentenario de Caracas took place, which was played between the teams Athletic Bilbao, Platense and Académica Coimbra, super regional teams that no longer exist.\nIn 1968 the Tournament took place in Caracas in which the Oldemario Ramos Trophy was offered, played between the teams of Benfica, Botafogo and Argentina XI. in which Botafogo became the great champion.\nThis competition is considered by some journalists as a predecessor of Intercontinental Cup, in that it regularly featured clubs from Europe and South America. However, there has come to light no 1952–1960 original source indicating that it had any influence for the creation of the Intercontinental Cup, or that it was effectively hailed in 1952–1957 as a club world trophy. Nevertheless, some clubs like Real Madrid highlight this trophy in their history as a world championsip or trophy section of their web-sites and publications. "

He played in their minor league system in 1955 and briefly in 1956, before leaving organized baseball—he returned to the Cincinnati farm system in 1960. Prior to the season, he was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies, but was never called up to the major league level. After the season, on November 27, 1961, he was acquired by the Angels in the 1961 Rule 5 draft.\nTorres played three seasons in Major League Baseball, making his major league debut with the Los Angeles Angels in . On April 10, 1962, Torres went 0-for-4 in his major league debut against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Illinois. In his third career game, a 5–0 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, Torres earned his first career hit, a leadoff double off pitcher Jim Kaat.\nIn , his rookie season, the career .254 hitter hit 11 home runs and batted in 74 runs, far more than the 51 he would knock in the next season. In 127 games, he batted .259 and scored a career-high 44 runs. During the season, Torres played in a career-high 138 games, but had his least-productive power-hitting season, launching only 4 home runs. Torres did, however, hit .261 on 121 hits, both career-high marks. Torres hit a career-high 12 home runs in , the third highest total by an Angel that year, behind only teammates Joe Adcock (21) and Jim Fregosi (18). Although he reached a career high in 1964 in both home runs and slugging percentage, he set career-lows in games played, runs, hits, RBIs, and batting average before eventually settling into retirement following the season.\nAlthough he was mostly known for his playing time for the Angels, before his Major League Baseball career began, he participated in the 1960 Caribbean Series. Torres tied for the tournament lead in home runs, hitting three in the week-long competition. Torres shared the honors with fellow-Puerto Rican Herman Davis and Héctor López of Panama, who spent time in Major League Baseball during his career."

González mainly played for the High Single-A Lancaster JetHawks in 2006, but also spent some time with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. González played in 122 games and batted .289 with a career high 23 home runs. He also led the JetHawks in home runs (21) and RBIs (93). González was also an All-Star Futures Game selection and a California League postseason All-Star selection. \"Baseball America\" rated González as a High Class-A All-Star, and he received the same honor from \"Topps\".\nIn 2007, \"Baseball America\" rated González at #18 on their top 10 prospects list and was the 3rd highest Diamondbacks player on that list. González mainly played for the Double-A Mobile BayBears, but also spent some time in Triple-A with the Tucson Sidewinders. González played in 130 games and batted .288 with 17 home runs. González led the BayBears in home runs (16) and RBI (75). González was once again named to the All-Star Futures Game.\nOn December 14, 2007, the Diamondbacks traded González, Dana Eveland, Aaron Cunningham, Chris Carter, Brett Anderson, and Greg Smith to the Oakland Athletics for Dan Haren and Connor Robertson.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn May 30, 2008, González made his MLB debut at the age of 22 against the Texas Rangers, where he got his first career hit, an opposite field double down the left field line off Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Millwood. This was one of two doubles he hit in his major league debut. His next five major league hits were also doubles, making González the first player since Hall of Famer Johnny Mize in 1936 to record the first seven hits of his career as extra base hits. On June 20, 2008, González hit his first career home run against the Florida Marlins. It was a solo home run that was hit off a curveball to right-center field. He had his first 4-hit game, going 4-for-4 against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 8.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn November 12, 2008, González was traded with Huston Street and Greg Smith to the Colorado Rockies for Matt Holliday. After what many called a disappointing season with Oakland, González spent most of the season with the Rockies Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. After a series of injuries to the Rockies outfield, González was called up and started slowly, but eventually began to produce, proving himself as a nice combination of power and speed atop the lineup. In the 2009 National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, González tied the franchise record for the most hits in an NLDS with 10, and led the NLDS and ALDS in batting average with .588 in four games. In his 2010 season, he finished in the top 5 in home runs, batting average, RBIs, and runs scored in the National League.\nOn July 31, 2010, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, González hit for the cycle, including a walk-off home run on the first pitch in the bottom of the 9th inning. He became the first player since Dwight Evans of the Boston Red Sox in 1984 to hit a walk-off home run for the cycle, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Manager Jim Tracy labeled González as not just a five-tool player, but a \"six-tool player.\" Only four other players in major league baseball history had completed a cycle with a game-ending homer: Ken Boyer (1961), César Tovar (1972), George Brett (1979), Dwight Evans (1984). Nolan Arenado repeated the feat in 2017 to make it six total players in major league history.\nIn 2010, González garnered serious consideration as a candidate for the National League MVP award, along with St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols and Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto, as well as a Triple Crown candidate with the above-mentioned first basemen. However, González fell short on home runs and narrowly missed having the most RBI, but did manage to win the NL batting title in 2010 with a .336 average. He finished with 34 home runs, 117 RBI and a National League-leading 197 hits. He also led the National League in total bases (351) and power-speed number (29.5).\nGonzález received the National League Players Choice Award for Outstanding Player in 2010. He then won the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year throughout Major League Baseball. González was also voted the winner of the 2010 Luis Aparicio Award, which is given to the most outstanding Venezuelan player in Major League Baseball, as voted by Venezuelan and international Spanish-speaking media. He finished third in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America for National League MVP. For his defensive efforts in 2010, in which he only committed one error in the outfield, González won his first Gold Glove. On the offensive side, González received his first Silver Slugger Award.\nGonzález signed a seven-year, $80.5 million contract extension with the Rockies on January 11, 2011. The contract included a $3 million signing bonus and yearly salaries through 2017 that ramp up to $20 million. It is the largest contract in MLB history for a two-year player. On May 21, 2012, he became the 22nd player in MLB history to hit a home run in four consecutive at-bats, doing this during a two-game span against the Houston Astros. In early July 2011, Gonzalez injured his right wrist and was placed on the disabled list. On July 21, 2011, he yet again injured the wrist against the Atlanta Braves. On May 14, 2013, he went 5-for-5 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, hitting 2 home runs and setting a new career high with 5 hits in one game. On June 5, 2013, he hit 3 home runs against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in a 12–4 victory.\nIn 2014, with the breakout of Corey Dickerson, González was moved out to right field.\nGonzález won a Silver Slugger Award in right field for the 2015 season after hitting 40 home runs, second most in the National League.\nAfter his poor performance in the 2017 season it was highly speculated that Gonzalez would not return to play for the Rockies in the 2018 season. After the 2017 season González did temporarily leave the team, and entered free agency. However González was re-signed to a one-year, $8 million contract on March 12, 2018, to remain playing for the Rockies.\nIn 2018, he played 132 games hitting 16 home runs and batting .276 with 67 RBI's. He entered free agency at the end of the season.\nCleveland Indians.\nGonzález signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on March 19, 2019; the deal included a non-roster invitation to spring training. He is set to make $2 million, plus $1 million in incentives, because he made the big league roster.\nThe Indians purchased González's contract on April 14, 2019. González was designated for assignment by the Indians on May 22, 2019, after hitting .210 with 2 home runs and 7 runs batted in. After clearing waivers, González elected free agency on May 26, 2019.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn May 30, 2019, González agreed to a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. The team purchased his contract on June 3, 2019, and he was the starting right fielder in an inter-league game against the Los Angeles Angels. With one out and the bases loaded in the seventh inning, González made a highlight-reel game-saving diving catch. On June 29, he was designated for assignment for the second time in the 2019 season. On July 2, González again elected free agency.\nSeattle Mariners.\nHe was signed to a minor league contract on February 12, 2020, with the Seattle Mariners. Gonzalez was released by the Mariners organization on June 25, 2020.\nPersonal life.\nGonzalez married a Venezuelan woman named Indonesia Riera on October 20, 2012. He is the father of a boy and twin girls."

Fox (born April 7, 1943) is an American former professional basketball player.\nCollege career.\nFox was born in Atlanta and attended Gordon High School in Barnesville, Georgia. A 6'10\" center, Fox played in junior college before enrolling his junior year at the University of South Carolina, playing in 13 games his junior season. He burst onto the scene his senior year, 1964–65, leading the Gamecocks in both scoring and rebounding. He averaged 17.8 points and 13.6 rebounds per game.\nProfessional career.\nHe was drafted in the eighth round of the 1965 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals, but he elected to play professionally in Europe for two seasons.\nFox joined the NBA's Royals for the 1967–68 season. In 31 games for the Royals, he averaged 3.2 points and 3.1 rebounds in eight minutes per game. Then, on February 1, 1968, he was part of a big trade which sent him and Happy Hairston to the Detroit Pistons for Tom Van Arsdale and John Tresvant. His playing time increased to over 15 minutes per game in 24 games for the Pistons, and he averaged 4.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.\nThe following season, 1968–69, Fox again was part of a midseason trade. In 25 games for the Pistons, he averaged 5.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game before being traded on December 17, 1968, along with a third-round draft pick to the \nPhoenix Suns for McCoy McLemore. He found success with the Suns—he became a starter, averaging over 38 minutes per game and career-high 13.8 points and 13.3 rebounds along with 2.8 assists per game.\nIn 1969–70, he played the entire season for the Suns. Averaging 25 minutes per game in 81 games, he averaged 12.9 points and 7.0 rebounds per game with a career-best .524 field goal percentage.\nJust after the completion of the 1969–70 season, on April 23, 1970, Fox was again traded, this time along with a second-round draft pick to the Chicago Bulls for Clem Haskins. For the 1970–21 season with the Bulls, Fox played in all 82 games, averaging 9.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.\nIn 1971–72, Fox played in 10 games for the Bulls before being traded again, this time along with a second-round draft pick back to the Cincinnati Royals for Norm Van Lier and a third-round pick. For the season, in 81 games, he averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.\nOn October 9, 1972, Fox was on the move yet again. The Kansas City-Omaha Kings (formerly the Cincinnati Royals) traded him along with Dick Gibbs to the Seattle SuperSonics for a second-round pick. In the 1972–73 season, he averaged 11.4 points and a career second-best 11.2 rebounds per game.\nIn 1973–74 he had another fine season with the Sonics, averaging 11.3 points and 9.2 rebounds along with a career-best 2.9 assists per game. He still holds the SuperSonics single-game record for rebounds with 30, while adding 25 points and nine assists, which he collected in a win against the Los Angeles Lakers on December 26, 1973.\nThe 1974–75 season was his third full season with Seattle as Fox averaged 9.0 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.\nOn October 22, 1975, Fox was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for a second-round draft pick. For the season, he averaged 3.9 points and 3.4 rebounds per game.\nOn October 20, 1976, the Bucks waived Fox, and a week later he signed with the New York Nets. In his final NBA season, he averaged 6.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.\nFox averaged 9.3 points and 7.4 rebounds in his 10-year NBA career.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from his 10-year NBA career, in 1978 Fox founded Sport Court of Arizona, which specializes in game court construction, outdoor recreation, performance sports products, and surfacing. Sport Court of Arizona serves residential communities and commercial properties in Scottsdale, Tucson, Phoenix and their surrounding areas.\nIn 2005, Fox was inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.\nHis two sons, Mike and Jim Jr., who grew up on Sport Court products, have taken over the business since Jim Sr. has retired.\nFox has taken up watercolors in his retirement. He is a signature member of the Arizona Watercolor Association and the National Watercolor Society.\nIn 2018, Jim became a published illustrator with the debut of the bilingual picture book, \"Babies Nurse / Asi se alimentan los bebes\" () written by his daughter-in-law, Phoebe Fox. He is also the illustrator of Babies Bond and the author/illustrator of The Legend of the Verde River Smelter House and The Legend of the Jekyll Island Submarine.\nHe is a grandfather of five and resides in Phoenix with his wife, Mary Alice."

Surprised by a massive home crowd, he overhauled Australia's top favorites Michael Klim and Geoff Huegill on the final 25 metres to snatch a gold medal in a new European record of 52.00. Klim added a silver to his two relay golds from the Games, in a time of 52.18, while Huegill took home the bronze in 52.22, handing an entire medal pool for the Aussies with an unexpected two–three finish.\nAt 18 years of age, U.S. teenage swimmer Ian Crocker came up with a spectacular swim to earn a fourth spot in an American record of 52.44. Meanwhile, Canada's Mike Mintenko shared a fifth-place tie with Japan's Takashi Yamamoto in a matching standard of 52.58. Germany's Thomas Rupprath and Russia's Anatoly Polyakov closed out the field with a joint seventh-place finish (53.13).\nEarlier in the semifinals, Huegill became the second fastest of all-time in swimming history to break a 52-second barrier, establishing a new Olympic record of 51.96.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.

        "title": "Doping at the 2007 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 2007 Tour de France was affected by a series of scandals and speculations related to doping. By the end of the Tour, two cyclists were dismissed for failing tests and the wearer of the yellow jersey was voluntarily retired by his team for lying about his whereabouts and missing doping tests. A fourth rider was confirmed to having used doping while in a training session prior to the 2007 Tour and a fifth rider failed tests late in the race, with his result being officially announced just after the end of the Tour. During the competition, two teams were asked to withdraw after at least one member was found to have doped.\nThe events generated criticism and a general distrustful attitude toward the sport of professional cycling from media and public opinion. The doping allegations also resulted in several team sponsors threatening to retire their support if events advanced further. Some media such as German TV channels ARD and ZDF left the Tour once the first scandals broke. Following the Tour's conclusion, the sport's governing bodies spoke out about ways to combat the prevalence of doping in cycling and key team sponsors elected to withdraw their support due to the reputational damage caused by the scandals. The 2007 Tour de France has been referred to as one of the most controversial Tours. After the end of the Tour, \"The Times\" of London ranked it 4th in its list of the top 50 sporting scandals.\nBackground.\nSince the introduction of doping tests in 1964, many cyclists were caught in the Tour de France. In recent years, 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis and points classification winner Erik Zabel, along with most of their Team Telekom team-mates, confessed to using erythropoietin (EPO). In 1997, former points classification winner Djamolidine Abdoujaparov was disqualified from the Tour de France for doping use. In 1998, the Festina affair had several main contenders removed from the race. In the next years, several riders were removed from the Tour de France for doping (see List of doping cases in cycling).\nIn addition, several riders were not allowed to start the previous Tour, including Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso because of their involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case, a Spanish investigation against doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and a number of accomplices accused of administering prohibited doping products to approximately two hundred professional athletes, to enhance their performance.\nAfter the completion of the 2006 Tour, winner Floyd Landis was found to have an elevated testosterone to epitestosterone ratio on a sample taken following Stage 17 of the race, and at the time of the 2007 Tour prologue. Since the results of an independent arbitration hearing were still pending Landis was prevented from defending his title. He was stripped of his 2006 Tour title in September 2007.\nEvents immediately before the Tour.\nAlessandro Petacchi, a sprint specialist, failed a test for salbutamol at Pinerolo on 23 May in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, the same day he claimed the third of his five-stage wins in the event. As a result, Petacchi, an asthma sufferer, was suspended by Team Milram and forced to miss the Tour de France because of the charges. Though he seemed cleared of the charges at one point, he was later suspended for one year.\nOn May 25, Bjarne Riis admitted he had won the overall competition of the 1996 edition under the effects of performance-enhancing drugs, claiming \"for a time [doping] was a part of everyday life for me\", and he was later stripped of the title. Five other former Telekom teammates were also implicated in doping. On May 24, riders Erik Zabel and Rolf Aldag had earlier admitted to using banned blood booster EPO in the mid-1990s.\nOther high-profile potential Tour riders were caught up in doping controversies. Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca remained under investigation and 2006 Giro winner Ivan Basso was banned for two years on 15 June for his part in events uncovered by \"Operación Puerto\".\nDuring the Tour.\nDespite Petacchi's failed test result prior to the Tour prologue, the first stages were uneventful in terms of doping allegations. It was not until Stage 8 before the first doping allegations surfaced against one of the participants. German cyclist Patrik Sinkewitz failed tests for elevated levels of testosterone at a June 8, 2007 pre-Tour training camp. \nImmediately prior to Stage 12, reports began to surface that the then current race leader, Michael Rasmussen had been dropped by the Danish Cycling Union in the month prior to the Tour following claims he had missed three out-of-competition doping tests. Tour director Christian Prudhomme nevertheless allowed the rider to continue in the absence of a failed test result.\nDays later on 24 July, pre-race favourite Alexander Vinokourov was withdrawn from the Tour after . Vinokourov had returned a failed A test for an illegal blood transfusion from a compatible donor before the individual time trial on July 21, in which he placed first. In addition to Vinokourov, who was in 23rd place overall, the entire Astana Team was forced to withdraw, affecting highly placed riders such as 5th placed Andreas Klöden and 8th placed Andrey Kashechkin.\nThe following day, after finishing Stage 16, which had begun with a protest by riders, it emerged that Italian cyclist Cristian Moreni had failed tests for testosterone after Stage 11, in which he finished 102nd. He was immediately pulled out of the race by his team, Cofidis (who had participated in the day's protest). Team Cofidis then voluntarily retired the rest of their riders from the Tour.\nOn 25 July Michael Rasmussen won Stage 16; with a three-minute lead, he appeared all but certain to win the Tour the next day. However, hours after his victory, Rasmssen's team, Rabobank, abruptly pulled Rasmussen from the Tour and sacked him for a violation of the team's internal rules. The Danish rider had given incorrect information to Rabobank's sports director about his whereabouts which followed on from earlier reports that he had missed previous out-of-competition doping control tests.\nWith the sport reeling from the revelations, the Tour continued as allegations began to surface regarding new race leader Alberto Contador (see \"Alberto Contador\" below). While no further rider or team withdrawals occurred before the race's conclusion in Paris, it later emerged that two more riders Andrey Kashechkin and Iban Mayo had failed tests for doping during the Tour's later stages.\nReaction to events during the Tour.\nPrior to Rasmussen's exit, the doping revelations of Sinkewitz and Vinokourov had been met with defiance by the UCI, the Tour organizers and the majority of the European press (with certain exceptions) however, with Rasmussen's sacking whilst wearing the yellow jersey (no rider had previously been withdrawn from the race while leading), the mood became more pessimistic, with the exception of Tour director Christian Prudhomme who publicly regarded the Dane's withdrawal as \"the best thing that can happen to the Tour. The race will go on for the rest of the riders and we believe it would be an insult to them to stop the race. We believe the general classification is much better now than it was.\"\nPrudhomme's reaction was in contrast to the French newspapers. \"France Soir\" ran a mock death notice declaring the Tour had died \"at age 104, after a long illness.\" Declaring further: \"The Tour is clinically dead. It is a broken toy, a burst soap bubble popped by careless kids, unaware that they are damaging themselves, their health and their childhood dreams as well...It's all the more painful as we had almost begun to believe in the Tour again... in these soap-and-water cyclists who we were so ready to love. But instead of dreams, the last 48 hours have been a living nightmare.\"\nA similar editorial in \"Le Figaro\" announced: \"It really doesn't matter who wins the Tour. The 2007 edition died on 24 July on the heights of Loudenvielle...Killed by Alexander Vinokourov, idolised by the media and cycling fans, but revealed to have the blood of another running in his veins on the finishing line. Damn Vinokourov! He sullied the infinite beauty of the Pyrenees, dirtied cycling a little more and further discredited the Tour de France.\"\nAnother French newspaper, \"Libération\"'s editorial demanded \"The Tour must be stopped\", describing the procession of cyclists as a \"caravan of ridicule\".\nThe British popular media who had previously acclaimed the success of the Tour's prologue in London and the first stage through Kent, were similarly critical calling it the \"Tour de Farce\" (\"Daily Mirror\") and declaring it a \"Corrupt race populated by a cast of frauds heading straight into the gutter\" (\"The Times\"). Swiss newspaper \"Tages-Anzeiger\" reduced its coverage of the race in protest to minimal reporting of results and full reporting of any doping stories.\nGerman television broadcasters ARD and ZDF stopped covering the race (after they vowed to in the Tour prelude) when Patrik Sinkewitz was revealed to have failed tests following Stage 8; Sat 1 and Pro Sieben replaced them as the German rightsholders. Most other media decided to stay, and some even criticised the German decision.\nSponsors similarly indicated their unwillingness to continue to support a sport dogged by scandal, most noticeably Gerolsteiner and T-Mobile (the latter subsequently withdrew from sponsoring cycling later in the year). Team Rabobank's head of sponsorship Heleen Crielaard reacted to the Rasmussen dismissal stating: \"We are a bank and we want to be reliable. One thing we definitely do not appreciate is lying...\" although denied suggestions that they had influenced the decision to sack the rider.\nDespite calls for the Tour to be cancelled mid-race, the race continued principally on the basis that the race itself and its history is bigger than individual events.\nUCI director Pat McQuaid urged team directors and the riders to take responsibility: \"The teams need to have more control over their riders..\"They are the ones who need to clean out the riders who are iffy, they need to ensure they can guarantee that everyone of their riders is riding clean and riding fairly. The evidence is that most of the time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples. I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third.\"\nEddy Merckx who had won the Tour on five occasions, commented: \"my heart is no longer in it\" in response to his support for the Tour. Another Belgian rider Johan Museeuw (who had previously received a two-year ban for doping), suggested doping and drug use were a possible consequence of the difficulty of riding the Tour in its current format. Questioning why stages had to be so long and including several arduous 'out-of-category' mountain climbs.\nFollowing Vinokourov's exit, Patrice Clerc president of Tour organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) stated: \"I am not downcast and I am all the more determined to go all the way in this fight...It may seem paradoxical but we are closing in on victory. I have been saying we have started a merciless war against doping...We live in dark times and it is out of the question to give up, it is out of the question to leave the place to those who cheat.\"\nParticularly strong reaction came from Jean-François Lamour, vice president of the World Anti-Doping Agency who called for the Tour de France to be banned entirely and for road cycling to be withdrawn from the Olympic Games and former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Craig Reedie suggested that road cyclists might be required to hold an \"anti-doping passport\".\nFrench Prime Minister François Fillon attempted to stem the tide of negativity stating: \"Obviously this gives a disastrous image of the Tour de France, but at the same time, if we encourage the organisers, we can clean up French sports and in particular cycling\"; whilst Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, demonstrated support by joining the Tour and following the race leaders in the Tour director's car.\nPrior to Stage 16 a group of riders from eight teams – six from France plus German outfits Team Gerolsteiner and T-Mobile Team – forming the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible (or Movement for Credible Cycling), delayed the start of the Tour by thirteen minutes asking for all teams to abide by their good behaviour charter of 2005, under which teams are requested to avoid fielding riders implicated in doping affairs. The protest was in obvious contrast to the 1998 reaction which was at odds with authorities, protesting at the heavy-handed treatment of riders.\nTour riders generally remained encouraged however. Fabian Cancellara, Cedric Vasseur and David Millar all stated publicly that they believed the consensus among riders in the peloton was that anti-doping measures were effective and the sport would continue to benefit from the harder line.\nRiders who failed tests.\nPatrik Sinkewitz.\nDespite the rider's failed test result relating to a pre-Tour training camp, Sinkewitz competed in the race until Stage 8, when he collided with a spectator and withdrew from the event, at which point the test result emerged. Sinkewitz initially denied the allegation and called for his B sample to be tested. German television withdrew from covering the Tour in protest when his failed test came to light. On 31 July Sinkewitz subsequently retracted his denial and confessed to using a testosterone gel on his upper arms whilst training. Accepting the failed test result, Sinkewitz stated that: \"It was a big mistake and irresponsible toward my team, colleagues, the sponsor and the whole of cycling.\" T-Mobile responded to the admission by sacking Sinkewitz with immediate effect.\nAlexander Vinokourov.\nAlexander Vinokourov began the Tour as one of the favourites. Vinokourov's A test revealed two different types of red blood cells in his circulatory system indicating he had a blood transfusion prior to the stage. A blood transfusion is meant to increase the number of red blood cells in the body, improving oxygen flow from the lungs to the muscles. Vinokourov rejected the failed test, blaming the anomaly on excessive blood flow in his thighs following a heavy collision earlier in the Tour. Accordingly, he asked for his B sample to be tested; however, the lab test for locating blood cells from another donor in \"old fashioned\" homologous transfusions is considered fool-proof. It was later revealed that he had also failed tests on his win of stage 15, and that his B sample had since returned \"non-negative\". Astana responded by sacking Vinokourov.\nCristian Moreni.\nCofidis rider Moreni was placed 54th at the time he was withdrawn from the Tour and had participated in the rider protest prior to Stage 16. His failed test related to Stage 11 and Moreni decided not to ask for his B sample to be tested, admitting to doping according to Cofidis team manager Éric Boyer.\nIban Mayo.\nSpanish cyclist Iban Mayo was tested for doping on the second rest day, on July 24. The test failed for EPO after the Tour's conclusion. He was subsequently suspended by his team Saunier Duval–Prodir. Mayo had previously failed tests for a high testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio during the 2007 Giro d'Italia, but on that occasion UCI found that he had not breached any doping regulation. Mayo placed 16th overall in the 2007 Tour. It later emerged in October 2007 that Mayo's B-sample would be re-tested after results from a laboratory in Ghent returned inconclusive results.\nOther affected riders.\nMichael Rasmussen.\nDespite being tested negative for doping before the Tour and seventeen times during the Tour, Michael Rasmussen was pulled from the race for violating team rules. According to Rabobank, he had told the UCI and the team that he was training in Mexico from June 4 to June 26, 2007. Italian cycling journalist and former cyclist Davide Cassani told a Danish television channel that he had seen Rasmussen on June 13 and 14 in the Dolomites in Italy. When Rabobank team director Theo de Rooij confronted Rasmussen with this story, according to news reports he allegedly admitted the lie. Rasmussen denied admitting this, however and told a Dutch newspaper (\"Algemeen Dagblad\") \"My career is ruined\". According to Team Rabobank spokesman Jacob Bergsma, when sponsor Rabobank learned of Rasmussen's deceit, they insisted that he be sent home immediately.\nRasmussen had previously been given two warnings from UCI and two warnings from Anti Doping Denmark for missing out-of-competition doping controls. Three warnings from either organization would have landed him with a ban. The warnings had no immediate consequences, but cast a cloud of doubt about whether Rasmussen was doping.\nMichael Rasmussen's withdrawal came immediately after his dramatic victory in Stage 16, defending multiple attacks from Alberto Contador on a gruelling mountain pass. At the time he was holding the yellow jersey, leading the race by three minutes and ten seconds, and he appeared well on his way to winning the Tour.\nOver three months later on 8 November, Danish newspapers reported that Rasmussen had admitted misleading the UCI as to his whereabouts, an offence that carries a penalty of two years suspension.\nAlberto Contador.\nAlberto Contador was not allowed to start in the 2006 Tour de France due to his possible involvement with the Operación Puerto doping case in which he had been referred to by key persons who were the subject of investigation. He was subsequently cleared and allowed to start in 2007, going on to win the Tour. Contador signed a commitment in which he stated: \"I am not involved in the Puerto affair nor in any other doping case\". But according to documents obtained by the French newspaper \"Le Monde\", he was still involved in the Puerto affair and therefore should not have been allowed to start the 2007 Tour. Since Contador was the only rider able to stay with Rasmussen on two arduous stages in the Alps and Pyrenees, several journalists focused on his relationship with Eufemiano Fuentes and his role in Operación Puerto, without uncovering new evidence. Contador was tested five times during the Tour, and no discrepancies were reported.\nAfter the Tour, German doping expert Werner Franke, who had complete access to Puerto documents, accused him of having taken drugs in the past. On August 10, in response to increasing suspicion about links to the Operación Puerto blood-doping ring alleged by Franke, Alberto Contador publicly declared himself a clean rider: \"I have never doped and I have never participated in an act of doping\", said Contador, reading from a prepared statement. \"I won the Tour clean. I cannot understand the attacks against by people that don't even know me. My commitment is absolute and I will always be ready to collaborate in the fight against doping.\" Contador was joined by Discovery Channel team manager Johan Bruyneel, Spanish sports minister Jaime Lissavetzky and members of his family.\nContador failed tests for clenbuterol in the 2010 Tour de France and was subsequently suspended from cycling for two years.\nOther developments.\nIn addition to the sacking and resignations of a number of riders (see above) it was announced on 31 July that Team Astana had suspended team activities for one month, stating that: \"Following recent events, we have decided to stop our activities until the end of August...This period of time will be the opportunity for deep questioning.\" and two weeks after the Tour had finished it emerged that team-rider Andrej Kashechkin had also failed doping tests. The Astana team were later banned from entering the next Grand Tour of the season, the 2007 Vuelta a España (or \"Tour of Spain\") as a direct result of the failed doping tests of three of the team's riders.\nOn 3 August Team Rabobank's general director, Theo de Rooij announced his resignation from the team as a consequence of the events.\nBoth Michael Rasmussen and Alberto Contador were excluded from the Hamburg Cyclassics race later in the month after the Tour due to continuing allegations linking both riders to doping.\nAs well as the international media, professional riders and sponsors, a number of organisations involved with the Tour and professional cycling made statements about the future of the sport and the impact of doping. The Discovery Channel Team subsequently announced they would be disbanding at the end of the 2007 season citing the \"situation in the sport\" at the time as one of the factors in their failure to find new sponsors. Later in the year T-Mobile confirmed they would withdraw from sponsoring professional cycling in order to distance themselves from doping scandals which included Patrik Sinkewitz's failed test result in the 2007 Tour and previous admissions of doping by former T-Mobile team riders including Bjarne Riis.\nIn an interview broadcast in September 2007, president of the UCI Pat McQuaid referring to the Tour events, called for the then-current two-year ban for first-time doping offenders to be increased to a life ban in an effort to deter doping activity. The statement marked a shift in policy as the president had previously (during the Tour) expressed a belief that a two-year ban was sufficient.\nOn February 13, 2008, the ASO announced that the Astana team, despite completely changing its ownership, management, and rider roster since the 2007 scandals, would be barred from the 2008 Tour due to its involvement in the 2007 scandals and its links to Operación Puerto. The move meant that neither Contador, the 2007 winner, nor third-place Levi Leipheimer, both of whom signed with the revamped Astana setup, were able to compete in the 2008 tour."

        "title": "Reactions to the Duke lacrosse case",
        "text": "The 2006 Duke University lacrosse case resulted in a great deal of coverage in the local and national media as well as a widespread community response at Duke and in the Durham, North Carolina area.\nMedia coverage.\nInitial coverage (March–April 2006).\nThe case attracted widespread media attention almost from the moment it became public. The apparent circumstances—three white males (David Evans, Reade Seligmann, and Collin Finnerty) from privileged backgrounds at an elite university apparently taking advantage of a student and single mother (Crystal Gail Mangum) from a crosstown black college (NCCU), trying to make ends meet by working as a stripper and escort—seemed tailor-made for wall-to-wall coverage. However, once the case deteriorated, critics saw it as a stinging showcase of bias in the media and the university system.\nAmong those giving extensive coverage to the matter was Nancy Grace. Before Duke suspended its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, \"I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over a little thing like gang rape!\" and \"Why would you go to a cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?\" Another, Susan Estrich, said \"I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor.\" Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case with some of the most inflammatory claims and supported the withholding of evidence by Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, saying, \"Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism.\" Murphy said \"I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth.\"\nFeminist blogger Amanda Marcotte declared on her blog that people who defended the wrongly accused Duke students were \"rape-loving scum\". \"Time\" reported that in \"late January, more ethics charges were heaped on the District Attorney in the Duke University sexual-assault case, and Marcotte attacked the news with her usual swagger and sarcasm:\"\nMarcotte later deleted posts on her blog critical of her statements, then later deleted the entire entry.\n\"Reason\" contributing editor Cathy Young has described Marcotte as a \"leader of the cyber-lynch mob in the Duke University rape hoax\". In \"Marcotte's eyes, the real crime of the 'independent feminists' is helping preserve the idea that the presumption of innocence applies even in cases of rape and sexual assault.\"\nOther outlets that have been accused of taking an initial pro-prosecution slants included, but are not limited to:\nThe case continues (May–October 2006).\nGrace continued to feature developments in the case on her program, with a pro-prosecution slant. On June 9, 2006, after hearing reporting on various defense motions, which the CNN reporter indicated might already prove reasonable doubt, Grace sarcastically asked, \"Well I'm glad you have already decided the outcome of the case, based on all of the defense filings. Why don't we just all move to Nazi Germany, where we don't have a justice system and a jury of one's peers?\" On June 22, 2006, she featured \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Lester Munson who opined, \"I think the state has probably a better case than most observers are describing. I have studied this at some length ... There is some voracity to the victim's account.\"\nOn August 6, 2006, \"The News &amp; Observer\" of Raleigh, North Carolina, wrote that District Attorney Mike Nifong \"promised DNA evidence that has not materialized. He suggested that police conduct lineups in a way that conflicted with department policy.\" The article went on to say that \"he made a series of factual assertions that contradicted his own files: He suggested the players used condoms; he accused the players of erecting a wall of silence to thwart investigators; and he said the woman had been hit, kicked and strangled. The medical and police records show that the victim had said no condom was used, that police had interviewed three players at length and taken their DNA samples and that the accuser showed no significant bruises or injuries.\"\nOn August 25, 2006, amid growing doubts as to the strength of the case and the veracity of Mangum, \"The New York Times\" published a front page article by Duff Wilson and Jonathan Glater stating that the weaknesses in the case highlighted by the defense were not indicative of the strength of the case as a whole. \"In several important areas, the full files, reviewed by \"The New York Times\", contain evidence stronger than that highlighted by the defense.\" The \"Times\" story further indicated that \"there is also a body of evidence to support decision to take the matter to a jury.\" This article would be widely criticized as the actual lack of strength of Nifong's case became apparent. In spite of widespread criticism, the newspaper's public editor defended Wilson, and he was permitted to remain on the case through Nifong's disbarment trial.\nThe case deteriorates (November 2006-May 2007).\nAfter many inflammatory comments about the defendants, Nancy Grace's show covered the dismissal of charges on the day of the announcement, but with a substitute host. Undaunted by the lack of DNA evidence, CNN's Paula Zahn insisted that \"the DA would not be proceeding with this case if he didn't believe that this alleged victim had been raped.\" She also demanded explanations \"How, then, sir , do you explain the woman's injuries ... particularly some of the internal injuries?\"\nPerhaps the most grudging admission of exoneration came from \"The Boston Globe\", which stated in a lead editorial: \"Three members of the Duke lacrosse team may have been louts, but all the evidence suggests they were not rapists . . . the students have the resources to get on with their lives.\"\nSimilarly grudging was sportswriter John Feinstein, who stated on the syndicated sports talk show The Jim Rome Show in May 2007 \"I think they're guilty of everything but rape\" and \"I really don’t want to hear that they’re victims and martyrs, and that their lives have been ruined.\" Feinstein, who in March 2006 had demanded the revocation of the scholarships of every Duke men's lacrosse team member, and who (against the findings of the Coleman report) continued to describe the team as \"out-of-control\", added \"I don't think I've been proven wrong.\"\nNancy Grace, who had been particularly vocal in her support for Nifong's prosecution, took the night off for the show following the attorney general's dismissal of all charges, with Jane Velez-Mitchell guest hosting instead.\nWhile the march of the 2007 Duke men's team to the NCAA final game generally received extensive and favorable coverage, a number of sportswriters published negative stories about the team. \"Washington Post\" columnist Mike Wise wrote \"[I]t's hard to embrace everyone as a victim. With all due respect to those 'INNOCENT' bracelets worn around Durham this year, this isn't \"To Kill a Mockingbird II.\" \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Philip Hersh commented, \"The idea that the Duke lacrosse team's success is a feel-good story makes me ill. . . it would be a bigger mistake to believe (the dropping of charges) means Duke's lacrosse team was innocent of assault against common decency.\"\nAfter proclamations by the North Carolina Attorney General, Roy Cooper, that the three students were \"innocent\" in April, \"USA Today\" columnist and incoming Bennett College President, Dr. Julianne Malveaux, commented in an interview on National Public Radio a few days later that they were \"hooligans,\" had lied, and that they \"did not deserve an apology.\"\nThe \"Duke Chronicle\" noted the closing of the case, and stated. \"There are other members of the Duke community, however, from whom we have not heard [...] These are the voices of the range of individuals, from students to professors to community members, who responded to last year's allegations not with moderation [...] but with extreme, inflammatory and unfounded statements.\"\nResponse.\nDuke faculty groups.\nSoon after the allegations were made, 88 Duke professors (referred to sometimes as the \"Group of 88\", sometimes referred to as the \"Gang of 88\") from the Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences placed an ad in \"The Chronicle\" referring to the circumstances surrounding the allegations as a \"social disaster\" and quoting primarily anonymous individuals citing racism and sexism in the Duke community. The advertisement concluded, \"We're turning up the volume [...] To the students speaking individually and to the protestors making collective noise, thank you for not waiting and for making yourselves heard,\" and \"These are the students shouting and whispering about what happened to this young woman.\" Notable signatories included Houston Baker, Miriam Cooke, Anne Allison, Cathy Davidson, Ariel Dorfman, Michael Hardt, Alice Kaplan, Claudia Koonz, Pedro Lasch, Walter Mignolo, Mark Anthony Neal and Alex Rosenberg. The ad was spearheaded by faculty member Wahneema Lubiano.\nIn three departments, more than half of faculty signed the statement. The department with the highest proportion of signatories was African and African-American Studies, with 80%. Just over 72% of the Women's Studies faculty signed the statement, Cultural Anthropology 60%, Romance studies 44.8%, Literature 41.7%, English 32.2%, Art &amp; Art History 30.7%, and History 25%. No faculty members from the Pratt School of Engineering or full-time law professors signed the document. Departments that had no faculty members sign the document include Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Genetics, Germanic Languages/Literature, Psychology and Neuroscience, Religion, and Slavic and Eurasian Studies.\nIn January 2007, many months after the initial print of the ad, a new letter was posted at the Concerned Duke Faculty website signed by 87 faculty members stating that the original ad was misinterpreted. The letter states that the intent of the original ad was to address issues of racism and sexism in the community and not to prejudge the case.\nIn January 2007, lacrosse team member Kyle Dowd filed a lawsuit against Duke University and visiting associate professor and signatory to the original ad, Kim Curtis, claiming that he and another teammate were given failing grades on their final paper as a form of retaliation after the scandal broke. The case has been settled with the terms undisclosed except that Dowd's grade was altered to a P.\nDowd's mother emailed another original signatory, Houston Baker, who continued after the charges had been dropped to accuse her son and the others of being \"hooligans, rapists,\" and called her \"the mother of a farm animal.\"\nAnother signatory, Thavolia Glymph, said she was disappointed because \"since the DNA results were returned Monday, we moving backwards.\" The DNA results indicated that there was neither any sexual nor physical connection between the stripper and the players she accused.\nSeventeen faculty members of the economics department sent a letter showing support for the players on January 6, 2007, saying, \"We regret that the Duke faculty is now seen as prejudiced against certain of its own students,\" and telling the players that they are more than welcome to enroll in their courses.\nStudent groups and independent organizations.\nMany students showed their support for the lacrosse team during the investigation in a variety of ways. The Duke women's lacrosse team chose to wear \"Innocent\" sweatbands with the accused players' numbers during their games in the 2006 NCAA Final Four. \"We want to win a national championship for ourselves but definitely also for the university and the men's team,\" one team member explained. \"They don't really have a chance to play their season, which is a shame.\" The women came under fire from many in the media. Kevin Sweeney of \"Salon\" argued that their actions will make it more difficult for rape victims to speak out in the future, while \"New York Times\" sports columnist Harvey Araton stated that their \"cross-team friendship\" made them lose common sense.\nAnother group of students, Duke Students for an Ethical Durham, sought to encourage students to vote in the upcoming election as Durham residents. It was specifically created in response to Nifong's mishandling of the case. Nifong ended up winning the election.\nThe Association for Truth and Fairness (ATAF) seeks to raise money to defray some of the indicted players' legal fees. ATAF, a non-profit organization, will continue to \"help victims of abuses of power and other prosecutorial injustices.\"\nWristbands saying \"Duke Lacrosse 2006 INNOCENT! #6 #13 #45\" were also sold to raise money for the cause.\nAn outpouring of support came at the beginning of the 2007 lacrosse season. For the season opener, 6,485 fans attended the game to cheer the Blue Devils on their way to a 17–11 victory over Dartmouth.\nNorth Carolina Central University forum.\nThe day after DNA results came back negative, Nifong and other city officials such as Durham Mayor Bill Bell spoke at a community forum on April 12, 2006, on violence against women at N.C. Central, where the accuser was a student. The crowd, predominantly African American, criticized the media for portraying the accuser as a stripper and escort instead of a mother and student. One questioner said that Duke University hospital must have tampered with the DNA sample for it to come back negative, while another suggested that the accuser ought to have been helicoptered to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center for treatment since Duke had a conflict of interest. One NCCU student, Chan Hall, as quoted by \"Newsweek\", stated, \"It's the same old story. Duke up, Central down.\" He continued that he wanted to see the Duke students prosecuted \"whether it happened or not. It would be justice for things that happened in the past.\" NCCU Chancellor James H. Ammons Jr. said that \"[t]his incident has forced us to examine issues relevant to any campus environment -- sexism, racism and the need to educate our students about sexual assault and violence against women.\" At the same time, he urged the crowd to be patient and let the legal process take its course.\nNAACP and civil rights activists.\nThe NAACP urged for a thorough investigation of the facts and a trial with a jury before the public formed an opinion on the case. North Carolina NAACP Legal Redress Chair, Al McSurely, explained that \"The NAACP stands for fair play for all parties, zealous investigation and deep concern for the survivors of racist/sexist attacks.\" At the same time, some have criticized the NAACP for making statements that portrayed the players as racist despite evidence to the contrary, using the case to promote the group's cause, and implying guilt. McSurely stated that \"[w]ithin five minutes, the men threatened the women with racial and misogynist verbal assaults,\" despite evidence to the contrary. He continued that the lacrosse players \"were caught with their macho entitlement views hanging out and, to save themselves, they have together to blame the survivor of their verbal assaults.\"\nAfter Nifong dropped the rape charges against the three players in December 2006, the NAACP's \"case monitor\" and NCCU law professor Irving Joyner stated that the drop of rape charges could help Nifong's case: \"Now, they don’t have to establish that there was penetration committed against the accuser . . . In addition to that, now they don’t have to deal with the DNA or the lack of DNA evidence. And with the rape shield statute, it’s unlikely that information will even come before the jury to consider.\"\nOn the official state NAACP's website, an 82 point 'Crimes and Torts committed by Duke Lacrosse Team Players' memo was listed long after the charges were dropped and the players were declared innocent. Included in the memorandum was an assessment of the defendants' strategy to have the charges dropped: \"The three defendants they have two mountains to climb. First, they must deflect public attention from their boorish, racist, and illegal behavior by mounting outlandish attacks on the survivor and the D.A. Second, they must deal with a mountain of physical evidence, that is corroborated by, we have reason to believe, accounts of some of the men who were at the party who have cooperated with the police and the D.A. from early on.\" North Carolina Attorney General Roy A. Cooper refuted these facts in the summary of findings report. It stated that \"no evidence ... corroborate[d] the accusing witness's versions of the events ... No DNA evidence confirmed her stories ... No medical evidence confirmed her stories ... No other witness confirmed her stories ... The accusing witness’s accounts of the story changed significantly.\"\nIn April 2006, civil rights activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's \"The O'Reilly Factor\" to discuss the case. Sharpton began the interview by commending the \"blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community to stand up for this girl.\" In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, \"First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?\" When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, \"I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict.\" Sharpton continued that the case parallels \"Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom.\" At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. \"I don't know yet and I think that the proper thing to do is to support those that want justice.\" \nOn April 15, 2006, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said that his non-profit Rainbow/Push Coalition organization would pay for the college tuition of the accuser, Mangum, whether she fabricated the story or not. Jackson said that she should never \"have to stoop that low to survive.\" He continued that the \"...fantasy's as old as slave masters impregnating young slave girls [...] The character of this thing is chilling [and] [s]omething happened that everybody's ashamed of...\" Defense attorney Joe Cheshire found Jackson's comment about \"slave masters\" odd because the players did not ask for black strippers. \"There is no slave-master mentality here, and that's just another perfect example of [...] self-absorbed race pandering,\" Cheshire stated.\nAfter all charges were dropped on April 13, 2007, the North Carolina NAACP praised the state attorney general's investigation into Mangum's claims that had found them to be without merit.\nBloggers.\nThe case received extensive coverage on blogs. One blog which supported the three students was \"Durham-in-Wonderland\" authored by Brooklyn College history professor KC Johnson. Johnson also co-authored a book on the case with journalist Stuart Taylor, entitled \"Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case.\" The players' lawyers stated that they used the blog as a resource throughout the case, and Seligmann made a point of thanking Johnson in his statement following the dismissal of charges.\n\"Wanted poster\" distribution.\nA poster that \"looked like a wanted poster\" was distributed on campus and in nearby neighborhoods shortly after the allegations surfaced in March 2006 showing pictures and names of 40 members of the lacrosse team, urging them to \"come forward\" with information on the alleged rape.\nDuke administration and University president.\nDuring the initial investigation of the players by Durham police, Dean Sue Wasiolek advised the players to cooperate with police and tell the truth, not tell anybody about the charges, nor hire attorneys because she thought nothing would come of it. Wasiolek is one of the defendants named in the Ekstrand lawsuit. Chris Kennedy, senior associate athletic director, told the captains to contact their parents immediately and to hire attorneys shortly after (on March 17).\nMoneta and Brodhead placed Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty on interim suspension for the Spring 2006 semester following their indictment, while David Evans graduated the day before he was indicted. In the fall of 2006, their status was modified to \"administrative leave\" to allow them to make academic progress while not at the university.\nRichard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University, was quoted by WRAL-TV as saying to the Durham Chamber of Commerce on April 20, 2006, \"If our students did what is alleged, it is appalling to the worst degree. If they didn’t do it, whatever they did is bad enough.\" At the same time, Brodhead repeatedly stated that \"our students must be presumed innocent until proven otherwise,\" with his earliest citation on March 25, 2006.\nOn December 20, 2006, Brodhead stated that \"the DA's case will be on trial just as much as our students will be.\" Two days later, Nifong dropped the most serious rape charges against the players. Brodhead released a statement calling for Nifong to recuse himself and questioned his actions: \"Given the certainty with which the district attorney made his many public statements regarding the rape allegation, his decision today to drop that charge must call into question the validity of the remaining charges. The district attorney should now put this case in the hands of an independent party who can restore confidence in the fairness of the process. Further, Mr. Nifong has an obligation to explain to all of us his conduct in this matter.\"\nOn January 3, 2007, Brodhead invited Seligmann and Finnerty back to Duke as students in good standing even though they still faced charges. They were also welcomed to participate on the lacrosse team. Brodhead explained, \"We have decided that the right and fair thing to do is to welcome back Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty to resume their studies at Duke for the spring semester. Although the students still face serious charges and larger issues require Duke’s collective attention, the circumstances in this case have changed substantially, and it is appropriate that the students have an opportunity to continue their education.\" Both declined. Instead, Seligmann decided to enroll at Brown University, while Finnerty chose to attend Loyola College in Maryland.\nBrodhead, in an interview with Lesley Stahl of \"60 Minutes\", stated that \"Duke has a rule and many, many, many other universities observe the same rule, which is that when a student is indicted for a crime that has an element of violence, we often separate the student from the university because you don't know at that time what harm [...] might be done either in the community or to the student. It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try to understand the nature of the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to get on with their life. Once the facts took the turn they did in December, then we had to rebalance those things. Then at that point it just seemed to us that simple fairness meant that we had to allow the students to come back.\"\nIn regards to the team's season, Duke athletic director Joe Alleva decided to forfeit two games due to admitted behaviors such as \"underage drinking and hiring private party dancers\". According to Brodhead, the team's players then \"wished to suspend competitive play until the DNA results come back.\" Brodhead then decided to suspend the remainder of the season until \"there [was] a clearer resolution of the legal situation.\"\nIn an open letter to the public, Brodhead outlined his formation of committees to examine the lacrosse team, the administration's response to the incident, the student judicial process, campus culture, and a presidential council. The committees have been criticized by some observers, including KC Johnson, former student president Elliott Wolf (offered a seat in the Campus Culture Initiative), and the \"Chronicle\", since it was chaired by several Group of 88 members such as Anne Allison, Karla FC Halloway, and lacrosse critics Prasad Kasibhatla and Peter Wood. Among the conclusions of the group-chaired committees was shared governance of athletics by faculty members, and required classes for students by group members. Also, the student senate representative was Chauncey Nartey, a student who Sue Pressler had previously reported to the police because he had made death threats to Mike Pressler's family.\nAfter Nifong's resignation and disbarment, Brodhead released a statement: \"One fact stares us in the face: The ordeal of the last 15 months was wholly unnecessary. It was not the result of reasonable differences of legal opinion or honest errors of judgment. Our students were accused by the community's senior law enforcement officer with no credible basis in fact [...] The actions Duke took caused consternation to many in the University family, which I profoundly regret. As Duke University's president, I resolve to do my part to repair the harm unleashed by Mr. Nifong's actions and to move forward from this painful episode.\"\nLater, Brodhead apologized to the lacrosse players and their families for the university's \"failure to reach out\" in a \"time of extraordinary peril.\" Brodhead's actions generated criticism from opinion pieces in the media. For example, \"Newsweek\" published an article on September 10, 2007, that argued that \"Brodhead and Nifong [the DA in the case] had an almost willful disregard for the facts.\" An article in \"The Economist\" on September 15, 2007, stated that Brodhead did \"little, if anything, to defend the lacrosse players or to criticise the faculty [at Duke] for its lynching mob mentality.\" Stuart Taylor Jr. and KC Johnson argue President Brodhead and other administrators \"portray[ed] them [the students] with grotesque exaggeration as a bunch of uncooperative, rowdy, drunken white racists who might well be rapists, too. Nifong, hoping to divert attention from the powerful proof of innocence in the soon-to-be-public DNA tests (that exculpated the students), could hardly have hoped for a more obliging helper than Richard Brodhead.\"\nOther Duke faculty.\nDuke English Professor Houston Baker (now former professor as he was hired as a Distinguished University Professor at Vanderbilt University in May 2006) wrote a scathing letter on March 29, 2006, regarding the lacrosse team and the administration's response to the incident, asking, \"[w]hat have Duke and its leadership done to address this horrific, racist incident alleged to have occurred\" and asserting \"we have been deeply embarrassed by the silence that seems to surround this white, male athletic team's racist assaults (by words, certainly - deeds, possibly) in our community.\"\nBaker also wrote that the players were \"safe under the cover of silent whiteness\" and these \"[y]oung, white, violent, drunken men among us - [are] implicitly boasted [sic] by our athletic directors and administrators.\" He said Duke has joined other colleges and universities in the \"blind-eying of male athletes, veritably given license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech, and feel proud of themselves in the bargain.\" He also explicitly stated that the lacrosse players displayed \"abhorrent sexual assault, verbal racial violence, and drunken white male privilege loosed amongst us.\"\nDuke University Provost Peter Lange responded, \"I cannot tell you how disappointed, saddened and appalled I was to receive this letter from you. A form of prejudice - one felt so often by minorities whether they be African American, Jewish or other - is the act of prejudgment: to presume that one knows something 'must' have been done by or done to someone because of his or her race, religion or other characteristic.\" He continued, \"We do not know much about the worst of what may have happened in the incident that has inflamed our community,\" and concluded, \"Sadly, letters like yours do little to advance our common cause.\"\nBrodhead appointed Duke Law Professor, James Earl Coleman, Jr., to head the committee to examine the lacrosse team's culture. Dr. Coleman found that the team has exhibited \"exemplary academic and athletic performance\" and is \"[n]either racist or sexist. On the contrary, the coach of the Duke Women's Lacrosse team has expressed her sense of camaraderie that exists between the men's and women's team; members of the men's team, for example, consistently come to the women's games. The current as well as former black members of the team have been extremely positive about the support the team provided them.\" Also in the report, while it was stated that the rates of alcohol abuse for the lacrosse team were higher than most other Duke athletic teams, \"their conduct has not been different in character than the conduct of the typical Duke student who abuses alcohol.\"\nSince then, Coleman has been one of the most vocal critics of Nifong's handling of the case. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\", Coleman argued that he pandered to the black community in the middle of the election campaign: \"I think that he pandered to the community by saying 'I'm gonna go out there and defend your interests in seeing that these hooligans who committed the crime are prosecuted. I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, buy, you know, big-time lawyers and get them off. I'm doing this for you.'\" Furthermore, Coleman stated that Nifong has committed serious prosecutorial misconduct, and if there was a conviction, there \"would be a basis to have the conviction overturned based on his conduct.\"\nProfessor Steven Baldwin of the chemistry department was another of the few faculty members to make public statements about the case. In two letters to the Duke Chronicle (\"What About Mike Pressler?\" in April 2006 and \"The Administration's Mismanagement of Lacrosse\" in October 2006), Dr. Baldwin strongly criticized the administration's handling of the case, especially with respect to Coach Mike Pressler."

He was listed as tall and .\nDoyle was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the ninth of ten children; his family moved to Huron, Ohio, about west of Cleveland, when Doyle was a child. He graduated from Huron High School in 1958. His professional baseball career began in 1959 in the Detroit Tigers' farm system. It would take him ten years and five MLB organizations before he reached the majors.\nAs a 29-year-old rookie, Doyle was an effective member of the 1969 Braves' bullpen, working in 36 games and 39 innings pitched, winning each of his two decisions, posting four saves, compiling a strong 2.08 earned run average, and helping his team win the National League West Division championship. Doyle appeared in Game 2 of the 1969 NLCS against the New York Mets; in one inning, he allowed two unearned runs on two hits. The Mets took the contest, 11–6, and proceeded to sweep the best-of-three series en route to their first world championship.\nThe Braves sold Doyle's contract to the Angels that November, and he worked in 49 games in 1970, his only full campaign in MLB. However, after posting a 3–1 record, a 5.14 earned run average, and five saves through August 16, he was sold again, this time to the Padres. Pitching for last-place San Diego over the final weeks of the 1970 season, Doyle earned two saves but dropped both of his decisions. He then returned to the Angels' organization to spend 1971 at Triple-A Salt Lake City. Suffering from a sore arm, he was able to make only two appearances for the 1972 Angels before retiring from the game.\nIn his 87-game MLB career, Doyle allowed 85 hits and 46 bases on balls in 90 innings pitched, with 65 strikeouts. In addition to his 5–3 career won–lost record, he was credited with 11 saves.\nDoyle died on May 6, 2020."

He played college football at Princeton University from 1882 to 1884 and was known as one of the greatest kickers in 19th century football. After his playing career ended, he remained active in the development of the game as a coach and founding member of football's rules committee. He was reported to have held a place in Princeton athletic history similar to that held by Walter Camp at Yale. Moffat was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nEarly years.\nMoffat was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1862. He was the son of James C. Moffat, who was a professor at Princeton University for 40 years.\nFootball player.\nMoffat enrolled at Princeton and was a member of the Princeton Tigers football and baseball teams in the early 1880s. In baseball, he was Princeton's star pitcher for four years.\nIn football, he played at the halfback position and developed a reputation as \"probably the greatest kicker ever seen on a football field.\" Football historian David M. Nelson credits Moffat with revolutionizing the kicking game in 1883 by developing the \"spiral punt,\" described by Nelson as \"a dramatic change from the traditional end-over-end kicks.\" Moffat has also been credited with inventing the drop kick, and kicked equally well with either foot.\nMoffat was a member of the Princeton football team from 1882 to 1884. As the team's senior captain in 1883, Moffat kicked 32 field goals in 15 games. In Princeton's 26 to 7 victory over Harvard in 1883, Moffat made five field goals, two drop kicks with his right foot, two drop kicks with his left foot, and one from placement.\nFootball official and coach.\nBy profession, Moffat was a civil engineer. However, he remained an active and influential coach and official in the sport of football. Moffat was a member of football's Rules Committee for most of his adult life and, in that capacity, helped shape the game during its formative years. In October 1883, while still a student at Princeton, he was one of two Princeton representatives on an informal, seven-member rules committee that adopted the game's first modern scoring system—2 points for a touchdown, 4 points for a goal after touchdown, and 5 points for a field goal.\nIn December 1893, with the game in turmoil as the result of deaths and serious injuries resulting from the game, a formalized Rules Committee was established consisting of Walter Camp of Yale, W. A. Brooks of Harvard, and Moffat as Princeton's representative. \"The New York Times\" urged the three men to \"abolish mass plays and other brutal manoeuvres.\" Moffat remained on the Rules Committee until his death in 1914.\nFor many years, Moffat also served as an \"advisory coach\" to the Princeton football team. Contemporaneous records show that Moffat was active in coaching the team. For example, the undefeated 1896 team is listed as having \"no coach\", but a report published that fall in \"The Harvard Crimson\" noted that \"Alexander Moffat '84 has charge of the team and is being assisted by Lea '96 and Morse '95.\" According to an obituary, Moffat for many years after his graduation \"acted as coach, umpire and referee and made practice of going to Princeton nearly every season to aid in the training of the football team.\" Big Bill Edwards, who played at Princeton from 1896 to 1899, later wrote of Moffat: \"His interest in the game was great, and he was always ready to give as much time as was needed to the coaching of the Princeton teams. His hard, efficient work developed remarkable kickers. He loved the game and was a cheerful, encouraging and sympathetic coach.\"\nMoffat died from pneumonia at Presbyterian Hospital in New York City in 1914 at age 51.\nIn 1971, Moffat was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame."

        "title": "History of the Pakistani cricket team",
        "text": " \nThe Pakistan cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1952 and has since become one of the most successful teams in modern cricket. The team reached the semi-finals of the 1979,1983, 1987 and 2011 World Cups, and finals in 1992 and 1999, and won the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup by defeating England in the final with the captaincy of Imran Khan They are one of the most successful T20 sides but faced a big failure in T20 2016 having won the T20 World Cup in 2009 and been runner-up in 2007. And after that they have defeated India by big margin of 180 in the Final of Champions Trophy 2017 at The Oval. Pakistan has also been ranked as the Number 1 Test Team twice (summers of 1988 &amp; 2016) and Number 1 across all formats (Test, ODI and T20) at various points.\nPast history.\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, and the establishment of the separate nation state of Pakistan, cricket in the country developed steadily and Pakistan was given Test match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India, which, being the successor state of the British Raj, did not have to go through such a process.\nPakistan's first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in Dacca in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test history).\nThe team is considered strong but unpredictable. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has had players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. Over the years, competitions between India and Pakistan have always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams from both sides of the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistan's matches against India in the Cricket World Cup have seen packed stadiums and heightened atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held.\n1986 Australasia Cup.\n1986 Australasia Cup, played in Sharjah, is remembered as a famous last-ball victory for Pakistan against arch-rivals India, with Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero.\nIndia batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. Javed Miandad came in to bat at number 3, and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, Miandad stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma, which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.\n1992 World Cup Semi Final.\nAfter winning the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.\n1992 World Cup Victory.\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia &amp; New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar, and being led by an injured captain Imran Khan. Pakistan won only 1 of their first 5 matches including a 1 no-result and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 against England, until the match was declared as a \"no result\" due to rain. Captain Imran Khan famously told the team to play as \"cornered tigers\", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most famously, the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England.\n2007 World Cup Shock.\nPakistan participated in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup History when they were knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to Ireland, who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, were put into bat by Ireland on a green pitch. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen crossed double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the resurgent Irish for 132. The Irish went on to win the match, helped by a knock of 72 from Niall O'Brien. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup.\nTragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican police spokesman, Karl Angell, reported on 23 March 2007 that, \"Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation\", and that, \"Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.\"\nSubsequent to his team's defeat and the death of Bob Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain.\nOn 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder. Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, \"It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses.\" \"I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad.\" A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death.\" After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.\nOn 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson, previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of the Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the role. In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB.\nPlayer disputes and rebellions.\nThe Pakistan team has been marred by player disputes and rebellions within the team on various instances. The first such reported instance was in 1981, when ten players including Imran Khan, Asif Iqbal and Majid Khan refused to play under the captaincy of Javed Miandad. \n&lt;br&gt;\nOnce again, in 1992 Miandad was the target of another revolt this time led by Wasim Akram with the support of now retired Imran Khan. This led to Miandad being replaced with Akram.\nLater in 1993, when Wasim Akram was appointed captain of the national team, players including Waqar Younis and Javed Miandad revolted against him and Akram was removed as captain. Akram did regain captaincy again in 1996 and then again in 1998–99.\nIn 2009, many senior players revolted against captain Younis Khan when the team was playing in the UAE against New Zealand. Press reports say that a group of eight players led by Shoaib Malik went to the house of former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, where they swore on the Quran to never play under Younis again. Sensing the direction of the wind, Younis left the team for \"rest\" and the captaincy was awarded to Mohammad Yousuf.&lt;br&gt;\nOn the subsequent Australian tour, differences between Yousaf and the other players came to the forefront, causing Yousaf to give the captaincy of the fifth ODI to Shahid Afridi. Shoaib Malik, captain the team in the T20 (after Afridi was suspended due to ball tampering), started a tirade against Yousaf.&lt;br&gt;\nThe above-mentioned revolt lead to an operation cleanup within the Pakistan team, when selectors were asked not to consider Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousaf for any future series.\nTournament history.\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within Pakistan\"\nICC Champions Trophy.\n\"Known as the \"ICC Knockout\" in 1998 and 2000\"\nHonours.\nCricket World Cup (1): 1992\nICC World Twenty20 (1): 2009\nICC Champions Trophy (1): 2017\nAsia Cup (2): 2000 2012\nReferences.\nCategories of Pakistani cricket"

        "title": "Santa Anita Golf Course",
        "text": "The Santa Anita Golf Course, located in the city of Arcadia, California, was operated by Santa Anita Associates for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation from 1986-2016. This golf course was historically considered to be a part of Arcadia County Park. However, new operators will take over beginning September 2016.\nHistory.\nThe upon which the golf course was built has always been devoted to recreation in some form or another. The original architect was James Harrison Smith. Originally part of the \"Lucky\" Baldwin Ranch, Santa Anita's history dates back to the days when its broad oaks sheltered places where Indians camped. Across its broad acres traveled Mission Fathers from San Gabriel on their way up Little Santa Anita Canyon for lumber needed to build the Mission.\nFrom 1907 through 1909 horse racing was a feature on Lucky Baldwin's famed track. The clubhouse turn was right where No. 16 is now and when you're on the hill on the backside of No. 14, that's the turn where the horses turned for home.\nWorld War I Years.\nDuring World War I, Ross Field, Named after Lt. Cleo J. Ross of the U.S. Army Air Service, housed a United States Army balloon school. Ross was an observer with the 8th Balloon Company and was killed in action in France on September 26, 1918, the only U.S. Army balloonist to die in combat. The balloon school closed in the spring on 1919.\nAnita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club.\nDepression Era.\nIn 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex. The recreational area in which these amenities were built is now part of Arcadia County Park.\nThe Course Opens.\nThe Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938.\n1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open—held each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of \"The Open\" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70.\nThe Course Changes.\nIn the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia County Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes.\nAs part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened.\nDuring the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play.\nCurrent Course hole by hole.\n1st Hole 371 yard Par 4. Named \"Thomas\" for noted golf architect George C. Thomas Jr. Thomas designed the Los Angeles Country Club North Course, Riviera and Bel Air Country Club. The original design was a 425 yard dogleg left par 4. The fairway for the opening hole was re-routed in 1989 when the driving range and first fairway were swapped. The original green remains in use but is now approached from the north.\n2nd Hole 364 yard Par 4. Named \"Dune\" for the large bunker that fronts the green. The original design featured two fairway bunkers, a large one on the right and a small pot bunker on the left. The fairway bunkers were removed as the tree line matured in the 1960s. The green is elevated and crowned which makes for challenging approaches. Two sets of tees exist, the most often used sits to the north, the second tee box is located behind a stand of trees near Campus Drive.\n3rd Hole 554 yard Par 5. Named \"Power\" for the strength required to reach the green when the original design measured 580 yards. The spacious fairway provides lots of room for tee and second shots. A bunker complex on the right side of the landing area was lost in the 1960s and a single bunker was added in the early 2000s. The landing area for second shots is undulating and features a central bunker that forces a decision on the angle of approach to the green. The green features a large bunker front and two behind. An approach from the right opens up the green.\n4th Hole 130 yard Par 3. Named \"Maiden\" after the 6th Hole at Royal St. Georges in Sandwich England. The \"Maiden\" Par 3 template features a green with two tiers or humps in the back of the green with a valley between. The 4th green is bracketed by two bunkers and slopes heavily towards a false front. Long shots will find a down slope and a difficult chip back to the green. The devilish back left pin position makes for one of the most difficult shots on the course.\n5th Hole 375 yard Par 4. Named \"Railroad\" for the tracks that once ran along the left side of the fairway. As designed the tee shot played over a small creek which was turned into a cemented wash in 1956 which now bisects the teeing ground and runs along the left. A ridge runs diagonally across the fairway in the landing zone and will hold back a short drive forcing a long shot to an elevated and well protected green. As designed the area to the left of the green featured a bunker that was replaced with a grassy swale that allowed a secure bailout option. A bunker was restored to this area in the late 1990s. The kidney shaped green with a false front is protected by a large bunker to the right. The angle, slope and elevation of the green provides a difficult challenge with a premium on proper club selection.\n6th Hole 411 yard par 4. Named \"Hogback\" for the football shaped elevated green. The fairway is open but influenced by a large tree on the right. The second shot may be the most difficult on the course. The green is 38 yards deep and protected by a false front, a large bunker on the left and a massive 20 foot drop off to the right. The swale to the right of the green was subtle as designed, but with time and traffic it has eroded and now will challenge the unfortunate golfer with an extraordinarily difficult recovery shot from a dirt lie. Par is a very good score on this very difficult hole.\n7th Hole 379 yard Par 4. Named \"Narrows\" for the wide fairway that narrows as it approaches the hole. The dog leg rewards a carry over a large bunker on the left. A bale out on the right will punish with uneven lies and a much lengthened second shot. The narrow and deep green is protected with a bunker left and out of bounds right. Club selection is critical as the green slope will heavily influence shots that land on the right side of the green.\n8th Hole 193 yard Par 3. Named \"Dam\" for the view of Monrovia's Sawpit Dam that was once visible from the teeing ground (now obscured by trees). The hole was inspired by Pine Valley's famous 3rd hole. The original design featured a bunker left and right, but the right bunker was removed in the 1950s. Time has increased the forward slope of the green and the large false front creates an optical illusion and complicates club selection. Summer time shots freely bounce on the green, but winter shots with softer ground will not carry.\n9th Hole 481 yard Par 5. Named \"Master\". Once one of the most challenging holes on the course, it has drifted furthest from the original design. The original layout was a 445 yard Par 4 featuring a teeing ground now located in right field of the neighboring baseball field. The tee ball was played down a chute of trees into a dog leg left. The dog leg was protected by numerous bunkers left and shots played out to the right were funneled into a swale with difficult side and uphill lies. The green was protected by a swale in the front and no bunkers. The deep green sloped towards the back and with rear pin positions could play as long as 460 yards. The green was rebuilt due to drainage issues in the 1940s and bunkers were added to the right. The hole was completely reworked in 1972 when the baseball field was built and the maintenance yard relocated. The hole now plays straight and has been increased to a Par 5. The fairway still presents a challenge with slopes and swales but much of the challenged of the original design has been lost.\n10th Hole 353 yard Par 4. Named the \"Camel's Hump\" due to the large mound that protects the center of the green. As constructed the hole ran straight to the green with the wide fairway protected by bunkers left, right and center. The green is at fairway level (rare for the course) and the right and center bunkers were removed in 1955 and the large mound placed in front of the green. The green, the narrowest on the course at 51 feet and the widest at 111 feet, peaks behind the mound and slopes away side to side. The hump obscures many of the pin positions and requires a thoughtful drive to insure an clear approach to the flag.\n11th Hole 407 yard Par 4. Named \"Wind\" as it plays into the prevailing wind. The slight dog leg left fairway is free of bunkers but features a spine that runs across the fairway that catches shorter drives. The elevated green is protected by bunkers on each side and slopes toward a false front.\n12th Hole 207 yard Par 3. Named \"Redan\" after the famous 15th at North Berwick, Scotland. As with its namesake, the 12th was designed to be protected by a left bunker with a green positioned at a 45 degree angle. This classic piece of golf architecture usually is designed to be played with a running shot that would feed to the green and down to protected pin. The changes with grasses over time has significantly limited this style of shot as it now grabs most approaches and forces a long carry into the green made more difficult by afternoon winds. A second bunker was added in the 1950s and further complicates approaches.\n13th Hole 509 yard Par 5. Named \"Pass\" for the pass between two large mounds that funnels tee shots to the fairway center. Second shots can be blind and the fairway slopes hard to the right forcing the unfortunate into the trees or tree obstructed third shot. A boomerang green is protected by bunkers left and right and slopes right left and back. The green is best played to the center and par is a good score.\n14th Hole 317 yard Par 4. Named \"Crow's Nest\" as an homage to Lucky Baldwin's old race track that once occupied the site. The main grandstand featured a \"Crow's Nest\" observation point on the roof. The back of the green is the highest point on the course.\n15th Hole 189 yard Par 3. Named \"Thorn\" in honor of the rose bush planter that decorates the area between the 15th green and 16th tee. The hole is protected by a large central bunker in front and another in the left rear. The green slopes hard away from the left front. Shots landing left of the bunker often trundle on to the putting surface. Judging distance is very difficult on this challenging hole.\n16th hole 437 yard Par 4. Named \"Darsie\" after Darsie L. Darsie, Editor of the Los Angeles Herald Express Newspaper and a noted Golf writer. The fairway was originally the main stretch of the old Lucky Baldwin racetrack. As designed, the hole shared a large bunker with the 17th hole. Following the 1955 remodel the maturing trees protect both sides and a swale on the left makes for uneven lies. The green is protected by a tree and large bunker left. The green favors a run up shot landing on the right which will feed down to the left sloping green. The 16th is the #2 handicap hole and had destroyed many a good round with its challenges.\n17th Hole 292 yard Par 4. Named \"Desert\" in honor of a large 200 yard sand waste area that once ran up the left hand side of the fairway forcing tee shots to the right. The angled and well bunkered green opens up from that side. The sand area was removed as the trees between the 16th and 17th holes matured in 1955.\n18th Hole 439 yard Par 4. Named \"Climax\" as it is the end of the round. The difficult dog leg right once featured an extensive bunker complex and an out of bounds to the right along the 10th fairway (removed once the trees matured). The fairway is undulating and the landing zone is bisected by a large ridge that runs away left to right from the teeing ground. Time has deepened the area between the ridge and the fairway and significantly altered the strategic nature of the hole. The depression is worn bare by carts and maintenance equipment and makes for an incredibly difficult second shot . The original green was flat and protected by bunkers left and swales on the right. The green was rebuilt in 1955 with a bunker to the rear. Clubhouse expansion in 1989-1990 reduced the size of the green at the rear and increased the forward slope.\nThe Course Record.\nThe current Par 71 record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. \"The Open\" era par 70 record is held by Ellsworth Vines who shot an opening round 62 on October 16, 1953 during the Santa Anita Open.\nScorecard.\nScorecard for Santa Anita Golf Course circa 2010"

Having suffered badly over the first six days of the Games, Hackett maintained a strong lead from start to finish, and touched the wall first to claim a gold in 14:48.33. Perkins fought off a challenge against his newest rival in the middle of the program's longest race, but ended up only with a silver in 14:53.59, handing the entire medal haul for the host nation with a 1–2 finish. U.S. swimmer Chris Thompson came up with a spectacular swim to take the bronze in an American record of 14:56.81, holding off a fast-closing Alexei Filipets of Russia (14:56.88) by seven hundredths of a second (0.07).

Great Britain's Alison Sheppard (25.45) and Japan's Sumika Minamoto (25.65) closed out the field.\nNotable swimmers missed out the top 8 final, featuring Australia's overwhelming favorite Susie O'Neill; Völker's teammate Katrin Meissner, who shared bronze medals with Jill Sterkel in the event's inception in 1988 as a member of the former East German squad; and Estonia's Jana Kolukanova, who grabbed the final spot from the prelims after winning a three-person swimoff.\nOne of the most popular highlights in the event took place in the first heat. Dubbed as the \"Crawler\", Paula Barila Bolopa had finally completed a unique double for Equatorial Guinea, as she swam the slowest ever race by a female in Olympic history with a time of 1:03.97.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.

        "text": "Joseph Nathaniel Kendall (October 2, 1909 – November 25, 1965) was an American gridiron football player, best known for playing college football for the Kentucky State Industrial College for Colored Persons (now Kentucky State University) in the mid-1930s. Nicknamed \"Tarzan\" for his athletic prowess, he was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007.\nBiography.\nKendall was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1909, and attended high school there. A dominant figure in black college football in the 1930s, Kendall first played for West Kentucky Industrial College, a junior college, during the 1932 season. He then played for the Kentucky State Thorobreds during the 1933–1936 seasons. His nickname of \"Tarzan\" appeared in print by October 1934. While Kendall played as a halfback, football of the era included much more passing by halfbacks than in modern collegiate or professional football; various newspaper reports of the era highlighted Kendall's skill as a passer.\nKendall helped lead the 1934 Kentucky State Thorobreds to an undefeated season and consensus black college football national championship selection; the program was also named champion by some selectors in 1933 and 1935. In December 1935, the Thorobreds defeated Florida A&amp;M in that season's Orange Blossom Classic; coverage of the game highlighted \"Kendall with his sure arm, shooting bullet-like passes all over the field.\" Kentucky State had an overall record during Kendall's playing years. He was a first-team All-America selection by Chester L. Washington, sports editor of the \"Pittsburgh Courier\", for the 1934 to 1936 seasons. In September 1938, Kendall played on an all-star team against the Chicago Bears in an exhibition game at Soldier Field.\nFollowing his playing career, Kendall served as a high school teacher, principal, and sports coach. He first taught in Harlan, Kentucky, interrupted by service in the United States Army during World War II. He then taught in Owensboro from 1948 until his death. Kendall died on November 25, 1965, at Owensboro Daviess County Hospital, a month after sustaining injuries in an automobile accident on U.S. Route 60 near Garfield, Kentucky. He was survived by his wife, four sons, and three daughters.\nA park in Kendall's hometown of Owensboro was co-named in his honor in 1973. Kendall was inducted into the Kentucky State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1975, and was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007, becoming the first inductee from Kentucky State. He was inducted to the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2011."

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between France and New Zealand",
        "text": "The National Rugby Union teams of France and New Zealand (the All Blacks) have been playing each other for over a century. The first encounter, during the historic 1905–1906 All Blacks tour of Europe and North America, which was also France's first Test, took place in Paris in January 1906 and was won by New Zealand 38–8. It was not until their third meeting, in 1954, that France secured their first win over New Zealand 3-0.\nFrance first toured New Zealand in 1961 before any of the Home Nations and the All Blacks won all three Tests. The All Blacks first full tour of France was in 1977, when they won one of the two tests. France first defeated the All Blacks in New Zealand on Bastille Day 1979. France achieved a first series win in New Zealand in 1994, when they won both Tests. Since 2000, the two teams have contested the Dave Gallaher Trophy.\nThe teams World Cup history includes eight matches, the joint most for any pair of teams. They have played two tournament finals, in 1987 and 2011 (both at Eden Park and both won by New Zealand).\nOverall, the All Blacks have won 48 Tests against France's 14, with one match drawn. The largest winning margin in a test match between the countries was a 61-10 victory to the All Blacks at Westpac Stadium in Wellington in 2007. The most career points scored by members of either team is 92 by Andrew Mehrtens, and he also holds the record for most points in one match with 29.\nDespite the vastly superior win record of New Zealand in this encounter, France has the greatest number of wins against the All Blacks of any Northern Hemisphere opponent to date. France are sometimes called the \"bogey\" team of New Zealand, known for having inconsistent results in regular test matches, but have proven to be fierce opponents in the knockout stage of the Rugby World Cup. All Black campaigns in The Rugby World Cup were halted by defeats to France in 1999 and 2007, and were nearly upset again in 2011 with a very narrow 8-7 victory in the final.\nHistory.\nEarly meetings (1905–25).\nThe first-ever New Zealand tour to the Northern Hemisphere was in 1905–06. It was also the first time they wore a black strip and the first time they performed the haka. The team – known today as \"The Original All Blacks\" – played various club and national sides throughout the British Isles before taking on France on 1 January 1906. This was France's first Test and was held at Parc des Princes, Paris. The All Blacks scored ten tries, including six in the second half, to France's two, and won 38–8. Despite the scoreline, France's two tries were more than any previous team had scored against the All Blacks on tour. Commenting on the state of French rugby in their book \"The Complete Rugby Footballer\", Original All Blacks Dave Gallaher and Billy Stead wrote: \"We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other.\"\nThe 1924–25 All Blacks' \"Invincibles\" tour included a Test against France. The teams met at the Stade des Ponts Jumeaux in Toulouse on 18 January 1925. Although French rugby had improved since 1906, the All Blacks still won 30–6, with France scoring two tries. All Blacks' captain Cliff Porter said of France \"Your forwards gave us a lot of bother. Your three-quarters were not so good.\"\nIn 1926, France lost to the New Zealand Maori. Perhaps the \"most celebrated Maori side in history\", they undertook a seven-month 1926–27 tour of Australia, Ceylon, France, Wales and Canada, playing 38 matches, winning 29 and losing seven, with two draws. In total, the Maori scored 712 points while conceding 215. This was the last match between a New Zealand representative team and France for nearly three decades. In 1932 the International Rugby Football Board (IRB) expelled France from the Five Nations Championship for breaching the professionalism rules in its domestic club competition. Consequently, the All Blacks did not face France during their 1935 British Isles' tour. Although France was readmitted in 1939, the Second World War intervened, suspending international competition.\nIn 1946, France played two matches against a team selected from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, nicknamed the \"Khaki All Blacks\". Despite the team not being a representative New Zealand side, they included many future All Blacks. The games took place on 10 March at Stade Colombes, Paris, and on 24 March at Wallon Stadium, Toulouse. The Khaki All Blacks won both (14–9 and 13–10).\nPost war (1954–68).\nThe 1954 match at Stade Colombes, Paris, was dominated by the All Blacks who had the majority of possession and territory. Despite this, France scored in the 35th minute after the ball was lost by All Blacks' half-back Keith Davis from France's line. The ball was picked up by French number eight Robert Baulon who passed to Paul Labadie. Labadie then passed to French captain Jean Prat who scored a try, giving France a 3–0 lead that the All Blacks failed to close. Although New Zealand relentlessly attacked the French line – and made several drop goal and penalty attempts – the French defence held, earning France their first win (3–0) over the All Blacks.\nFrance first toured New Zealand in 1961 – before any of the Home Nations. The first Test at Eden Park was won 13–6 by the All Blacks after they scored two converted tries and a penalty. France's first five-eighth Pierre Albaladejo kicked all of France's points with two drop goals, prompting the New Zealanders to nickname him \"Monsieur Drop\". The second Test of the tour was played at Athletic Park in Wellington. The wind was very strong and neither team scored during the first half. In the second, playing into the wind, France scored a try to lead 3–0. The All Blacks' Kel Tremain responded with a try. In one of the best conversions of his career, Don Clarke kicked almost parallel to the goal-line, relying on the strong wind to gust the ball over the posts. The Blacks won 5–3. Although the All Blacks won the final Test in Christchurch 32–3 to take the series, the tour had a positive influence in France where it was broadcast on national television via satellite, popularising the sport beyond its traditional heartland of the southwest.\nThe next two matches between the teams were both in Paris. The All Blacks won the first 12–3 in 1964 after tries from Ralph Caulton and Ken Gray. In the next match, in 1967, the All Blacks were coached by Fred Allen and captained by Brian Lochore; they won 21–15.\nIn 1968, following their first Five Nations Grand Slam, France toured Australia and New Zealand.\nThey were defeated in their Test against Australia and in all three against the All Blacks. The All Blacks' side was particularly strong and won all its Tests between 1965 and 1970. France's touring losses presaged a string of defeats that did not end until they drew against Wales in the 1969 Five Nations (in which France finished last).\nFull amateur tours (1970–1994).\nFrance achieved only their second Test victory over the All Blacks in 1973 at Parc des Princes, Paris. The All Blacks had defeated England, Scotland and Wales, and drawn with Ireland on their 1973 tour and France was their last Test. France won 13–6, and scored two tries to nil, with two penalties the only points from the All Blacks. In 1977 the All Blacks made their first-ever full tour of France. France won the first Test in Toulouse and the All Blacks the second in Paris. France then reciprocated and toured New Zealand in 1979. This time, neutral referees were appointed for the first time. The All Blacks won the first Test 23–9 at Lancaster Park. However, in the second Test, France upset the All Blacks by winning 24–19 on Bastille Day at Eden Park. The victory was France's first win in New Zealand over the All Blacks.\nThe 1980s saw many France – New Zealand Tests. The first two were in 1981 when the All Blacks toured France, visiting in Toulouse and Paris; the All Blacks won both Tests, 13–9 and 18–6 respectively. In 1984, France visited New Zealand for two Tests. They lost the first, at Lancaster Park, 10–9 (despite repeated French drop goal attempts late in the match, nearly all in front of the posts from various distances) and the second, at Eden Park, 31–18.\nIn 1986, France played a one-off Test in New Zealand, at Lancaster Park. Many top All Blacks were serving a two-month suspension for participating in the rebel Cavaliers tour to South Africa. The team that faced France became known as the \"Baby Blacks\" as all bar two of them were either making their Test début or were very inexperienced. The Baby Blacks upset France 18–9 in front of 24,000 spectators; the only try coming from number eight Mike Brewer.\nLater in 1986, the bans served, the full All Blacks toured France. They won the first Test, in Toulouse, 19–7. Their next match, at Nantes, became known as \"the battle of Nantes\". France played aggressively and tried to intimidate the All Blacks. All Black Buck Shelford had his scrotum rucked in the twentieth minute that required stitches while he was still on the field. He was later knocked out, losing several teeth in the process, and did not finish the match. The aggressive display by France paid off and they won 16–3.\nThe following year France and the All Blacks met in the final of the inaugural Rugby World Cup. The tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia and the final was held at Eden Park. The All Blacks were captained by David Kirk and went on to win their first World Cup 29–9. According to the All Blacks' coach at the time, Brian Lochore, the previous year's loss in Nantes was the catalyst for their World Cup victory. Shelford said of the match \"We wanted to play them in the final because we wanted revenge\". The match also helped improve the diplomatic and political rift between France and New Zealand caused by the 1985 bombing of the \"Rainbow Warrior\" by French Secret Service agents.\nFrance toured New Zealand in 1989 and played a two Test series. They lost both Tests; the first 25–17 at Lancaster Park, and the second 34–20 at Eden Park. In both Tests the All Blacks led at the half time break, with France responding by scoring most of their points during the first 15 minutes of the second half before the All Blacks counter-attacked to win in the last quarter. The All Blacks' reciprocal tour of France came in 1990. Again two Tests were played and again they were won by the All Blacks; 24–3 at Nantes, and 30–12 at the Parc de Princes. The All Blacks first-five eighth Grant Fox, dominated both matches, scoring 16 points in the first Test, and 22 points in the second.\nThe next tour was of New Zealand by France in 1994. In a major upset for New Zealand rugby, France took the first Test 22–8 at Lancaster Park, coinciding with Frenchman Philippe Sella's hundredth match for his country. Sella said of the game \"But this historic victory for my 100th cap, with a score I never imagined – that's one of my really great, great memories\". The second and final Test on tour was at Eden Park on 3 July 1994. The All Blacks were winning 20–16 with three minutes remaining after Matthew Cooper had kicked a penalty. The French counter-attacked and ran the ball the length of the field from their own in-goal area to win. The ball was handled by nine French players before the try was scored by Jean-Luc Sadourny. French captain Philippe Saint-Andre called it \"a counter-attack from the end of the world\", and it was then labelled (the try from the end of the world). The try gave France a 23–20 win and a 2–0 series win over the All Blacks. In 2003, \"Daily Telegraph\" readers voted the try the fourth best of all time in either rugby union or rugby league.\nProfessional era (from 1995).\nOn 11 November 1995, France set a record when they defeated the All Blacks 22–15 at Toulouse—their third consecutive victory over the New Zealanders. A week later, on 18 November, at the Parc des Princes in Paris, the All Blacks took their revenge, inflicting a resounding 37–12 defeat. It was not until 1999 that the two teams met again, in a one-off Test at Athletic Park in Wellington. The All Blacks won 54–7; at the time France's largest ever loss. Tana Umaga scored three tries and Andrew Mehrtens kicked 19 points in the match.\nAfter their Athletic Park victory, the All Blacks were heavy favourites to win when they met France in the semi-finals of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. The game was played at the neutral venue of Twickenham Stadium on 31 October 1999. The All Blacks led 24–10 seven minutes into the second half after two tries (both from Jonah Lomu). France then scored two penalties and two drop goals to first five-eighth Christophe Lamaison to reduce the All Blacks' lead to 24–22 with 25 minutes remaining. Scrum-half Fabien Galthié chip kicked the ball to Christophe Dominici who then scored. Another Lamaison kick set up a try for centre Richard Dourthe, which Lamaison converted, to take France into the lead, 36–24. France scored another try in the remaining five minutes, and although the All Blacks scored a last-minute try France won 43–31. Lamaison had scored 28 points, and a \"full house\" – a try, conversion, penalty and drop goal all in one match. Many have called this match \"the greatest game in World Cup history\".\nThe Dave Gallaher Trophy was introduced in 2000 to be contested between the two teams. It was named in memory of All Blacks captain Dave Gallaher who captained the All Blacks against France in 1906 and who died at the Battle of Passchendaele. The Cup was first contested on Armistice Day (11 November) 2000. The All Blacks won 39–26 and scored two tries while Andrew Mehrtens scored nine penalties. The two met again the following week and this time France won 42–33, but as only the first Test counted towards the trophy the All Blacks retained it.\nThe countries met in one-off Tests in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 2001 Test was won 37–12 by the All Blacks, the 2002 Test was a 20 all draw and in 2003 the All Blacks won 31–23 at Jade Stadium. They met again in 2003 at the Rugby World Cup in Sydney. The match was a third-fourth play-off game and was won 40–13 by the All Blacks. In 2004 they met in a one-off Test in Paris. The 2004 Test was the first between the two teams with Graham Henry as All Blacks coach. France were 2004 Six Nations Champions, but were defeated by five tries to nil. The final score was a 45–6 win to the All Blacks; a record at the time. They met in France in 2006 – this time for a two-Test series. The first Test was played in Lyon on Armistice Day. The All Blacks defeated France 46–3 which was a record defeat for them at home. This was despite the All Blacks' team not being their strongest available. Following the defeat France's manager Jo Maso said that the All Blacks played the match, \"for all the New Zealanders who died during the two World Wars in Europe\". The following week the two teams met in Paris, this time to commemorate the centennial of the first ever All Blacks versus France Test. Despite fielding what coach Graham Henry described as his best team, the All Blacks achieved a less notable 23–11 victory.\nThe next year France visited New Zealand for a two-Test series. The final rounds of the 2006–07 Top 14 season conflicted with the tour, so France sent a Test team short of 30 of their top players. With their weakened squad, the team was labelled \"France C\" by the New Zealand media. Featuring six new caps, France were defeated 42–11 in the first Test at Eden Park. The second Test was played the following week in Wellington, and the All Blacks achieved their largest ever victory over France with a 61–10 win.\nThe defeat was France's heaviest in their history.\nFrance hosted the 2007 World Cup, and the two teams met in the tournament quarter-finals. Despite France's hosting of the tournament, the match was held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The match was won by France 20–18, and involved several controversial decisions by referee Wayne Barnes, who subsequently received death threats from some fans. France scored one try after the sin binning of All Blacks second five-eighth Luke McAlister, and another from a forward pass unseen by the referee. The All Blacks were strongly criticised for not attempting a drop goal in the game's final minutes. Their performance was analysed by Palmerston North based company Verusco who had analysed 1,500 games since 2000. They discovered that the All Blacks made 57 tackles to France's 269, and they had 66 percent possession and 60 percent territory. The playing time, that is time the ball is in play, was the longest of any game Verusco had ever recorded.\nAn 'Independent Review of the 2007 Rugby World Cup Campaign', conducted by Russel McVeagh lawyers and SPARC (Sport and Recreation New Zealand), found that Barnes and the touch judges had a significant impact on the result of the match. The report states that \"The penalty count was 10-2 against the All Blacks, with none awarded in the second half, despite dominance in territory and possession (which statistically should result in penalties awarded to the dominant side). On anyone's account the referees and touch judges made mistakes which worked against the All Blacks.\" Outside New Zealand and France, the focus was on the fact that, as in 1999, France had pulled off what \"The Guardian\" described as another \"incredible triumph against the odds.\"\nIn 2011, New Zealand hosted the Rugby World Cup. Unusually, France and New Zealand played twice at the tournament - both times at Eden Park. Both teams were in Pool A, and on September 24 New Zealand won their first encounter 37-17. New Zealand were pool winners, with France second. On either side of the draw for the knockout stage, both teams made the final on October 23. New Zealand won 8-7. The match involved several controversial decisions by referee Craig Joubert, nonetheless for the second time New Zealand won a home World Cup with France runners up.\nSummary.\nAs of September 2023, New Zealand and France have played 63 Tests. The All Blacks have won 48, France 14, and one has been drawn. Only four matches have been played at neutral venues; the 1999 World Cup semi-final at Twickenham, London, the 2003 World Cup third/fourth play-off match at Stadium Australia in Sydney, and the 2007 and 2015 World Cup quarter-finals at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. New Zealand have scored considerably more points than France both in France and New Zealand, and at neutral venues - although at neutral venues France have won two of the four matches. A summary of the Test match statistics can be found below.\nRugby World Cup matches.\nNew Zealand and France have played eight Rugby World Cup games, more than any other pair of teams, including six play-off matches. Five have been won by New Zealand and three by France. France's wins knocked New Zealand out of the 1999 and 2007 tournaments at the semi-final and quarter-final stage respectively. New Zealand's first two successful campaigns (1987 and 2011) ended with wins over France, both at Eden Park. New Zealand's other victories have come in a quarter-final (2015), a pool match (2011, again at Eden Park) and the 2003 third-place playoff.\nXV results.\nBelow is a list of matches that France and New Zealand opted not to give full test match status."

His playing career over by 1984, he found work as a scout in the California Angels organization from 1985 to 1987, and then the Montreal Expos in 1987.\nHe became a hitting instructor for the Jamestown Expos of the New York–Penn League in 1988 and then became the east coast scouting supervisor for the Minnesota Twins from 1988 to 1991.\nGeneral Manager.\nMalone became the Expos Director of Scouting in 1991 and became the Expos General Manager in 1994. He was in charge of orchestrating the Expos \"fire sale\" in 1995 where they had four days to get rid of several expensive contracts to slash the payroll. He traded or released several star players from what had been a successful team the previous season. Departing were Larry Walker, John Wetteland, Ken Hill and Marquis Grissom. Malone resigned following the season.\nAfter a few years as assistant general manager with the Baltimore Orioles, Malone was hired as the GM of the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 11, 1998. When he was hired, he described himself as the \"new sheriff in town.\" He also nicknamed himself \"Dodger Boy\". Malone's tenure in Los Angeles, under the new News Corporation owners led to several expensive high salaried stars being signed to huge contracts, including Kevin Brown, Shawn Green and Gary Sheffield.\nIn April 2001, he got into a verbal argument with a Padres fan in San Diego, who was heckling Sheffield.

        "title": "Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation",
        "text": "The Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation (OPBF) is a professional boxing organization that sanctions title fights in the Asian and Pacific region.\nHistory.\nOriental boxing started in the Philippines in 1946 after the Spanish-American War. While America was stationed in the Philippines, boxing began to build up in popularity due to American influence. Many Filipinos who were inspired by boxing, moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to continue their careers.\nYujiro Watanabe of Japan laid important groundwork in developing the sport in Japan and bridging language and cultural barriers with neighboring countries. Watanabe came to America in 1911 to box and returned to Japan in 1921 to form one of the first boxing groups in Asia, known as the Japan Club. This club allowed boxing to gain more popularity in Japan during the post-war years.\nThe OPBF was later formed in 1954 by the Japanese, Korean, and Filipino boxing commissions. It was originally named the Orient Boxing Federation but changed to the Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation when the Australian National Boxing Federation joined in 1977. In 1963, Australia, New Zealand and the Oceania countries were approved for membership. In November 1977, the organization was officially renamed to Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation. The organization headquarters were moved from Australia to Japan in 2018.\nThe OPBF helped form the World Boxing Council in 1963 and is currently affiliated with that organization.\nIn January 2009, women's championships were established, across eleven weight classes (from atomweight to welterweight). Initially, women's title fights were contested in ten-round bouts, which was reduced to eight rounds in 2012.\nOn 30 March 2016, the OPBF Silver Championship was established, following a dispute between the Japanese and Philippines boxing commissions on whether an interim title should be established. WBC chairman Mauricio Suleiman suggested naming the title \"Silver\" to avoid detracting any prestige from the full title. Despite this, the JBC announced a policy of not allowing OPBF Silver matches to be contested in Japan.\nIn November 2018, the OPBF announced the establishment of domestic OPBF titles, which would certify national champions. The first OPBF national champion was crowned on 9 December 2018, when Dao Nguyen Anh Tuan won the OPBF Vietnam super lightweight title.\nMembers.\n15 national commissions and 3 regional commissions (Hong Kong, Guam and Hawaii).\nControversies.\nThe OPBF ratings have been criticized numerous times. The ratings released in January 2005 had the undefeated #1 super flyweight Z Gorres passed up by three fighters, including a previously-unranked Prosper Matsuura jumping to #3, after an impressive win. Additionally, the undefeated Reynaldo Bautista dropped from #4 to #5 after a defense of his WBO Asia Pacific bantamweight title. The previously-unranked Japanese fighter Jun Toriumi catapulted to the #1 spot and won the title soon after.\nThe following year, a new batch of ratings drew further criticism. WBO Asia Pacific super featherweight champion Czar Amonsot, who was previously ranked #3, dropped out of the top 10 after knocking out Victor Mausul for the title and defeating Cristian Favela. Unranked Jimrex Jaca was moved to #1. Apart from this, former OPBF super featherweight champion Randy Suico had relinquished his title to move up to lightweight, and was immediately ranked at #1 in his new weight class in the new rankings. The previous #1, Shunsuke Ito, had just won the Japanese lightweight title by stopping his opponent in the second round and was in line for a OPBF title shot against reigning champion Chikashi Inada.\nIn September 2017, undefeated Filipino prospect Edward Heno won the vacant OPBF light flyweight title on his second attempt. However, he was stripped of the belt and dropped to number four in the rankings after he was unable to defend it at that year's OPBF convention in Puerto Princesa in November, even though the winner of a vacant belt normally gets 90 days to defend it."

        "title": "Ice cricket",
        "text": "Ice cricket are variants of the English summer game of cricket but played in harsh, wintry conditions. Early forms of ice cricket were played outdoors and on skates. The difference between the forms of Ice Cricket is that some are played directly on the ice, with no mat laid down. The results are a little more unpredictable and provide more fun and variety. In modern forms the players don't wear skates.\nIn the modern game the ball is the same as an indoor cricket ball, a composite plastic red ball which makes it relatively easy to find if it gets hit into a snowdrift.\nThe Ice Cricket World Championship is held annually in the Estonian city of Tallinn. With winter temperatures of minus 10 to minus 25 degree Celsius, the tournaments are played on Harku Lake, which freezes over rapidly in early January.\nHistory.\nCricket on ice was played in England from at least the first half of the 19th century.\nA game was played in Sheffield in 1826. \"A match was played on the ice near Sheffield a few days ago, in skates, in which several of the Sheffield Club wore engaged. Through one of the bats breaking the double wickets were struck, and the day was concluded with a well contested single wicket game.\"\n\"Cricket Match Extraordinary.— The splendid piece of water on Erridge Park has been a grand scene of attraction for the last few weeks to the visitors and inhabitants of Tonbridge Wells. The surface covers an area of about twenty-one acres, and consequently gives a fine opportunity for scientific skating. We have noticed as many as from 100 to 200 at a time forming various figures on the ice. A cricket match was played on the ice by Messrs. E. Vanx, 33; J. Clapson, 1; T. Russell, 29; Duffy, 9, not out; A, Glover, 0; W.Loof, 1; J. J. Hastings and W. Friend; byes, 12; total 85; against —T.Neal, 14; J. Trice, 16; R. Clapson, 1; J. Taylor, 17; T.Seamer, 7; G.Bourne, 10, Beale.0; and J.Gurr, 12; byes, 17; total,84. The bowling of Mr. J. Clapson excited general admiration, as well as that of Messrs. Vaux and Seamer. The stumps were fixed in two blocks of wood, and all the gentlemen played in skates; the ball when struck flew with great swiftness over the ice, the parties running or rather skating between the wickets, and those who were looking out skating after the ball. The whole presented a most lively and interesting scene. The latter evolutions were attended with many of those minor accidents peculiar to the slippery game, much to the amusement of the numerous spectators; we are happy, however, to say that none were materially hurt. The game was a single innings. Mr. Vaux obtained thirty-three runs and was not oot; his batting was very superior, as was also that of Mr. Thomas Neal. There were upwards of a hundred ladies and gentlemen on the ice at one time, among whom we noticed the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Nevile, Miss Myeta, &amp;c. — Kentish Observer\"\nAn eleven-a-side game of ice cricket was played at Gosfield Lake near Halstead on 18th January 1838.\nA twelve-a-side match of ice cricket was played in Chesham, Bucks in February 1841 between two teams of Gentlemen playing on the pond in the park. \nAn eight-a-side match of ice cricket was played in Oxford in 1850.\nCricket was also played on ice in the Fens, though it never became as popular as bandy. In February 1855 the \"Cambridge Chronicle\" reported on a match between March and Wisbech on the Ballast Pits at March. The home team beat the visitors by 118 runs, thanks to a century not out by Rhodes. \"The fielding and batting of many of the players was considered to be far superior to and more graceful than any cricketing on the green sward\".\n\"WALTHAM ABBEY — Cricket Match on the Ice. A cricket match was played on the ice in the Waltham Marshes on Saturday, January 19, between the members of the Waltham Abbey and Enfield Lock Small Arms Factory Cricket Club and their friends, sides being chosen by Messrs. Dean and James — the whole of the players being on skates. The fielding by Messrs. Rutherford, Hawkins, Bigby, and Powell was much admired; but in consequence of the heavy fall of snow the day previous the scores were small.\"\nA match was played on Chantry Water Mill Pond, Storrington in 1891 and another match was held near Market Harborough in 1893.\nIn 1903 an ice cricket match was held on the English Skating rink at Davos.\nA photo of a game of ice cricket in St Moritz was published in 1903.\nAn international tournament called Cricket On Ice has been played on Lake St. Moritz since 1988 and now in Estonia every year since 2004.\nBritish Olympic bobsledder, Keith Schellenberg is sometimes credited as having invented a form of ice cricket while in St Moritz. He is said to have taught the sport of cricket to fellow Winter Olympians while in Switzerland.\nAnother version credits the Estonian version to Barry Jason, an English immigrant to Estonia and former Estonian cricket president who was determined to increase the visibility of cricket throughout the year in the country. The first World Championship was held in 2007.\nMore recently in The Netherlands, the VOC Cricket club in Rotterdam has been known to organise cricket matches, in those winters when the lakes freeze sufficiently over to support such an event."

        "text": "The Dirty Dozen were the rookies that made the Dallas Cowboys team in 1975. These players were credited with helping the Cowboys advance to Super Bowl X and were a key foundation of the team's success during the latter half of the 1970s going into the early 1980s, as by 1979 many of these players would have replaced many of the Cowboys' aging starters of the 1960s. The rookies came up with the nickname inspired by the film of the same name, and spent half of the season without shaving.\nLegacy.\nFor all of the accolades that the Dallas Cowboys scouting department had received throughout the years, the team had never kept more than nine draft choices and the average number was keeping six. In 1962, 14 rookies made the team - 7 draft choices, 4 undrafted free agents, 2 obtained in trades and one claimed off waivers. \nIn 1975, eleven picks and one undrafted free agent (Percy Howard) made the team, hence the nickname \"The Dirty Dozen\" for the 1975 Cowboys draft class. This group of rookies didn't even include linebacker Mike Hegman, who was drafted that year but did not enter the NFL until 1976, nor future Seattle Seahawks starting quarterback undrafted free agent Jim Zorn who made the team, but was later cut to make room for running back Preston Pearson, who had been waived by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe infusion of new talent not only meant an immediate rebuilding process and competition, but also changed the course of the team in a significant way. This group helped the Cowboys reach Super Bowl X that season, and moving forward would play a key role in the franchise being given the nickname \"America's Team\".\nThis draft class is considered to be one of the greatest in NFL history."

        "text": "A cricket team from South America toured England, Scotland and Wales in the 1932 season. The team played six first-class matches and 12 other games. A seventh first-class match with Worcestershire was abandoned without a ball being bowled.\nThis tour was the only occasion on which the South Americans played first-class cricket as a team representing the whole continent, though individual members of the side played for their countries in matches against touring teams from England that were designated as first-class.\nTouring team.\nThe team was captained by Clement Gibson, who had played first-class cricket in England for Cambridge University, MCC and Sussex.\nThe full team was:\nFirst-class matches.\nThe team played six first-class matches, and a seventh against Worcestershire was abandoned without any play.\nThey beat an under-strength Oxford University by 10 wickets after Marshal scored 153 and Ferguson 85, and Dennet Ayling took 10 wickets in the match for 87 runs.\nLeicestershire then won the second first-class game rather easily by an innings and 33 runs, with the South American batting unreliable in both innings in a match affected by heavy showers. The Army also beat the touring side after a South American first innings of 303 in which Stuart scored 133 was followed by a second innings batting collapse.\nThe match against Sir Julien Cahn's XI produced a remarkable victory for the South Americans. Cahn's XI made 413 in the first innings, largely due to 251 for Denys Morkel, the South African Test player, made in four hours. The South Americans responded with a century opening stand between Jackson and Dennet Ayling and totalled 338. The Ayling brothers then each took five wickets as Cahn's XI were all out for 150 and Dennet Ayling, with an unbeaten 86, took the touring side to victory by five wickets, sharing another century opening stand with Jackson.\nThe match with Sussex was affected by rain and left drawn. Knox made an unbeaten 110, batting at No 9 in the South American innings. The final match of the tour was a heavy defeat to Scotland by eight wickets.\nOther matches.\nThe South Americans played 12 other matches, all of them one- and two-day games, and many of them affected by the weather in a wet summer. All the games were drawn, except the matches against Kent's Second Eleven and a team calling itself the Gentlemen of Somerset, both of which the touring team lost.\nThe match against MCC at Lord's was a two-day game. MCC were captained by the 58-year-old Pelham Warner and included the South African Test player Herbie Taylor and England players J.W.Hearne and Eddie Dawson. The South Americans had slightly the worse of a high-scoring draw."

He played college football at the University of Central Florida, and was selected by the Redskins in the 10th round of the 1987 NFL draft.\nEarly life.\nWilson was born in Zephyrhills, Florida and attended Zephyrhills High School, where he played high school football and baseball. During his senior year, Wilson batted .400 with 10 home runs and 50 stolen bases. Wilson was drafted by the New York Mets but decided to attend college.\nCollege career.\nWilson attended and played college football at the University of Central Florida. As a freshman return specialist in 1983, he finished second in the nation with a 30.5 kick return average, including a national-high 100-yard touchdown return against Southeastern Louisiana University. During his sophomore season, Wilson led the team in receiving (483 yards), scoring (44 points), punt returns (96 yards) and kickoff returns (952 yards). In 1985, he set a school record with seven 100-yard games, which included five consecutive 100-yard games. He finished the season with 76 receptions for 1,119 yards and 12 touchdowns. He finished his college career with 151 receptions for 2,443 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 4,854 all-purpose yards, which is still a school record. In 2003, Wilson was named to UCF's 25th Anniversary Football Team.\nProfessional career.\nWilson became the first UCF Knights football player to be selected by an NFL team when he was selected the 10th round (274th overall) of the 1987 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins. The 1987 season began with a 24-day players' strike, reducing the 16-game season to 15. The games for weeks 4–6 were won with all replacement players, including Wilson. The Redskins have the distinction of being the only team with no players crossing the picket line. Those three victories are often credited with getting the team into the playoffs and the basis for the 2000 movie The Replacements.\nPrison sentence.\nWilson was arrested on December 19, 2011, after investigators raided his house and found a quarter-kilogram of cocaine, more than an ounce of crack cocaine, a loaded shotgun and a Hi-Point CF-380 semiautomatic handgun. According to court documents, in 2009 to 2012, he worked with others in Pasco County, Florida to distribute large quantities of cocaine and crack cocaine. During the height of his drug trafficking operations, Wilson distributed approximately 100 kilograms of cocaine per month, and profited over $1 million. He pleaded guilty on January 18, 2013 to drug and weapons charges. On May 1, 2013, Wilson was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison, which included 12 years' imprisonment for three drug-related charges, followed by a mandatory consecutive five years for possessing a firearm."

The race began on 18 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Udine, finishing back in Milan on 5 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Carlo Galetti of the Atala-Continental team, with fellow Italians Eberardo Pavesi and Luigi Ganna coming in second and third respectively.\nEberardo Pavesi was the first rider to lead the race after winning the first stage into Udine. After the second stage, Carlo Galetti took the lead of the race. Galetti then successfully defended the lead all the way to the race's finish in Milan. En route to his overall victory, Galetti won two stages. The Atala-Continental team finished as winners of the team classification.\nChanges from the 1909 Giro d'Italia.\nOne major change was made to the calculation for the general classification before the start of the second Giro d'Italia. Originally a point was given to each rider for his placing on each stage, but the organizers chose to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage.\nThe organizers chose to increase the length of their race after the success from the first edition. The original race was eight stages long and the 1910 edition was increased by two stages, to ten. The overall length of the race was increased to close to 3,000 kilometers, which made the race close to 500 kilometers longer than the inaugural edition of the race.\nParticipants.\nA total of 101 riders started the second Giro d'Italia out of the 118 that signed up to participate. Of the 101 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 18 May, twenty of them made it to the finish in Milan on 5 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were six teams that competed in the race: Atala-Continental, Atena-Dunlop, Bianchi-Dunlop, Legnano-Dunlop, Otav-Pirelli, and Stucchi-Pirelli.\nThe notable participants included the reigning champion of the Giro d'Italia, Luigi Ganna. The peloton also contained some of the most famous Italian cyclists at the time in Carlo Galetti, Ezio Corlaita, Giovanni Rossignoli, and Eberardo Pavesi. Two-time Tour de France champion Lucien Petit-Breton rode the Giro for the second straight year, along with his fellow countryman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq who had been successful in the Tour. The Giro also saw its first German participants, neither of whom completed the race.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage of the second Giro d'Italia began with a large send off in the start city of Milan. The finish in Udine was hotly contested as five riders came to the finish line in a pack. Ernesto Azzini managed to out-sprint the other four riders in the leading group to win the stage. The next stage saw the first non-Italian stage winner in the history of the Giro d'Italia, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq. Dortignacq managed to breakaway from his fellow group member Carlo Galetti and then solo to the stage victory while five other riders chased close behind. Galetti's second-place finish on the stage was high enough for him to take the lead of the race. The French success enraged the Italian fans and led the competing riders to ban unite against the foreign riders. The third stage saw three major Italian riders, Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, and Eberardo Pavesi, and attack early on in the stage. The three riders then rode together all the way to the finish in Teramo. Galetti went on to win the stage, with Ganna and Pavesi following in quick succession.\nThe Giro's fourth stage saw a tough stage with poor conditions for the riders, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of many riders including the likes of Lucien Petit-Breton - who was ranked third overall at the time. The peloton's pace was slower due to the w poor conditions, which caused the riders to arrive two hours later than expected in Naples. Pierino Albini beat out the Frenchman Maurice Brocco by 36 seconds for stage victory. Prior to the fifth stage's start, Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq withdrew from the race after citing an illness. The police suspected foul play and looked into the situation, but their results are disputed through contradicting stories. Due to impassable roads, the start of the fifth stage was moved from Naples to Capua and decreased the distance of the stage from to . Eberardo Pavesi won the fifth stage after leading for most of the race.\nThe peloton remained intact for roughly the first half of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away from the pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.\nEberardo Pavesi dominated the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi went on to win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get back on his bike and finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 20 cyclists who had completed all ten stages. For these cyclists, the points they received from each of their stage placing's were added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated points was the winner. Ezio Corlaita won the prize for best ranked isolati rider in the general classification."

This was 1971 champ Charles Coody's final entry as a competitor; after struggling in his opening round to an 89, he played very well (at age 68) in round 2, carding a 2-over par 74 for his last competitive round at Augusta.\nAmateurs: McElhinney (+11), Molinari (+13), Ogden (+15), Dougherty (+16), Marsh (+16).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 8, 2006\"\n\"Sunday, April 9, 2006\"\nThunderstorms postponed a good chunk of action in the third round, forcing it to be completed on Sunday morning. Mickelson moved to the top of the leaderboard with a two-under 70 to 212 (−4). Second round leader Campbell shot 75 (+3) to fall into a tie for second with Couples, who shot even par for the round. Woods shot 71 for 214, two strokes back in a six-way tie for fourth, along with Singh and four others.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 9, 2006\"\nSummary.\nMickelson won his second consecutive major (2005 PGA Championship) and his second green jacket with a final round 69 for a two-stroke victory over Tim Clark. Mickelson's lone bogey was at the final hole, when he had victory all but assured. The win also gave him his third major in the last nine. Clark finished in solo second by holing-out from a green side bunker at the 72nd hole. Woods shot a two-under 70 to finish three strokes behind Mickelson in a five-way tie for third. Others finishing in third place were Couples, Goosen, Campbell, and José María Olazábal, the 1994 and 1999 champion, who shot the round of the tournament, a six-under 66. Sadly, Mediate fell out of contention after hitting three balls into the water and making a ten at the par-3 12th.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPar 3 Contest.\nBen Crane won the annual Par 3 contest, which took place on Wednesday, April 5, with a four-under 23. Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, made a curtain call at the event; Nicklaus was one-under and was in contention throughout the day. Pádraig Harrington, Clark, and Oberholser all aced the ninth hole."

Environmentalists criticised the project for the environmental damage the construction inflicted on the peninsula. A report by the Hong Kong Government agreed, claiming that the methods used for construction of the club and access roads resulted in \"unnecessary scars\". It also called the access roads a \"major eyesore visible over a wide area\". Members of the government's Environmental Protection Advisory Committee accused the club of having little regard for the environment.\nOn the morning of 4 November 1982 the club was attacked by six masked arsonists who assaulted a security guard and set a maintenance shed ablaze, destroying about $2 million worth of machinery, including tractors, buggies, and lawnmowers. The incident slightly delayed the club's opening. It eventually opened in December 1982. The first phase included a nine-hole course.\nHeavily indebted, the club opened when Hong Kong's economy was faltering due to fears over the 1997 handover to China. The club struggled to attract members, and went bankrupt in 1983 and closed. It reopened on 18 April 1984 after cutting staff levels and receiving a $6 million injection from a member. It began making a profit in 1985.\nThe club was accused of racial discrimination in 2018 after signage was posted barring domestic helpers from the poolside area.\nFacilities.\nAside from the golf course, the club has various other facilities including a driving range, putting green, gym, spa, outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, table-tennis room, badminton courts, squash courts, basketball court, football pitch, children's playground, and indoor playroom. It also has several dining venues and retail shops.\nMembership.\nNew members could buy into one of the six types of membership by purchasing units of the club's debenture after passing a very stringent character check. Price starts from little under HK$500,000 and could reach over HK$3,500,000. On top of that, members are required to pay additional subscription fee each year.\nType of membership:\nEvents.\nIt has hosted various local and international events and tournaments, such as the PGA Tour China Clearwater Bay Open, the World Amateur Team Championships, Hong Kong Tennis Champions Cup, and Sport for All Day."

        "title": "Art Howe (American football)",
        "text": "Arthur Howe (March 3, 1890 – March 28, 1955) was an American football player and coach, teacher, minister and university president. He played college football for Yale University from 1909 to 1911, was the quarterback of Yale's 1909 national championship team, and was a consensus first-team All-American in 1912. He was the head coach of the 1912 Yale football team. Howe was later ordained as a Presbyterian minister and taught at Eastern preparatory schools and at Dartmouth College. From 1930 to 1940, he was the president of Hampton University. He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973.\nEarly years.\nHowe was born in South Orange, New Jersey, in 1890. His father, Solomon Howe (born April 1856), was a Massachusetts native and was a wholesaler dealer of dry goods. His mother, Mable Rose (Almy) Howe (born September 1863), was a New York native. Howe played high school football at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey and at The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut.\nYale University.\nHowe enrolled at Yale University in 1908. He played for the Yale Bulldogs football team as a quarterback from 1909 to 1911. As a sophomore in 1909, Howe led the team to a perfect 10–0 record, as the Yale team outscored its opponents by a combined score of 209–0. At the end of the 1909 season, Howe was selected as a second-team All-American by Walter Camp. After another strong year in 1910, Howe was unanimously elected by his teammates as the captain of Yale's 1911 football team. As a senior, he set a collegiate record by returning 18 kicks in a November 1911 game against Princeton. After the 1911 season, Howe was selected as the first-team All-American quarterback by \"Collier's Weekly\" (as selected by Walter Camp), \"The New York Globe\", W.S. Farnsworth, Dr. Henry L. Williams, and Charles Chadwick.\nWhile attending Yale, Howe was, according to profile in the \"Boston Daily Globe\", also a leader in religious life at the university, the strongest man in his class, an excellent scholar, and one of the best hockey players in college.\nAt the end of December 1911, Howe agreed to return in the fall of 1912 as the school's head football coach, after graduating with Yale's Class of 1912. In his one year as head coach, Howe led the 1912 Yale football team to a 7–1–1 record, with the only loss coming against that year's national championship team from Harvard.\nDuring the period from 1899 to 1912, Yale had 14 different head football coaches in 14 years – despite compiling a combined record of 127–11–10 in those years. During that 14-year span, the Yale football team has also been recognized as the national championship team by one or more of the major national championship selectors on seven occasions – 1900 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis), 1901 (Parke Davis), 1902 (Parke Davis), 1905 (Parke Davis, Whitney), 1906 (Billingsley, Parke Davis, Whitney), 1907 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, Whitney), and 1909 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis).\nSeminary and teaching career.\nAfter leaving Yale, Howe enrolled at the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. He graduated from the seminary in 1916 and became a Presbyterian minister.\nIn June 1916, Howe was hired as a teacher and coach at the Loomis Institute (now known as The Loomis Chaffee School) in Windsor, Connecticut. In a draft registration card completed in June 1917, Howe indicated that he was living in Windsor, Connecticut, and was employed as the chaplain at the Loomis Institute.\nIn 1918, Howe was the head football coach at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.\nIn approximately 1920, Howe left the Loomis School and joined the faculty of the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. Howe was a teacher and the chaplain at the Taft School through most of the 1920s. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, Howe was living in Watertown with his wife Margaret and their two children. Howe's occupation at the time was listed as a professor at the Taft School.\nAfter leaving the Taft School, Howe became a professor of citizenship at Dartmouth College. He remained at Dartmouth from approximately 1929 to 1930. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Howe was living in Hanover, New Hampshire, with his wife Margaret and their daughter and four sons. His occupation was listed as a minister and teacher at Dartmouth College.\nHampton Institute.\nIn November 1930, Howe was selected as the president of Hampton Institute (now known as Hampton University), a historically black university in Hampton, Virginia. The university had been founded by Howe's father-in-law, Gen. Samuel Chapman Armstrong, in 1869. He served as the president at Hampton for nearly a decade. In the last couple years of his administration, Howe faced increasing agitation from students and alumni seeking reforms, including an increase in African-American faculty representation and equal pay for African-American faculty members. Howe resigned as Hampton's president effective June 1940. Howe's wife, Margaret Armstrong Howe, continued to serve as a trustee of Hampton until her death in 1971.\nLater years.\nFrom 1940 to 1949, Howe was the managing director of the Welfare Federation of the Oranges and Maplewood in New Jersey. In a draft registration card completed in 1942, Howe indicated that he was living with his wife Margaret in East Orange, New Jersey, and that he was employed by the Welfare Federation. He also served as chairman of the Tilton, New Hampshire School for Wayward Boys.\nFamily, death and posthumous honors.\nIn August 1916, Howe was married to Margaret Marshall Armstrong in a ceremony held at the Chocorua Chapel on Chocorua Island in Lake Asquam, near Chocorua, New Hampshire. They had a daughter (Alice) and four sons (Harold, Arthur, Jr., Richard and Sydney).\nIn 1955, Howe died after a short illness at Sceva Speare Memorial Hospital in Plymouth, New Hampshire.\nHe was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973."

        "text": "Timothy J. Kennedy (born April 30, 1986) is an American former professional ice hockey forward, who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Buffalo Sabres, Florida Panthers, San Jose Sharks and the Phoenix Coyotes.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nKennedy played several years of his youth career with the Buffalo Regals, where he led the team with future Michigan State University teammate Chris Mueller. He also attended Bishop Timon - St. Jude High School. He played for several years on the Western Division's hockey team in the Empire State Games where his teams won gold in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, Kennedy was offered a contract with the Ontario Hockey League, but declined because he would have been unable to play NCAA college hockey. He was later drafted by the Sioux City Musketeers, a team in the United States Hockey League. Kennedy was actively recruited by major college hockey programs including Colorado College, Ohio State, and Boston College, ultimately accepting a scholarship to Michigan State, where he was a member of 2007 NCAA Championship team. He contributed one goal in the championship game against Boston College and assisted Justin Abdelkader's game-winning goal.\nProfessional.\nKennedy was drafted in the sixth round, 181st overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals but was traded to the Buffalo Sabres the same day in exchange for Buffalo's sixth-round draft pick in 2006 (Mathieu Perreault).\nOn June 1, 2008, Kennedy signed a two-year entry-level contract with the Sabres. He spent the beginning of the 2008–09 season playing for the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League (AHL). On December 27, 2008, the Sabres called him up from Portland, giving him the opportunity to play his first NHL game in his hometown in Buffalo. The game was a shoot-out win over the New York Islanders.\nKennedy played the entire 2009–10 season in Buffalo, scoring 10 goals and 16 assists, for 26 total points in 78 games in the regular season, plus 1 goal and 2 assists in 6 playoff games. Kennedy's entry-level contract expired at the end of the season, resulting in a contract dispute with the Sabres. In arbitration, Kennedy was awarded a $1,000,000 contract. On August 2, the Sabres waived Kennedy. Kennedy cleared waivers the next day, at which point Buffalo bought out Kennedy's contract for $333,333. The reported monetary difference between Kennedy's request and the Sabres' contract offer before arbitration was $50,000.\nOn August 30, 2010, Kennedy signed a one-year contract with the New York Rangers for a reported $550,000. At the start of the season and no room on the Rangers roster, Kennedy was waived again, on October 5, and was then sent to the Rangers' AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, on October 13. On February 26, 2011, Kennedy was traded by the Rangers along with a third round pick to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Bryan McCabe.\nOn January 26, 2012, he was traded by Florida to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Sean Sullivan.\nThe following year, on July 11, 2013, Kennedy signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way deal with the Phoenix Coyotes. In the 2013–14 season, Kennedy appeared in 37 games for the Coyotes, his most in the NHL since 2010. As a depth forward, he contributed from the lower lines with 2 goals and 8 points.\nOn July 3, 2014, Kennedy continued his journeyman career by signing a one-year, two-way deal with the Washington Capitals, his original draft team. He was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears for the duration of the 2014–15 season, featuring in the AHL All-Star game and posting 59 points in 75 games.\nOn June 3, 2015, Kennedy signed a one-year contract with Russian club, HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the 2015–16 season. Kennedy described the experience in Nizhnekamsk as a poor fit for him; he was unable to adapt to the coaching regimen and the city's strict military environment, which prevented him from bringing his family to Russia, and partway through the 2015–16 KHL season, the club bought out his contract. He finished the season playing for Helsinki-based Jokerit, which he considered a much more pleasant experience; he intended to return to North America for the 2016–17 season, most likely in the AHL, but eventually moved to Sweden, signing a one-year deal with Luleå HF of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) on July 21, 2016. On December 15, 2016, he parted ways with the club, due to a combination of injuries and the birth of his son back in the United States. He was released from his contract in December 2016 and was claimed on waivers by the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL. The Checkers, after conversing with Kennedy, then dropped their claim and allowed Kennedy to sign with the Rochester Americans, allowing him to be closer to his family.\nOn October 5, 2017, after a successful try-out Kennedy was signed to a one-year AHL contract with the Binghamton Devils for the 2017–18 season.\nInternational play.\nTim Kennedy was named to the Team USA roster for the 2010 World Championships in Germany. Team USA finished 13th out of 16 teams, with Kennedy scoring one goal and no assists in six games."

        "title": "Kermesse (cycling)",
        "text": "A kermesse, also spelled kermess, and kermis in Dutch is a style of road bicycle race that is common in Western Europe. Typically kermesse races are found in Belgium, especially in the northern Flanders region, where they are the most popular style of amateur bicycle race. They also exist in the Netherlands. The bicycle race borrows the name from the kermesse festival where the bicycle race is often held on the same day as a town festival, though not always.\nThese amateur races are usually 90 to 140 kilometers in length. While some are longer or shorter, most are about 120 kilometers. The race is a set distance and number of laps over the established course. There are typically 10 to 20 laps, of between 5 and 10 kilometers. There are also professional races, which are longer, 150 to 180 km, with a circuit length of not less than 10 km. The race usually begins and ends in the center of the town which is hosting the day's race. The race will occupy the roads in town as well as the roads surrounding, either city streets or farmland.\nThe course usually has a rolling enclosure. This means that while the race is not passing through, the streets are open to traffic. A designated car, usually with a caution sign and a red flag, leads the riders and close the cross streets to traffic. A following car, usually with signs and a green flag, open the streets back up to traffic.\nThese events are usually amateur races (professionals are not allowed) and classified as UCI 1.12B, though there are also professional only races. To enter the race one must hold a license with a governing cycling body of their country or with the Union Cycliste Internationale. Most kermesse races in Belgium are overseen by Wielerbond Vlaanderen. Registration for the races is typically 3 euro with a 5-euro deposit for the race number. The race number must be returned after the race to get one's deposit back.\nThere is usually a pay out of 670 euro or 800 euro. Traditionally the 670 euro race will pay out 35 deep and the 800 euro race will pay out 50 deep. Some races have greater or less payout. Within the event there are often special prizes awarded during certain laps of the race, known as primes. The primes are usually cash awards, but sometimes will be other things like a bicycle.\nThe kermesse is similar to the criterium but differs in having a longer course length and longer lap length. While a criterium traditionally lasts 60–90 minutes, a kermesse will often take 120–180 minutes. A single lap in a criterium is usually less than 5 kilometers while the kermesse is usually 5-10 kilometers per lap."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on regional sports networks",
        "text": "Major League Baseball games not broadcast exclusively by its media partners are televised by regional sports networks, which present sports programming of interest to their respective region. Most MLB broadcasters are members of chains such as NBC Sports Regional Networks and Bally Sports, although several teams are broadcast by regional networks that are independent of these chains. Some teams own partial or majority stakes in their regional broadcaster.\nRegionally broadcast MLB games are subject to blackouts; games from outside of a viewer's designated market are blacked out to protect the local team. In addition, certain national regular season telecasts on ESPN, FS1, and TBS are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games may be blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.\nAmerican League.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nWhen the Montreal Expos were relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2004, the issue arose regarding television rights for the new franchise. Since at least 1981, Major League Baseball had designated the Baltimore Orioles television territory to extend from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe Orioles agreed to share its territory with the Nationals in return for the ability to present the Nationals games on the Orioles television network, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. The Orioles have a 90 percent stake in MASN and MLB paid the Orioles $75 million for 10 percent of the regional sports network. When the Lerner family bought the Nationals in July 2006 they became part owners in MASN. Over the next 23 years, the Washington Nationals’ stake in the network will increase to 33 percent. Under the current arrangement, MASN paid the Nationals $20 million to broadcast their games in 2005.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBoston Red Sox baseball coverage began in 1984 on the New England Sports Network, airing mostly road games on the newly formed pay cable channel. Former Sox second baseman Kent Derdivanis served as the play-by-play announcer and Mike Andrews provided color commentary. NESN periodically sent guest color commentators to the booth, with the likes of Rico Petrocelli, Bill Monbouquette, and Dick Radatz. The in-studio host was a young man just out of Syracuse University named Sean McDonough.\nFast-forwarding 24 years later, NESN now carries full coverage (minus some nationally broadcast games on FOX and ESPN) of Red Sox games as well as in-depth pre- and post-game shows. Unlike previous seasons where it split coverage with over-the-air stations, it now broadcasts all games not on national television, using the slogan \"One Nation, One Network\". In 2006, it became the first network to broadcast all its Major League Baseball team's games in high definition, available to cable providers throughout New England, DirecTV, AT&amp;T U-Verse (in CT) and Verizon FIOS (in MA). Dish Network only provides NESN in HD during live Red Sox, Boston Bruins, Hartford Colonials (UFL), as of 2010, and College Hockey games, most notably The Beanpot (Ice Hockey) Tournament.\nChicago White Sox.\nIn October 2004, FSN Chicago lost broadcast rights to all of the professional sports teams in the Chicago area when the owners of the Bulls, White Sox, Blackhawks, and Cubs decided to end their agreement with the network and partnered with Comcast to form Comcast SportsNet Chicago. This led to a number of cable/satellite providers dropping the network. With the end of local pro sports coverage, FSN Chicago became mostly a feeder channel of the national network's entire schedule, some minor local and semi-pro teams, Midwestern outdoors programs, and sports rights and games from other college conferences of little interest to Chicago area viewers. In 2005, Cablevision bought all of FSN Chicago when NewsCorp swapped assets with the cable company.\nThe White Sox also shared broadcast television rights with the Cubs on WGN-TV since 1948. Starting with the 2020 season, NBC Sports Chicago (originally CSN Chicago) will have exclusive rights to regionally-aired White Sox games.\nCleveland Guardians.\nCleveland Guardians regional games are currently held by Bally Sports Great Lakes. The network was originally founded in 2006 by the Dolan family as Sportstime Ohio, which was later purchased by Fox Sports Networks in 2012 before Diamond Sports Group took over ownership in 2020. It operated as a separate business venture, it can be compared to the New York Yankees' YES Network, as both were started primarily to broadcast each team's games. However they differ in that YES is owned by a holding company that also owns the Yankees, whereas STO was a venture separate from the Guardians that is directly owned by Larry Dolan, Cleveland Guardians owner.\nThirty minutes before each Guardians game, Bally Sports Great Lakes airs \"Guardians Live,\" a pre-game show hosted by Al Pawlowski. It features highlights from the previous game, a preview of the upcoming game, and news from around baseball.\nDetroit Tigers.\nPASS Sports was started by Tom Monaghan in 1984, who at the time also owned the Detroit Tigers. In 1992, Monaghan sold the Tigers to Mike Ilitch and PASS was sold to Post-Newsweek Stations and merged with the Post's Detroit television station WDIV (Detroit's NBC affiliate).\nFollowing the purchase, PASS moved its studios and offices from Ann Arbor, MI to WDIV's in Detroit. PASS became available on basic cable, (under Monaghan it was a premium cable network). Post-Newsweek made the station 24-hours, (under Monaghan it only airing in the evening and on weekends).\nFox Sports Detroit was launched as a competitor to PASS in 1996. After a surprise bid in 1996 to pick up the rights to the Detroit Pistons, Fox Sports Detroit began planning to launch their network two years later.\nWhen Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers rights were up for bid, Fox Sports Detroit decided to accelerate their launch date by bidding and winning the rights to the Red Wings beginning with the 1997–98 season and the Tigers beginning in 1998. The Washington Post Company, the parent company of Post-Newsweek Stations sold the remaining year (1998) of the Tigers, Pistons contracts and the contract of broadcaster John Keating to Fox Sports Detroit. In 2021, the network was rebranded to Bally Sports Detroit and is currently the exclusive local home of the Detroit Tigers.\nHouston Astros.\nHome Sports Entertainment was home of the Houston Astros from its inception in 1983 until the mid-1990s, when the network became part of the Prime Sports Networks. Prime Sports Southwest lasted only two years before its parent company was purchased by News Corporation and renamed Fox Sports Southwest. In 2005, a sub-feed of Fox Sports Southwest was formed, called Fox Sports Houston, which focused on Houston-based teams including the Astros. In January 2009, Fox Sports Houston broke away from its parent network and became a stand-alone network, however that network became defunct when the Astros and Rockets teams purchased a majority ownership in the new regional sports network Comcast SportsNet Houston, and moved their programming there. In 2014, DirecTV and AT&amp;T acquired Comcast SportsNet Houston out of bankruptcy and was eventually rebranded as AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest (formerly Root Sports Southwest).\nOn September 29, 2023, the Astros and the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association purchased AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest from Warner Bros. Discovery Sports and renamed it the Space City Home Network.\nKansas City Royals.\nSports Time was a regional sports network in the United States. It was owned by Anheuser-Busch and was launched on April 2, 1984.\nThe new network was a way for Anheuser-Busch to show additional games of the St. Louis Cardinals, the Major League Baseball team it owned at the time. Games of the Cincinnati Reds and Kansas City Royals baseball teams, the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, and various college sports teams also aired on the network.\nSports Time showed Reggie Jackson's 500th career home run on September 17, 1984. The Royals were playing the California Angels in Anaheim, California that night.\nAfter a season of obvious frustration, Anheuser-Busch pulled the plug on Sports Time at the end of March 1985. Today, the Cardinals and Reds are shown on Fox Sports Net in their respective regions, Midwest and Ohio. Beginning with the 2008 season, Fox Sports Kansas City will show most Royals games. For the first season, 140 games are scheduled to be aired. In 2021, Fox Sports Kansas City rebranded itself as Bally Sports Kansas City. The Blues are also shown on FSN Midwest.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nIn 1990, Prime Ticket became the cable television home of the California Angels, as well as serving as the cable home of the Clippers for one season (1990–91), before they moved to the now-defunct SportsChannel Los Angeles (originally Z Channel) the following season. Angels games are currently shown on Bally Sports West. One other local network showing the Angels games is the over-the-air MY 13 Los Angeles network, or KCOP-TV Los Angeles.\nMinnesota Twins.\nThe Minnesota Twins baseball team launched Victory Sports One as a cable and satellite television regional sports network in October 2003. Victory Sports, of course, became the exclusive TV home of Twins games; in addition, it planned coverage of various Minnesota college and high school games. The channel also simulcast ESPNEWS.\nThe Twins opted to retain the local broadcast rights for game broadcasts after the 2003 season, in order to carry the games on their own network, after carriage for many years on Midwest Sports Channel (currently Bally Sports North). The model for the plan was the success of the New York Yankees' YES Network.\nHowever Victory Sports was unable to obtain carriage from the primary cable television providers in the Twin Cities, the rest of the state of Minnesota, and the Dakotas, or from DirecTV or Dish Network. During the 2004 season, the Twins quickly re-signed with FSN North to placate viewers inconvenienced by the change.\nNew York Yankees.\nBetween 1989 and 2001, the MSG Network was the cable home of the New York Yankees. MSG paid an average of $55 million a year for those rights, and the deal is widely credited as having started a national trend towards greater team coverage on regional sports networks, with more games being broadcast than over-the-air stations' regular programming schedules could usually permit. MSG also produced the Yankees radio broadcasts from 1994 to 2001, which aired on WABC. MSG also owned the over the air broadcast rights to Yankee games, which they sold to long-time broadcaster WPIX from 1989 to 1998 and WNYW from 1999 to 2001 (at the time, News Corporation owned part of MSG). In 2002, the Yankees left MSG to form the YES Network. From 2002 to 2005, MSG aired games from Major League Baseball's New York Mets on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, games which previously aired on FSNY (MSG, FSNY, and WPIX each carried about 50 games a season on consistent days of the week). Like the Yankee deals, Cablevision also owned the broadcast TV rights, placing games on WWOR-TV before moving to WPIX in 1999. After the 2005 baseball season, Mets games moved to SportsNet New York, a cable network partially owned by the Mets, although WPIX retained a reduced slate of games. Comcast and Time Warner, which generally control whatever NYC-area cable systems Cablevision doesn't (Time Warner controls most of Upstate New York as well), are the other partners. From 2002 onward, games started airing on the newer YES Network.\nSeattle Mariners.\nRoot Sports Northwest is the regional carrier of the Seattle Mariners, televising their games in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and parts of Idaho and Montana.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nBally Sports Sun is the regional TV home of the Tampa Bay Rays.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nAs the Blue Jays are the only MLB team in Canada, the entire country is considered the regional territory of the Toronto Blue Jays. Blue Jays games are broadcast by Sportsnet, owned by team owner Rogers Communications. Although the main Sportsnet service is operated as a set of regional sports networks, all games are broadcast nationally, and the regionalized feeds are primarily used for NHL regional blackouts only. Under Labatt ownership, the team was broadcast by TSN, which was previously co-owned with the team. The network continued to sub-license a package of Blue Jays games from Rogers until the 2010 season, when Sportsnet became the exclusive broadcaster of all Blue Jays games. Both Sportsnet and TSN air packages of U.S. games, coming from other regional sports networks and ESPN respectively. TVA Sports provides French-language coverage of selected games.\nIn addition, in the past some Blue Jays games were televised nationally on Canadian over-the-air networks, namely CBC and CTV. During their existence, Blue Jays games were sometimes blacked out in Quebec to protect the Montreal Expos. Some over-the-air games were blacked out in Windsor to protect the Detroit Tigers.\nNational League.\nChicago Cubs.\nChicago Cubs games are split between three broadcasters; Comcast SportsNet Chicago (owned by a consortium of NBCUniversal, and the Bulls, White Sox, Blackhawks, and Cubs—and displacing FSN Chicago in 2004), WGN Sports (whose games are split between WGN-TV and WPWR-TV), and WLS-TV. Some Cubs games on WGN were seen nationally via sister network WGN America (formerly Superstation WGN), although this was discontinued as part of its transition to a general entertainment cable network. Due to licensing by the CRTC, the WGN feed that is seen in Chicago is also available in Canada on some Digital Cable/Satellite providers, meaning some Cubs games can be seen despite Canada being considered the home territory of the Toronto Blue Jays. Games televised by WGN Sports or WLS-TV are syndicated by a network of affiliated stations within the team's territory.\nBeginning with the 2020 season, Cubs games will air on the new Marquee Sports Network, a regional sports network founded and operated by the Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group.\nColorado Rockies.\nFrom 1993 to 1996, the Rockies were without a cable television affiliate. That changed, when FSN Rocky Mountain acquired the regional cable rights in 1997, and the team has aired most of its games on that network since then, sharing some of its games with KWGN (1997–2002) and KTVD-My 20 (2003–2008). Starting in 2009, FSN Rocky Mountain (later Root Sports and then AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain) became the exclusive TV outlet for the Rockies. In 2023, AT&amp;T announced its exit of the RSN business, leading to the shuttering of AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain and the MLB taking over the Rockies' TV broadcast starting in 2024.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nGames are presented on Spectrum SportsNet LA and have been since 2014. The Dodgers own 50% of the channel in association with Charter Communications. Prior to September 2016, the channel was known as Time Warner Cable Sportsnet LA before the acquisition of Time Warner Cable by Charter Communications.\nThis arrangement has not been without controversy due to carriage disputes with other major cable providers leaving many unable to see the games in the Los Angeles area.\nFrom January 1997 to September 2013, Fox Sports Net West 2 (later renamed Fox Sports Prime Ticket, now simply called Prime Ticket) was formed to serve as a cable home for the Clippers, Dodgers, Ducks, and all other events that FSN West didn't have room for. This is after the December 1993 shut-down of SportsChannel Los Angeles, which left their home teams with only over-the-air and part-time cable coverage locally.\nMiami Marlins.\nFrom 1993 to 2005, the Marlins Television Network aired games to homes not only in South Florida but to other parts of Florida. The network was produced by the same crew that telecast Marlins games on cable television. When FSN Florida (now Bally Sports Florida) signed an exclusive long-term deal for Marlins baseball starting in the 2006 season, that signaled the end of the Marlins Television Network as a majority of those telecasts would air on Sun Sports.\nNew York Mets.\nSportsNet New York (SNY) is a New York City-based sports cable network which airs in the New York metro area and all of New York state, and nationwide via satellite. It is owned jointly by the New York Mets, Time Warner, and Comcast.\nSNY will carry 120 Mets games during 2007 season (with the remainder airing on WPIX, Fox, and ESPN). Bill Webb, who directs the World Series and the All-Star Game for Fox, is the director for Mets broadcasts on both SNY and WPIX.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nCSN Philadelphia was the very first Comcast Sportsnet and broadcasts the Comcast-owned Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia Flyers, along with the Philadelphia Phillies.\nCSN Philadelphia debuted on October 1, 1997, replacing the old PRISM Network in the Philadelphia area. The Phillies own a minority share of the channel.\nCSN Philadelphia's studios and offices are located inside the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. CSN Philadelphia also has a small studio inside Citizens Bank Park, which is used sporadically during the baseball season.\nIn addition, Comcast owns The Comcast Network, which on occasion will air Phillies games in the Philadelphia metro area when a Flyers or 76ers game airs on CSN Philadelphia. WPHL-TV also carries a slate of games from each team. WPSG formerly carried Phillies games, but WPHL-TV took broadcasting rights in 2009.\nIn 2017, Comcast SportsNet was rebranded under the NBC Sports name (this in conjunction to Comcast's 2011 acquisition and integration of NBCUniversal) and CSN Philadelphia was renamed NBC Sports Philadelphia. TCN subsequently became NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus.\nSan Diego Padres.\nBally Sports San Diego (formerly Fox Sports San Diego) was the regional broadcaster of the Padres from 2012 until May 30, 2023, taking over from 4SD, a local cable channel owned by Cox Communications.\nBecause Diamond Sports Group, majority owners of Bally Sports San Diego, failed to make a payment to the Padres on May 30, 2023, MLB took over broadcasts of Padres games effective May 31. This is the first team for which the league has taken over broadcasting.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nBetween 1984 and 1989, the Cardinals aired 50 games a season, first on Sports Time (1984), then on pay-per-view on Cencom. After being off cable television for four seasons (1990–93), the Cardinals returned to the cable airwaves in 1994 through Prime Sports Midwest, which became FSN Midwest in November 1996. The Cardinals have been on FSN Midwest since then. The Cardinals will again air 130 regular-season games on FSN Midwest in 2010, with the other 32 on either ESPN, Fox or NBC affiliate KSDK-TV 5. For many seasons, Joe Buck and Al Hrabosky were the commentators, but Dan McLaughlin has since replaced Buck, who called MLB and NFL games for Fox-TV until 2022 when he moved to ESPN as the voice of \"Monday Night Football\". As of 2023, Chip Caray, calls TV play-by-play for the Cardinals on the since-rebranded Bally Sports Midwest.\nWashington Nationals.\nWhen the Montreal Expos were relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2004, the issue arose regarding television rights for the new franchise. Since at least 1981, Major League Baseball had designated the Baltimore Orioles television territory to extend from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe Orioles agreed to share its territory with the Nationals in return for the ability to present the Nationals games on the Orioles television network, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. The Orioles have a 90 percent stake in MASN and MLB paid the Orioles $75 million for 10 percent of the regional sports network. When the Lerner family bought the Nationals in July 2006 they became part owners in MASN. Over the next 23 years, the Washington Nationals’ stake in the network will increase to 33 percent. Under the current arrangement, MASN paid the Nationals $20 million to broadcast their games in 2005.\nOnline streaming of local games.\nUntil 2020, all in-market streaming rights for each team were controlled by Major League Baseball.\nFor a period, the Yankees and Padres streamed their regional games online through subscription services, but as of the 2015 season, only the Toronto Blue Jays offered in-market streaming of their games to authenticated subscribers of the team's broadcaster within its designated market (Sportsnet also sells access to its networks, and these games, as an over-the-top subscription service). Regional games were not available on TV Everywhere services such as Fox Sports Go or the NBC Sports app, and in-market streaming is not available via MLB.tv because games are always blacked out for in-market teams.\nCurrent commissioner Rob Manfred stated in an April 2015 interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\" that MLB planned to finalize a plan to allow in-market streaming of regional games \"some time this year\". Major League Baseball and representatives of its regional broadcasters have attempted to negotiate how in-market streaming for U.S. teams would operate, including whether digital rights to regional games would be centralized and held by an exclusive partner, and whether local rightsholders would be able to distribute the telecasts through their own services and apps, or whether all in-market games would have to be offered through existing MLB apps. Providers objected to having in-market streaming be MLB-controlled, as they would gain access to users' credentials.\nAs of the 2016 Major League Baseball season, Fox reached a three-year deal to offer in-market streaming of its 15 teams to authenticated subscribers of the corresponding Fox Sports Networks. Fox pays a digital rights fee for each team, and the streams are managed by MLB Advanced Media but delivered through the existing Fox Sports Go applications. Wider adoption began to spread in the 2017 season, with NBC Sports Regional Networks and SportsNet New York (via the NBC Sports app), Root Sports (now AT&amp;T SportsNet in most markets), and NESN launching in-market streaming of their local teams. Only three teams—the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals (who share MASN as their rightsholder), and the Los Angeles Dodgers, do not offer in-market streaming.\nAs of the 2020 season, MLB's owners voted unanimously to revert ownership of \"certain in-market digital rights\" to the teams themselves. Commissioner Manfred stated that digital streaming had become \"substitutional with broadcast rights\", and that these changes would allow teams more flexibility in selling their digital rights in the future. However, such arrangements may still be subject to negotiations with existing regional rightsholders.\n2023 developments.\nOn February 15, 2023, Diamond Sports Group, which operates the Bally Sports networks and which holds the television rights to 14 of MLB's 30 clubs, did not pay a $140 million debt payment on time. Commissioner Manfred said at a press conference before the 2023 season that he hoped that MLB could make broadcasts available for all teams available via MLB.tv, without local blackouts, in the event that regional sports networks are unable to provide coverage. On March 14, Diamond Sports Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in an attempt to restructure its debt.\nOn February 24, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which operates three AT&amp;T SportsNet channels and has a minority stake in Root Sports Northwest, informed teams and leagues that it intends to exit the regional sports network business, focusing instead on its national broadcasts of the NBA on TNT and the NHL on TNT. AT&amp;T SportsNet networks told the Rockies, Astros, and Pirates that they do not have the money to make scheduled rights fee payments, and gave each team until March 31 to negotiate deals to take their television rights back. The president of AT&amp;T SportsNet told \"The Seattle Times\" that Root Sports Northwest was unaffected by WBD's announcement, as the Mariners themselves have owned a majority stake in the channel since 2013.\nIn response to the potential loss of broadcasters for 17 of its teams, the MLB created a new local media department and hired Doug Johnson as senior vice president and executive producer of local media, Greg Pennell as senior VP of local media, and Kendall Burgess as VP of local media technical operations. Johnson had worked for AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Pennell and Burgess were previously employees of Bally Sports.\nOn May 30, the MLB announced that it would take over Padres broadcasts starting the following day, after Bally Sports San Diego failed to make payments to the team during a grace period. The Padres are the first team for which the MLB will produce all regional telecasts. On July 18, following Bally Sports Arizona's failure to make payments to the Arizona Diamondbacks on a similar grace period, the MLB decided to take over for all regional telecasts of Diamondbacks games for at least the rest of the 2023 regular season."

        "text": "The 1950 Giro d'Italia was the 33rd edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started in Milan on 24 May with a individual time trial and concluded in Salsomaggiore Terme with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 13 June. Fifteen teams entered the race, which was won by Swiss Hugo Koblet of the Guerra team. Second and third respectively were Italians Gino Bartali and Alfredo Martini.\nTeams.\nIt was announced in January 1950 that there would not be more than 100 riders starting the race. However, fifteen teams of seven were granted entry for the race. This meant the starting peloton consisted of 105 cyclists, the same amount that started the 1949 edition. Italians comprised the majority of the entrants (88), while the remaining 17 foreign riders were from France (9), Switzerland (5), Belgium (2), and Luxembourg (1). Of the starting riders, 75 completed the course.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe race featured three previous winners of the Giro d'Italia that later became known as the \"Big Three\" or \"Italian Tripod\": Gino Bartali (), Fausto Coppi (), and Fiorenzo Magni (). That season the three of them had success in the classics as Bartali won Milan–San Remo, Coppi won Paris–Roubaix and La Flèche Wallonne, and Magni won his second Tour of Flanders. Despite this, many writers and fellow riders like Magni, Jean Robic, and Giulio Bresci still viewed it as a competition between Coppi and Bartali, with Coppi was regarded as the favorite entering the race. When asked who was his toughest opponent in the race, Coppi answered Bartali and Robic.\nA \"Nouvelliste valaisan\" writer commented that this was the first Giro to feature foreigners as team captains. 1947 Tour de France winner Robic (), Fritz Schär (), and Ferdinand Kübler () entered as sole leaders of their respective squads. 's leader upon entry was Belgian Marcel Dupont, while teammate Hugo Koblet's recent form made some believe he may end up leading the team during the race. \"El Mundo Deportivo\"'s Luis Bettonica felt that for either Bartali or Coppi to not win they will have to face a large amount of difficulties. Vito Ortelli () was not viewed as a serious challenger following a poor performance at the Tour de Romandie and due to his general inconsistent finishes. Ortelli when asked about his intentions at the Giro, replied \"I will be running it.\" Kübler was seen as a threat to challenge Bartali and Coppi because his team was strong and had openly stated he would be in good form when the race hits Locarno. The French team () featured Apo Lazaridès and Lucien Teisseire, who placed second and third at the 1948 world championships, respectively. brought sprinter Adolfo Leoni who won several stages and wore the race leader's pink jersey late into the last year's race before Coppi took the race lead with two stages left and young rider Pasquale Fornara. 's Luciano Maggini was seen as a contender for the sprint finishes, while Alfredo Martini and Giancarlo Astrua were expected to achieve high final rankings in the general classification. \"l'Unità\" writer Attilio Camoriano expected Martini to be the \"big surprise of the race.\"\nRoute and stages.\nBefore being released, it was rumored the race would go from 24 May to 11 June. The route was revealed on 26 January 1950. The route was thought to be easier than in previous years, with the first several stages being fairly easy before the seventh stage introduced climbs over . The ninth stage in particular featured the three major climbs of Passo Rolle (), Passo Pordoi (), Gardena Pass (). In total the route was thought to be very flat as it contained of climbing.\nIn a break from tradition the race started in Milan rather than finishing in . This change was precipitated because 1950 was declared a Jubilee by Pope Pius XII. Due to the route changes, this meant the Dolomites would be visited during the middle of the race, while the Apennines would be traversed near the race's conclusion. Following the Milan opening in the Piazza del Duomo square, the race route veered west passing through Florence and Genoa on its way into the Dolomites and passing through finishing in Locarno, a Swiss town. Then the route turned south and traveled down along the Adriatic coast and traversed the Apennines before returning north to finish in Rome.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and subtracting time bonuses – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nTwo additional jerseys were awarded. The green jersey was given to the highest ranked non-Italian cyclist in the general classification, and the white jersey was given to the highest ranked independent cyclist in the general classification. Another green jersey was awarded to the best placed foreign rider in the general classification.\nThere were also some classifications without associated jerseys. There was the mountains classification, for which the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThere was a black jersey (maglia nera) awarded to the rider placed last in the general classification. The classification was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nSecondly, there was an intermediate sprints classification. In twelve stages, there were intermediate sprints midway of the stage, where points for this classification could be won.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nThere several time bonuses awarded to riders for various accomplishments during the race.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run. A one-minute bonus was given to the winner of each stage, the intermediate sprint in the twelve stages containing a sprint, and the winner of a mountain classification climb. Second place in those same categories awarded a 30 s time bonus.\nFinal standings.\nMinor awards.\nTwo blue bracelets were awarded for winning a stage with the greatest time gap between the second placed rider. Koblet won the first bracelet for winning the sixth stage into Locarno by 1' 48s, while the second bracelet was given to Astrua for his victory on the fifteenth leg that finished in L'Aquila. He won that stage by five minutes and six seconds. A classification was kept regarding the amount of stage victories per rider. The classification was split by four riders who each won two stages: Conte (stages 1 and 18), Bevilacqua (stages 4 and 12), Koblet (stages, and 8), and Luciano Maggini (stages 7 and 13).\nAftermath.\nFollowing the race, the entire peloton that finished the race traveled to St. Peter's Basilica to hear a Wednesday service by Pope Pius XII on 14 June. In particular, Koblet and Bartali spoke with the Pope personally and the Pope asked of Coppi's health. Previous winner Fausto Coppi, who was recovering in a Trento hospital, commented \"Koblet deserved to win the Tour of Italy and he is worthy of all praise.\" Following the race, Guerra announced Koblet renewed his contract with the team. A Swiss newspaper writer \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" wrote that the Swiss riders dominated the race, holding the race lead for all but two days, and all five Swiss riders that started, finished the race. The writer commented that Koblet was not seen as the initial leader for Guerra, as Marcel Dupont entered as their leader. The writer also felt that Koblet's victory earned Swiss cycling respect within the cycling community and may lead to an invitation for a ten-man team to a future Tour de France – which at the time was contested by national teams rather than trade teams. Ferdinand Kübler was viewed to have a great race relative when compared to his last Grand Tour, the 1949 Tour de France. Based on his high finish Kübler was expected to seriously contend at the upcoming Tour de France. Had the race been run without time bonuses factored into the general classification, Bartali would have won the race by 18 seconds over Koblet."

These riders are generally sprinters or domestiques unconcerned about their finishing positions in the mountain stages. Their primary concern is beating the elimination time to ensure their survival in a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France. As such they are amongst the best descenders, pushing to make up enough time to stay in the race.\nIf the autobus arrives outside the elimination time, the organisers may extend the elimination time if the autobus is larger than 20% of the riders. However, if a rider is dropped from the autobus in this situation they will almost certainly be eliminated unless they have suffered an accident, in which case they may be exempted. The elimination time varies depending on the organisers; in the Tour de France there are differing coefficients depending on the difficulty of the stage. These coefficients are a percentage of the stage winner's time. \nDue to the common interest in survival, the mood in the autobus often has a greater sense of camaraderie than in the main peloton. Riders often assist one another with food and drinks despite riding for separate teams. It is sometimes referred to as \"the laughing group\". Over the years there have been many riders who have become well-known for taking control of the group, shepherding the group over the line, including Eros Poli and Bernhard Eisel. "

        "text": "Thomas J. Davies (October 14, 1896 – February 29, 1972) was an American football player and coach. He played as a halfback at the University of Pittsburgh and was a consensus All-American in 1918 and 1920. After retiring as a player, Davies worked as a football coach for the next 26 years, including stints at the University of Pennsylvania, Geneva College, Allegheny College, the University of Rochester, the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the University of Scranton, and Western Reserve University. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1970.\nPlaying career.\nDavies was a native of Gas City, Indiana. He moved to Washington, Pennsylvania when he was 11 years old. Davies played high school football at Aliquippa High School in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, and at The Kiski School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. Davies was working in a Washington factory when he got the chance to play football at Kiski. A friend refused to accept a football scholarship there unless Davies went along.\nDavies enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh where he played four seasons (1918–1921) of football under coach Glenn Scobey \"Pop\" Warner. Davies played in 31 games for the Pittsburgh Panthers and averaged 150 yards per game over his four-year career. He was selected as a first-team All-American in his freshman season of 1918 and again as a junior in 1920. As a freshman in 1918, Davies weighed only 142 pounds. In his first carry for Pitt, he ran for 13 yards against Washington &amp; Jefferson—then a national power. Three plays later, he ran for 38 yards, \"setting the pace for a stellar playing career.\"\nDavies helped Pitt to an undefeated season and a national championship in 1918, as he led the team in rushing, passing and receiving. He led Pitt in all-purpose yards all four years that he played. In a 1918 game against Georgia Tech, the freshman Davies accounted for five touchdowns—running 50 yards for a touchdown, returning two punts for touchdowns (a 60-yard and a 50-yard return), and passing for two more touchdowns. After watching Davies run back a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown in 1918, one writer noted:\"When Brother Tom Davies caught the kickoff on the ten-yard line at Franklin Field in Philadelphia one Saturday in November, we saw the prettiest piece of open field work not off at an angle, Tommie ran the length since the days of Jim Thorpe. On a bee line of the gridiron, and in so doing he personally took care of seven men! Then just for fun he added two more. The papers said, 'Tom Davies Beats Penn.' It has been the same against Syracuse, Lafayette and Georgia Tech. And now Pitt is counting on another All-American.\"\nAs a junior in 1920, Davies led Pitt to another big win over the University of Pennsylvania. In what some called Davies' finest game, he threw a touchdown pass, ran 80 yards for a touchdown, returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown and returned an interception 60 yards for a touchdown.\nAlso in 1920, he led Pitt to a 35–0 win over Syracuse, as he rushed for 255 yards and scored 16 points in only three quarters of play.\nIn December 1920, Davies was elected by his teammates to be captain of Pitt's 1921 football team. Davies was selected as team captain at a team banquet at which the entire team gave Davies \"a thunderous cheer.\" The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Davies was so affected by the demonstration that he stammered only a few words of appreciation and left the hall saying, \"I'm going to phone my mother and tell her all about it.\"\nDavies continues to rank among Pitt's all-time leaders in scoring with 181 points and all-purpose yards with 3,931 yards. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Pitt, Davies began a long career as a college football coach. His first coaching position was as an assistant to the legendary John Heisman at the University of Pennsylvania in 1922. At the time of his hiring at Penn, \"The New York Times\" noted: \"Tom Davies, former Pitt captain and all-American halfback, makes his debut as a Penn coach. The versatile Davies, who raised havoc with a number of Penn elevens in recent years, will instruct in forward passing, punting and straight arming, and will also help Tom McNamara with the scrubs.\"\nDavies received his first head coaching job in 1923 when he was hired as the head football coach for the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes located in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. He spent only one season at Geneva, compiling a record of 6–2–1. In 1924, he was hired by Allegheny College where he remained for two seasons. In 1926, Davies was hired as the head football coach at the University of Rochester, where he spent nine years, coaching until 1934. After leaving Rochester, he spent one season as a coach at Carnegie Tech and another at Kiski Prep School.\nIn 1937, Davies took over as head football coach at St. Thomas College. In his first season, he led the Tomcats to a 6–1–1 record. Prior to the start of the 1938 season, St. Thomas College changed its name to the University of Scranton. Davies's 1938 team finished with a record of 7–2. The team improved in 1939 and completed an undefeated 7–0–2 season. Davies resigned as Scranton's coach in March 1940 with a three-year record of 20–3–3.\nAfter leaving Scranton, Davies went into the insurance business in the Cleveland area.\nAlthough Davies insisted at the time of his resignation at Scranton that he was done with coaching, he was hired in March 1941 to take over as the head football coach for the Western Reserve University Red Cats. Davies served seven years as head coach at Western Reserve, although there was no team from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II, but was discharged in October 1947 by the University Board of Athletics. The dismissal came 24 hours after members of the team demanded that they finish the year under another coach.\nLater years.\nAfter permanently retiring from football in 1947, Davies returned to the insurance business in the Pittsburgh area.\nDavies was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1966 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970. He died of a heart attack in February 1972 at age 75. He died at his home in Pittsburgh's Highland Park district."

        "text": "Paul Melvin McKee (April 26, 1923 – January 23, 1999) was an American football end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins. He played college football at Syracuse University and was drafted in the twelfth round of the 1945 NFL Draft. He played for the Redskins for two years.\nLike Joe Namath after him, McKee starred in football, basketball, and baseball at Beaver Falls High School in Beaver Falls, PA (1938-1940). In addition to playing football at Syracuse, McKee was a wartime reserve on the Orange basketball team, scoring three points in the one game in which he played (1942-1943).\nMcKee's best game with the Redskins happened to be Sammy Baugh Day, November 23, 1947, when future NFL Hall of Famer Baugh was honored and presented with a new station wagon. Playing against the champion Chicago Cardinals that day, Baugh threw for 355 yards and had six touchdown passes, with McKee catching two of them and the 'Skins defeating the Cardinals 45-21.\nOn November 28, 1948, McKee was ejected from a game for decking with a hard right another future Hall of Famer, the Chicago Bears' Clyde \"Bulldog\" Turner. This was after Turner had stunned him with a forearm and elbow to the face (in the era before facemasks) while McKee was running a decoy route left and Baugh throwing incomplete right. The Washington Times-Herald's sports editor, Ev Gardner, wrote a column about the incident the following week, pleading, according to the column's title, \"No Fine for Paul, Please; Rather Curb the Bulldog.\" Just two summary paragraphs from Gardner's column: First, \"The hulking Turner was standing with some of the other Bears waiting for the Skins to line up again, when McKee got his bearings. Paul walked over and planted a beautiful right square on Turner’s jaw. It carried plenty of voltage for the massive Bulldog was laid flat on his back. His features resembled strawberry jam.\" Second, \"When a player is tossed out of an N[F]L game for fighting he automatically is fined $50. No notice of any fine has been forthcoming as yet from Commissioner Bert Bell’s office.\"\nAfter retiring from the NFL, McKee embarked on a career of college and high school coaching, teaching, and athletics administration. He started as an assistant coach at the University of Rochester, doing baseball, basketball, and football. He went on to coach high school football at Rome Free Academy, Vernon-Verona-Sherrill, and Rush-Henrietta, all in upstate New York. Between his years at V-V-S and R-H, he was an assistant football coach under John Yovicsin at Harvard (1960-1963 football seasons).\nMcKee's first season as head coach at Rome, 1955, was RFA's most successful in thirteen years. RFA's seven wins included an 18-6 victory over Rochester's Aquinas Institute; their lone loss was by just two points, 20-18, to Auburn. Highlights of McKee's second season at the helm, when RFA won five, lost two, and tied one, included holding on to tie Aquinas, 13-13, snapping Auburn's nineteen-game winning streak 19-8, and outlasting Syracuse's Christian Brothers Academy 13-7.\nMcKee started the R-H football program with an undefeated freshman team (1964) that continued undefeated the following season as JVs. From the fall when that team became seniors until McKee retired from coaching, his five full varsity teams (1968-1972) had a record of 37-3 and either won or tied for five conference championships.\nOne of McKee's sons, Thom, became known nationwide in 1980 for winning $312,700 on the television game show Tic Tac Dough. Another son, Jeff, in 1981, was a first-team All-American defenseman in lacrosse at Syracuse.\nMcKee was inducted into the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, into the University of Rochester's Athletic Hall of Fame\nin 1998 (for football and basketball), and into New York State Section V's Football Hall of Fame posthumously in 2003 (for coaching)."

Elder began his career with the rookie-level Pulaski Rangers, and had a 1.95 earned run average (ERA) in 20 games. He missed the 1998 season due to Tommy John surgery. Afterwards, he would play in 24 games for the Charlotte Rangers, finishing with a 4–2 win–loss record and a 2.84 ERA.

He played one season in the National Basketball Association with the Detroit Pistons (1980–81). He played college basketball at Virginia Tech.\nEarly years.\nRobinson attended Greensboro Day School. He accepted a basketball scholarship from Virginia Tech. He became a starter as a sophomore and led the team in rebounds in each of his last three years. He averaged 11.2 points and 7.4 rebounds during his college career.\nHe is ranked fourth among the school's all-time career rebound leaders and is 27th in career scoring. In 2003, he was inducted into the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was named to the ACC Basketball Tournament Legends roster.\nProfessional career.\nRobinson was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round (31st pick overall) of the 1980 NBA draft. He played in the Lakers' 6 exhibition games, averaging 5 points and 3 rebounds per game. On October 2, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for a 1981 second round draft choice (#39-Harvey Knuckles). As a rookie, he averaged 7.9 points and 19.6 minutes per game. He was released on October 27, 1981.\nIn 1981, he opted to continue his professional career in the Italian basketball league, signing with the Oece Trieste of the Serie A2 Basket. He contributed to the team winning a promotion to the Lega Basket Serie A, while averaging 17 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. In 1982, he had similar averages in the division 1, registering 16.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game.\nIn 1983, he signed with the Spanish club Real Madrid, to play under coach Lolo Sainz. In his first season, he formed a lethal pair under the boards with Fernando Martín Espina, averaging 13.5 points and 9 rebounds per game. He would also be a witness of the fight that took place in the second match of the championship series against FC Barcelona Bàsquet, between Martín, Mike Davis and Juanma López Iturriaga, which caused the Barca squad not to show up for the third match because of disagreements with the sanctions of the Competition Committee, earning Real Madrid a controversial league title. The team would also win the FIBA Saporta Cup that season.\nDespite his production (16.1 points and 7.4 rebounds in 84-85 and 16.0 and 7.4 in 85–86), Real Madrid decided to dispense of his services in search of a player of more strength, such as Brad Branson. During his time with the team he won three league titles and two Copas del Rey.\nIn 1986, he signed with the Cacaolat Granollers, who aspired to win against the elite teams of the league. Despite his good stats (18.4 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first season and 20.3 and 8.8 in his second), the team failed to achieve their goal of getting into the ACB semi-finals. In 1991, there were high expectations after the team's merger with the RCD Espanyol Bàsquet, but it coincided with problems detected Robinson's heart, that forced him to announce his retirement, although a few months later it was reported that his ailments were not as serious as initially feared.\nRobinson spent two years in the United States engaged in his businesses, until in 1991 he decided to return to the courts, accepting the offer from the TDK Manresa to replace Lance Berwald for 6 games. In 1992, at the age of 34, he signed with Juventud Alcalá of the First Division and announced his final retirement at the end of the season.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1989, he received his pastoral ordination from the Cathedral of His Glory. He currently is a pastor of the New Millenium Christian Center."

He played 92 National Hockey League (NHL) games for the Jets, Hartford Whalers and Minnesota North Stars in a career predominantly spent in the American Hockey League (AHL). He won the Calder Cup in 1985 and was a First Team AHL All-Star in 1988.\nMartin is most famous for having his junior playing rights traded in 1983 by the Seattle Breakers to the Victoria Cougars in exchange for the Cougars' team bus.\nPlaying career.\nFollowing two seasons of junior A hockey in Kelowna, Martin was added to the Seattle Breakers' reserve list. He chose instead to gain an education while playing at the University of Denver in 1982–83. Martin did make it known that he would play junior for his hometown team, the Victoria Cougars, however. The Breakers wished to trade Martin, and were in need of a new team bus. Coincidentally, the Cougars had an extra bus that they purchased from the defunct Spokane Flyers franchise, but as they were unwilling to pay the taxes and fees required to bring the bus into Canada, it was sitting in storage in the United States. As a result, on January 19, 1983, the Cougars traded the bus to the Breakers for Martin and $35,000. Martin earned the nickname \"Bussey\" for the remainder of his career.\nHe played one season with the Cougars in 1983–84, scoring 75 points in 60 games before turning professional. The draft pick of the Winnipeg Jets finished the 1983–84 season in the American Hockey League with the Sherbrooke Jets where he played five games. Martin remained in the AHL for much of the following three seasons, appearing in a total of 27 regular season and playoff games in the NHL over that time. He won the Calder Cup championship in 1984–85 while a member of the Sherbrooke Canadiens.\nHe signed as a free agent with the Hartford Whalers in 1987, but spent the majority of the season in the AHL with the Binghamton Whalers where he scored 28 goals and 89 points in 71 games. He was named a First Team AHL All-Star that season. He was acquired in the waiver draft by the Minnesota North Stars at the start of the 1988–89 NHL season, but was sent back to Hartford, also on waivers, after four games. He played 50 more NHL games for Hartford over the next two seasons. He signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Kings in 1990. Martin played 22 games with their AHL affiliate, the New Haven Nighthawks in 1990–91, after which he retired from professional hockey."

As a member of the Brazilian national volleyball team, he won gold medals at the 2004 and 2016 Olympics, and silver medals at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.\nAdditionally, Serginho is a two-time World Champion (2006, 2010), and a multimedalist of the World League, South American Championship, World Cup, and the Grand Champions Cup. In 2009, he became the first libero to be named Most Valuable Player in the history of the FIVB World League.\nCareer.\nSerginho is widely regarded as one of the best liberos of all time and is unquestionably the best libero of the 2000s, with more awards than any other libero. Known for his outstanding service reception and digging capabilities, teams often attempt to avoid Sergio when serving. Beyond his defensive abilities, he is also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter is forced to make the first contact. This is in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.\nSerginho is a multimedialist of every volleyball tournament in the 2000s. He is a seven-time South American Champion, and he won with Brazil every South American Championship during his whole career in the national team. In 2002 and 2006, he achieved titles of World Champion. During his career, he achieved seven gold and three silver medals of the FIVB World League.\nIn his achievements are also medals in World Cup, World Grand Champions Cup, and Pan American Games.\nIn 2004, Serginho became an Olympic Champion for the first time. However, in the next two Olympics, the Brazilian national volleyball team won silver medals only. Serginho semi-retired from the national team after the 2012 Olympics, and returned only for the 2015 World League. After that he declined to compete at the 2016 Rio Olympics, but was persuaded by Bernardinho to return. Bernardinho claimed that, while Serginho no longer had the agility that made him famous, he had experience and maturity to lead the team during a tournament that would certainly be rife with pressure on the Brazilian team, since they were playing on their country and coming from two losses on previous Olympics. Serginho was essential to motivate his team against France. They were losing, and on a break, Serginho told his colleagues that, while they all had at least one more chance at going to the Olympics, he didn't – those would be his last Olympic Games. Eventually, Brazil won the gold medal against Italy, and Serginho was acclaimed by the cheering fans, who called him king. After the match against Italy, Serginho was named the tournament's most valued player. He announced after the Rio finals against Italy he will play professionally for two more years."

        "title": "2006 Minor League Baseball umpire strike",
        "text": "The most recent umpire strike in Minor League Baseball history was the strike of 2006. It involved primarily a monetary dispute between the Association of Minor League Umpires (AMLU), a trade union, and the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation (PBUC), a management company. The dispute resulted in the hiring of replacement umpires for a number of games, followed by minor concessions by both parties, resulting in a slight wage increase for umpires employed in Minor League Baseball.\nParties involved.\nIn 1999, the minor league umpires, under the umbrella of the Professional Baseball Umpire Corp (PBUC), unionized themselves and formed the Association of Minor League Umpires (AMLU). The following year, the AMLU signed a salary contract with the PBUC. The union was formed to provide support and protection for the umpires in contract negotiations with PBUC, which is in turn governed by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL, the formal name of Minor League Baseball). As of the 2006 strike, the president of the union was Andy Roberts, an International League umpire, while attorney George Yund and Pat O'Conner were key figures representing management and the minor leagues. O'Conner, then a vice president and the chief operating officer of Minor League Baseball, would be elected president of the minor leagues at the end of 2007. The AMLU represented about 220 umpires in then 16 different leagues within Minor League Baseball.\nCauses.\nThe primary impetus for the strike came from AMLU's distaste for its umpires' salaries. Though salaries had always been rather low in accordance with PBUC's idea that umpiring was not a proper career, AMLU insisted that they had become too low. Umpires in Minor League Baseball made $15,000 in Triple-A, $12,000 in Double-A, $10,000 in full-season Class A, and $5,500 in rookie leagues. This was just a fraction of the salary of umpires in Major League Baseball, who were making from $84,000 to $300,000 annually. Many minor league umpires required an extra job or two during the off-season to make ends meet. However, the difficulty of the in-season schedule prevented the umpires from maintaining a second job during the baseball season. This led to a challenge in finding a steady job with an opportunity for advancement.\nThe strike began when irked umpires filed a lawsuit with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in Florida against PBUC in mid-March on the grounds that PBUC threatened to fire those umpires who decided to strike. There was some speculation that the AMLU union umpires intended to strike in early 2006, just after their contracts expired in late 2005. When it was time to renew the expired contract, the AMLU umpires demanded salary increases, which the PBUC was unwilling to pay. It was decided then that the umpires would go on strike. The umpires refused to report for spring training, marking the beginning of their official strike of 2006. The first game of Minor League Baseball on April 4, 2006, began with a replacement umpire.\nThe umpires demanded a $100 per day salary increase and a $10 per diem increase. In the 2000 contract that AMLU initially signed with PBUC, rookie umpires were getting paid $1800 per month and senior umpires were getting paid up to $3400 per month. This salary was not enough, considering that their schedule only lasts for five to six months, leaving their annual salary at a meager $15,000 to $20,000. Per diem rates ranged from about $20 for rookie umpires to $25 for senior umpires. According to AMLU, the per diem rate in the 2000 contract was completely inadequate to meet the needs of umpires. Because the umpires spent the five-month season on the road, living in hotels and eating in restaurants, their daily food and gas expenses could not be met with the 2006 per diem rate first proposed by PBUC.\nDuring the strike.\nThe dispute began in February 2006. As PBUC's contract with AMLU had expired in 2005, both groups were engaged in negotiating the terms of the next five-year contract for the umpires. Contention emerged over a salary hike proposed by PBUC, the first in almost a decade. PBUC offered a $100-per-month raise as well as an across-the-board increase of $1 per day to the per diem payments. The deal also included a proposal to raise the deductible for the umpires' health insurance from $100 to $500, reducing the effective amount of the salary hike. AMLU rejected the deal outright, claiming that it was insufficient to meet their needs. AMLU made an announcement on March 24, 2006, that they had filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against PBUC. The umpires began to strike shortly thereafter.\nThe first minor leagues to announce that their umpires had failed to report on April 4 for opening day were the International League and Texas League. Umpires for the Southern League failed to report on April 5. April 6 was the national opening day for Minor League Baseball. A total of 220 umpires represented by the AMLU went on strike, refusing to report across 16 different leagues. Management (PBUC) issued a statement that they had made their best and final offer, and then announced that they would continue the season, implying that they would use replacement umpires in the place of the professional AMLU workers.\nOn May 11, some major league umpires joined with the AMLU umpires in a show of solidarity. Tim Timmons, Randy Marsh, Ángel Hernández, Hunter Wendelstedt and Sam Holbrook arrived in the picket line outside of Cooper Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, to strike alongside AMLU umpires.\nReplacements.\nFor the duration of the strike, PBUC management called in replacement umpires for the 220 AMLU umpires on strike. These replacements consisted largely of umpires from college baseball and high school baseball. For fear of reprisals, PBUC refused to release the names of the replacements. A number of incidents involving the replacement umpires followed. Some players, coaches, managers and AMLU representatives placed the blame on the replacements.\nOne of the most publicized mishaps involving the replacements occurred on April 26 during a game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. After striking out at the plate, a frustrated Delmon Young of the Durham Bulls threw his bat at an umpire in response to what he thought was a bad call. The bat hit the umpire, bringing criticism from Minor League Baseball and earning Young a 50-game suspension. In another incident, Birmingham Barons manager Chris Cron walked out in anger with his team in the eighth inning of a game against the Jacksonville Suns after the benches were vacated three separate times. After being ejected from a game on May 1, Ottawa Lynx manager Dave Trembley declared the replacement umpire’s performance as “the worst officiating [he had] ever seen in 20 years of professional baseball. [It was] an embarrassment to the International League and an embarrassment to [me].\" One International League player remarked, \"It's definitely not professional baseball the way they're calling balls and strikes. I've been called out twice on balls that bounced in the dirt. Definitely hitters are taking a beating and so are the pitchers. I know guys on our team are throwing pitches sometimes down the middle and (they're) getting called balls. And sometimes they're 10 inches outside and they're called strikes.\nBoth AMLU lawyer Robert Weaver and a National League scout criticized the skills of the replacements. Weaver said of the replacement umpires' performances, “It's definitely inconsistent and it's affecting careers. Players' numbers are down. I think the league ERA is an earned run lower than it was last year.\" Management within PBUC as well as Minor League Baseball remained supportive of the replacement umpires. Both PBUC and Minor League Baseball denied the charges made by players, managers, AMLU and coaches that the replacement umpires were unprofessional, lacking the experience and skills to manage the players and make the proper calls. Pat O'Conner later praised the replacement umpires for their efforts, noting that they had done quite well during the strike and would be used again should an AMLU umpire became injured or sick.\nAgreement.\nAfter a few grueling weeks of the strike, negotiations were finally settled between AMLU and PBUC on May 30. The umpires who had been on strike agreed to resume work by June 12. An earlier contract proposal had been rejected by AMLU by a two-to-one margin. Days later, along with the help of a federal mediator, the two sides were able to devise a new contract. Through the use of collective bargaining and their labor strike, umpires were able to negotiate an increase to their per diem payments by $3, up to a maximum of $40 depending on the league. As for monthly salaries, there was an increase of $100, also a part of the six-year agreement. Minor League Baseball and PBUC were in agreement with the arrangement. Pat O'Conner stated that he was \"happy to have reached a deal that will assure labor peace with [the] umpires through the 2011 season.\""

        "text": "The 1956 Giro d'Italia was the 39th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Milan on 19 May with a flat stage and concluded back in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 10 June. Sixteen teams entered the race, which was won by Luxembourgian Charly Gaul of the Faema team. Second and third respectively were Italian riders Fiorenzo Magni and Agostino Coletto.\nGaul took the lead in the legendary stage up Monte Bondone, where under a snow storm he won with an 8-minute margin over runner up Alessandro Fantini. This edition is unique since there were two Mountains Classification winners. There were two awards for the Dolomites and the Apennine mountains, the winners were Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes respectively.\nTeams.\nFifteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1956 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 105 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 43 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe race was thought to be more open in previous years due to notable absences of top riders like Louison Bobet due to sickness, 1950 winner Hugo Koblet as he was recovering from a back injury and desired to focus on the Tour de France, Stan Ockers, Ferdinand Kübler, and Raphaël Géminiani, along with the innovations regarding the race route. A \"Feuille d'Avis de Neuchatel\" writer felt that the race would offer a great opportunity for the younger riders to succeed as the previous great riders like Coppi are getting too old. Previous year's winner Fiorenzo Magni (Nivea-Fuchs) was one of the older generation of riders to enter the race in great form, coming off of a win at the Tour of Piedmont. In addition, Magni had announced that this would be his last Giro as he would retire as the season's end. The writer continued naming young Italians with potential to contend like Gastone Nencini (Leo–Chlorodont), following his performance in last Giro, amateur road race champion Sante Ranucci (Legnano), and Aldo Moser (Torpado). Jean Brankart lead the primarily Belgian Eldorado team and was viewed as a rider who would win a Tour de France. Some viewed Charly Gaul (Faema) as a favorite to contend for the overall. Spanish contenders were thought to be climber Federico Bahamontes (Girardengo), while sprinter Miguel Poblet (Faema) was thought to be a favorite for the flatter stages.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was revealed on 24 February 1956. The race contained eight stages with mountains, which contained sixteen categorized climbs. The race route all together contained 3 rest days and 23 stages across 25 days of racing, of which 18 were mass-start stages, two individual time trials, one team time trial event, and one individual time trial run as a relay. The relay event took place in San Marino. The second day of racing featured a split stage where the second half was a team time trial that was contested at night to not interfere with a local football match that was happening in the afternoon. The planned tenth stage from Salerno to Frascati was deemed an \"electoral stage\" at the route's announcement and was chosen to be removed because it fell on the day of Italian municipal elections. Three new Dolomite mountains were climbed during this edition of the race: Monte Bondone (), San-Pellegrino (), and Vallès ( meters). Eleven categorized climbs from the Apennines were included in the race route, with the Pian di Creto () being utilized in the second stage. For the first time in race history, the cities of Lecco, Rapallo, Salice Terme were stops for the Giro.\nWhen interviewed about the route several current and former riders said. The route was thought to be difficult.\nClassification leadership.\nOne jersey was worn during the 1956 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThere were three mountains classifications in the 1956 Giro d'Italia, one for the Dolomites, Apennines, and one for the highest mountain in the race, the Passo dello Stelvio. The rider that was the first over the Stelvio was Ignis' Aurelio Del Rio. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the teams were awarded points for their rider's performance during the stages."

With this classification victory, Menini won 300,000 lire. Guido Boni (Bianchi), Guido Carlesi (Chlorodont), Alfredo Zagano (Asborno), Jesús Galdeano (Faema), and Gianni Ferlenghi (Bianchi) placed second in the classification and split 300,000 lire."

        "title": "1954 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 1954 Giro d'Italia was the 37th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Palermo on 21 May with a team time trial and concluded in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 13 June. Fifteen teams entered the race, which was won by Swiss Carlo Clerici of the Welter team. Second and third respectively were Swiss rider Hugo Koblet and Italian Nino Assirelli.\nTeams.\nFifteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1954 edition of the Giro d'Italia. The organizers invited neighboring countries to gather a squad of riders to send to compete in the race. Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland all entered a team, while France was offered a spot in the race and accepted, but could not form a team in time. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 105 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 67 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nFausto Coppi (Bianchi) was seen as the clear–cut favorite, because of the strength of his supporting team. Coppi's greatest challenger was thought to be Hugo Koblet (Cilo). Koblet entered the race in what was regarded as not great form, but if he were to gain his form in the race, then his chances of victory would be large. A \"La Sentinelle\" writer felt that Koblet's presence made the competition interesting as it felt no other rider could challenge Coppi. Koblet was thought to have a better support from his team relative to the past couple of years and was expected to contend for the general classification.\nOutside candidates included Fiorenzo Magni (Nivea) who would normally be considered a more legitimate contender; however, he was recovering from a fall in the one–day race Roma–Napoli–Roma. Roma-Napoli-Roma winner Bruno Monti (Arbos) and Pasquale Fornara (Bottecchia) were seen as other challengers. \"Old\" three–time champion Gino Bartali (Bartali) lined up to race while being supported by his usual \"domestiques\" Corrieri and Bresci. \nWhile noting that the Giro had been primarily won by Italian riders, \"Feuille d'Avis Valaisan\" felt the teams with Belgians, Spanish, and Swiss teams would have a good chance to rival the Italian squads. \"Nouvelliste Valasain\" writer even commented that a coalition of some sort exists between Italian riders against the foreign riders. Girardengo-Eldorado riders Stan Ockers and Rik Van Steenbergen were seen as the best Belgian entrants. Their Raymond Impanis was seen a potential threat, but due to disputes with their team director, his participation was questionable. Heinz Müller was the German Clement team's best chance. The Dutch team Locomotief was thought to be filled with good climbers and rouleurs with the likes of Wim Van Est, Wout Wagtmans, and the Voorting brothers Adrie and Gerrit. The team was expected to do well in the opening team time trial. Spanish Climber Jesus Loroño (Ideor) was seen as a contender in the mountains after his performance at the 1953 Tour de France, where he won as a stage and the Mountains classification. Bernard Ruiz and Francisco Masip were two other Spanish riders to watch. Fritz Schär (Guerra) was seen as a rider who would favor the intermediate sprints classification despite his recent poor performance at the Tour de Romandie. Carlo Clerici (Welter) was thought to have \"class and will.\" \nNotable absences included Ferdinand Kübler (Fiorelli) who had an ongoing dispute with the race organizers following his abandonment of the Giro the year before. Louison Bobet (Mercier) was seen as a rider who could pose a threat to Coppi, but due to previous incidents of giving him up, he was not seen as a strong contender.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route's first fourteen stages were revealed on 25 February 1954, amid speculation that Rome was not going to be included. The rest was revealed on 6 May 1954. The route included two time trials, one team and one individual, and was the longest Giro as of 2023. The inclusion of the team time trial was criticized as it was thought to give too much of an advantage to the wealthier teams. In addition, the team time trial that year was held midway through the race and several teams were down men through disease or abandonment, which only further hindered teams. To assuage this complaint of the teams, the team time trial stage was made first. Critics felt that the route would be similar to year's past, where all the action would be in the closing days, citing the 20th and 21st stages as being the most difficult. The press felt that the increased number of intermediate sprints would lead to more attacks throughout the stage ad help animate the race. The race started in Palermo for the first time since 1949.\nRace overview.\nIn the sixth stage, Carlo Clerici escaped and took the lead with a big margin.\nIn the twentieth stage, Fausto Coppi won and took some time back. His fans were hoping that he would show more action on the twenty-first stage which included the Bernina Pass, but cyclists rode slowly as a form of protest against the racing conditions, taking almost ten hours to cover the 222 km stage; this event became known as the Bernina strike. When the race ended in Milan the next day, angry supporters whistled at the cyclists. For his leading role in the strike, Coppi was given a two-months suspension, although this was later revoked.\nClassification leadership.\nOne jersey was worn during the 1954 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. The winner of the general classification received 72,000 francs. In total 32,555,000 lire (then roughly 227,000 Swiss francs) was awarded. Each day a rider wore the pink jersey, he would win 15,000 francs. Each stage winner received 49,000 francs. A green jersey was awarded to the best ranked foreign rider in the general classification, who also received a sum of money each day the jersey was awarded.\nThe mountains classification awarded all awarded three points to the first rider and one point to the second rider to cross the summit of a categorized climb. There was no leader's jersey awarded for this classification. The winner received 10,000 francs. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also a classification for the teams, in which the teams were awarded points for their rider's performance during the stages in the intermediate sprints. \nIn the \"gran premio traguardi volanti\" or intermediate sprint classification points were awarded at designated sprint locations throughout each stage's route and at the stage finishes. In total there were 64 designated sprint points throughout the race. Points were awarded to the first three riders to pass through the assigned point: first received five points, second received three points, and third received one point. The winner of each sprint will receive 650 francs, while the overall classification winner received 81,000 francs. The leader of this classification wore a white jersey.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the race, a \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" writer described how non-Italian riders dominated the race by winning 11 of the 22 stage, while having 35 foreigners riding to 75 Italians starting the race. The writer acknowledged that some critics felt Italian cycling was beginning to decline as the \"Big Three\" Bartali, Coppi, and Magni would be soon exiting the sport; however, the writer noted that Giancarlo Astrua, Nino Defilippis, Pasquale Fornara, among others would help maintain Italian cycling's presence. In particular, the writer felt the younger riders attacked more and forced the older riders out of their reserves quicker than expected. The writer concluded that the Swiss riders have earned respect from their peers and become favorites entering races now, while stating that the Swiss riders that will contest the upcoming Tour de France will have a lengthy time off to rest before its start because of the 1954 FIFA World Cup. A \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" writer wrote that large attacks were expected on the 21st stage which featured the Bernina pass; however, the attacks did not come, which at the time they speculated it was due to fatigue of the riders. Due to the low effort by the riders and slow stage speed, race organizers cut the prize money on the stage by half. Later this inaction by the peloton on the 21st stage became known as the \"Bernina strike.\" Another \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" writer described the collective performance by the Swiss riders as the best in the nation's history at the Giro, as three finished in the top 12 of the general classification."

        "text": "The Spanish men's national ice hockey team () is the national men's ice hockey team of Spain. The team is administered by the Spanish Ice Sports Federation, itself a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). As of April 2020, the Spanish men's national program is 31st on the IIHF World Rankings and has 135 registered players. The men's national team currently competes at the IIHF World Championship Division II, Group A level.\nHistory.\nOn 10 March 1923, Spain joined the IIHF after the Spanish Winter Sports Federation was founded in the same year. After building an artificial rink in Madrid, Spain, they entered their first international tournament in late 1923. Spain won their first international game against Belgium in the Challenge de Haute–Garonne tournament held in Bagnères-de-Luchon, France. They lost their next game in the tournament to France.\nIn 1924, Spain competed in the Ice Hockey European Championships held in Milan, Italy. During their first game against Switzerland, two of Spain's seven players were injured. Due to this, Switzerland agreed to play with only five players allowing the game to continue. Switzerland ended up winning 12–0. Spain was forced to forfeit their second game against Sweden due to the injuries suffered by their players. Sweden had also agreed to play with five players.\nAfter the European Championships, Spain entered the Coupe de Davos in Davos, Switzerland. Days before the tournament, Spain had upset Switzerland 4–0. The tournament had 12 teams broken into four groups with Spain being placed in group two along with Switzerland and Germany. Spain lost to Switzerland, 6–0 and to Germany, 7–0. Spain also lost to Germany's second team, 2–0 but avoided being in last place by beating Italy, 4–0. On 1 January 1925, Spain played Germany's second team again, winning in double overtime 3–1. After beating Germany, Spain went on a Swiss tour winning three of the games they played. Spain played in the Challenge de Haute–Garonne for the second time in January 1925. During the tournament, they defeated Belgium's second team 4–1 and tied France 3–3.\nIn 1926, Spain again competed in the European Championships held in Davos, Switzerland. In their first game against Belgium, Spain lost 5–0. They also lost their second game to Czechoslovakia (9–2). In the consolation pool, Spain tied Italy 2–2 and lost to Poland, 4–1.\nSpain has competed in the IIHF World Championship Division II since it began in 2001. During the first year of the tournament in 2001, Spain defeated South Africa, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand. However they lost to South Korea preventing Spain from finishing in first. In 2002, Spain finished in third place in Group B after defeating Bulgaria, Iceland and Luxembourg and losing to Yugoslavia and Lithuania. During the 2003 version of the tournament, Spain defeated South Africa, Mexico and Australia and lost to Yugoslavia and South Korea. Spain finished in third place in Group A. Spain hosted the Division II tournament in 2004 and finished fourth place in Group A by defeating Israel and Luxembourg. Spain lost to China, Croatia and Australia. 2005 was a down year for Spain as they finished in fifth place in Group B with only two points. Spain's only win came against Iceland while they lost to Serbia and Montenegro, Belgium, Israel and North Korea.\nIn 2006, they lost to Serbia and Montenegro, Romania men's national ice hockey team and twice to Bulgaria while beating South Africa for their lone win. They finished in fifth place in Group A for the second straight year. In 2007 they defeated Bulgaria, Turkey and Serbia and lost to Belgium and Croatia. Unlike the prior two years Spain finished in third place with nine points. In 2008, Spain finished in third place by defeating Australia, Iceland and Mexico and lost to China and New Zealand.

        "title": "Jim Ellis (swimming coach)",
        "text": "James Ellis (born 1947) is an American swim coach who founded the PDR (Philadelphia Department of Recreation, or Pride, Determination, Resilience) swim team just outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as one of the few predominantly Black swim teams largely for intercity youth. He coached the team from 1971 to 2008, at Nicetown's Marcus Foster Recreation Center outside Philadelphia then moved the team to Nicetown's newly built Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center from 2010-2023 where it became affiliated with the Salvation Army Kroc Center. The 2007 feature film \"Pride\" is based on his life story, and focused a great deal of attention on the accomplishments of his swimming program. \nEarly influences.\nEllis was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1947, and grew up there. He began swimming at the recently integrated Highland Park pool in Pittsburgh and as a youth took a position as a lifeguard there. By the mid-1960's the Pittsburgh outdoor pools had hired several black lifeguards. Currently the largest outdoor public pool in Pittsburgh, the Highland Park pool was large when Ellis worked there and had been used for swim competitions. In July, 1951, the pool had been the subject of a lawsuit filed by the Pittsburgh Urban League on behalf of League member Alexander Allen which claimed that he had been deprived of his civil rights by being chased from the pool by a group of White teenagers. The Pittsburgh Urban league won the suit, with the court noting that public pools should allow access regardless of race.\nEducation.\nEllis graduated from Westinghouse High School which had a large black enrollment, and was part of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. He received the honor of having his name placed on the Westinghouse High School Wall of Fame. He swam competitively in high school, and at the collegiate level for Cheney State, an historically Black University near Philadelphia, where he also studied mathematics.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from Cheney State, Ellis wanted to get a job as a teacher, but was not able to secure a position. Having previously worked as a lifeguard, he became a water safety instructor at Sayre-Morrie Recreation Center in West Philadelphia. He later became a math teacher at a high school in Philadelphia where he taught for many years.\nPDR swim team coach.\nIn 1971, Ellis formed the PDR (\"Pride, Determination, Resilience\" or \"Philadelphia Department of Recreation\") swim team at the Marcus Foster Recreation Center in Nicetown, a neighborhood in Philadelphia. The team is recognized as being the first African-American swim team in the country, and Ellis is credited with helping break down stereotypes and diversifying the sport of swimming. His teams were highly competitive locally and nationally. They gained national recognition as a premier training program, sending team members to the swimming trials for every U.S. Olympic team from 1992 to 2007.\nIn the 1980's, members of Ellis's swim club had received college scholarships for their swimming skills, set national age-group records, \nand a few had been selected for the Olympic trials. By 2019, over 100 of Ellis's swimming club members were estimated to have received college scholarships.\nMany talented swimmers, like Michael Norment, came to swim for Ellis' team because of his strong reputation as a coach. Norment became the first black swimmer on the U.S. national team, and later became a swimming coach himself. \nClosing of Marcus Foster Pool.\nEllis coached the PDR team from 1971 until 2010. In 2008, the Marcus Foster Pool in Nicetown, where Ellis coached the PDR team, was closed due to disrepair to both the building and the pool and Ellis relocated his team, whose program was associated with Philadelphia's Parks and Recreation Department. By 2019, all but one of the Philadelphia indoor public pools closed, though most outdoor public pools remained open.\nFor a period after the closing of the Marcus Foster Pool in 2008, and prior to 2010, Ellis conducted his co-ed swim team at the pool at Philadelphia's La Salle University, and in the summer of 2008, taught swimming at Kelly Pool in Philadelphia's Fairmont Park.\n2007 Ellis biographical film, \"Pride\" opens.\nIn 2007, the feature film \"Pride\" was released, which portrays Jim Ellis and his struggles to establish the PDR team. The film was noted for having received an outstanding performance from lead actor Terrence Howard who played Ellis, but took criticism for its overuse of clichés typical of both sports movies and movies about race. Tough, upbeat, and not looking for sympathy like his high achieving swimmers, Ellis noted that \"nasty prejudice\" resulting from encountering a \"white coach with swimmers from the affluent suburbs\" -- as depicted in the movie -- was not common, and that \"in reality there was little of that sort of discrimination against his team.\" Nonetheless, Ellis did not deny the existence of some forms of prejudice.\nSAKA swim coach, aquatics director.\nIn Spring, 2010, the Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center opened in Nicetown, Pennsylvania, the same city as Ellis's prior PDR swim team program at the public indoor Marcus Foster pool. The new Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center cost $108 million which included a $72 million grant from the Kroc Foundation, started by the family of Roy Kroc, particularly Kroc's third wife philanthropist Joan Kroc. $36.3 million was raised regionally from government and private funds. Known as the Jimmy Moran Competition Pool, the 25 meter, 10 lane competition-grade pool was designed for recreational swimming lessons, water polo, and swim meets. Taking an early role, Ellis was influential in designing the pool at the center. The movie \"Pride\", released three years earlier, may have helped focus attention on Ellis's program, as the inclusion of a state-of-the-art swimming pool in the Kroc Center would become a boon for Ellis's swim club.\nSince late 2010, Ellis has remained the coach of the Salvation Army Kroc Aquatics (SAKA) program located in the Kroc Center. As of 2023, the pool and Ellis's Aquatics program has remained open and active nearly continuously, and Ellis's program is sometimes referred to as the Philadelphia Department of Recreation Swim Team, though it is no longer directly associated with the Department. By 2011, he had put together a competitive team of about 40 members, and also acted as the Aquatics Director.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn May 2007, Ellis received the President's Award from the International Swimming Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was named to the \"List of the 30 Most Influential People In Swimming Over the Past 30 Years,\" selected by USA Swimming and Speedo. Ellis was inducted to the American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2019."

        "text": "The men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay event at the 2000 Summer Olympics took place on 22–23 September at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre in Sydney, Australia.\nSince the event's inception in 1960, the U.S. team dominated the race from the start to demolish a four-year-old world record and most importantly, to defend their Olympic title. Lenny Krayzelburg (53.87), Ed Moses (59.84), Ian Crocker (52.10), and Gary Hall, Jr. (47.92, an American) put together a blazing fast finish of 3:33.73 to cut off their own standard by 1.11 seconds. Moses also produced a mighty effort in the breaststroke leg as he became the first ever swimmer to record a sub one-minute barrier split. After accepting their golds in front of the Aussie home crowd, the U.S. men unfurled a banner reading: \"Sydney 2000. In our hearts forever. Thanks Australia.\"\nThe Aussie team of Matt Welsh (54.29), Regan Harrison (1:01.48), Geoff Huegill (51.33), and Michael Klim (48.17) finished behind their greatest rivals by a couple of seconds, but made a surprise packet with the silver in an Oceanian record of 3:35.27. Meanwhile, Stev Theloke (55.07), Jens Kruppa (1:00.52), Thomas Rupprath (52.14), and Torsten Spanneberg (48.15) earned their first medley relay medal for Germany since the nation's reunification in 1990, taking home the bronze in a European record of 3:35.88.\nNetherlands' Klaas-Erik Zwering (56.83), Marcel Wouda (1:01.20), Joris Keizer (52.26), and anchor Pieter van den Hoogenband (47.24, the fastest split of the race) missed the podium by more than a full body length over the Germans with a fourth-place time of 3:37.53. Hungary (3:39.03), Canada (3:39.88), France (3:40.02), and Great Britain (3:40.19) completed a close finish at the rear of the championship finale.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition."

        "text": "The 1959 Giro d'Italia was the 42nd running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tour races. The Giro started in Milan, on 16 May, with a stage and concluded back in Milan, on 7 June, with a leg. A total of 120 riders from 15 teams entered the 20-stage race, which was won by Luxembourgian Charly Gaul of the team. The second and third places were taken by Frenchman Jacques Anquetil and Italian Diego Ronchini, respectively.\nTeams.\nIn the weeks preceding the Giro's start, Jacques Anquetil and the team were interested in participating in the race; however, they desired an appearance fee. After calls were made, the team eventually settled on coming to the race. Ultimately, thirteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1959 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 130 cyclists. The teams were primarily composed of Italian riders except and . From the riders that began the race, 86 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nJacques Anquetil and Charly Gaul were seen as favorites to win the race. Anquetil entered the Giro with a formidable Helyett–Leroux–Fynsec–Hutchinson team that included the likes of 1958 Vuelta a España winner Jean Stablinski, the 1958 Tour de France's most \"elegant\" rider Edouard Delberghe, Irishman Seamus Elliot, and Jean Graczyk. When asked about his chances to win the race Anquetil stated: \"I know that I am in good shape. If I am beaten, it will mean there are better riders than myself in the race.\" Reigning world champion Ercole Baldini was seen as a contender to win the race, but due to an operation at the beginning of the cycling season he entered the race weighing more than normal. Charly Gaul entered as a previous winner of the Giro d'Italia in 1956 Giro d'Italia, as well as the reigning champion of the Tour de France.\nFaema–Guerra's Rik Van Looy had desires to win a Grand Tour during his career and had previously raced the Giro in 1955 and Vuelta a España in 1958, not finishing either race. However, during the 1959 campaign, Looy won the Giro di Sardegna and Vuelta a Levante, as well as finishing third in the Vuelta a España. Faema–Guerra entered with a completely Belgian team except for German Hans Junkerman and had gotten the nickname \"Red Guard\" because of their red jerseys, the team was well known for setting up Looy for stage victories. Miguel Poblet stated he was not there just to win stages.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the race was released on 2 April 1959 at the Casino della Valle in Saint Vincent in front of journalists, local dignitaries, and various industrialists. There were four individual time trials within the race of which one, stage 7, was a climbing time trial up to Mount Vesuvius. Ten stages contained a total 15 categorized climbs. The only rest day was scheduled on 27 May in Rimini. The race consisted of 22 days of racing and was covered .\nRegarding the route for the Giro d'Italia, \"Corriere dello Sport\" writer Cesare Facetti felt that the route was very difficult and would make it very difficult for a rider to complete the Giro d'Italia and be successful in the Tour de France in late June.\nRace overview.\nThe race began with the introductions in the Duomo square in front of the Milan cathedral, with Baldini received the loudest ovation upon his introduction. The opening leg finished at the famed Spa town Salsomaggiore. During the stage, only one breakaway was able to sustain a lengthy advantage over the peloton and that came into the race with a solo attack by Darrigade (Helyett). He managed to win the intermediate sprint on the course before being joined by six riders and another twenty as the stage wound down; however, the escapees were caught with to go. The day ended with a bunch sprint won by Belgian Rik Van Looy. \nThe following stage was the first individual time trial of the race, which Anquetil was favored to win. Anquetil won the day by twenty-five seconds ahead of Rolf Graf and assumed the race lead. He rode the stage on a 52 x 13 gear, which when Gaul found out following the stage said \"Nobody, not even Anquetil, can push that gear.\" The first summit finish came with the third leg that ended on the Abetone. A twelve-man group containing Looy and Jos Hoevenaers reached the climb first, while a second major group containing the favorites likes Anquetil and Gaul reached the climb after. Gaul attacked at the beginning of the climb and reached the first group alone. He rode with them for a short time before attacking and going on solo to win the stage and take the race lead.\nAround into the fourth stage, near Pistoie, a group of nine broke away from the peloton and established a lead of five minutes that soon grew to eleven as the stage progressed. The peloton reacted and began to increase their tempo, but they did not catch the breakaway. In the breakaway, some riders cracked leaving Arturo Neri, Armando Pellegrini, Aurelio Cestari, and Gastone Nencini at the front. Pellegrini edged out Cestari and Nencini to take the stage, while Neri dropped before the finish line and finished four seconds behind.\nDuring the sixth leg into Naples, Seamus Elliot (Helyett–Pontin) attacked from the leading breakaway as the stage came to a close, primarily because of sprinter Miguel Poblet's (Ignis) presence in the breakaway. He went under one kilometer left before he cramped with remaining and was overtaken. Poblet won the stage, while Elliot held on to get 10th place. The next day's stage was a climbing individual time trial along a road on Mount Vesuvius, which ended at the observatory on the volcano. As the riders began the time trial in reverse of the standings for the general classification, contenders Anquetil and Gaul were the final two to get on the course. Anquetil again chose a larger gear (45 x 20), while Gaul chose a smaller gear (45 x 23). Anquetil was faster over the initial stretch of the race which covered the cobblestones, but after that stretch, Gaul closed the gap. Gaul finished eight seconds after Anquetil did, winning the stage by 37 seconds over Guido Boni (Tricofilina). A time trial followed the next day, but this time it was around the island of Ischia. The course was rather hilly and was won by Antonino Catalano (Bianchi), while with respect to the general classification, Anquetil managed to gain 22 seconds on Gaul.\nSan Marino was the destination of the twelfth leg and it could be reached by one road when entering from Romini, a steep and rough road. The course featured two and a half circuits before its conclusion uphill. Anquetil attacked on the flat roads before the final climb and Nino Defilippis won the stage. Anquetil, who placed third, gained time he gained on the general classification contenders, put him 34 seconds behind the leader Gaul.\nAfter the leading riders had crossed the Costalunga during the fifteenth day, Gaul descended with an advantage on a group containing Poblet, Anquetil, and Van Looy. The riders caught and passed Gaul when he suffered a puncture on the descent. The trio opened a large gap and Poblet won the stage, while Gaul crossed 2 minutes and 33 seconds behind. This loss gave Anquetil the race lead.\nIn the time trial to Susa, Anquetil caught Gaul into the stage. Gaul proceeded to ride in Anquetil's slipstream for the remainder of the stage before Anquetil dropped him in the final kilometer.\nClassification leadership.\nOne jersey was worn during the 1959 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nThe mountains classification leader. The climbs were ranked in first and second categories. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. There were two categories of mountains. The first category awarded 80, 60, 40, 30, and 20 points, while the second distributed 60, 40, and 20 points. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the teams were awarded points for their rider's performance during the stages.\nAftermath.\nThis was the first edition of the Giro d'Italia where an Italian did not lead the general classification after any stage. \"La Gazzetta\" wrote that the collective performance of the Italians in the Giro did not live up to expectations."

        "text": "Matthew Gillette Robinson (born June 28, 1955) is a former professional American football player, a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) from 1977–1982 for the New York Jets, Denver Broncos, and Buffalo Bills. He was later with the Jacksonville Bulls and Portland Breakers of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1984 and 1985, respectively.\nCollege.\nRobinson played college football at the University of Georgia under head coach Vince Dooley. His sophomore season in 1974 was his first as a starter and he led the Bulldogs to a 6–6 record. He threw for 8 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. Georgia improved the next season though Robinson's stats went down; they finished at 9–3 and were ranked 19th in the AP poll. In 1976, Robinson's senior year, the Bulldogs went 10–1 in the regular season and were ranked fifth, but lost the Sugar Bowl to national champion Pittsburgh. When his college career concluded, Robinson finished with more interceptions (20) than touchdown passes (17).\nPro career.\nDespite Georgia being a run-oriented team, Robinson was selected by the New York Jets in the ninth round of the 1977 NFL Draft. With Richard Todd viewed as the quarterback of the future, Robinson was considered a \"camp arm,\" a quarterback drafted only to get repetitions in practice so the incumbent starter doesn't get overworked in the preseason. Robinson defied the odds and made the team, and even got a start his rookie season, against the Seattle Seahawks in week nine, but the Jets were shut out 17–0.\nFour games into the 1978 season, the Jets at 2–2, Todd was injured, and Robinson was pressed into service as the starter. The Jets lost his first start, but then won their next three and looked like a contender in the AFC East. Robinson made some big plays along the way, including a 75-yard strike to Wesley Walker to upset the defending AFC champion Denver Broncos 31–28 in week ten. Robinson's steady play along with an improved defense helped the Jets finish 8–8, a marked improvement over 1977's 3-11. For the year, Robinson passed for 2,002 yards and 13 TD's with 16 INT's. For the 1979 season, Todd was re-instated as the starter and Robinson stayed as backup for one more year before being traded to the Broncos in exchange for a second and first round pick and back-up quarterback Craig Penrose.\nIn 1980, Robinson started the first seven games for the Broncos over veteran Craig Morton. During that time, the Broncos went 4–3. Robinson only spent one season in Denver, moving on to Buffalo to serve as the understudy to Joe Ferguson. Robinson then joined the Jacksonville Bulls of the USFL. His time in Jacksonville ended when the Bulls acquired Brian Sipe. Robinson then moved on to the Portland Breakers and finished his career there. In 1985, his final season as a pro, he split time with Doug Woodward, a quarterback out of tiny Pace College, as the Breakers were struggling to find a new quarterback after starter Johnnie Walton retired. The Breakers failed to generate much of an offense and finished 6–12 and missed the postseason.\nIn his final season, Robinson completed 156 passes on 310 attempts and threw 15 touchdowns and 20 interceptions for 2,182 yards.\nPost NFL career.\nRobinson remains active with the NFLPA, helping players who have recently retired making the transition from being a professional athlete to the next chapter of their lives."

        "title": "1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 54th edition of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 6 at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Illinois, the home of the Chicago White Sox of the American League. The Wednesday night game resulted in a 13–3 American League victory. The game celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the All-Star Game, and occurred exactly 50 years to the date of the first All-Star game, also at Comiskey Park. This was the 54th game, as no game was held in 1945, while two were held each year from 1959 through 1962.\nThis was the fifth All-Star Game played in Chicago, and the third to be hosted by the White Sox at Comiskey Park (1933, 1950), with two by the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field (1947, 1962). This was the last time the All-Star Game was played in the venue where the annual exhibition began. When the White Sox next hosted the All-Star Game twenty years later in 2003, they had moved across the street to their new home at U.S. Cellular Field.\nThe game was the first American League win in twelve years, and only the second AL win since 1962. The thirteen runs scored by the American League set a new record for one team in All-Star Game history. The ten-run margin of victory was the largest since the 12–0 American League victory in 1946.\nThe game is perhaps best remembered for Fred Lynn's grand slam off Atlee Hammaker of the Giants, part of a big third inning for the home team. As of , it is still the only grand slam in the history of the Midsummer Classic. During that third inning, the American League set All-Star Game records for the most hits (6) and runs (7) by a single team in their half-inning - all off Hammaker.\nPrior to the first pitch, Chuck Mangione played the Canadian national anthem on his flugelhorn, while the Oak Ridge Boys sang the \"Star-Spangled Banner\". The colors were presentated by the Great Lakes Naval Training Center Color Guard, which previously presented at the 1947, 1950, and 1963 games; they did the honors again in 1990 and 2003.\nFor this golden anniversary, there was also an \"Old Timer's Game\" played on Tuesday, the day before the All-Star game. Because Independence Day was on Monday this year, the All-Star break did not begin until that evening, as the holiday included a full slate of day games.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nUmpires.\nGeorge Maloney was the last home plate umpire to work an All-Star game wearing the outside chest protector long favored by umpires in the American League. Maloney was one of only four active umpires in 1983 still using the outside protector. He and Russ Goetz retired following the 1983 season. Bill Kunkel soldiered on while battling cancer, succumbing in May 1985. Jerry Neudecker, the last outside protector holdout, retired after the 1985 season.\nGame summary.\nThe first inning gave notice that this would be one of the sloppiest All-Star games in history. Steve Sax led off the game by reaching on an error by AL starting pitcher Dave Stieb. Sax stole second and scored when next batter Tim Raines grounded to Stieb and Stieb threw wildly past Rod Carew at first. Raines reached third, but couldn't score as Stieb struck out the side; Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy, and Mike Schmidt all fanned.\nThe AL tied it in their half of the first on a sacrifice fly by George Brett and took the lead in the second on another sac fly by Robin Yount. The Giants' Atlee Hammaker came in to pitch for the NL in the bottom of the third and promptly had one of the worst innings by a pitcher in All-Star Game history. Jim Rice led off with a homer, followed by a Brett triple. Dave Winfield singled home Brett. Manny Trillo singled, and Carew drove home Winfield with a two-out single. Hammaker then intentionally walked right-handed hitter Yount to face Fred Lynn, a left-handed hitter. Lynn made the NL pay for the move with the first-ever grand slam in All-Star game history. When the dust cleared, the AL had a 9-1 lead and Hammaker had given up six hits and seven runs in an inning, both All-Star game records that still stand.\nThe NL gamely fought back on RBI singles by Murphy in the fourth and Sax in the fifth, but that was all they would get. In the seventh, Lou Whitaker had an RBI triple and Willie Wilson an RBI double for the AL. The AL capped off the scoring when Brett scored on a fly ball hit by Whitaker that Pedro Guerrero dropped and Rickey Henderson drove in Cecil Cooper with a groundout."

        "title": "Sailing on the Seven Seas",
        "text": "\"Sailing on the Seven Seas\" is a song by English electronic music band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), released on 18 March 1991 by Virgin as the first single from their eighth studio album, \"Sugar Tax\" (1991). Along with 1981's \"Souvenir\", it is the band's highest-charting UK hit to date, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted at number three in Austria and Sweden, number five in Ireland and number nine in Germany. The single was the first to be released by OMD without co-founder Paul Humphreys, who had left to form his own band the Listening Pool.\nThe song pays homage to various rock groups. The Velvet Underground song \"Sister Ray\" is directly referenced (OMD had previously covered \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" as a B-side to 1980 single \"Messages\"), and the line \"people try to drag us down\" is similar in melody and lyrical content to the opening line of the Who's \"My Generation\"; singer Andy McCluskey also noted that the track includes \"Glitter Band-style\" drumming.\nReception and legacy.\nRichard Riccio of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" described \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\" as \"fabulous... a rollicking foot-stomper in its original version, and a haunting late-night dance track in remixed [B-side] form.\" MTV Europe ranked it the 21st-greatest song of 1991, while KROQ placed it 54th. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Dave Thompson wrote that OMD \"sail giddily through the musical past\", delivering \"a glorious musical mélange, an inspired melding of synth pop soar, 2-Tone yore, and glam rock roar, the anthemic chorus to the fore with a fist-in-the-air punch that shouts out for more\".\nHumphreys described the track as \"a great, kind of a weird pop song\". Original OMD drummer Malcolm Holmes, who also had no involvement in the song, said, \"I loathe the track – I do. But it charted and it did the business.\" After returning to the band, Holmes commented, \"'Sailing on the Seven Seas' is a great thing to play as a drummer. When I started to play it, it became something else to me... so I don't really see the song as how I did in those days.\nVersions and B-sides.\nThe song was released as a 7-inch single version and in an extended version for the 12-inch release. The extended version was more oriented to the electronic dance music market in vogue at the time. Another mix entitled \"Dancing on the Seven Seas\" was also included on a special collector's edition CD single. The regular CD single featured another remix entitled \"Floating on the Seven Seas\" and the \"Larrabee Mix\" of \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\", similar to the original single version but mixed at Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, California.\nTwo other new songs were included as B-sides or bonus tracks on the CD single: \"Burning\" and \"Sugar Tax\". Despite its title, \"Sugar Tax\" did not feature on the album of the same name. Both tracks feature on the B-sides compilation album \"\" (2001). \"Sugar Tax\" also features as a B-side on the later single release \"Then You Turn Away\".\nA 12-inch promo single released in the US features further remixes, namely \"Drowning on the Seven Seas\", \"Raving on the Seven Seas\" and 'Mix 1' and 'Mix 2' of \"Dancing on the Seven Seas\". Although uncredited, many of the remixes were the work of Phil Coxon."

        "title": "Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents Michigan State University (MSU). The team plays at the Munn Ice Arena in East Lansing, Michigan, on the MSU campus. The Spartans have won the NCAA national championship three times (1966, 1986, and 2007). The current head coach is Adam Nightingale, who took over coaching duties on May 3, 2022, after Danton Cole was fired. Michigan State currently competes in the Big Ten Conference.\nThe MSU ice hockey program has seven CCHA regular season championships, 11 CCHA Tournament titles, and 1 Big Ten Conference regular season championship. MSU has also won 12 Great Lakes Invitational titles, 3 ACHA Division 2 titles and 1 ACHA Division 3 title. The Spartans have been in the NCAA tournament 23 times, with nine Frozen Four appearances. On April 7, 2007, the Michigan State Spartans won their third national championship by beating Boston College 3–1. Their traditional rival is Michigan and the teams have played an annual game in Detroit since 1990. Starting at the Joe Louis Arena, the game has since moved to Little Caesars Arena in 2018.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Spartan ice hockey program traces its roots back to the first informal varsity team that began in 1922 playing an independent NCAA Division I schedule. On January 11, 1922, Michigan State played its first intercollegiate hockey game, a 5-1 loss to Michigan. Home games during the first season were played on the frozen Red Cedar River on MSU's campus.\nMichigan State finished 0–3 in the 1922 season and picked up its first win during the second season on February 11, 1923, 6–1 over the Lansing Independents. The team did not play the 1923–24 season but returned for the 1924–25 season. The 1924–25 season marked the first time the program had a head coach, John Kobs, who also coached the Michigan State Spartans baseball team. Kobs' tenure at Michigan State lasted six season before the team was suspended for 19 seasons. During which time the team compiled a record of 8-18-1.\nHarold Paulsen was hired as the varsity ice hockey coach at Michigan State on August 1, 1948 following the suspension of the hockey programs during the years of the Great Depression and World War II. Before recruiting or coaching, Paulsen oversaw the renovation of Demonstration Hall into an indoor rink with artificial ice-making capabilities. On January 12, 1950, MSU played its first game since 1930, losing to Michigan Tech 6–2. Paulsen struggled through his first two years at Michigan State with a 6–25 record. MSU athletic director Ralph Young felt the hockey program's progress was inadequate and Paulsen resigned. Following the 1951 season, Amo Bessone accepted the head coaching position at Michigan State University. Bessone would remain at MSU for the next 28 years.\nIn the 1958–59 season Michigan State, Minnesota, and Michigan formed their own ice hockey division due to the dissolution of the WIHL. Michigan State won it with a record of 5–2–1 in the division play.\nAmo Bessone era.\nWhen Bessone arrived at Michigan State, the ice hockey program was beginning its third full season after being reinstated. That same season, in 1951–52, the Spartans joined Colorado College, Denver, Michigan, Michigan Tech, Minnesota, and North Dakota as founding members of the Midwest Collegiate Hockey League (MCHL).\nAmo Bessone won his first collegiate hockey game as head coach on November 29, 1951, when the Spartans defeated Ontario Agricultural College 8–2. The Spartans struggled with six losing seasons before Bessone turned things around in his seventh season as coach. In 1957–58, Michigan State enjoyed its first winning season. The following season, Bessone guided MSU to a Big Ten championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The tournament was MSU's first NCAA tournament appearance. The Spartans defeated Boston College 4–3 in the semifinals and advanced to the schools's first championship appearance. The Spartans lost the 1959 national championship game in overtime 3–4 to North Dakota. MSU finishes the season 17-6-1. Michigan State became a charter member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in 1959. The WCHA was a reincarnation of the loosely affiliated Midwest Collegiate Hockey League and Western Intercollegiate Hockey League that disbanded following the 1957–58 season. Bessone and MSU struggled during the first five seasons of the WCHA. Again, Bessone turned things around with a winning season in 1964–65. The following season, Bessone coached Michigan State to an improbable NCAA National Championship.\nMSU began the 1965–66 season 4-10, but rebounded winning 12 of their last 15 games including defeating the defending national champion, Michigan Tech, to win the WCHA playoffs after finishing sixth in the regular season. The win earned MSU a spot in the 1966 NCAA tournament. In the national semifinals, Bessone upset highly favored Boston University 2–1 with a goal by Spartan forward, Doug Volmar. In the national championship game, Bessone and the Spartans faced Len Ceglarski's Clarkson team that owned the national-best record of 24–2. On March 19, 1966, Michigan State beat top-ranked Clarkson 6–1 victory to give Michigan State is first national championship. Len Ceglarski and Amo Bessone shared the Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year in 1966. The national title and coaching award cemented Bessone's legacy as a coach. To this day, Bessone's 1966 Michigan State team remains one of the biggest underdog stories in NCAA ice hockey history. The total number of team victories (16) and team winning percentage (.551) is the lowest of any NCAA ice hockey champion. MSU made the NCAA tournament again with a strong WCHA playoff finish in 1967, but lost 2–4 in the national semifinals, a rematch of the 1966 NCAA Tournament against Boston University.\nBessone began the 1970s with six straight winning seasons. During Bessone's time coaching the Spartans the team won MSU won its first Great Lakes Invitational by defeating Michigan Tech 5–4 on December 28, 1973.\nAs MSU hockey was building momentum, Munn Ice Arena opened October 25, 1974, when Michigan State hosted Laurentian. That same season saw the first sellout crowd in Munn's history when the Spartans defeated North Dakota 6–2. A season later, in 1975–76, Bessone guided MSU to its best WCHA conference record of 20-12-0 before Minnesota knocked MSU out of the WCHA playoffs in 6-7 triple overtime loss. Minnesota, who had finished below Michigan State in the conference, received an NCAA tournament bid instead. Bessone announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1978–79 season after three straight losing seasons. Bessone coached his final game as head coach on March 3, 1979, when the Spartans defeated rival Michigan 5–3.\nRon Mason era.\nAfter Amo Bessone retired from Michigan State University, the MSU Athletic Director, Joseph Kearney, hired Ron Mason as the Spartans new head coach. Mason was named Spartan head coach on April 1, 1979, and spend the next 23 seasons at Michigan State. It was a rough start in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association for Mason as he compiled a record of 26-46-2 over two seasons. Michigan State joined the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) in 1981 and over the next few seasons Mason turned the hockey program around. The Spartans won CCHA playoff championships the first four straight seasons of the conference in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985. MSU would win a second national title in 1986 when the Spartans defeated Harvard 6–5.\nIn 2000 CCHA coaches and athletic directors unanimous voted to renamed the CCHA championship trophy to the Mason Cup in honor of Ron Mason, who was a key figure in establishing the conference in the early 1970s prior to his tenure at Michigan State. During the 2000–01 season Michigan State finished first in the regular season and advanced through the CCHA Tournament winning the first ever Mason Cup. That same season the Spartans made a Frozen Four appearance by beating Wisconsin 5-1 before losing to North Dakota in the Semifinal game. On October 6, 2001, the Spartans hosted an outdoor game at Spartan Stadium against rival Michigan known as The Cold War. The school would set an attendance record for an outdoor hockey game as 74,554 fans attended. The game ended in a 3–3 tie.\nMason led Michigan State to seven CCHA regular season titles and a conference-record 10 CCHA tournament titles. In addition, MSU under Mason made 19 NCAA tournament appearances during his 23 seasons with the Spartans. He coached MSU to five NCAA Frozen Fours, two National Championship appearances, and one National Championship. Mason coached two Hobey Baker Memorial Award winners, Kip Miller in 1990 and Ryan Miller in 2001.\nRick Comley era.\nRick Comley was announced as Ron Mason's successor as head ice hockey coach at Michigan State University in March 2002. Comley led the Spartans to a tournament appearance in 2004, his second season as MSU's head coach. After losing to Northern Michigan in the 2004 CCHA Tournament the Spartans received an at-large bid to the 2004 NCAA Tournament. Third ranked MSU fell to second seed Minnesota-Duluth in the opening round 0–5.\nComley's Spartans returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2006 after missing the NCAA Tournament in 2005. Comley guided MSU to a second-place CCHA finish in the regular season and a CCHA Mason Cup championship in 2006. Michigan State advanced into the 2006 Tournament with an automatic bid. The Spartans defeated New Hampshire 1-0 before losing to Maine 4–5 in the East Regional Final.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Michigan State was preseason ranked No. 5, which was MSU's highest preseason ranking since October 2001. The team earned an NCAA Tournament bid after finishing the regular season with a conference record of 15-10-3. Comley led MSU to defeat three higher-ranked teams en route to the national championship including No. 1-ranked Notre Dame in the Midwest Regional final. In the Frozen Four the team defeated No. 4-ranked Boston College in the national championship game on April 7, 2007, by a score of 3–1 in a game that saw Michigan State score three unanswered goals in the third period.\nIn December 2010 the Michigan State Spartans and Michigan Wolverines played a second outdoor game at Michigan Stadium. The game, known as The Big Chill at the Big House, took place on December 11, 2010. 104,173 fans filled Michigan Stadium and watched as Michigan beat Michigan State 5–0. The attendance broke the 75,000 of the Cold War and 78,000 of the 2010 IIHF World Championship and set a new attendance record for a hockey game. Later that same season on January 25, 2011, Rick Comley announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2010–11 season.\nTom Anastos and Big Ten Conference era.\nIn September 2010 Penn State University announced that the university was elevating its men's and women's American Collegiate Hockey Association club programs to varsity status. Then-CCHA commissioner Tom Anastos publicly stated that the CCHA would strongly consider adding Penn State as the conference's 12th member. On March 21, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced plans to sponsor men's ice hockey starting in 2013–14 season. Michigan State along with CCHA rivals, University of Michigan and Ohio State University will leave the CCHA to join University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin from the WCHA and Penn State to form a six-team Big Ten Hockey Conference. Less than a week after the Big Ten's announcement Michigan State announced that former CCHA Commissioner, Tom Anastos would become the 6th head coach in the history of the program. Anastos is a former Spartan hockey player who played for MSU from 1981 to 1985. He is also the former coach at Michigan-Dearborn (NAIA) from 1987 to 1990, and compiled a 68-37-7 record. He later served as an assistant coach under Ron Mason from 1990 to 1992.\nAnastos picked up his first NCAA DI coaching victory with Michigan State in the second game of the 2012 Icebreaker tournament with a 3–2 overtime win over Air Force. The Spartans finished the 2011–12 season ranked 5th in the CCHA standings and received a first round bye in the CCHA Tournament. The Spartans faced fourth-seeded Miami (OH) in the second round, in the best-of-three series Michigan State was swept 0-6 and 1–4 in two games. Despite being swept by Miami, the Spartans finished 15th in the Pairwise rankings and became the final at-large bid selected for the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The bid marked the team's first appearance in the NCAA post-season since 2008, the team was placed in the East Region held at Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In the game, Union College took an early lead and held the Spartans to a single goal in a 3–1 win over Michigan State in the East Regional semifinal. The game was the first meeting between the two programs and also the first win in the NCAA Division I national tournament for the Dutchmen.\nAt the end of the 2016–17 season, it was announced that Tom Anastos would step down as head coach of the Spartans.
