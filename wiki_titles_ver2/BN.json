        "text": "Baseball Mogul is a series of career baseball management computer games created by game designer Clay Dreslough. The product was first published in 1997. The 27th and latest installment is Baseball Mogul 2024. A proprietary database, included with the game, permits play in any season of historical baseball from 1901 to the present.

(i.e.: Bill Mueller is Bert Mack and Barry Bonds is Bert Brundage. Players had the same initials as their major league counterparts but different first and last names)\n\"Baseball Mogul 2007\" was the best-selling PC baseball game of 2006, selling over 100,000 units according to NPD data.\nBaseball Mogul 2006.\n\"Baseball Mogul 2006\" was developed by Sports Mogul and released on Mar 15, 2005.

Published by Monkeystone Games.\nBaseball Mogul 2002.\nDeveloped and published by Sports Mogul in March 2002\nBaseball Mogul 2000.\nDeveloped and published by Infinite Monkey Systems.\nBaseball Mogul 99.\nDeveloped by Infinite Monkey Systems. Published by WizardWorks.\nBaseball Mogul.\nDeveloped and published by Infinite Monkey Systems.\n\"Baseball Mogul\" tied with \"CART Precision Racing\" to win \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1997 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award. The editors called it \"about as humble as games get, but it was more original than any sports title this year\".\nOther games using the Baseball Mogul engine.\n\"Microsoft Baseball 2001\" was an action-oriented baseball game that used the Baseball Mogul engine and allowed players to control the franchise. \"MLB Slugfest\" and \"MLB Slugfest: Loaded\" are a series of action-oriented baseball games for PS2, Xbox and GameCube that used the Baseball Mogul engine for in-game and franchise simulation.\nGameplay.\nPrior to \"Baseball Mogul 2007\", all games were simulated, with the player assuming the combined role of general manager/manager/owner. Players oversee an entire baseball franchise, and possess the ability to set batting lineups, make trades, and set ticket and concession prices. \"Baseball Mogul 2007\" added a play-by-play option to control every pitch of a game.\n\"Baseball Mogul\" relies primarily on text-based menus.\nConfiguration.\nWhen starting a new game, the player must choose from one of five options:\nAfter selecting one of those five options the players must choose the level of difficulty (Fan, Coach, Manager, or Mogul). The opposing AI strengthens, and the player's initial operating budget shrinks with each increment in difficulty. The following options further determine the nature of the game's simulation and are listed under \"Advanced Options\":\nPlayer ratings.\nA variety of player attributes are rated numerically on a 100-point scale, though none are likely to score lower than 40 or 50 except for relief pitchers' \"Endurance\". Ratings vary over time with player development, aging, and injuries suffered. All players possess an \"Overall\" rating, a combination of all other measures weighted by position, a \"Peak\" projection of overall performance at the height of his career, and an indication of \"Health\", the likelihood of succumbing to personal injury, which declines with age and major injuries.\nPosition players are rated for a variety of measures of batting, baserunning, and fielding prowess. \"Contact\" and \"Power\" ratings correlate to a batter's ability to connect with pitches and do so solidly, influencing batting average and extra base hits. Swinging-at-a-pitch determination, or not, relates to the \"Eye\" rating, with highly rated players properly identifying good pitches from bad. Laying down bunts and running the bases are also measured, by \"Bunt\" and \"Speed\" ratings. Defensive talent is broken into \n\"Range\", \"Arm\", and \"Fielding\" ratings, measuring aptitudes to reach and quickly dispose of batted balls with skill and consistency.\nPitchers are rated for a variety of measures of pitching skills. \"Power\" measures pitch velocity and strikeout rate. Accuracy in pitch placement and walk rate relates to a pitcher's \"Control\" rating. \"Movement\" indicates the action, or movement, on pitches thrown, with highly rated pitchers inducing more ground balls or popups from opposing batters. \"Endurance\" roughly indicates the pitch count that can be thrown before fatigue sets in, adversely affecting velocity, control, or movement.\nBatting and fielding skills for pitchers are conflated into \"Hitting\" and \"Defense\" ratings, respectively, with values comparable only to other pitchers. For example, a Hitting score of 90 would not qualify a pitcher to start as a position player.\nOnline play.\nMany players choose to run leagues with their friends using \"Baseball Mogul\". This gameplay is similar to fantasy baseball, except that the games are simulated by the engine and thus leagues can continue beyond the Major League Baseball season.\nThe league commissioner posts game results as a saved game file, and each player downloads this file, makes adjustments to his team, and sends his updated file to the league commissioner.\nUpdates and patches.\nAbout once a month, Sports Mogul will add a patch based on bugs reported by players in the forums. When a version is X.5 or higher, it is considered a beta of the next Baseball Mogul iteration. For example, 15.50 would have been considered an open beta for Baseball Mogul 2014. On the Sports Mogul forums, players report bugs with the current patch and also can request ideas for future version of the game."

        "title": "Kenny Anderson (basketball)",
        "text": "Kenneth Anderson, known as Kenny Anderson, (born October 9, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player. After a college career at Georgia Tech, he played point guard professionally from 1991 to 2006, mostly in the National Basketball Association.\nEarly life.\nAnderson was born in Queens, New York City. As a 16-year-old high school sophomore, the LeFrak City, Queens native who attended academic and athletic powerhouse Archbishop Molloy High School in Briarwood, Queens, was considered one of the best basketball prospects in America. Collegiate recruiters began scouting Anderson in sixth grade and he was on the front page of the New York City sports section when he was 14.\nBy the end of his high school career, he was a four-time \"Parade\" All-American, a feat not accomplished since Lew Alcindor, and the first player to be named All-City four times. He was a McDonald's All-American, was named New York State Mr. Basketball by the New York State Coaches Organization, and named High School Basketball Player of the Year by Gatorade, the New York State Sportswriters Association, \"Parade\", Naismith, and \"USA Today\" Despite his coach, Jack Curran, benching him for the first quarter of all of his games during his freshman year at Molloy, Anderson set the all-time state record for scoring in New York, with 2,621 points. This record stood until 2004, when Lincoln High School guard Sebastian Telfair eclipsed the mark late in his senior season. He was considered the No. 1 player in the country, over such notables as Jimmy Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal.\nCollege career.\nAfter a long recruiting process, Anderson signed a letter of intent in November 1988 to play at Georgia Tech, selecting the Yellow Jackets over North Carolina, Duke, and Syracuse.\nAnderson played two years for Georgia Tech as the team's starting point guard, helping lead the team to the Final Four in 1990, along with swingmen Dennis Scott and Brian Oliver. The trio was nicknamed \"Lethal Weapon 3\". Despite winning the ACC title, they entered the NCAA tourney as only the fourth seed. They proceeded to sweep through the LSU Tigers, led by Shaquille O'Neal, and two Big 10 teams on their way to the Final Four. Georgia Tech's tournament run ended against eventual champions UNLV in the Final Four.\nWith Scott and Oliver gone after that season, Anderson averaged nearly 26 points per game. Georgia Tech secured a No. 8 seed for the 1991 NCAA tournament, where they lost in the second round to Ohio State. Soon after, Anderson announced that he would forgo his last two years of eligibility to enter the NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nNew Jersey Nets (1992–1996).\nAnderson was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the second pick in the 1991 NBA draft. He was the youngest player in the league in his rookie year, and averaged seven points, two rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. During Anderson's second season he nearly doubled his point, rebound, and assist averages en route to the Nets making the 1993 NBA playoffs. While in New Jersey, coached by Chuck Daly, Anderson formed what was widely expected to become a \"big three\" of sorts with Derrick Coleman and Dražen Petrović. However, Petrović's 1993 death in a car accident prevented this from coming to fruition. In his third season, he averaged career highs of 18.8 points and 9.6 assists per game. That season, on February 18, 1994, Anderson scored a career-high 42 points and recorded 14 assists during a 119–114 win over the Detroit Pistons. That same season, Anderson and teammate Coleman represented the East squad in the 1994 NBA All-Star Game. \nCharlotte Hornets (1996).\nHe was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in 1996, along with Gerald Glass, in a deal for Khalid Reeves and Kendall Gill. Anderson played only 38 games in the 1996 season for the Hornets after the midseason trade, averaging 15.2 points.\nPortland Trail Blazers (1997–1998).\nIn 1996, Anderson signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. During the 1997 NBA playoffs, Anderson averaged 17 points, 4.8 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game during Portland's first-round loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.\nBoston Celtics (1998–2002).\nIn 1998, the Trail Blazers traded Anderson, along with Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, and two 1998 first-round picks to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire, Carlos Rogers, Walt Williams, and a 1998 second-round pick, but he refused to report to the team because he did not want to play in Canada, which prompted the Raptors to trade him to the Boston Celtics five days later, along with Žan Tabak and Popeye Jones for John Thomas, Roy Rogers, Chauncey Billups, and Dee Brown.\nSeattle SuperSonics (2003).\nAnderson spent a considerable amount of time as a Celtic before he was sent to the Seattle SuperSonics, along with Vitaly Potapenko and Joseph Forte, and in a package for Vin Baker and Shammond Williams. \nNew Orleans Hornets (2003).\nAt the 2003 NBA trade deadline, Anderson was dealt back to the Hornets, who had since relocated to New Orleans, for Elden Campbell.\nIndiana Pacers (2004).\nOn September 19, 2003, Anderson signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers. Anderson played 44 games as a member of the Pacers, averaging six points per game. \nAtlanta Hawks (2005).\nOn September 16, 2004, Anderson signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks. He was waived by the Hawks on February 24, 2005.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2005).\nOn February 28, 2005, Anderson was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Clippers after being waived by the Hawks. He was later waived by the Clippers on March 25, 2005.\nPost-NBA.\nAnderson was released from Lithuania's Žalgiris Kaunas after the 2005–06 season, thus ending his professional career as a basketball player.\nNational team career.\nAnderson played for the U.S. national team in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, where they won the bronze medal.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson was raised by his mother, Joan, and did not meet his father until he was in his thirties. He has two sisters, Sandra and Danielle. He was poor growing up, but Anderson says that being able to provide for his mother was inspiration for him to become a professional basketball player. In October 2005, his mother died from a heart attack.\nAnderson is the father of seven children, by four women. He became a father of a daughter while attending Georgia Tech. He had a relationship with Dee Dee Roper (DJ Spinderella of the rap group Salt-N-Pepa), and they have a daughter together. He was married to Tami Roman (who has appeared on the reality series \"Basketball Wives\"), but they divorced. They have two daughters, including hip-hop artist Jazz Anderson. Anderson met his second wife Tamiyka R Lockhart in West Los Angeles in 1998 while they both were going through divorces. They have a son together, Kenneth Anderson Jr. They divorced in 2004. He met his third wife, Natasha, during the 2004 NBA playoffs. They married in 2007. Anderson and Natasha are raising his son Kenny Jr. and her daughter.\nIn 2005, despite earning $63 million during his NBA career, Anderson filed for bankruptcy.\nIn 2013, Anderson reported that he was sexually abused as a child by both a person who lived in his neighborhood and a basketball coach.\nIn February 2019, Anderson was hospitalized for several days near his home of Pembroke Pines, Florida after suffering a stroke.\nAfter the NBA.\nIn 2007, Anderson was named as the coach of the Continental Basketball Association's Atlanta Krunk. He accumulated a 9–19 record during the 2007–08 season.\nIn 2008, Anderson made a TV appearance on \"Pros vs Joes\".\nIn September 2008, he was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame.\nIn 2008, he became the head coach of slamball team Hombres, and helped them to a semi-finals berth.\nAnderson graduated in 2010 from St. Thomas University in Miami, with a degree in organizational leadership.\nIn August 2011, Anderson took the position of basketball coach at the David Posnack Jewish Day School in Davie, Florida. In May 2013, following a DUI arrest, the school indicated that they would not renew his contract.\nIn 2014, Anderson was named to a team assembled by Dennis Rodman as part of his \"basketball diplomacy\" effort in North Korea with the job of playing an exhibition match against the North Korean Senior National Team to celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong-un. Anderson later said that upon arrival, he felt he had let down friends, family and fans but also had no choice but to go through with the event. He said he would donate some of his earnings, which were not paid by the regime, to charity.\nIn 2015, Anderson appeared in Dwayne Johnson's reality TV show \"Wake Up Call\".\nIn 2017, Anderson appeared in \"Mr. Chibbs\", directed by Jill Campbell. This documentary tracked Anderson's life post basketball as he came to terms with personal demons in his life.\nIn 2018, Anderson was hired as the head basketball coach for Fisk University."

Evans hired Roger Montgomery as an agent.\nProfessional career.\nAfter not having been selected in the 2001 NBA draft, he signed as a free agent for the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played in only 10 games. In 2002, he moved to Greece to play for Olympiacos, and in the following, 2003–04 season he played for the Italian power Benetton Basket Treviso (winning the Italian Cup). In 2004, he made the roster for the NBA's Sacramento Kings, and became a rotation player. He started 11 of 65 games, and played 19 minutes per game on the season, contributing 6.4 points. In 2005, he was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Pistons, where he was reunited with his former coach and close friend Flip Saunders, and played a rotation role of 14 minutes per game, averaging 5.2 points per game.\nOn June 28, 2006, the Pistons traded Evans to the Los Angeles Lakers for the draft rights to Cheikh Samb, following Evans' request to be moved to a team where he would be given more playing time. He served as a bench player for the Lakers, largely as the back up to Kobe Bryant.\nOn November 20, 2007, he along with teammate Brian Cook were traded to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Trevor Ariza. He became the Magic's starting shooting guard, contributing to the team's 52–30 record and landing the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 Playoffs.\nEvans agreed to terms on a 3-year contract from the Atlanta Hawks worth about $7.5 million on July 25, 2008. At the time, he was on the verge of signing a three-year deal with the Golden State Warriors. On May 7, 2009, Evans scored a postseason career-best 16 points during an Eastern Conference Semifinals Game 2 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. February 23, 2011, he was traded to the Washington Wizards.\nEvans has since retired. Evans' final NBA game was on April 26, 2012 in a 104 - 70 win over the Miami Heat where he recorded 18 points and 1 assist.\nIn 2017, Evans joined the Killer 3's of the BIG3 basketball league, playing alongside coach/player Charles Oakley, Chauncey Billups, and Stephen Jackson, among others."

The French team were thought to be assured of the gold medal and came in as raging favourites in the event. However, the United States team surprised everyone when defeating France by eight points to nil.\nSummary.\nThe rugby football Olympic tournament consisted of only one match. It was played between the United States and France. The US squad was made up of American football players from California universities, notably Stanford, California, and Santa Clara. Due to American football becoming an increasingly violent sport, these and other west coast universities chose to instead play rugby union from 1906-1914.\nOn the other side, the French team was composed of players from four clubs near Paris: Racing Club, Olympique, Club Athlétique des Sports Généraux, and Sporting Club Universitaire. \nUnited States player Rudy Scholz wrote about the match:\nAfter the Olympic competition, the US team toured England and France in 1924, playing three games in England as preparation for the 1924 Olympic competition.\nOn 19 September, in Lyon, United States defeated a team representing the southeast of France 26–0. The American team also achieved victories against a southern French team (in Toulouse) and a southwest side at Bordeaux.

        "text": "In rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics held in Paris, won the gold medal, beating in an upset in front of a partisan crowd.\nAll the matches were played at Olympic Stadium of Colombes. It was the last time rugby was played at a Summer Olympics until rugby sevens was introduced in 2016.\nEntries.\nIn September 1923, the U.S. Olympic Committee agreed to send an American rugby team to the 1924 Paris Olympics. The French Olympic Committee (FOC) had scheduled the rugby event to kick off the 1924 Paris Games, and Romania and the USA were expected to provide only token opposition for the European Champions. France was picked to win the gold medal in grand style.\nUSA Arrival.\nThe USA Olympic rugby team arrived in Paris, via England on 27 April 1924, after a 6,000-mile journey by train, bus, ship, and ferry from Oakland, California. The team was the target of hostility even before the players set foot on French soil. In the port of Boulogne immigration officials refused the U.S. team entry, and the players – many of whom had been seasick during the turbulent crossing – spent over 12 hours waiting for the officials to resolve the situation.\nFrance versus Romania.\nThe Olympic games of 1924 opened on 4 May with a match between France and Romania. Playing its first fifteen, the French notched a 59 to 3 victory over the smaller eastern European team, scoring 13 tries including four by the fine Stade Francais winger Adolphe Jauréguy.\nAfter the match, another round of trouble started over the referee for the France – USA match. The dispute degraded into the French no longer providing any practice fields for the team, so the Americans found themselves a park in the outskirts of a city. Fanning the flames, the French press published an article by a Paris City Counselor criticizing the U.S. team. The Americans invited the Frenchman to come down to the pitch to discuss the matter. To make matters worse, an argument started over the French Olympic Committee's ruling that the American side could not film their match against Romania that weekend. A French company had been awarded sole rights to filming the Olympics, and an American request to film the match was flatly denied. A meeting on the 8th did not resolve the issue, so Sam Goodman told the French organizers that the US might pull out of the Games.\nAdding fuel to the fire, the American players' clothes were robbed during that day's training session. Even though a French attendant had been posted, the team lost about $4,000 worth of cash and possessions. Cleaveland and his teammates were not very happy, and because of their treatment in the press, the American side was now being cursed and spat on in the streets of Paris. The French press now whipped up fierce anti-American sentiment in Paris.\nUSA versus Romania.\nOn Sunday, 11 May, the US defeated Romania at Colombes Stadium. With Norman at flyhalf, Richard Hyland at center, and Jack Patrick at flanker.\nFullback Charlie Doe had a good day kicking, scoring 13 points. With the impressive win, though, a difficult situation was brewing. Each time the Americans touched the ball, the French crowd of about 6000 booed and hissed. Conversely, they cheered and screamed each time the Romanians gained any possession. And though everyone felt that the Americans would play a harsh, physical match, both the American and French sporting press noted the lack of violence and the skilled nature of US play, coupled with their size and fitness.\nSome of the French press even conceded that the fans had been unfair at the match. Still the odds were set at 5 to 1 against the US with a 20-point spread in the upcoming match with France. Two days later, the issue over the final's referee was settled when Albert Freethy of Wales was selected.\nThe final.\nThe match was particularly violent with 2 French players leaving the field due to injuries. During the final between and the at Colombes Stadium, French fans booed and hissed the American team. French fans threw bottles and rocks onto the field and at American players and officials, wild brawls broke out in the stands, U.S. spectator Gideon Nelson was knocked unconscious after being hit in the face by a walking stick, and French fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle, leaving the police to protect the Americans. At the medal ceremony, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was drowned out by the booing and hissing of French fans, and the American team had to be escorted to their locker room under police protection.\nRosters.\nComplete list of players:"

        "title": "Major League Baseball transactions",
        "text": "Major League Baseball transactions are changes made to the roster of a major league team during or after the season. They may include waiving, releasing, and trading players, as well as assigning players to minor league teams.\nActive, expanded, and postseason rosters.\nAs of the 2022 season, each Major League Baseball team maintains a 26-man active roster, a 28-man expanded roster, and a 40-man reserve list of players. Players on the 26-man roster are eligible to play in official major league games throughout the season. The 40-man reserve list includes the players on the 26-man roster plus as many as 14 players who are either on the team's seven-, ten-, fifteen-, or 60-day injured list, who are on paternity leave for up to three days, or who are in the franchise's farm teams in Minor League Baseball. From September 1 through the end of the regular season, each team is required to expand its active roster to 28 players. (Before the 2020 season, any player on the 40-man reserve list, also referred to as the \"expanded roster\", was eligible to play in an official regular season game on or after September 1.) Many young players make their Major League debuts in this way, as \"September call-ups.\"\nTo be eligible for a team's postseason roster, a player must be on any of the following: (a) the 40-man reserve list, (b) the injured list, (c) the bereavement list, or (d) the restricted list as of August 31 at midnight ET. The only exception is that a player who is on the injured list at the end of the regular season may be replaced on the postseason roster by any other player who was in the organization on August 31, with the approval of the Commissioner. All players on the team's roster during the season will be eligible to receive a World Series ring after the team wins the World Series.\nThe August 31 rule was waived in for servicemen returning from World War II. Over the years, there have been several notable cases where a player acquired after the August 31 deadline made a significant contribution to a playoff-contending team but was ineligible for the postseason; for example, Pedro Ramos with the 1964 New York Yankees and Sparky Lyle with the 1980 Philadelphia Phillies.\nTrades.\nTeams may trade only players currently under contract. Trades between two or more major-league teams may freely occur at any time during a window that opens two days after the starting date of the final game of the most recent World Series and closes at 4 pm Eastern Daylight Time (UTC 2000) on July 31. MLB had allowed trades during the month of August if players cleared waivers, but August trades involving players on a team's 40-man reserve list were eliminated after the 2018 season per the Official Major League Rules, 9(b)(3).\nUnlike in the NFL, NHL, MLS, and the NBA, teams may not trade draft choices (with the exception of competitive balance draft selections, which can be traded as explained below), but may purchase the rights to Rule 5 Draft Picks.\nBeginning with the 2012 season, MLB allows one specific class of draft picks to be traded. As part of a newly signed collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players' union, each team is allocated a \"bonus pool\"—a set amount of money it can use to sign its draft picks for that year. Teams that go over their threshold can be penalized by losing one or more future draft picks. Those forfeited draft picks will eventually end up in the possession of small-revenue teams, which can then trade them if they wish. The first picks awarded under this scheme were for the 2013 draft.\nIf a player has been on an active major league roster for 10 full seasons and on one team for the last five, he may not be traded to another team without his consent (known as the 10 &amp; 5 rule). Additionally, some players negotiate to have no-trade clauses in their contracts that have the same effect.\nIn some trades, one of the components is a \"player to be named later\" which usually turns out to be a minor league player. The unnamed player is included as part of a trade when the teams cannot immediately agree on a specific player or when the player is not yet eligible to be traded. In these cases, the player in question must be named within six months. Cash or some other consideration may be exchanged in lieu of the player to be named later. For example, during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, the Minnesota Twins traded Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians at the trade deadline. Among the conditions of the trade were that if the Indians played no more games in 1994, \"Indians general manager John Hart must write a check for $100 made out to the Minnesota Twins and take Twins general manager Andy MacPhail out to dinner.\"\nWaivers.\nAny player under contract may be placed on waivers (\"waived\") at any time. Before the abolition of August trades in 2019, teams were \"required\" to place any player they wished to trade after MLB's July 31 trade deadline on waivers before trading him.\nIf a player is waived, any team may claim him. If more than one team claims the player from waivers, the team with the weakest record in the player's league gets preference. If no team in the player's league claims him, the claiming team with the weakest record in the other league gets preference. In the first month of the season, preference is determined using the previous year's standings.\nIf a team claims a player off waivers and has a viable claim as described above, his current team (the \"waiving team\") may choose one of the following options:\nIf a player is claimed and the waiving team exercises its rescission option, the waiving team may not use the option again for that player in that season—a subsequent waiver would be irrevocable with a claiming team getting the player essentially for nothing. If no team claims a player off waivers after three business days, the player has cleared waivers and may be assigned to a minor league team, traded (to any team), or released outright.\nThe waiver \"wire\" is a secret within the personnel of the Major League Baseball clubs; no official announcement of a waiver is made until a transaction actually occurs, although information sometimes leaks out. Before the abolition of post-July 31 trades, players were often waived during the post-July \"waiver-required\" trading period for teams to gauge trade interest in a particular player. Usually, when the player was claimed, the waiving team would rescind the waiver to avoid losing the player unless a trade could be worked out with the claiming team.\nThe National League (NL) was the first of the two major leagues to adopt the trade deadline rule in 1917. Originally it was enforced after June 15, but was later changed as the result of a new collective bargaining agreement. For many years, players could not be traded from one league to another without being waived by all of the teams in the trading team's league. Then, in , an inter-league trading period was established, centered on the winter baseball meetings in December. Later, there were two \"inter-league\" trading periods each year, one from after the World Series until mid-December and the second from a week before spring training began until March 15. So intent were leagues on keeping their stars from being moved from one league to the other, that then–National League President Warren Giles threatened to keep NL clubs from trading major stars to the American League after the deal that sent Frank Robinson from Cincinnati to Baltimore.\nAssignment to a minor league team.\nOptions.\nOptions are directed by MLB Rule 11 (C). A player has a finite number of option \"years\" in which he may be moved between the major and minor leagues up to five times per season as of 2022; previously, a player could be optioned an unlimited amount of times subject to the 15 day wait period for pitchers and two-way players and 10 day wait period for hitters except when either the \"27th man\" or injured list exception applied. If a player is on the 40-man reserve list but not on the active major league roster, he is said to be on optional assignment—his organization may freely move him between the major league club and the minor league club. The rules for this are as follows. (In all cases, an assignment of a player on a major-league injured list to the minors while on a rehabilitation assignment does not count as time spent in the minors.)\nPer the current collective bargaining agreement between MLB and the Players Association, effective as of the 2022 season, a player may be optioned to the minor leagues no more than five times in a given season. Once a player is optioned to the minors (except if recalled to serve as the \"27th man\" for a doubleheader), a player cannot be recalled to the majors for 10 days (if a position player) or 15 days (if a pitcher or two-way player) unless another player is placed on the injured list and a recall is to replace that player. Once all of the options have been used up on a player, a player is considered \"out of options\" and a player must be placed on and clear waivers prior to being sent down to the minor leagues (there is also the \"veterans' consent\" rule).\nThe option system was designed to prevent players from being buried in the minor leagues forever, by forcing teams to make a decision within a limited number of years on whether or not they can use a player in the Major Leagues. Once placed on the protected 40-man reserve list the player knows his team will have to bring him up to the majors, or expose him to being claimed on waivers so that another team can bring him to the majors, all within three years. Options do not \"reset\" if a player is traded - he still has only the original three option years that began when he was first placed on a team's 40-man reserve list.\nDesignated for assignment.\nA player who is designated for assignment (DFA) is immediately removed from the 40-man reserve list. This gives the team time to decide what to do with the player while freeing up a roster spot for another transaction, if needed. Once a player is designated for assignment, the team has seven days (it had been 10 days under the 2012–2016 Collective Bargaining Agreement) to do one of the following: the player can be traded, the player can be released, or the player can be put on waivers and, provided he clears, outrighted to the minors. A player who is outrighted to the minors is removed from the 40-man reserve list but is still paid according to the terms of his guaranteed contract. A player can only be outrighted once in his career without his consent.\nVeterans' consent.\nIf a player has 5 years of major-league service, he may not be assigned to a minor-league team without his consent. This exclusion applies regardless of whether he has not yet been outrighted once, has remaining options, or has cleared waivers. If the player withholds consent, the team must either release him or keep him on the major league roster. In either case, the player must continue to be paid under the terms of his contract. If he is released and signs with a new team, his previous team must pay the difference in salary between the two contracts if the previous contract called for a greater salary.\nInjured list.\nIf a major league player cannot play because of a medical condition, he may be placed on the 10-day injured list (IL) (15 days prior to the 2017 season; to be changed back to 15-days beginning the 2020 season). This removes the player from the 25-man roster, freeing up a space, but the player is ineligible to play for at least 10 consecutive days. Players on the 10-day injured list are still a part of the 40-man roster. An injured player may also be placed on the 60-day injured list to remove the player from the 40-man roster as well, with the condition of being ineligible to play for at least 60 consecutive days. However, the 40-man roster must be full before a player can be placed on the 60-day IL.\nIn 2011, a 7-day injured list was added specifically for players who have suffered a concussion. This was instituted to allow players who may recover from their concussions quickly to be removed from the active roster and replaced for a shorter period of time than the standard IL term. A player who is still suffering from concussion symptoms at the 7-day mark is automatically transferred to the 10-day IL. Both the brain injury and the player's recovery need to be verified by team and league doctors; the list is not intended for non-concussion injuries.\nPlayers placed on the 7-day or 10-day injured list may be moved to the 60-day injured list at any time, but not vice versa. Players may be placed on any injured list retroactively for a maximum of 5 inactive days and may remain on either list for as long as required to recover. During this 5-day period, a player's status is said to be day-to-day, indicating that the team is in the process of deciding whether the player must be placed on either IL or is healthy enough to return to active service. Injured players may not be traded without permission of the Commissioner nor may they be optioned to the minors, though they may be assigned to a minor league club for rehabilitation for a limited amount of time (30 days for pitchers, 20 for non-pitchers).\nUntil 2018, the injured list (IL) was called the disabled list (DL). MLB changed the name of the disabled list to the injured list beginning the 2019 season.\nPersonal leave.\nBereavement list.\nThe bereavement list may be used when a player finds it necessary to leave the team to attend to a serious illness or death in his (or his spouse's) immediate family. A player placed on the bereavement list must miss a minimum of three games and a maximum of seven games. The team can use another player from its 40-man roster to replace a player on the bereavement list. It was adopted beginning with the 2003 season.\nPaternity leave list.\nThe paternity leave list may be used when a player chooses to leave the team to attend the birth of his child. A player placed on the paternity leave list must miss the next team game, but no more than three games. The team can use another player from its 40-man roster to replace a player on the paternity leave list. This list was adopted beginning with the season.\nRule 5 draft.\nIf a player not on a 40-man reserve list has spent four years with a minor-league contract, originally signed when 19 or older or five years when signed before the age of 19, he is eligible to be chosen by any team in the rule 5 draft during the offseason. No team is required to choose a player in the draft, but some do. If chosen, the player must be kept on the selecting team's 26-man major league roster for the entire season after the draft—he may not be optioned or designated to the minors. The selecting team may, at any time, waive the rule 5 draftee, such as when they no longer wish to keep him on their major league roster. If a rule 5 draftee clears waivers, he must be offered back to the original team, effectively canceling the rule 5 draft choice. Once a rule 5 draftee spends an entire season on his new team's 26-man roster, his status reverts to normal and he may be optioned or designated for assignment. To prevent the abuse of the rule 5 draft, the rule also states that the draftee must be active for at least 90 days. This keeps teams from drafting players, then \"hiding\" them on the injured list for the majority of the season. For example, if a rule 5 draftee was only active for 67 days in his first season with his new club, he must be active for an additional 23 days in his second season to satisfy the rule 5 requirements.\nAny player chosen in the rule 5 draft may be traded to any team while under the rule 5 restrictions, but the restrictions transfer to the new team. If the new team does not want to keep the player on their 26-man roster for the season, he must be offered back to the team he was on when he was chosen in the draft.\nThe intent of the rule 5 draft is to prevent teams from holding major league-potential players in the minor leagues when other teams would be willing to have them play in the majors. However, this draft has also become an opportunity for a team to take a top prospect from another team who might not be ready for the major leagues. For example, Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana was chosen by the Florida Marlins four years before winning the award, when the Houston Astros declined to put him on their 40-man roster. The Marlins chose Santana in the 1999 rule 5 draft, and traded him to the Minnesota Twins who kept him on their roster for the 2000 season, in which he toiled to a 6.49 earned run average at only 21 years of age. Two years later, he legitimized himself as a Major League pitcher, with an ERA under 3.00, and two years after that, he was recognized as one of the best pitchers in the league. Had he not been chosen in the rule 5 draft, he likely would not have made his major-league debut until the 2001 or the 2002 season with the Astros.\nRoberto Clemente is the only Rule 5 draft pick to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, having been selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the then Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955."

        "title": "Mike Fisher (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Michael Andrew Fisher (born June 5, 1980) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey centre who played for the Ottawa Senators and Nashville Predators in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Senators in the second round, 44th overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nFisher grew up playing hockey in the Peterborough Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) with the rep Minor Petes program. He was drafted from Jr. A Peterborough Petes (OHA) by the Sudbury Wolves in the second round, 22nd overall, in the 1997 OHL Priority Draft. After putting up 49 points in 66 games in his first year with the Wolves, Fisher was drafted in the second round, 44th overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. Returning to the OHL for one more season, Fisher recorded 106 points, fifth overall in league scoring.\nOttawa Senators.\nFisher debuted with the Senators in 1999–2000 and recorded 9 points in an injury-shortened 32-game rookie season. He became known for his aggressive style of play and began to also show his penchant for offensive production as he improved to 18 goals and 38 points in his fourth season in 2002–03.\nDuring the lock-out year of 2004–05, Fisher played overseas for EV Zug in the Swiss Nationalliga A. As NHL play resumed the next season, in 2005–06, Fisher emerged with 22 goals and 44 points, providing valuable secondary scoring for the Spezza-Heatley-Alfredsson line. He helped the Senators to a first seed in the Eastern Conference going into the playoffs, but they were defeated by the fourth-seeded division rivals Buffalo Sabres in five games in the second round. With a career-high plus-minus (+/-) rating of +23 in the regular season, Fisher was nominated for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward. He finished as second runner-up behind Jere Lehtinen of the Dallas Stars and trophy-winner Rod Brind'Amour, captain of the Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe following season, Fisher duplicated his previous campaign's goals total with 22 and improved to a personal best 26 assists and 48 points. He was kept to 68 games due to a left knee injury, sustained on December 27, 2006, against the New York Islanders, forcing him to sit out four weeks. In the playoffs, Fisher helped the Senators to the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, where they fell short to the Anaheim Ducks in five games. Fisher posted career playoff highs with 5 goals, 5 assists and 10 points in 20 games.\nWith one year left on his contract heading into the 2007–08 season, Fisher re-signed with the Senators to a five-year, $21 million contract extension. He went on to set a career-high 23 goals that season. However, Fisher was forced to miss the playoffs, injuring his left knee in a knee-on-knee hit from Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mark Bell in the final game of the regular season.\nA month and a half into the 2008–09 season, Fisher suffered another knee injury, straining a ligament in his right knee against the New York Islanders on November 17, 2008.\nNashville Predators.\nOn February 10, 2011, Fisher was traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for the Predators' 2011 first round draft pick (Stefan Noesen) and a conditional pick in 2012 (Jarrod Maidens). The condition was that should the Predators win a playoff series, the Senators would receive a third-round pick, and a second round pick if the Predators won two or more playoff series. The Predators won their first round playoff but ultimately lost their second round series, to the Vancouver Canucks, meaning the Senators received a third-round pick. According to Fisher, although there were many trade deals for him, Ottawa GM Bryan Murray and Ottawa owner Eugene Melnyk had chosen to accept Nashville's offer so that Fisher could be closer to his wife, country singer Carrie Underwood.\nFisher played his first game with the Predators on February 12, 2011, and registered an assist in a 5–3 win over the Colorado Avalanche. He scored his first goal as a Predator five days later, on February 17, against the Vancouver Canucks.\nFisher was the winner of the 2012 NHL Foundation Player Award, awarded to the NHL player who applies the core values of hockey – commitment, perseverance and teamwork – to enrich the lives of people in his community.\nOn July 7, 2014, the Predators announced that Fisher had been injured during a training session and ruptured his Achilles tendon. This caused him to be out four-to-six months rehabbing the injury and missing the beginning of the season. Fisher finished the 2014–15 season with 19 goals and 39 points in 59 games. On June 26, 2015, just prior to becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1, Fisher signed a two-year, $8.8 million contract extension with the Predators, paying $4.8 million in 2015–16 and $4 million in 2016–17.\nOn December 1, 2015, Fisher suffered a lower-body injury in a game against the Arizona Coyotes. He was placed on injured reserve and only began skating again on December 19. On March 2, 2016, Fisher played in his 1,000th game. On May 5, 2016, he scored with 8:48 left in triple overtime in game four of the Western Conference Semi-finals to beat the San Jose Sharks 4–3, tying the series at two games apiece and ending the longest game in Nashville franchise history.\nOn September 7, 2016, Fisher was named the sixth captain of the Predators after previous captain Shea Weber was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for defenseman P. K. Subban. He led the Predators to the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals eventually losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. On August 3, 2017, Fisher announced his retirement from the NHL via a letter addressed to Predators fans in that day's edition of \"The Tennessean\", becoming the first Predators captain to retire with the team.\nOn January 31, 2018, Fisher announced that he intended to end his retirement to help the Predators make another Stanley Cup run. Fisher said that he would practice with the Predators and eventually sign a contract before the trade deadline of February 26, 2018. On February 26, 2018, Fisher signed a one-year contract with the Predators. In his final season, Fisher registered two goals and four points in 16 games with the Predators and only one goal in 12 playoff games. Fisher retired for a second time on May 12, 2018, a few days after the Predators were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Winnipeg Jets.\nPersonal life.\nFisher was born and raised in Peterborough, Ontario, to parents Jim and Karen and is a devout Christian. He has two brothers (Rob and Gregory, aka \"Bud\") and one sister (Meredith). Fisher's uncle is David Fisher, a former chaplain to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club. Fisher's brother Gregory is also a hockey player; he is a goaltender who played for Quinnipiac University in the ECAC. On October 23, 2009, Gregory replaced the Senators' then-starting goaltender Pascal Leclaire in net during a Senators' practice after Leclaire fell ill.\nIn the off-season, Fisher devotes time to hockey camps in his hometown in Peterborough, Kingston and Ottawa through Hockey Ministries International. Fisher has also been a guest instructor at the Roger Neilson Hockey Camp.\nFisher is married to American singer Carrie Underwood. They met backstage after one of Underwood's concerts in 2008. The couple became engaged on December 20, 2009. On July 10, 2010, Fisher married Underwood at The Ritz-Carlton Lodge, Reynolds Plantation, in Greensboro, Georgia, with more than 250 people in attendance. Underwood surprised Fisher by having one of their favorite artists, Brandon Heath, sing his song \"Love Never Fails\" for their first dance. It was announced on September 1, 2014, that Fisher and Underwood were expecting their first child together. In February 2015, Underwood gave birth to their first child, a son. In January 2019, she gave birth to their second son. \nOn March 21, 2019, Fisher became a United States citizen."

        "text": "The Bangladesh A cricket team, also known as Bangladesh Emerging cricket team, is a cricket team representing Bangladesh, and is the second tier of international Bangladeshi cricket below the full Bangladesh national cricket team. The team played its first game, against the full Pakistan side, in Savar in January 2002.\nTours by Bangladesh A.\nBangladesh A have toured regularly. On their first two tours they took part in domestic competitions in the host countries. Since then they have played most of their tour matches against the host countries’ A teams, except for their tours of England, when they have mostly played against county teams.\n2001-02 Busta Cup in the West Indies.\nBetween late January and early March 2002 Bangladesh A competed as the eighth team in the 2001-02 Busta Cup, the domestic first-class competition in the West Indies. Captained by the Test player Akram Khan, they played seven matches, winning one and losing five, and finished seventh. The average age of the team was 22, and they struggled to adapt to the conditions. None of the team scored a century. Mosaddek Hossain, who was 18 at the time, was the most successful player, taking 21 wickets with his leg-spin at an average of 32.23. The highest scorer was Mazharul Haque, with 451 runs at an average of 32.21.\nThe victory over Windward Islands was the first first-class victory by any Bangladeshi representative team. Tushar Imran, who was also 18 years old, scored 46 and 79 and was named man of the match. Mosaddek Hossain took 3 for 41 and 5 for 81 in the eight-run victory.\n2003-04 PCB Patron's Trophy in Pakistan.\nIn December 2003 and January 2004 Bangladesh A competed in the 2003-04 PCB Patron's Trophy in Pakistan. Using 25 players, they played six matches, losing four and drawing the other two. Shahriar Hossain scored 218, the only double-century in that season's competition, in the drawn match against Defence Housing Authority.\nDuring the same period Bangladesh A also competed in Pakistan's Patron's Cup List A tournament, winning two and losing four of their six matches.\n2004-05 in Zimbabwe.\nIn February and March 2005, Bangladesh A played three first-class matches followed by five List A matches against Zimbabwe A in Bulawayo and Kwekwe. Captained by Shahriar Nafees, Bangladesh A won all three first-class matches, but under the captaincy of Sanwar Hossain they lost the List A series 2–3.\nThe highest first-class innings for Bangladesh A was scored by Mushfiqur Rahim, who made 111 not out and 50 in the second match, his second first-class match at the age of 16. He made his Test debut at Lord's three months later. Enamul Haque (aged 18), Shahadat Hossain (aged 18) and Shakib Al Hasan (aged 17) shared the bowling honours, Haque taking the best innings and match figures with 7 for 49 and 3 for 69 in the first match. All three subsequently played Test cricket.\n2005 in England.\n\"See Bangladesh A cricket team in England in 2005\"\nShortly after the Bangladeshi Test team toured England in 2005, a Bangladesh A team also toured, again captained by Shariar Nafees, playing five first-class matches (of which they lost three and drew two) and three List A matches (won two, lost one) in July and August. Six of the team had been part of the earlier Test squad. The outstanding player was Tushar Imran, who had not been part of the Test squad, who scored 467 runs in first-class matches at an average of 58.37, including the team's only two centuries.\n2006 in Zimbabwe.\nThe tour to Zimbabwe in June and July 2006 followed the same pattern as the tour in 2005: three first-class matches followed by five List A matches, all against Zimbabwe A. This time, along with matches in Bulawayo and Kwekwe again, two matches were played in Mutare. Tushar Imran captained the team, most of whom had Test experience.\nBangladesh A won the first first-class match, drew the second, and lost the third; they won the List A series 4–1. The outstanding player in the first-class matches was Enamul Haque, who took five wickets in each first innings and finished with 22 wickets at an average of 17.18. The highest scorer in the first-class matches was Alok Kapali, with 336 runs, including two centuries, at an average of 67.20. Mehrab Hossain scored a century in each innings in the second match.\n2006-07 in Sri Lanka.\nBangladesh A toured Sri Lanka in March and April 2007, playing two first-class and three List A matches against Sri Lanka A. Tushar Imran again captained the team. All five matches were lost by large margins. No centuries were scored.\n2008 in Ireland and England.\nA young team of 22 players toured Ireland and England from mid-June to early August 2008. Nobody was older than 26, and 17 were under 22. The captain, Junaid Siddique, was 20. They played four first-class matches (winning won and drawing three), four List A matches (winning one and losing three), one Twenty20 match (lost) and three minor matches. The only century was scored by Raqibul Hasan in the List A match against MCC.\n2010-11 in South Africa.\nBangladesh A, captained by the experienced Test player Mohammad Ashraful, toured South Africa in April 2011, playing two first-class and four List A matches against South Africa A. South Africa A won all the matches comfortably, except for the second first-class match, which was ruined by rain, and the first List A match, in which Ashraful took 3 for 27 and made 118 not out off 99 balls to lead Bangladesh A to a six-wicket victory. Ashraful's was the only century for Bangladesh A.\n2011-12 in the West Indies.\nIn November 2011 Bangladesh A visited the West Indies, playing two first-class, two Twenty20, and two List A matches against West Indies A in Antigua and Saint Vincent. The captain was Jahurul Islam.\nThey drew the first first-class match and lost the second by one wicket; they won the first Twenty20 by one wicket and lost the second by 55 runs; and they lost the two List A matches. Their only centuries came in the first match, when Mominul Haque (150) and Nasir Hossain (134) added 259 for the fifth wicket after the first four wickets had fallen for 59.\n2013 in England.\nAn experienced 15-man Bangladesh A team, again captained by Jahurul Islam, toured England in August 2013, playing eight List A matches: five against county teams followed by three against England Lions. Bangladesh A had generally sound batting but ineffective bowling, and they lost their first seven matches. They won their last match after chasing the England Lions total of 319 for 7, when Farhad Reza hit a six off the last ball of the 50th over.\n2014 in the West Indies.\nIn May and June 2014 Bangladesh A played seven matches in Barbados against teams representing the Sagicor High Performance Centre: two first-class, three List A and two Twenty20 matches. The young West Indians outclassed Bangladesh A in every match except the first Twenty20 match, which Bangladesh A won easily. Nasir Hossain captained the team in the two first-class matches, and Naeem Islam was the captain in the limited-overs matches.\n2015-16 in India.\nIn September 2015 Bangladesh A visited India and played three List A matches against India A in Bangalore, and two first-class matches, one against Karnataka in Mysore and one against India A in Bangalore. The team was captained by Mominul Haque.\nIndia A won the first and third List A matches. Bangladesh A won the second, thanks to Nasir Hossain, who scored 102 off 96 balls then took 5 for 36. Karnataka won their first-class match by four wickets, then India A overwhelmed Bangladesh A by an innings. In Bangladesh A's first innings, Sabbir Rahman, going to the wicket after the first three wickets had fallen for two runs, scored 122 not out off 131 balls out of a team total of 228.\n2015-16 in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nA team captained by Shuvagata Hom toured South Africa and Zimbabwe a few weeks after the tour to India. They played four minor matches against South African provincial teams in Pretoria in October 2015, winning one and losing three, before going on to Zimbabwe in November to play five matches at the Harare Sports Club. They played three List A matches against Zimbabwe A, winning them all comfortably; Mithun Ali scored 100, 66 and 60. Two first-class matches followed which were evenly contested. Bangladesh A won the first by 14 runs and the second was drawn. Tasamul Haque scored 102 in the second match.\n2018 in Ireland.\nA team toured Ireland to play five unofficial ODIs (captained by Mominul Haque) and three unofficial T20s (captained by Soumya Sarkar) in August 2018.\n2019-20 in Sri Lanka.\nA team visited Sri Lanka in September and October 2019 to play three first-class matches and three List A matches. The captain in the first-class matches was Mominul Haque, and in the List A matches it was Mithun Ali.\nSeries in Bangladesh.\n2019, Afghanistan A.\nBangladesh A hosted Afghanistan A in July 2019 for two first-class and five 50-over matches.\n2021, Ireland Wolves.\nIreland Wolves toured Bangladesh to play one first-class match, five 50-over matches and one Twenty20 match in February and March 2021."

With 32 teams having entered the 1934 competition, FIFA organized qualification rounds to select 16 teams for the finals. Even Italy, the host of the World Cup, had to earn its spot, the only time this has been the case. The previous champion Uruguay refused to defend its title because many European nations had declined to take part in the 1930 World Cup, held in Uruguay.\nOf the 32 teams which entered,\nThe first match, between Sweden and Estonia, took place in Stockholm on 11 June 1933, with Swedish player Knut Kroon scoring the first goal. The last match was played in Rome only three days before the start of the tournament, as late entrant United States beat Mexico to become the final team to qualify.\nFormat.\nThe 32 teams were divided into 12 groups, based on geographical considerations, as follows:\nThe 12 groups had different rules, as follows:\nKey:\nGroups.\nGroup 1.\nEstonia v Lithuania was not played since neither team could qualify with a win.\nSweden qualified.\nGroup 2.\n11–1 on aggregate; Spain qualified.\nGroup 3.\nItaly qualified, as Greece declined to play the second match.\nGroup 4.\nBulgaria withdrew, and the remaining matches were not played since Hungary and Austria were already assured of the top two spots.\nHungary and Austria qualified.\nGroup 5.\nCzechoslovakia qualified.\nGroup 6.\nRomania and Switzerland qualified.\nGroup 7.\nNetherlands and Belgium qualified (Belgium finished above the Irish Free State on goal average).\nGroup 8.\nGermany v France was not played since both teams were already assured of the top two spots.\nGermany and France qualified.\nGroup 9.\nPeru withdrew, so Brazil qualified automatically.\nGroup 10.\nChile withdrew, so Argentina qualified automatically.\nGroup 11.\nFirst round.\n10–2 on aggregate; Cuba advanced to the Second Round.\nSecond round.\n12–3 on aggregate; Mexico advanced to the Final Round.\nFinal round.\nThe match to decide whether the United States or Mexico would qualify was played only three days before the start of the final tournament, as the United States submitted their entry too late.

        "title": "Clipping (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Clipping is a penalty in the sport of ice hockey. It is generally recognized as hitting an opposing player at or below the other player's knees. Clipping should not be confused with hip checking, where one player hits an opponent with his hips, although occasionally a hip check will result in a clipping call. A player is generally assessed a minor penalty for clipping, unless an injury is caused, in which case a major penalty and a misconduct or game misconduct will result. It is one of the most rarely called penalties in the sport.\nHistorically, players penalized for clipping are labeled as \"dirty\" players, as clipping is nearly always viewed as attempt to injure an opponent.\nAdditionally, Rule 639(a) of the USA Hockey Rulebook states:\n“Any player who deliberately leaves his feet and contacts an opponent with any part of his body thereby causing the opponent to trip or fall shall be assessed a minor penalty (Clipping).(Note 3) This rule does not apply to a player who has dropped to his knee(s) to block a shot.”\nHistory.\nClipping was instituted as a rule in the National Hockey League in 2002, following a low hit on 26 April by Toronto Maple Leafs forward Darcy Tucker on New York Islanders captain Michael Peca. The hit occurred during a Stanley Cup playoff matchup between the two teams, and Peca was unable to play for the remainder of the season. When the NHL added the new rule, the videotape distributed by the league showed the hit as an example of a clipping penalty that would result in an automatic game misconduct."

It is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and is listed as an international Test cricket venue.\nCounty cricket.\nThe venue is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club, which has played its home matches there since 24 May 1967, after moving away from Cardiff Arms Park. A 125-year lease of the ground was acquired in 1995, with the previous leaseholder, Cardiff Athletic Club, moving its cricket section (Cardiff Cricket Club) to the Diamond Ground in Whitchurch. Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the Sport Wales National Centre. Cardiff Corinthians F.C. have previously used the area for football.\nInternational cricket.\nSophia Gardens has been an international cricket venue since 20 May 1999, when it played host to the 1999 Cricket World Cup match between Australia and New Zealand. From 2001 to 2012, the ground was a regular venue for One Day Internationals, hosting nine matches in 12 years, but it was not until 2006 that it hosted its first England match, the first match of the series against Pakistan on 30 August 2006. In 2012, the ground was named as one of three venues for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, along with The Oval and Edgbaston; it hosted five matches, including the opener between India and South Africa on 6 June 2013, and the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka on 20 June. The ground also hosted two Twenty20 Internationals between England and Pakistan in September 2010, and hosted another against Australia in August 2015.\nOn 11 April 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the venue would host a series of major Test matches over the next four years. It would host its first Test match on 8 July 2009 as the opening match of an Ashes series between England and Australia. This made Sophia Gardens the 100th Test match venue. In July 2011, the ECB stripped the ground of its right to host the 2012 West Indies Test because of Glamorgan's late payment of the £2.5 million fee it owed for hosting the 2011 Sri Lanka Test. The ground was originally set to host a Test match against New Zealand in 2013, but this was given up in exchange for the 2013 Champions Trophy. The ground was chosen as the venue for the first Test of the 2015 Ashes series.\nThe ground was one of 11 venues for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was host for four group matches.\nStadium redevelopment.\nThe cost of redeveloping the stadium was £9.4 million. About half of this (£4.5 million) being provided as a loan by Cardiff Council. It is possible that the revamped stadium could host seven Test matches, nine One Day Internationals and two World Cup games up to 2028, injecting at least £50 million into the local economy. Construction work on the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens began in April 2007, and the redeveloped stadium was first opened for competitive matches on 9 May 2008, when the Glamorgan Dragons played the Gloucestershire Gladiators in a Friends Provident Trophy match which the Gladiators won by six wickets.\nStadium naming rights.\nOn 4 March 2008, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with SWALEC, thought to be the biggest single sponsorship by a county cricket club, giving SWALEC the naming rights to the new stadium, worth in excess of £1.5 million over 10 years.\nIn June 2015, ahead of the First Test of the 2015 Ashes series, the stadium was renamed as simply \"The SSE SWALEC\" in reflection of the ownership of sponsors SWALEC by SSE plc. The new logo from June 2015 was designed to reflect the shape of the stadium. In April 2018 the stadium officially reverted to its original name of Sophia Gardens following the end of the sponsorship deal."

        "title": "Figure skating at the 1972 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The figure skating events at the 1972 Winter Olympics were held at the Makomanai Skating Rink and the Mikaho Indoor Skating Rink.\nThe results of both the men's and ladies' singles events were dominated by placements in the compulsory figures, which at the time were nominally worth 50% of the total score but in fact weighted more heavily than the free skating due to being judged using a wider range of marks.\nIn the men's event, Ondrej Nepela, the winner of the compulsory figures segment, took the gold in spite of placing only 4th in the free skating after falling on his triple loop jump. The free skating winner was Sergei Chetverukhin, who skated one of his best performances at this event to take the silver medal. Patrick Péra, second in the figures, had a poor free skating in which he fell on a triple salchow jump early in his program and then made other mistakes. Nonetheless, the weight given to figures allowed him to take the bronze medal ahead of John Misha Petkevich, Kenneth Shelley, and Toller Cranston, who all skated dynamic programs with at least one cleanly landed triple jump apiece.\nThe effect of the figures was even more pronounced in the ladies' competition, where gold medal winner Beatrix Schuba placed only 7th in the free skating, performing mostly single jumps. The free skating was won by Janet Lynn, who received a perfect mark of 6.0 despite falling on a flying sit spin. Lynn's skating captivated the Japanese audience, especially when she got up smiling from her fall. Lynn took the bronze while Karen Magnussen, second in the free skating with a strong performance, took the silver. The third place skater in the free skating, Sonja Morgenstern, included a triple salchow in her program, which at this time was very rare for a female skater. She placed 6th overall.\nThe pairs competition was a tight battle between the two top Russian teams. Irina Rodnina / Alexei Ulanov did not skate their best, with Ulanov missing his required double salchow jump in the short program and Rodnina making an error in the jump combination at the beginning of their free skating. They eventually won a 6–3 decision over their teammates Liudmila Smirnova / Andrei Suraikin. The bronze medal team of Manuela Groß / Uwe Kagelmann made no major errors and received the highest technical merit marks from some of the judges for their program. Their elements included a throw double axel which at this time was rarely attempted.\nMedal table.\nParticipating NOCs.\nEighteen nations participated in figure skating at the 1972 Games.\nResults.\nMen.\nReferee:\nAssistant Referee:\nJudges:\nLadies.\nIn the ladies' event, American skater Janet Lynn won not only a bronze medal, but also tremendous popularity among Japanese audiences because of her artistic free program, as to make appearance on the cover of \"Olympic Winter Games, Sapporo 1972\" photo books published in Japan, and even on Japanese TV commercials later.\nReferee:\nAssistant Referee:\nJudges:\nPairs.\nReferee:\nAssistant Referee:\nJudges:"

        "text": "Women's ice hockey in Great Britain is administered by the English and Scottish Ice Hockey Associations. It is one of the fastest growing areas of the game.\nThe British Women's Leagues were formed with six teams in 1984. The founder members of the league were:\nOf those teams, only two are still in league play today, Oxford University and Solihull, while the Cambridge University has a non-league team. After the Ravens folded, a new team, the Penguins, was set up in Peterborough.\nLeague structure.\nIn England and Wales, 28 teams play in the British Women's Leagues. The top 6 teams in the country play in the Elite League, with a Premier league consisting of 8 teams, and below that two unequally sized divisions, split by north (consisting of 4 teams) and south (consisting of 9 teams).\nIn the Premier Division, the sides play each other, one home, once away, with the team ranked highest being declared champion of the league and promoted to the Elite League.\nAt the end of the season, the top four Premier sides and top three Division One sides from each region converge for the 'Trophy Weekend'. The Premier Sides play for the Chairman's Cup, while the Division One sides play for the Division One Trophy.\nIn addition to the playoffs, there is promotion and relegation between the Elite, Premier, and Division 1 leagues. In 2004/05, this was decided with a Playoff Weekend at Coventry. The Division One sides played first in a one-off game; the following day the winner of that game played the 10th ranked team in the Premier league, to decide who played in the Premier and Division 1 leagues for the following season.\nIn 2007–08 season the EIHA introduced women's U16 teams to the league structure. Three teams (Oxford, Streatham and Bracknell) were created in a Southern Division and four teams were created in the women's U16 Northern Division. For 2008–09, Oxford folded and was replaced by Peterborough in the South.\nTeams.\nElite League (2019/2020 season).\nPremier League (2019/2020 season)\nDivision 1 North League (2019/2020 season)\nDivision 1 South League (2019/2020 season)\nHistory.\nBelow is a list of the winners of the major competitions. The team's standing is shown in win–loss–tie format.\nWomen's English League.\nThe Women's England League was the first incarnation of the league, starting with five teams before moving up to seven by 1988. An influx of interest from new teams resulted in a complete regionalisation of the sport, a system that lasted two years.\nRegionalised British League.\nOverall champion.\nOxford City Rockets declared unofficial champions after beating Streatham in a regional playoff by four goals to one. Rockets were never able to play the final against Sunderland (champions of the Northern Division).\nCapital/South Division.\nAfter two years of this format, the system switched to the structure that exists to the present day, making it after 15 years one of the longest lasting formats of any ice hockey league that ever has been in the UK.\nTrophy Weekend.\nThe Trophy Weekend has been split into the Bill Britton Memorial Trophy and D1 Trophy. The Memorial Trophy sees 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd in the Premier League, with the winners playing the final the following day.\nPrior to the Memorial Trophy being renamed, it was called the Chairman's Cup.\nThe D1 Trophy sees the Champion of the North playing the runner-up of the South, and Champion of the South vs runner-up of the North, with the winners playing the final the following day.\nThe introduction of the Women's U16 Northern and Southern (season 2007/08) created a third play-off final between the winners of each league.\nPromotion/relegation playoffs.\nInformation on these playoffs is sketchy; however, the following contains most of them. Playoffs were not held in every season due to either team's not wanting to go for promotion to the higher league, or a natural expansion of the Premier League.\nKnockout Cup.\nThe Knockout Cup was proposed to allow teams of different standard to play each other, and also to increase the number of competitions played in the women's game.\nRegional/national/international sides.\nIn the UK, there are five sides that play at regional, national and international levels.\nRegional Level.\nEngland is divided into two regional sides, featuring the best players who have not been selected for Team Great Britain. The regional sides are a recent addition to assist with the development of the top women's and girls' hockey in the UK. For the purposes of the records shown, only games against other regional, national or international teams shall be considered.\nIn addition, the conference sections are divided into Senior and Junior (U16) teams.\nNational teams.\nIn total there are three National teams, although Team England has been defunct since 2002. 2006 saw the England team reinstated and an Under 16 England added to the list of national teams. In August 2006 both teams travelled to Prague for a training camp, followed by a tournament in Pilzen which saw the Senior Team play their way to a silver medal.\nDetails of all Home Internationals known are shown below:\nThe overall records of the teams are therefore:\nTeam GB.\nTeam Great Britain is the national side that represents the UK in firstly the European Championships followed by the IIHF World Championships.\nBelow is a guide to GB's performances year by year. Only 'competitive' games (challenge matches ignored) are counted for the records.\n1989.\nTeam GB re-entered the world of international Hockey with a European Championship two-leg qualifying match against the Netherlands in Chelmsford. GB battled hard in both games but were defeated by an experienced Dutch side, winning both games by the margin of four goals to two, giving the Dutch an 8–4 aggregate win and a place in the European Championship.\nOverall record: 0–2–0\n1990.\nNo official competitions existed; however, GB defeated the Dutch in Amsterdam 1–0 in a challenge match.\n1991.\nTeam GB took part in the 1991 European Championship finishing 9th out of 10 teams. Placed in a very tough Group B, they lost their first three games to Sweden (0–16), Denmark (0–4) and Germany (0–6) before surprising the Czech Republic with a 2–2 draw in their final game. GB finished bottom of their group, and played Holland in the 9th/10th playoff which they won 3–0.\nRecord: 1–3–1\n1993.\nAfter the break for an Olympic year, GB started again in the newly formed European Championship Pool B. Following an opening loss against Latvia (0–3), GB repeated their performance against the Czech Republic from two years previous, this time with a 1–1 draw. France dispatched GB easily in the third game by 7 goals to 2, and GB won their first international game in the final match of the tournament with a 1–0 win over the Ukraine. giving GB a 4th place finish out of five teams, with GB only missing a medal by one point.\nRecord: 1–2–1\n1995.\nGB went to Denmark for the IIHF European Women's Championships Pool B in March 1995, faced a tough group on paper and proved to be a tough group on ice. GB fell to their worst defeat in four years in the opening game with a 14–1 defeat to Denmark. Slovakia defeated GB 4–1 and in the final group game Holland put seven past the Brits, with only two coming back.\nThe 7th/8th playoff game saw GB take on the Ukraine, the only side they had beaten in competitive hockey so far. Ukraine skated to a 2–0 victory which saw GB finish 8th out of eight teams.\nRecord: 0–4–0\nTeam roster:\n1996.\nA trip to Slovakia was in store for GB in Pool B in 1996. GB started positively with a much better account against Denmark who they had been routed against the previous year falling only to a 5–0 defeat. Any hopes of a great comeback were dashed in their second game against the Danes who GB had previously done well against, collapsing to a 7–1 defeat. That scoreline was repeated in the final group round game against the Dutch to leave GB adrift at the bottom of their group.\nThe 7th/8th playoff saw GB take on Kazakhstan and for the first time in the tournament. Kazakhstan was just able to edge ahead and won by the odd goal in 9 leaving GB in 8th out of eight place and without a win in two years.\nRecord: 0–4–0\nTeam roster:\n1999.\nSzékesfehérvár, Hungary\nFollowing a re-structure in the World Championships, and no championship in 1998 due to it being an Olympic year, GB finally came back into the new Pool B Qualifying Group to decide the final spot in Pool B for the following year.\nGreat Britain opened brightly holding Italy to a 1–1 draw after 40 minutes in the opening game before Italy stepping the game up a gear to skate out to a 4–1 victory; however, the signs looked good. The next game was against South Africa, which ended to be a sporting contest on the opening puck drop with GB running up their highest ever victory at international level with a 22–0 victory.\nAfter a slow start in the final game GB hit the host team Hungary hard with five quick goals in a match that ended up as 9–1 to the Brits, leaving them to finish 2nd out of four teams.\nRecord: 2–1–0\nTeam roster:\n2000.\nSzékesfehérvár, Hungary\nIt was back to Hungary in 2000, for the Pool B Qualifying Tournament. GB again had a strong start with the Brits 1–1 against the Group Favorites DPR Korea in their first game. Korea struck back with two 2nd period goals but despite a fightback by GB, the game ended up 4–2 to the Asian side.\nAustralia were next up for GB and were comfortably dispatched by seven goals to one. GB finally defeated Holland in a competitive game, 11 years after their first attempt with a comfortable 5–2 victory. GB again finished second out of four teams in their group.\nBelgium, who finished second in the other group, took on GB in the 3rd/4th place playoff. GB comfortably dispatched the Belgians by 8 goals to 1 which saw GB ranked overall third out of eight teams.\nRecord: 3–1–0\nTeam roster:\n2001.\nMaribor, Slovenia\nPool B overnight was renamed Division 1, but apart from that the challenge stayed the same for GB with their third straight attempt at qualification into the 2nd tier.\nGB looked to their first game against hosts Slovenia to set the standard for the tournament and they did not disappoint. 5–0 up after 20 minutes, they went on to win 12–0. Hungary also fell to a GB by 12 goals to 0 in Game 2, and with GB dispatching the Aussies by 4–2 in Game 3 they were left in the pleasant situation of played 3, won 3, scored 28, conceded 2.\nSlovakia took on GB in the final game. Despite getting a goal back in the 3rd, Team GB went down to a 4–1 defeat against Slovakia and finished second in their group for the third consecutive year.\nRecord: 3–1–0\nTeam roster:\n2002.\nHull, UK\nAn Olympic year saw no official hockey taking place, but the IIHF hosted a women's challenge tri-series between Italy, Belgium and GB, held in Hull.\nGB beat Belgium, but fell to Italy to finish second in the three team group.\nTeam roster:\n2003.\nLecco, Italy\nThe tea were off to Italy for Division 2, which now sported six teams in direct parity with the men's game for the first time.\nGB collapsed to the worst possible start against longtime foes Slovakia. 5–0 down after the first period, they ended up losing 8–1 to the Eastern Bloc side. Game 2 against group favourites Norway was just as tough for the Brits along a spirited performance saw them just 1–0 down after the first GB collapsed to an 8–3 defeat.\nGame 3 against Denmark saw a pulsating clash from end to end which saw GB register their first points with a 4–4 draw; however, after leading the Danes were 1–0 at the end of the 1st. The Netherlands, a long term bogey team of the Brits, skated to a 4–2 win over GB. GB's final game against Italy proved too much for them and they were defeated as they had been the previous year to an experienced Italian side, this time 4–2.\nGB were relegated, or so was thought. However, due to the SARS pandemic in China the World Championships were cancelled for that year and the IIHF did not relegate any teams from any divisions, effectively rescuing GB from relegation.\nRecord: 0–4–1\nTeam roster:\n2004.\nVipiteno-Sterzing, Italy\nFrom a standings point of view, the 2004 saw GB's worst ever performance in international ice hockey, with defeats to Denmark, Italy, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Australia.\nHowever, when a team is washed out a goal on a wraparound due to the referee 'losing sight of the puck' as it went round the net, there is not much to be done. GB battled desperately hard under some of the worst refereeing ever seen in an international competition.\nGB were relegated to Division 3 along with Australia.\nRecord: 0–5–0\nTeam roster:\n2005.\nCape Town, South Africa\nDivision III was the setting for GB. GB started off the tournament in impressive fashion easily dispatching Hungary 5–0 followed by an 11–0 demolition of Belgium.\nGB's minds were however firmly planted on the 3rd game, without a doubt the title decider. GB went a goal down at 26:56 before Newcastle's Teresa Lewis opened the account for GB on the half hour mark.\nWith the scores neatly tied at 1 heading into the final period, GB battled hard. University of New Hampshire's Angela Taylor picked up a penalty for highsticking at 47:39, and with eight seconds left in the game heartbreak as Slovenia took the lead. GB were never able to get back in the game and ended losing 4–1 with the final goal placed into the empty net.\nGame 4 saw GB take out their frustrations of the previous game with a 19–0 victory over South Africa, who were saved relegation by the IIHF Women's Committee as they expanded the Elite competition to nine teams, and thus no teams were relegated this time around.\nGame 5 saw GB finally lay the ghost of a year ago with a 6–2 victory over Australia to ensure GB's 2nd place finish.\nRecord: 4–1–0\nTeam Roster:\nOverall Record.\nGB's all time Competitive International record stands at: 14–28–3"

        "text": "The Pan Pacific Swimming Championships is a long course swimming event first held in 1985. It was founded as an alternative to the European Championships, for those countries that could not swim in those championships, in a manner similar to the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships which provide a similar 'continental' championships for non-European nations.\nThe meet was founded by its four Charter nations's swimming federations: Swimming Australia (Australia), Swimming Canada (Canada), Japan Swimming Federation (Japan), and USA Swimming (United States). As part of the Charter, hosting of the meet is to rotate among these four nations, with the meet being held in Japan every other championship. Initially, the meet was open to all countries that border the Pacific Ocean, giving the meet its name. This since has been expanded/opened to include other non-European countries wishing to participate, such as Brazil and South Africa.\nThe meet is considered to be one of the toughest international swimming competitions outside the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships, due in part to the presence of swimming power-house nationals like the United States and Australia, the first and second most medals winners, respectively.\nHistory.\nThe meet was initially staged biennially (every odd year), to allow for an international championship-level meet in the non-Olympic and non-World Championships years. However, beginning with the 2002 championships, due to the changing of the World Championships from every four years (even year between Olympics) to every two years (every odd year), the meet is a quadrennial event, held in the even year between Summer Olympics.\nUnlike the World Championships and Olympic Games, nations can enter as many people as they like in the preliminaries of each event (in most international meets, only two swimmers from each nation are permitted). However, only two swimmers per nation can qualify for the Championships' semi-finals and finals. Prior to FINA's creation of semi-finals in the late 1990s, a total of 3 swimmers per country could qualify for the final and consolation heats of an event, with no more than 2 swimmers per country in a final or consolation.\nList of championships.\nNote: The 1995 and 1999 editions served as the swimming test events for the Olympic venues, for the next year's Games.\nMedal table (1985–2018).\nAll-time Pan Pacific Championships medal table (Updated after 2018 Championships)\nJunior Pan Pacific Swimming Championships.\nThe Junior Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, aka Junior Pan PAC’s, is a long course swimming event that features high level 18 under swimmers around the Pacific. The event is held every other even year, and takes place in the non-world championship/junior championship years. The event was last held in 2018, with others postponed or canceled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic; future events have been postponed until after 2022.\nList of championships.\nJunior Pan Pacific Swimming Championships:"

        "title": "Dale Mitchell (baseball)",
        "text": "Loren Dale Mitchell (August 23, 1921 – January 5, 1987) was an American professional baseball left fielder. He played eleven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1946 to 1956 for the Cleveland Indians and Brooklyn Dodgers. A native of Colony, Oklahoma, he threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and .\nCareer.\nMitchell was a standout at Cloud Chief High School, where he lettered in various sports besides baseball. He was signed as a teenager by a scout of the Cleveland Indians in Hugh Alexander. However, an agreement to grant monthly payments until he graduated high school fell through when the front office reneged, leading to a long standoff where he elected to not report to the minors but also not negotiate with another team. As such, he applied to the University of Oklahoma in 1940. He played from 1942 to 1946 (with time served in the Army Air Force during World War II) with a career batting average of .467 and a senior season average of .507. Both marks are still Sooner records. After graduation, seeking out money to help his family, he noticed that a minor league team that was affiliated with the Indians was playing in Oklahoma City in the Double-A Texas League. He explained his situation and was signed to play there in June of 1946. By September, he was promoted to the majors.\nMainly a line drive hitter to all parts of the field, Mitchell hit .432 in 11 games for the Indians in his rookie season in 1946. He became a regular in 1947 and hit .300 or better six of the next seven seasons.\nIn 1948, Mitchell hit for a career-high .336 average, had 203 hits, led the league in singles (162), and led the Indians to victory in the 1948 World Series. He finished third in the 1948 American League batting race behind Ted Williams (.369) and Lou Boudreau (.355).\nIn 1949, Mitchell led the AL in hits (203), singles (161) and triples (23), struck out only 11 times in 640 at-bats, and made his first appearance in the All-Star Game. He received his second All-Star nod in 1952, and in 1954 led the Indians to an AL record 111 wins in a 154-game season and the American League pennant.\nMitchell posted a career .312 batting average, 41 home runs and 403 RBIs in eleven seasons in major league baseball. For the period between 1943 and 1960, only Williams and Stan Musial hit for higher averages. A good contact hitter as well, he struck out only 119 times in 3,984 at-bats and received 346 walks, for an outstanding 2.91 walk-to-strikeout ratio, the eighth best ratio in major league history. He compiled a .985 fielding percentage in the majors.\nMitchell played for the Cleveland Indians in all but 19 of the 1127 regular-season games in which he appeared. Near the end of the 1956 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers purchased Mitchell's contract from Cleveland.\nMitchell made the final out in Don Larsen's perfect game during Game 5 of the 1956 World Series for the New York Yankees against Mitchell's new team, the Dodgers. Mitchell, pinch-hitting for Brooklyn pitcher Sal Maglie, took a called third strike to end the only perfect game in Series history. Mitchell always maintained that the third strike he took was really a ball. The Dodgers would go on to lose the series in seven games (with Mitchell appearing as a pinch hitter in Game 7), and Mitchell retired afterward. After baseball, he worked in oil and the Martin Marietta Corporation as president of its cement division in Denver along with maintaining farmland that he had bought with the proceeds of making the World Series in 1948. \nLater life.\nDale Mitchell died from a heart attack in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1987 at the age of 65. The L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park at the University of Oklahoma is named in his honor, one that he called the biggest of his life."

Wilson played college football for the NC State Wolfpack and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the third round of the 2001 NFL draft. He also played for the New England Patriots and the Chicago Bears, playing as a safety.\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Wilson joined the Cardinals as a regional scout and served as a member of their personnel department from 2015 to 2022. Wilson parted ways with the team in February 2023 though for a new opportunity in the Panthers front office.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nWilson attended North Carolina State University, where he was a two-year starter at strong safety for the NC State Wolfpack football team. In 33 games (and 23 starts) with the Wolfpack, he posted 254 total tackles (144 solo tackles, 11 tackles-for-losses), 11 pass deflections and 3 passes intercepted. His 248 total tackles was the most by an N.C. State defensive back since James Walker collected 289 stops from 1993–95. At the end of his junior year, Wilson decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 2001 NFL draft.\nNational Football League.\nArizona Cardinals.\nThe Arizona Cardinals selected Wilson in the third round (64th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft.

        "title": "World Championship Tennis",
        "text": "World Championship Tennis (WCT) was a tour for professional male tennis players established in 1968 (the first players signed a contract at the end of 1967) and lasted until the emergence of the ATP Tour in 1990. A number of tennis tournaments around the world were affiliated with WCT and players were ranked in a special WCT ranking according to their results in those tournaments.\nThe WCT had an important impact on the commercial development of tennis. It instituted a tie-breaker system, experimented the \"no-ad\" scoring system on 40-40 (called at times \"sudden death\") and outfitted players with colored clothing, a radical idea at that time. WCT also strongly encouraged the audience to cheer for players, rather than politely applaud, as the more staid tennis audiences had done before. They publicly emphasized their prize money structure and special bonus pool as an incentive to attract top players.\nHistory.\nWorld Championship Tennis was founded in September 1967 by sports promoter David Dixon, who earlier witnessed the dreary conditions of the professional circuit before the open era when he visited a poorly promoted match between Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall. In August of that year, he had presented his idea of a pro tennis tour to Lamar Hunt and Al Hill Jr., who agreed to invest. WCT became the major professional tennis tour of players under contract of the early seventies.\nAfter starting with the \"Handsome Eight\", the original eight players (Dennis Ralston, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Cliff Drysdale, Earl Buchholz, Niki Pilić, Roger Taylor and Pierre Barthès), the first WCT tournament was held in January 1968 in Sydney, Australia and used the VASSS scoring system. According to sportswriter Rod Humphries, this first event was a hastily organized tournament held in the parking lot of the Channel 7 television studios in Epping and was won by Tony Roche. The first American WCT tournament was held in February 1968 in Kansas City, Missouri. In March 1968 Hunt and Hill took over Dixon's 50% stake in WCT and Dixon left the organization. WCT took a loss of $300,000 during its first year of operation. Al Hill, Jr. became president of WCT.\nBy early 1970, the WCT had signed other players (Marty Riessen, Ray Moore, Tom Okker, Arthur Ashe) and in July it acquired the player contracts of the other major professional organization, the National Tennis League (NTL), which had under contract players from the former professional group of Jack Kramer, namely Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Pancho Gonzáles as well as Andrés Gimeno, Roy Emerson, and Fred Stolle.\nIn 1971, the WCT circuit grew to 21 tournaments around the globe. In July 1971, at its annual meeting, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) voted to ban all WCT contract professionals from the ILTF tournaments and facilities from the beginning of 1972 onwards. At the end of the 1971 WCT season, the top eight players from the season were seeded according to their WCT rankings and played a year-end championship tournament in November. This was held about two weeks before the similar championship of the rival Grand Prix circuit, called The Masters. For commercial reasons, from 1972 onward this championship, played on indoor carpet, was usually held in the spring in Dallas, Texas and became known as the WCT Finals. The tournament ran for 19 years and the last championship was held in 1989. The format for this event was adopted by the Association of Tennis Professionals for the year-end Tour Finals.\nIn April 1972 an agreement was reached between the ILTF and WCT that divided the 1973 tour in a WCT circuit that ran from January through May and a Grand Prix circuit that was scheduled for the rest of the year. Under this agreement WCT players were again allowed to play the Grand Prix tournaments.\nThe WCT tour was merged into the Grand Prix tennis circuit in 1978. On 30 April 1981 WCT announced its withdrawal from the Grand Prix circuit and the establishment of its own full calendar season for 1982. According to Lamar Hunt the reasons for the withdrawal were the restrictions placed on them by the Men's Professional Council, the administrators of the Grand Prix circuit. In January 1983, WCT sued the Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC), the Association of Tennis Professionals and the ITF, claiming unfair restriction of trade. In November 1983 a settlement resulted in WCT's reincorporation into the Grand Prix with effect from 1985.\n1989 was the last season of WCT. The ATP established its own tennis circuit from 1990. On August 28, 1990, after the Tournament of Champions event at Forest Hills, WCT announced its dissolution.\nWCT also built and operated tennis clubs in the United States; WCT Lakeway World of Tennis in Lakeway (metro Austin), Texas and WCT Peachtree World of Tennis in Peachtree Corners (metro Atlanta), Georgia.\nWCT by year.\nWCT 1985.\nWCT tournaments returned to the Grand Prix stage after a three-year absence during 1982–84. There were only four events. The titles were split between Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe, winning two each. While McEnroe entered into all four, Lendl played just two and won both. McEnroe won the WCT Houston title, beating Kevin Curren in the final.\nThe WCT Finals in Dallas saw the unexpected defeat of McEnroe in the quarterfinals by Joakim Nyström in three straight sets. The title was captured by Lendl, whose success completed a triplicate of titles in three weeks: Fort Myers on hard, Monte Carlo on clay and Dallas on the carpet. Other players have won three, even four, tournaments in successive weeks in the Open Era, but never on different surfaces.\nIn Atlanta, McEnroe won the final over Paul Annacone in three sets. The WCT Tournament of Champions in Forest Hills ended with much anticipated final between Lendl and McEnroe. Despite winning only two of his last 12 matches over McEnroe in ATP tournaments, Lendl beat McEnroe 6–3 6–3.\nWCT 1986.\nThe WCT Atlanta tournament was marked by early exits of top seeds Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker in the first round. Edberg lost to Mikael Pernfors, and Becker lost to Tim Wilkison. In Dallas, Anders Järryd was the unexpected winner, having replaced the injured Ivan Lendl in the 12-player draw.\nWCT 1989.\n1989 was the final year of the WCT tour. Only three events were organized, all of them were incorporated into the Nabisco Grand Prix and gaining ATP ranking points.\nAt the 19th (and last) WCT Finals in Reunion Arena, John McEnroe won his fifth Dallas title. His semifinal with Ivan Lendl produced the best match of the tournament, and McEnroe beat Lendl for the first time in over three years. The tournament was negatively impacted by the withdrawals of Boris Becker (who did not appear at all) and Andre Agassi (walking off the court during a second set match with McEnroe). Brad Gilbert entered the event to fill the gap for Becker and surprisingly made it to the final. Later in spring, Lendl captured last two WCT titles in Scottsdale and Forest Hills to close the WCT era.\nWCT 1990.\nThere was no WCT tour in 1990, when the ATP established its own circuit named the ATP Tour, however there was one (final) tournament sanctioned by WCT. The Forest Hills WCT at West Side Tennis Club was moved from green clay to hardcourts and run as special non-ATP Tour event. Ivan Lendl stamped his WCT dominance winning the last title.\nWCT Year-end Championship Finals.\nThe WCT Finals were usually held in Dallas. The 1971 quarterfinals and semifinals were played in Houston, and the final was played at the Memorial Auditorium in Dallas. The 1972–1979 editions were played at the Moody Coliseum, and the 1980–1989 tournaments at Reunion Arena in Dallas.\nThe first edition of the WCT Finals in 1971 was played in November, just a few days before The Masters, the equivalent of the WCT Finals for the rival Grand Prix circuit. Because of TV pressure, the second edition was held in May 1972 and most of the following editions were organized in between months of March and May. Nevertheless, in 1972 another edition, less important and with half the prize money, was held in November in Rome. The prize money offered to the winner, Arthur Ashe, was $25,000 compared to the $50,000 won by Ken Rosewall for the main edition in May.\nA decade later there were three editions of the WCT Finals; the most important one in Dallas, and the others in autumn in Naples, Italy, and in winter (in January 1983) in Detroit, Michigan.\nWCT final rankings by year.\n1972.\nOne ranking was issued for the second part of 1971 and first part of 1972, and another for the second part of 1972 final standings. The first eight players in the second ranking played the 1972 autumn-winter WCT Finals held in Rome.\nSecond part of 1971/first part of 1972\nSecond part of 1972\n1973.\nThe players were separated into two groups, A &amp; B, with each group playing certain tournaments. The top 4 from each group qualified for the final at the end of the season.\nGroup A\nGroup B\n1974.\nThe group was divided into three groups, Red, Blue, and Green and the top 8 points winners qualified for the final (marked with*): 2 players by group plus the other two players having most points. Each group played separate tournaments except the Philadelphia tournament at the start of the season.\nRed group\nBlue group\nGreen group\n1975.\nThe group was divided into three groups again, Red, Blue, and Green and the top 8 points winners qualified for the final (marked with *). Each group played separate tournaments except the Philadelphia tournament at the start of the season.\nRed group\nBlue group\nGreen group\n\"1976–1983: All the players were put back together and played the same tournaments.\"\n1982.\nWCT expanded from the previous year and broke away from the Grand Prix for the year. There were three finals, Spring (Dallas) the most important one, Fall (Naples, Italy) and Winter (Detroit) and therefore three different points tables for each season:\nSpring\nSummer/Fall\nWinter\n1983.\nThere were only 9 tournaments and the WCT were back with the Grand Prix circuit.\nWCT Challenge Cup.\nSome special events such as the Aetna World Cup (where the Australian pros and the US pros faced in a team event because in 1970, at the start of this event, contract pro players weren't allowed to enter the Davis Cup) or the Challenge Cup (an 8-man tournament) were held by the WCT organization."

        "text": "\"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in . It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX. The song peaked at number 41 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1987.\nSong and video.\n\"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" instantly became a mainstream phenomenon, selling over 500,000 copies and reaching number 41 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 by February 1986. \"Billboard\" reported that the single's chart performance was propelled primarily by sales rather than radio airplay, saying, \"Although the record has a great deal of pop airplay across the country, especially as a novelty for morning drive programs, only a handful of radio stations are reporting it on their playlists.\" \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" fell in line with the Bears' high-media attention as they completed their one-loss regular season. The Bears dominated their postseason opponents, including the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX 46–10.\nThe 1985 Chicago Bears were the first sports team to have their own music video. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987 for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group, losing to \"Kiss\" by Prince. The 20th anniversary DVD was released in 2004, including the making of the video, outtakes and the music video itself. Julia Meyer has kept the copyright to the video.\nOver $300,000 in profits from the song and music video were donated to the Chicago Community Trust to help Chicago families in need with clothing, shelter and food. This was consistent with Walter Payton's lyric in the song: \"Now we're not doing this because we're greedy / The Bears are doing it to feed the needy\". In 2014, six of the performers (Richard Dent, Jim McMahon, Otis Wilson, Willie Gault, Mike Richardson and Steve Fuller) sued Julia Meyer and Renaissance Marketing Corporation, who licenses the song, stating the proceeds from the song should benefit charities; the six players' attorney stated, \"Among other things, the plaintiffs seek that a constructive trust be established for charitable purposes that they select in order to continue the Super Bowl Shuffle's charitable objective.\"\nThe video was taped at Park West, a Chicago night club, the morning after the Bears' only loss of the 1985 season, 38-24 to the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football on December 2, 1985. Jim McMahon and Walter Payton refused to participate in the video shoot, thinking it would be better to release the song and video after the season was complete. However, the team was insistent on releasing the song and video shortly after the shoot, so the video was filmed with the remaining players. Payton and McMahon both filmed their segments separately a week later at the Bears' practice facility after practice and these segments were interspersed in the video prior to release.\nPerformers.\nThe lyrics were written by Richard E. Meyer and Melvin Owens. The music was composed by Bobby Daniels and Lloyd Barry.\nThe \"referee\" in the video was portrayed by Julia Kallish.\nBears defensive end Dan Hampton declined involvement with the Shuffle, thinking it may have been too arrogant.\nPrecedents.\nThe 1985 Bears were not the first pro sports team with a group song.\nImitators and influence.\nThe success of \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" initiated numerous imitations from numerous teams across the league, including the Bears.\nOther parodies.\nDame and No. 2 Miami.\n2010 reprise.\nSeven of the surviving 1985 Bears (Walter Payton had died in 1999 of liver cancer) were reunited to film an updated version as a 30-second commercial promoting Boost Mobile, which was aired during Super Bowl XLIV. The seven players featured were quarterback Jim McMahon, backup quarterback Steve Fuller, receiver Willie Gault, linebackers Mike Singletary and Otis Wilson, defensive lineman Richard Dent, and punter Maury Buford. All of the featured players wore #50 jerseys as part of the company's $50 deal.\n2014 celebrity cover version.\nOn January 21, 2014, Misfire Records released a cover version of the song featuring acclaimed musicians (Jim James of My Morning Jacket, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Tim Harrington of Les Savy Fav), comedians (Tom Scharpling of \"The Best Show on WFMU\", Scott Aukerman of \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\", David Wain of \"The State\" and Stella, Kyle Kinane, and Dave Hill), and other notables (wrestler Colt Cabana and internet cat celebrity Lil Bub). Organized by radio host Sean Cannon with production from musician Alexander Smith, all proceeds from sales were to be donated to Reading Is Fundamental."

He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nPlaying career.\nSpencer was selected by the Chicago Blitz of the USFL in 1983 after a college football career at Ohio State University, where he ran for 1,371 yards in his senior season with the Buckeyes. He closed out his career with 3,553 yards rushing and ranks fifth on OSU's all-time rushing list, trailing only Archie Griffin (5,589), J. K. Dobbins (4,459), Ezekiel Elliott (3,961), and Eddie George (3,768). Spencer shared the backfield with Kevin Long as the starting running back with Chicago and rushed for 1157 yards on 300 carries with six touchdowns in his rookie season.\nIn 1984, Spencer played for the Arizona Wranglers and rushed for 1212 yards on 227 carries for a 5.3 yards per carry average. He also ran for 17 touchdowns. The following season, he played for the Memphis Showboats and rushed for 789 yards on 198 carries with three touchdowns. Spencer finished as the 3rd leading rusher in USFL history.\nIn 1985, Spencer signed to play for the San Diego Chargers, the same NFL team that drafted him in the 11th round of the 1983 NFL Draft. He rushed for 478 yards on 124 carries with 10 touchdowns that season. His biggest NFL season was in 1989, when he rushed for 521 yards on 134 carries. He was a limited reserve for the rest of his career with the Chargers and retired after the 1990 season.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1994, Spencer returned to Ohio State to be their running backs coach, a position he held until 2003. On January 27, 2004, he was announced as the running backs coach for the Chicago Bears. Spencer was not retained by the Bears in 2013 following the hiring of Marc Trestman.\nHe joined Lovie Smith's staff at Tampa Bay for the 2014 season. In 2019 Spencer was not retained by coach Bruce Arians. He then joined the coaching staff at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois as wide receivers coach."

        "text": "Lee Hyden Rose (October 23, 1936 – April 5, 2022) was an American basketball coach and college athletic administrator. He served as the head men's basketball at Transylvania University, in an interim capacity in 1964–65 and on a permanent basis from 1968 to 1975; the University of North Carolina at Charlotte from 1975 to 1978; Purdue University from 1978 to 1980; and the University of South Florida from 1980 to 1986, compiling a career college basketball coach record in 388–162. Rose twice coached teams to the Final Four of the NCAA Division I basketball tournament, with Charlotte 49ers in 1977 and the Purdue Boilermakers in 1980. After leaving the college ranks, Rose was an assistant coach with several teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1986 and 2008.\nCollegiate coaching career.\nRose, a native of Irvine, Kentucky, is a 1958 alumnus of Transylvania University where he served as an assistant coach after graduation under C. M. Newton. He then took a similar position at the University of Cincinnati before returning to his alma mater as head coach and athletic director and recorded 160 wins in eight seasons.\nIn 1975 he became the head coach and athletic director at UNC Charlotte, where in three seasons he took the 49ers to one NIT championship game (1976) and to the NCAA Final Four (1977). In 1977 he was named The Sporting News National Coach of the Year, the Sun Belt Coach of the Year, and Charlotte's \"Citizen of the Year\". In three seasons Rose's record at Charlotte was 72–18 (.800).\nRose left Charlotte for Purdue University in 1978. In the 1979 season, he led them to the NIT Championship Game. The 1980 season came under a cloud beginning in February, when it was reported that the University of South Florida asked for permission to interview Rose for the head coach position, which was received. The Boilermakers beat Indiana to reach the Final Four. Rose became one of only ten coaches in NCAA history to take two different schools to the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. Rose later stated that his relationship with athletic director George King was strained. Rose had been interviewed by Fred Schaus (who as assistant athletic director interviewed Rose due to King having surgery) before being hired, and in the first meeting with King, he told Rose that \"You'll never make more money than I do.\" Relations with the players were wavering, with one player reacting to the idea of leaving Purdue the day after the season ended by saying \"I hope he leaves\". Rose left Purdue after two seasons after compiling a 50–18 (.735) record. It was announced on April 4, 1980 (three days after the Final Four game) that he was hired to be the head coach at the University of South Florida with a salary doubled from the one he had at Purdue; Gene Keady replaced him at Purdue and coached there for 25 years. For his part, Rose stayed in touch with friends at the school along with stating that “I’ve wished many times that it worked out. But it just wasn’t a fit.”. He coached the Bulls to their first postseason appearances in team history, reaching the NIT three times before leaving in July 1986.\nLater career.\nAfter retiring from the college ranks in 1986 Rose served as an assistant coach for four NBA teams: the San Antonio Spurs (1986–1988); the New Jersey Nets (1988–1989); the Milwaukee Bucks (1991–1992), and the Charlotte Hornets (1996–2001). He also served as the Bucks' vice president of player personnel in the mid-1990s.\nRose and his wife resided in Charlotte, North Carolina, where they attended nearly every Charlotte 49ers basketball game. On June 7, 2007, Rose was hired by the Charlotte Bobcats to be part of head coach Sam Vincent's staff.\nHe has four grandchildren, Lee Rose; Kristi Rose; James Rose; and Alexzander Rose.\nRose died on April 5, 2022, at age 85."

        "text": "Boxing After Dark is an HBO boxing program, premiered on February 3, 1996, that usually showed fights between well-known contenders, but usually not \"championship\" or \"title\" fights. Unlike its sister program, \"HBO World Championship Boxing\", \"BAD\" featured fighters who were usually moving up from ESPN's \"Friday Night Fights\" or another basic cable boxing program. This was where fighters were given their start to become famous depending on how well they fare on \"BAD\" they might have a title fight on \"World Championship Boxing\" or could fall back (Ex: Jason Litzau had many entertaining fights on ESPN before moving up to \"BAD\" to face Jose Hernandez. After Litzau lost by knockout he returned to \"FNF\")\nIt usually aired at least once a month, following a \"World Championship Boxing\" card on HBO. \"Boxing After Dark\" debuted on HBO Canada beginning January 17, 2009 at 9:45 pm. ET/7:45 pm. MT\nHistory.\n\"Boxing After Dark\", or \"BAD\" for short, got its start on February 3, 1996 with commentators Jim Lampley and Larry Merchant. The first fight shown was an exciting 12-rounder featuring a then-unknown Marco Antonio Barrera and Kennedy McKinney. Barrera won by KO. Since then, \"BAD\" has prided itself on promoting fights between lesser-caliber fighters with something to prove, though occasionally well-known fighters, usually those signed by HBO, may make appearances.\nTenth season revamp.\nIn 2006, \"BAD\" entered its tenth season with an all-new lineup. Lampley, Merchant and Emanuel Steward would now call only \"WCB\" and pay-per-view fights. Replacing them were Fran Charles, former ESPN and Fox Sports Net analyst Max Kellerman who received \"something in the neighborhood of $10,000 for each \"Boxing After Dark\" telecast\" (according to Thomas Hauser) and former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Kellerman and Lewis had previously appeared on world championship and pay-per-view events for HBO as analysts and continue to do so. This season has featured mostly fights at lesser weights, a \"BAD\" staple, as well as new theme music and logo. On March 13, 2007, Fran Charles was replaced by Bob Papa due to scheduling conflicts with the NFL Network. Lampley has also on occasion stepped in for Charles and Papa.\nBeginning in 2013, the teams for \"BAD\" and \"World Championship Boxing\" became identical. Lampley, Kellerman, and Roy Jones Jr. called all boxing events for HBO with rare exceptions. Andre Ward and Bernard Hopkins served as substitutes for Jones.\nThe end of \"Boxing After Dark\".\nOn September 27, 2018, HBO announced they would be dropping boxing from the network following its last televised match on October 27, although there was an additional airing on December 8, 2018. Several reasons were given for the cancellation, including rapidly declining ratings, an increasing number of options for boxing on other channels, surveys that showed boxing was no longer one of the reasons people purchased HBO subscriptions, a lack of marquee boxing contests, and HBO corporate position that the service is \"not a sports network.\""

        "text": "Climbing fibers are the name given to a series of neuronal projections from the inferior olivary nucleus located in the medulla oblongata.\nThese axons pass through the pons and enter the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle where they form synapses with the deep cerebellar nuclei and Purkinje cells. Each climbing fiber will form synapses with 1-10 Purkinje cells.\nEarly in development, Purkinje cells are innervated by multiple climbing fibers, but as the cerebellum matures, these inputs gradually become eliminated resulting in a single climbing fiber input per Purkinje cell.\nThese fibers provide very powerful, excitatory input to the cerebellum which results in the generation of complex spike excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in Purkinje cells. In this way climbing fibers (CFs) perform a central role in motor behaviors.\nThe climbing fibers carry information from various sources such as the spinal cord, vestibular system, red nucleus, superior colliculus, reticular formation and sensory and motor cortices.\nClimbing fiber activation is thought to serve as a motor error signal sent to the cerebellum, and is an important signal for motor timing. In addition to the control and coordination of movements, the climbing fiber afferent system contributes to sensory processing and cognitive tasks likely by encoding the timing of sensory input independently of attention or awareness.\nIn the central nervous system, these fibers are able to undergo remarkable regenerative modifications in response to injuries, being able to generate new branches by sprouting to innervate surrounding Purkinje cells if these lose their CF innervation. This kind of injury-induced sprouting has been shown to need the growth associated protein GAP-43."

He is best known for his work as an advice columnist in his column \"Since You Asked\" on the website Salon.com which ran for twelve years (2001–2013). Critic Siobhan Welch said of him \"Cary Tennis has resurrected the advice column into a relevant, even thriving, literary form. He is the Anti-Dear Abby, with a style more reminiscent of an essayist’s ruminations than the pat responses usually found in print.\"\nCary Tennis graduated cum laude from the University of Miami in 1976 with a B.A. in literature and journalism and entered the masters program in creative writing at San Francisco State University in 1978. He passed his oral examinations (Wallace Stevens, William Faulkner and Vladimir Nabokov) and had his creative thesis approved (\"The Riverwood House and Other Stories\"), but he never completed the degree program.\nAfter university, Tennis worked in the mailroom of Western Electric in San Francisco, worked as a bike messenger, formed a new wave band called the Repeat Offenders (wrote, sang, played guitar), and worked as a rock journalist for the SF Weekly.\nIn the late 1990s he spent five years in a clerical job at Chevron. In 1999 he started working for Salon Magazine, first as copy editor, then copy chief and from 2001 as Salon's resident advice columnist.\nTennis's \"Since You Asked\" column began in 2001, and was based on a previous column by Garrison Keillor entitled Mr. Blue which appeared in Salon's Books section. In an unusual format for advice columns, \"Since you Asked\" publishes long letters, sometimes of 1,000 words, and equally long responses.\nIn the column, Tennis makes occasional reference to his own life, both as a suffering cancer patient and a recovering alcoholic.\nTennis writes of his craft: \"I'm no expert. I know the same things we all know,\" he says. \"What I'm offering is, you know, good writing! Good writing can clarify overlooked or obscure areas of emotion. With sufficient craft, these things can be illuminated, and in a way that's pleasurable to read. Plus I'm kind. I offer sympathy to people who are in trouble.\"\nTennis writes of America: \"Nothing has changed structurally; we are still a hateful, war-waging culture that denigrates women, celebrates killing, despoils the planet, plunders the resources of less powerful people, keeps a permanent underclass in virtual economic slavery and wages imperialist wars abroad. We're still the same country we were when I was growing up in the 1960s.\".\nIn 2007, Tennis wrote \"Since You Asked\", which is a collection of articles from his column.\nTennis announced in his column of November 19, 2009, that he has been diagnosed with a chordoma, a rare malignant tumor that usually occurs in the spine and base of the skull.\nOn Monday, September 30, 2013 Tennis posted on his Facebook page that he had been fired by Salon. He also noted this in the comments section to his column on that date. No explanation for the firing was provided.\nTennis was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He is based in Italy and is married."

        "text": "Robert Henry Stone (27 February 1956 - 1 August 2005) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer and official. He played 281 games for the St. George Dragons including 170 games in first grade mainly at prop. Stone achieved representative honours including being a member of the first New South Wales State of Origin team. Stone later became the executive officer at St. George where his most notable achievement was having St George Illawarra Dragons return to Oki Jubilee Stadium in Kogarah from 2003.\nPlaying history.\nRobert Stone played rugby union as a youngster and then switched to league as a teenager. He also completed training as a teacher.\nStone rose up through the grades at St. George, playing in the premiership winning Under-23s side in 1974, his first year as a graded player. He made his debut in first grade in 1975 NSWRFL season and played in the losing grand final to Eastern Suburbs in that year. Stone was also a member of the St. George side that won the Reserve Grade premiership in 1976.\nStone was a member of the 1977 St. George team that won the Premiership under coach Harry Bath. He played in the grand final which was drawn 9-all with Parramatta - the first draw in the history of Sydney rugby league. Stone scored the first try in the replay a week later which St. George won 22–0. In 1977, Stone won representative honours for the first time playing for City in City v Country.\nSt George won another premiership in 1979 defeating Canterbury-Bankstown, and Stone was a reserve for the match. However, in 1980, Stone represented NSW including in the first State of Origin match. NSW won the series but Queensland won the State of Origin match 20-10 as Queenslanders playing in the Sydney competition returned to play for their home state.\nIn 1984, Stone was captain of the St. George side for 15 out of the 24 matches played by the team. However, Stone was dropped to reserve grade for the 1985 grand final when St. George had teams playing in all three grades. Coach Roy Masters says that Stone was dropped for the game by a 3–2 vote. St. George lost first grade but won the reserve grade and third grade grand finals.\nStone did not play first grade in 1986 which was a disappointing year for the Dragons in their new home at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He was extremely disappointed at the decision by the St. George board to not offer him a new contract as he had reached 281 games for the club, making him third in the list of longest serving Dragons players behind Billy Smith and Norm Provan.\nHe was awarded Life Membership of the St. George Dragons in 1984.\nLater career.\nStone was so upset at the failure to renew his contract and the move to the SCG that he stood against St. George President Danny Robinson, losing by one vote. He played for Picton Rugby League Club in Country League as captain-coach and coached the Western Suburbs Magpies reserve grade side.\nHe was a primary school teacher for many years at Bald Face Public School in the Sydney suburb of Blakehurst, New South Wales and at Engadine Primary School in Engadine, New South Wales.\nIn 2000, the St. George Committee including Robinson asked him to return to St. George as the Chief Executive to protect the proud history of the club in the joint venture with the Illawarra Steelers. Stone played a critical role in organising the return of St. George Illawarra to OKI Jubilee Oval in Kogarah in 2003 including organising the rejuvenation of the ground. The area where former great players of the Dragons congregate to watch the match is known as \"Stoney's slab\" as recognition of his role in redeveloping the ground.\nRobert Stone was also involved in the decision by the Australian Labor Party to select Mark Latham as its new leader in 2003. Robert McClelland was a crucial vote in the battle between Latham and Kim Beazley. On 3 December, Latham suggested that McClelland call Stone who was his childhood friend and who Latham knew casually as a St. George fan. McClelland called Stone who advised him to vote for Latham as \"Putting Beazley back in again would be like putting me into a first-grade team again.

        "title": "London Cricket Club",
        "text": "The original London Cricket Club was formed in 1722 and was one of the foremost clubs in English cricket over the next four decades, holding important match status. It is closely associated with the Artillery Ground, where it played most of its home matches.\nEarly history of London cricket.\nThe earliest definite mention of cricket being played anywhere is at Guildford in the 16th century and there can be little doubt that the game had reached London by that time. Even so, there is no written reference to the game in London until 1680.\nA publication called \"The Post Man\" reported from 21 June 1707 to 24 June 1707 that \"two great matches at cricket (to be) plaid, between London and Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday, July 1st, and the other to be plaid in Lamb's-Conduit-Fields, near Holborn, on the Tuesday following, being the 3rd of July\". No match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown (3 July in 1707 was a Thursday).\nThe 1707 London team may have been just an occasional XI as the foundation date of London Cricket Club is unknown. But it was in existence by 1722 when it was referred to in a match against Dartford.\nThe Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Club.\nLondon Cricket Club was founded and organised by members of what is usually termed the \"Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Club\", which had its headquarters at the \"Star and Garter\" on Pall Mall in London. This gentlemen's club was multi-functional, though essentially of a social and sporting nature, but its purpose was to encourage and enable gambling. For example, its members also founded the Jockey Club and were usually involved with organising big prizefighting events. Cricket throughout the 18th century was funded by gambling interests and attracted huge stakes.\nGambling has always had its unsavoury side and eventually the Artillery Ground became a place of ill-repute. The club members became uneasy about associating with a place that was widely known for licentious and, occasionally, riotous behaviour, even though it showcased cricket of the highest class. Cricket was severely impacted by the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763 and the number of matches played greatly reduced. There are signs of the game returning to its rural roots during this period and evidently the aristocrats were happy with that development. Apart from four matches in the 1769 English cricket season, there are few mentions of London as a team in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War and many of the references suggest that these teams were in fact occasional \"London XIs\" rather than representing an organised London club.\nThe Artillery Ground itself began to be used less and less after 1763. A match on 15 September 1778 is the last important one played there. Hambledon was already by then the predominant centre of English cricket and a lot of games were being played at other outlying venues such as Laleham Burway, Bourne Paddock and Sevenoaks Vine. London for the time being had been abandoned.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the London Cricket Club was disbanded during the Seven Years' War. With its demise and the war situation, the \"honourable gentlemen\" retreated to the countryside and founded or at least augmented the Hambledon Club, which was the main centre of cricket from about 1765 for the next twenty years.\nIn the early 1780s, the gentlemen decided to re-establish themselves in the vicinity of London and founded the White Conduit Club in Islington. But they were not happy about the environment of White Conduit Fields and commissioned Thomas Lord to find a \"more private venue\". He opened Lord's Old Ground in 1787 in Marylebone. The gentlemen moved their cricketing interests there and reinvented themselves as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which is thus a direct continuation of the old London Cricket Club.\nPlayers.\nVery little is known of London's players during its heyday, from the 1720s to the 1760s. The following are the names that have been recorded by the season in which they are first mentioned in the sources.\nMatches.\nIn the 1720s, the London club seemed to share its time between Kennington Common and White Conduit Fields but it increasingly began to use the Artillery Ground from 1730.\nThe 1730s were the glory days of London Cricket Club and it completely dominated the cricket scene, especially given its royal and aristocratic patronage. One of the earliest good players mentioned is \"the famous Tim Coleman\" who was referred as such in 1731 when it was rare to see any player named in the newspapers.\nLondon's main opponents in the 1730s were Croydon and Dartford. They played matches against various other parish clubs and sometimes took on county sides, mainly Kent, Surrey and Sussex. There is sometimes confusion in the reports when London is identified with Middlesex and \"vice versa\" but, in general, London means the club and Middlesex was a team of players born in the county who were not necessarily of the London club.\nThe club's best season may have been the 1732 season when it was unbeaten. As a report recounts after the final match: \"This is the thirteenth match the London gamesters have played this year and not lost one match\".\nAs the 1730s progressed, London continued to be generally successful. From time to time, challengers appeared. Chertsey Cricket Club first made its mark in the 1736 season and London also had some tight contests against Chislehurst in the late 1730s.\nBut the biggest challenge to London's dominance emerged in the 1741 season. This was Slindon which starred the great all-rounder Richard Newland and was backed by the Duke of Richmond. After Slindon beat Surrey \"almost in one innings\" at the end of that season, it was inevitable they would come to the Artillery Ground and play London. This happened in 1742 when two matches were played against a background of furious gambling with huge wagers being laid against Newland's expected performance. London prevailed, winning the first match \"with great difficulty\" and then, having been assisted by the weather, thrashing Slindon by 184 runs in the second.\nIt was London's turn to be thrashed in 1743 when they played another of the \"great little clubs\": Addington Cricket Club who, on their first appearance at the Artillery Ground, easily won by an innings and 4 runs. Addington did have the great player Robert Colchin as a given man.\nIn 1744, Slindon were back and in June they beat London by 55 runs in a match whose scores have been preserved by the earliest known cricket scorecard. Slindon beat London again in September and proceeded to issue their audacious challenge to play against any parish in England. London did not take up the challenge: only Addington and Bromley felt able to respond.\nThere was a noticeable increase in the popularity of single wicket contests in the late 1740s although the London club often arranged these at the Artillery Ground. In the eleven a side game, county matches or games involving \"best elevens\" were the norm and, as the 1750s began, London was really playing parish matches only unless it had several given men."

        "text": "An independent baseball league is a professional baseball league in the United States or Canada that is not overseen by Major League Baseball or its affiliated Minor League Baseball system (historically referred to as organized baseball).\nIndependent leagues have flourished in northeastern states, where dense populations can often support multiple franchises. Because they are not subject to the territorial limitations imposed on affiliated minor-league teams, independent clubs can relocate as close to affiliated teams (and one another) as they choose to. For example, the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, cannot have an affiliated team because of its proximity to the Harrisburg Senators and Reading Fightin Phils, leaving the Atlantic League to place a team—the Lancaster Barnstormers—to fill the void. Another example is the greater New York City metropolitan area, where there are many independent teams: the Long Island Ducks, Staten Island FerryHawks, New Jersey Jackals, New York Boulders, and Sussex County Miners.\nThe Atlantic League considered as the top level of competition among the independent leagues, and has had more marquee players than any other independent league, including Jose Canseco, Mat Latos, Steve Lombardozzi Jr., Francisco Rodríguez, Chien-Ming Wang, Roger Clemens, Rich Hill, Scott Kazmir, Juan González, John Rocker, and Dontrelle Willis. Two former Atlantic League players are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Tim Raines and Rickey Henderson. Gary Carter, another Hall of Famer, managed in the league. The Atlantic League has had many notable managers and coaches, including Wally Backman, Frank Viola, Tommy John, Sparky Lyle, and Bud Harrelson. The Northern League alumni include Leon \"Bull\" Durham, J. D. Drew, and Darryl Strawberry.\nHistory.\nIndependent leagues are those professional leagues in the United States and Canada not under the purview of organized Minor League Baseball and the Commissioner of Baseball. Independent baseball existed in the early 20th century and has become prominent again since 1993.\nLeagues operated mostly autonomously before 1902, when the majority joined the NAPBL. From then until 1915, a total of eight new and existing leagues remained independent. Most joined the National Association after one season of independence. Notable exceptions were the California League, which was independent in 1902 and from 1907 to 1909; the United States Baseball League, which folded during its independent 1912 season; and the Colonial League, a National Association Member that went independent in 1915 and then folded. Another independent league, the Federal League, played at a level considered major league from 1914 to 1915.\nFew independent leagues existed between 1915 and 1993. Major exceptions included the Carolina League and the Quebec-based Provincial League. The Carolina League, based in the North Carolina Piedmont region, gained a reputation as a notorious \"outlaw league\" during its existence from 1936 to 1938. The Provincial League fielded six teams across Quebec and was independent from 1948 to 1949. Similarly to early 20th-century independent leagues, it joined the National Association in 1950, playing for six more years.\nIndependent leagues saw new growth after 1992, after the new Professional Baseball Agreement in organized baseball instituted more stringent revenue and stadium requirements on members. The Northern League and Frontier League both started play in 1993, and the Northern League's success paved the way for other independent leagues like the Texas-Louisiana League and Northeast League. Over the next eight years, at least 16 independent leagues formed, of which six existed in 2002. As of the 2024 season, there are seven active leagues, with four of them acting as MLB Partner Leagues."

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome included dressage, eventing, and show jumping. Eventing and show jumping presented both individual and team medals, dressage presented only individual medals. The competitions were held from 5 to 11 September 1960. 159 entries, including 8 women, competed from 29 nations: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uruguay, and the USA. The youngest participant was Min Gwan-Gi from South Korea at 18 years old, while the oldest rider was Lilian Williams from Great Britain at 65 years old.\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\nThere were two separate jumping competitions for individual and team medals, the first time this had occurred since 1920. 69 riders from 23 countries competed, and more than half of the riders had faults at either the 5 meter water jump or the triple combination, which had very odd distances. 9 of the 18 teams did not finish the first round. Although they were considered eliminated under Olympic rules, the Technical Delegate chose to implement a rule allowing eliminated riders to continue with a score that was equal to the worst non-eliminated rider, plus 20 additional penalties. This allowed all 18 teams to jump in the second round.\nThe individual medals were fought out between the two d’lnzeo brothers, Raimondo and Piero, David Broome, and Argentinean Naldo Dasso. The first round saw Raimondo d’lnzeo and Posillipo with the single clear, followed by Naldo Dasso with 4 penalties, and Piero d’lnzeo and his mount Max Fresson with eight. David Broome (7 penalties) had the best ride of the second round, while Piero d’lnzeo and Hans-Günter Winkler each had 8 faults, and the leader, Raimondo d’lnzeo had 3 rails down for 12 faults. Raimondo d’lnzeo's final score of 12 was still enough to win the gold, followed by his brother Piero and David Broome.\nDressage.\nThe 1952 Olympics created some serious changes for the dressage competition at the 1960 Games. The previous Games had resulted in a serious judging scandal after the German and Swedish judges favored their own countrymen. These two judges were subsequently suspended by the FEI. Following this controversy, the IOC threatened to remove dressage from the Olympics, but the FEI managed to come to a compromise, removing the team competition from the 1960 Games and only allowing individual competitors (up to 2 per country). Additionally, 3 of the judges had to be from non-participating countries, and ride-offs were filmed and reviewed for a day before the final results were announced publicly.\nThe other major change was in the scoring scale, which moved from a scale of 0–6 to 0–10.\n17 riders competed, from 10 nations. Despite the small number of riders, the competition still took a long time as the judges, conscious of not playing favoritism, conferred for up to 20 minutes following each ride. 5 riders total qualified for the ride-off (2 from the Soviet Union, and 1 each from Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden). The ride-off was filmed and reviewed, the judging panel decided not to change the original placings, and the results were announced to the public 3 days following the ride.\nEventing.\nFor the first time since 1924, the eventing team consisted of 4 riders rather than 3. Although 19 nations, with a total of 79 riders, competed, the eventing competition at the 1960 Olympics clearly went to the Australians. The team had fantastic performances cross-country, with three of the four riders (Lawrence \"Laurie\" Morgan, Neale Lavis, and Brian Crago) in the top three spots of the competition following endurance day. Bill Roycroft, the fourth Australian team member, had fallen on cement drain pipes, resulting in a concussion and broken collar bone. Unfortunately, Brian Crago's mount Sabre was rejected at the final horse inspection, removing him from his current silver-medal position. In order to insure his team finished, Roycroft left the hospital to ride in the final phase, posting a clear round and insuring a team gold for his country.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

Upon his retirement, Morgan held the major league record for most major league teams played for (12), but this record was surpassed by Octavio Dotel in 2012 and Edwin Jackson in 2018.

Morgan made his major league debut on June 11, throwing a complete game in a 3–0 loss to Scott McGregor and the Baltimore Orioles. After losing his first three starts in Oakland, Morgan was sent down to AAA Vancouver for the rest of the season, going 5–6 with a 5.58 earned run average (ERA) in 92 innings pitched. Although he had put up less than spectacular numbers as an 18-year-old, including an alarming strikeout-to-walk ratio of 0.5:1 (31 strikeouts and 62 walks), he was clearly on the fast track.\nAfter starting the 1979 season with the AAA Ogden A's, Morgan was called up again to the big club after posting a 5–5 record with a 3.48 ERA in 101 innings. However, he again appeared overmatched, finishing the season 2-10 for the A's. Morgan then spent the next two seasons in the minor leagues. After finishing another unspectacular season in 1980, going 6-9 back at Ogden, Oakland traded Morgan on November 3 to the New York Yankees for 33-year-old infielder, Fred Stanley. The Yankees then demoted Morgan and assigned him to the AA Nashville Sounds where he posted an 8–7 record with a 4.42 ERA in 169 innings.\n\"The Nomad\".\nMorgan was nearly dealt along with Oscar Gamble and Bob Watson from the Yankees to the Texas Rangers for Al Oliver prior to the 1982 regular season, but the transaction was squashed by Gamble whose contract had a list of eight teams to which he can be traded which did not include the Rangers. He pitched the entire 1982 season for the Yankees, pitching in 30 games with 23 starts. On December 9, Morgan was traded again, this time to the Toronto Blue Jays (along with outfielder/first baseman Dave Collins and future all star first baseman Fred McGriff) for minor league third baseman Tom Dodd and reliever Dale Murray. Morgan then split time between Toronto and AAA Syracuse in 1983 before spending the entire 1984 season at Syracuse. In December 1984, Morgan was taken off the Blue Jays' 40-man roster and was subsequently chosen by the Seattle Mariners in the Rule 5 draft. After losing much of 1985 to arm trouble, Morgan spent most of the next three seasons pitching for Seattle and compiling similar numbers to his career average, going 24–35 with a 4.53 over 429 innings with 216 strikeouts and 144 walks. In a hint of later career success, Morgan collected his first career save in 1986. Although showing himself to be a solidly average starting pitcher, he would continue to struggle with his control, annually putting up dismal strikeouts-to-walk ratios, and failing to show the promise that made him a first round selection. Morgan was acquired by the Baltimore Orioles from the Mariners for Ken Dixon at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1987. He split the 1988 season between Baltimore and AAA Rochester. That year he was recognized for his humanitarian work by winning the Little League's Junior Cy Young Award.\nMorgan was sent to his sixth franchise in a trade from the Orioles to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Devereaux on March 11, 1989. He remained with the Dodgers from 1989 to 1991. He had his first winning season as a pro in 1991 and earned his lone All-Star selection while finishing a 14–10 record. Morgan also led the National League with four shutouts in 1990, tied with the San Diego Padres' Bruce Hurst. On July 28, he was at the losing end of Montreal Expos pitcher Dennis Martínez's perfect game, even though Morgan himself was perfect through the first five innings.\nAfter leaving Los Angeles as a free agent, Morgan signed with the Chicago Cubs from 1992 to 1995. In 1992, Morgan finishing the season 16–8 with a 2.55 ERA over 240 innings – easily the best season of his career. However, he could not repeat his efforts and went 12–25 over the next two seasons after again experiencing arm trouble. After seeming to bounce back in the beginning of 1995, starting the season 2–1 with a 2.19 ERA for the Cubs, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals (along with minor leaguer catcher Francisco Morales and first baseman/third baseman Paul Torres) for third baseman Todd Zeile and cash, and went 5–6 in 17 starts the rest of the way. In 1996, Morgan would return to his previous form, posting a 4–8 record with a 5.24 ERA, and was released by the Cardinals on August 28. He would not be unemployed long as he signed with the Cincinnati Reds on September 4 and spent the remainder of the 1996 and all of 1997 with the Reds.\nPost-season play.\nAfter leaving the Reds as a free Agent, Morgan signed in December 1997 with the Minnesota Twins. After putting up good numbers with the Twins through August (4–2 with a 3.49 ERA and only 24 walks in 98 innings), Morgan was traded on August 25 back to the Cubs for pitcher Scott Downs and cash. While with the Cubs, he was on the mound when Mark McGwire hit his record-tying 61st home run. He also went to the post-season for the first time, relieving in two games without giving up a run, but the Cubs lost to the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series. On January 29, 1999, Morgan joined his 11th team, signing with the Texas Rangers as a free agent. Although he pitched to a 13–10 record, he had an ERA of 6.24 and was demoted to the bullpen late in the season.\nPrior to spring training in 2000, the 40-year-old signed with his 12th team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, who successfully converted Morgan to a full-time reliever. Morgan excelled in this new role and appeared in 60 games, pitched 100 innings, and compiled an ERA that was only slightly above career average. After pitching in 31 games in 2001, including his last career start, Morgan was again in the post-season with the D-backs, appeared in all three rounds, and threw innings of scoreless relief helping Arizona defeat the New York Yankees in seven games to win the 2001 World Series. He was back with Arizona again in 2002 and pitched 28 games over the first three months before being sidelined by an injury. He came back to make the final appearance of his career on September 2, pitching innings and giving up an unearned run in a 19–1 loss to the Dodgers. Morgan finished the season 1–1 with a 5.29 ERA and was not included on the D-Backs' post-season roster. Following the season, Morgan retired from baseball after 21 seasons.\nMorgan was the last active player to have competed during the 1978 season and one of the last four (the others being Jesse Orosco, Rickey Henderson and Tim Raines) to have debuted in the 1970s. In the 597 games Morgan pitched, 411 were starts. His career record was 141–186 with a 4.23 ERA with 1403 strikeouts and eight saves in innings.\nMorgan was tied with National Hockey League player Mike Sillinger and MLB pitcher Matt Skrmetta for the most teams played for in any North American professional sport through June 2006, when Skrmetta signed with the Chicago White Sox, his 24th professional team and 13th organization.\nPersonal life.\nMorgan currently resides in Ogden, Utah, and owns \"World Championship Outfitters\", a company which takes people on private hunts with Morgan as the guide. In 2010, he created the \"Robinson's Transport Wounded Warrior Hunt\", a hunting trip for military members who have received a Purple Heart."

        "title": "Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)",
        "text": "Jason Chandler Williams (born November 18, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who was a point guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for twelve seasons from 1998 to 2011. In 2006, Williams won his first and only NBA championship as the starting point guard for the Miami Heat. He was given the nickname \"White Chocolate.\"\nA native of West Virginia, Williams played college basketball for Marshall University and the University of Florida. The Sacramento Kings selected him in the first round of the 1998 NBA draft. He also played for the Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, and Orlando Magic throughout his career. The Heat named Williams one of their top 25 players of all time in 2007.\nEarly years.\nWilliams was born in Belle, West Virginia. He attended DuPont High School (since consolidated into the current Riverside High School) in Dupont City, where he played high school basketball for the DuPont Panthers in 1994, and led his school team to the state championship before being defeated by Martinsburg in the final. He became the only player in DuPont team history to reach 1,000 points and 500 assists. \"USA Today\" named Williams the West Virginia Player of the Year in 1994. Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss was one of Williams' high school basketball teammates.\nCollege career.\nWilliams originally committed to play college basketball for Providence College, but instead chose to attend Marshall University after Providence coach Rick Barnes left for Clemson. At Marshall, he played for coach Billy Donovan's Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball team from 1994 to 1996. After redshirting his first season, he averaged 13.4 points and 6.4 assists per game during his 1995–96 freshman year.\nWhen Marshall coach Billy Donovan accepted the head coaching position at the University of Florida in the summer of 1996, Williams decided to transfer and follow Donovan to Florida. After sitting out the 1996–97 season as required by the NCAA transfer rule, he became the starting point guard for the Florida Gators men's basketball team during the 1997–98 season, and set a Florida Gators single-game record with 17 assists in a December 3, 1997 game against Duquesne. Through twenty games, he averaged 17.1 points, 6.7 assists and 2.8 steals per game, and led the Gators to an 86–78 upset of the Kentucky Wildcats in Lexington, Kentucky. In February 1998, however, the University of Florida suspended him for the remainder of the season for cannabis use, after two previous suspensions for the same infraction.\nProfessional career.\nSacramento Kings (1998–2001).\nFollowing his suspension by the University of Florida, Williams decided to make himself eligible for the NBA draft. He was the seventh overall selection in the 1998 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings.\nIn his rookie year, the Kings, with a roster that included newcomers Williams, Chris Webber, Vlade Divac, and Peja Stojaković, turned into a playoff contender. That year, Williams' number 55 jersey was among the top five sellers of all NBA players.\nOn July 20, 2000, Williams was suspended for the first five games of the 2000–01 NBA season for failure to comply with his treatment obligations under the NBA's anti-drug program. The NBA does not release details of violations of the anti-drug program.\nOn February 28, 2001, Williams allegedly shouted racist slurs to Michael Ching, a Golden State Warriors season ticket-holder, and to several other Asian Americans seated beside Ching during a Warriors game at the Oakland Arena. As recounted by a letter Ching sent to NBA commissioner David Stern, Williams retaliated against heckling made by Ching and his party midway through the first half.\nThe NBA eventually levied a $15,000 fine on Williams for cursing at fans. Nike decided to change a planned advertising campaign featuring Williams as a result of his alleged actions as well. Williams has since apologized for the incident.\nMemphis Grizzlies (2001–2005).\nBy 2001, the Kings had concluded that Williams' behavior made him more trouble than he was worth. Additionally, general manager Geoff Petrie was concerned that Williams had not developed into a more complete point guard. With this in mind, the Kings traded Williams and Nick Anderson to the Vancouver Grizzlies for Mike Bibby and Brent Price. The team relocated to Memphis, Tennessee several weeks after the trade. In 2002, Grizzlies' general manager Jerry West hired Hubie Brown out of retirement to coach the team. The team improved by a franchise record 28 wins in Brown's first season.\nAfter Memphis was swept by the Phoenix Suns in the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Williams was reportedly involved in an altercation with Geoff Calkins, a columnist for the \"Commercial Appeal\". Sources said that Williams screamed in Calkins' ear and took his pen away from him. Calkins had previously quoted Williams as saying, \"I'm happy. I go home and see my kids and my wife and I'm OK. All of this [stuff] is secondary to me.\"\nCalkins was critical of the Grizzlies' lackadaisical play and had alleged that Williams did not care about winning basketball games. Williams was fined $10,000 for the incident on May 4, 2005. Williams maintained that the quotations were out of context, especially after Williams had delivered spectacular performances during the series, despite the Grizzlies' loss.\nMiami Heat (2005–2008).\nChampionship season (2005–2006).\nOn August 2, 2005, Williams and teammate James Posey were two of thirteen players involved in the biggest trade in league history that saw them being dealt to the Miami Heat in exchange for shooting guard Eddie Jones.\nWilliams started at point guard for the Heat in the 2005–06 campaign, playing a total of 59 games due to a knee injury but placing second only to Dwyane Wade in minutes per game. He would serve as the third leading scorer for Miami averaging 12.3 points a game, only trailed Wade with 4.9 assists per contest and was one of three players on the team with over 100 three-point baskets for the season. In the playoffs his averages were lower than the regular season, but he scored in double figures 11 times in the post-season including 21 points on 10 of 11 shooting in Game 6 of the Eastern Finals against the Detroit Pistons. Miami closed out Detroit in that game and would win the NBA Championship over the Dallas Mavericks, giving Williams his first and only title.\nDip in quality (2006–2008).\nIn the 2006–07 season, Williams was limited to 61 games, of which he started 55. He averaged 10.9 points and 5.3 assists, which did not meet his career averages of 11.7 and 6.5. His play dropped dramatically in the postseason, averaging 5.8 points per game and 3.5 assists per game. His struggles contributed to the Heat being swept by the Bulls in four games in the first round of the playoffs.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Williams played 67 games while averaging 8.7 points and 4.6 assists per game. He shot 41.5 percent from the field, 86.3 percent from the free-throw line, and 35.3 percent from beyond the three-point arc. In March, he had 34 points versus Orlando, connecting on five three-point baskets. He had two double-doubles: one against Phoenix and one against the Bucks; both were 21-point, 10-assist performances.\nOrlando Magic (2009–2011).\nIn the summer of 2008, Williams signed with the Los Angeles Clippers to a one-year deal. However, on September 26, 2008, Williams announced his retirement from the NBA after 10 years due to persistent injuries.\nIn February 2009, Williams announced he would attempt a return to the NBA. On August 19, 2009, Williams signed with the Orlando Magic. The move reunited Williams with Stan Van Gundy, his former coach in Miami, who pushed the team to make the signing. Orlando is located just south of Gainesville, where he had gone to college.\nWilliams played in all 82 games for the Magic that year, including 18 starts when Jameer Nelson was injured. He also played in all 14 of their playoff games, as the Magic advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in six games.\nWilliams re-signed with the team on August 3, 2010. On September 29, he had arthroscopic knee surgery, though he was still able to play the season-opener on October 28. After missing time due to injury, Williams was unable to crack the Magic's rotation behind Nelson and new acquisitions Chris Duhon and Gilbert Arenas. He was granted his release from the team on January 26, 2011.\nReturn to Memphis (2011).\nWilliams signed a two-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies on February 7, 2011, returning to the team where he was their all-time assists leader (since surpassed by Mike Conley). The rest of the season was fully guaranteed, with a player option for the second year of the contract.\nOn April 18, 2011, Williams officially announced his second retirement from the NBA.\nBIG3 career.\nOn February 1, 2017, it was announced that Willams would be playing in the 3-on-3 basketball league BIG3, on the 3 Headed Monsters with former teammate Rashard Lewis. In his debut he injured his knee, and missed the remainder of the BIG3 season as a result.\nPlayer profile.\nEarly in his career, Williams built a reputation for an unorthodox \"street\" style of play. He became a regular on \"SportsCenter\" for his spectacular passes and dazzling assists. He regularly attempted, and mostly completed, passes such as behind-the back, no-look and half-court. Popular user-generated Internet-video sites contain many \"home-made\" highlight videos dedicated solely to Williams' highlights. He was also known for taking spectacular three-point shots that drove home audiences wild. With his risky play, he was turnover-prone at times: in his second and fourth years, he peaked at over 3.5 per game. His playing style led Williams to be benched during crucial periods of some games. For example, in the 2000 NBA Playoffs, Williams sat out most of the fourth quarter in all five games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\nIn his later years with Memphis and Miami, he significantly tamed his extravagant playing style and consistently achieved one of the highest assists per turnover ratios in the NBA. Throughout his entire career, Williams continued to be known for his assists and for his creativity.\nIn the Rookie Challenge of the NBA All-Star Weekend in 2000, in a counter-attack, Williams made a no-look, behind-the-back pass off the elbow on a full sprint to Raef LaFrentz. \"I did it so you all wouldn't ask me to ever do it again\", Williams said.\nNickname.\nWilliams' nickname was \"White Chocolate\". The nickname was started in Williams' rookie year by Stephanie Shepherd, a media relations assistant with the Sacramento Kings. \"I came up with that name because of his style\", Shepard said. \"He has flash and pizazz. The way he does things with the ball is incredible to me. It reminds me of, like, schoolyard street ball when I go to Chicago.\"\nPersonal life.\nDespite his NBA success, Williams preferred to stay out of the spotlight and live a low-key lifestyle, spending time with his family. Williams married Denika Kisty, a University of Florida alumnus, a former member of the Florida Gators track and field team, and an All-American javelin thrower. Williams and his wife have three children; in his NBA profile, he listed his family as his \"most treasured possession\". Their daughter Mia is a freshman at the University of Florida, and a member of the Florida Gators softball team \nWilliams is a close friend of former Miami Heat teammate and center Shaquille O'Neal, having been neighbors in Orlando for three years. \"I was the one who helped broker the deal this summer\", O'Neal said (in 2005) of the five-team, 13-player trade that brought Williams to Miami. \"He wanted to play with me and I wanted to play with a guard who loves to pass and I think it'll be a good combination for myself and [guard] Dwyane Wade.\"\nWilliams has a number of tattoos, which include a panther on his right arm, a dragon on his left arm (which was redone in the 2007–08 season), an eye on his chest of which he said, \"It's why I pass so good, I have a 3rd eye\". In the 2000–01 season, he had a wolf holding a basketball tattooed on his arm, and \"WHITEBOY\" tattooed across his knuckles. He also has his children's names on his forearms.\nSocial and charitable work.\nIn 2003, Williams, when he was playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, along with Dr. Bob Wallace of the UT Medical Group founded the We Will Foundation, a charitable foundation to benefit children facing treatment for craniofacial deformities.\nWilliams was also a frequent visitor to St. Jude Children's Hospital when he was a player in Memphis, Tennessee. \"I started going over not long after I got here,\" said Williams, who has always said he likes to be around kids. \"I go see them when I can, and it's great to see their faces light up!\""

        "title": "Chris Duffy (baseball)",
        "text": "Christopher Ellis Duffy (born April 20, 1980) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder. He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Milwaukee Brewers.\nAmateur career.\nDuffy played baseball for two seasons at South Mountain Community College in Arizona. In , he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 43rd round of the draft, but opted to attend Arizona State University instead. At ASU in , he batted .373 with four home runs, 37 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases and was named a First Team All-Pac-10 selection.\nProfessional career.\nHe was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 8th round of the 2001 MLB Draft and accepted a contract with them. He made steady progress through the Pirates' minor league system from to , spending time with their teams in Williamsport, Lynchburg, Altoona, and Indianapolis. Over 5 minor league seasons and 524 games, he achieved a .299 batting average with 27 home runs and 190 RBIs.\n2005 season.\nIn 2005, Duffy received his first call-up to the majors on April 7 but spent only two weeks with the team before returning to Indianapolis on April 21. On July 17, he was again called up and spent the rest of the season on the Pirates' roster. Before an injury in late August ended his season, he hit .341 with 1 home run and 9 RBIs in 39 games with the Pirates.\n2006 season.\nIn , Duffy began the season as the Pirates' starting center fielder. After faring poorly at the plate in April and May, however, the Pirates optioned him to the minor leagues on May 14. After an emotional closed-door discussion with the general manager and manager, Duffy unilaterally decided to instead return to his home in Glendale, Arizona, causing the Pirates to suspend his pay. While Duffy had been very critical of manager Jim Tracy for insisting that he change his batting style, he insisted through his agent that he was not protesting the Pirates' decision. Rather, he was on leave for personal reasons that he did not wish to disclose, but that reportedly had to do with a lack of desire to continue a career in professional sports.\nDuffy returned to the minor leagues after about a month and—despite earlier reports that the decision to quit had nothing to do with Tracy's change to his batting style—immediately reverted to his 2005 batting style and hit for a .349 average in 26 games. Duffy returned to the majors on August 2 and, apparently with the support of the clubhouse, Tracy installed him directly into the starting center field and leadoff spots.\n2007 season.\nOn June 8, 2007, he hit an inside-the-park home run at Yankee Stadium.\n2008 season and beyond.\nDuffy failed to earn a spot on the Pirates' active roster, mainly due to injuries. On July 31, Duffy was designated for assignment after the Pirates traded Jason Bay for four players. He cleared waivers and was added to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians roster. On December 18, he signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers with an invitation to spring training. Duffy was assigned to the Brewers' Triple-A Nashville Sounds, but was on the temporary inactive list for a part of the season.\nDuffy soon later signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. Duffy was released unexpectedly during the 2010 season, and has not played professional baseball since."

        "title": "History of cricket to 1725",
        "text": "The earliest definite reference to the sport of cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., an \"Old Style\" Julian date which is 27 January 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in the records of a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, regarding usage of a parcel of land. John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had played cricket on the land when he was a boy in about 1550. Derrick's testimony is confirmation that the sport was being played by the middle of the 16th century, but its true origin is unknown. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, probably somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. There have been suggestions that it can be traced to Flemish immigrants then resident in the area. The origin of the word cricket could derive from the Flemish word \"krick(-e)\", meaning a stick. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.\nThe sparse information available about the early years suggests that it may have been a children's game in the 16th century but, by 1611, it had become an adult pastime. The earliest known organised match was played in about 1611, a year in which other significant references to the sport are dated. From 1611 to 1725, fewer than thirty matches are known to have been organised between recognised teams. Similarly, only a limited number of players, teams and venues of the period have been recorded. The earliest matches played by English parish teams are examples of village cricket. Although village matches are now considered minor in status, the early matches are significant in cricket's history simply because they are known. There were no newspaper reports of matches until the end of the seventeenth century and so the primary sources are court records and private diaries, hence games were rarely recorded.\nDuring the reign of Charles I, the gentry took an increased interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated in the years following the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. The patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.\nIn the first quarter of the 18th century, more information about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons—such as Edwin Stead; Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond; and Sir William Gage—were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest-known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which gambling and alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.\nOrigins of cricket as a children's game.\nThe most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as circa 1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.\nA number of words in common use at the time are thought to be possible sources for cricket's name. In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called \"creckett\". Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch \"krick\"(\"-e\"), meaning a stick; or the Old English \"cricc\" or \"cryce\" meaning a crutch or staff. In what may be an early reference to the sport, a 1533 poem attributed to John Skelton describes Flemish weavers as \"kings of \"crekettes\", a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin. In Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755), he derived cricket from \"cryce\", Saxon, a stick\". In Old French, the word \"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick, though this may have been the origin of croquet. The first mention of \"criquet\" in France is in a letter of grievance to King Louis XI on 11 October 1478, following a riot in Liettres. Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church, the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, \"met de (krik ket)sen\" (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").\nCricket was probably devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.\nAll acknowledged subject experts and authorities agree that there is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of \"Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket\". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or \"vice versa\", cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.\n\"Creag\".\nOn Thursday, 10 March 1300 (Julian calendar), wardrobe accounts of King Edward I of England included refunds to one John de Leek of monies that he had paid out to enable Prince Edward to play \"creag and other games\" at both Westminster and Newenden. Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It has been suggested that creag was an early form of cricket, but it could have been something quite different. Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word \"craic\" here taken as an Irish word meaning fun, entertainment, or enjoyable conversation. This sense of the word \"crack\" is found in Irish English, Scottish English, and Geordie in North East England. In Ireland the spelling \"craic\" is now more common than \"crack\".\nEarliest definite references.\nThe earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere in England (and hence anywhere in the world) is in evidence given at a 1598 legal case, concerning ownership of a parcel of land, which confirms that it was played on common land in Guildford, Surrey, around 1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to 27 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar fifty years earlier at the Free School of Guildford, \"hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies\", confirming that the sport was played there by schoolboys c.1550. It is perhaps significant that cricket is the only one of the \"plaies\" to be specifically named.\nIn 1598, there was a reference to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by Giovanni Florio. His definition of the word was: \"to make a noise as a cricket, to play \"cricket-a-wicket\", and be merry\". Florio is the first writer known to have defined cricket in terms of both an insect and a game. In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611, Florio infers that to play cricket-a-wicket has sexual associations with references to ', defined \"as we say cricket a wicket, or '\", and ', defined \"to thrum a wench lustily till the bed cry '\".\nThe development of village cricket: 1611–1660.\nBeginning of adult participation.\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Kent is deduced from a 1640 court case which recorded a \"cricketing\" of the Weald and the Upland versus the Chalk Hill at Chevening \"about thirty years since\" (around 1610). This is the earliest known village cricket match; and the earliest known organised match in Kent, in England and in the world. Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century. As with the 1598 reference, the case concerned the land on which the game was played.\nIn 1611, a French-English dictionary was published by Randle Cotgrave who defined the noun \"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\"; the verb form of the word is \"crosser\", defined as \"to play at cricket\". Although cricket was defined as a boys' game in Cotgrave's dictionary, as per the Guildford schoolboys above, other references from this time indicate adult participation. The first is in a 1613 court case which recorded that someone was assaulted with a \"cricket staffe\" at Wanborough, near Guildford. In 1616, John Bullokar referred to cricket in his \"An English Expositor\" as \"a kind of game with a ball\". In 1617, the 18-year-old Oliver Cromwell is recorded as playing cricket and football in London. This is the earliest definite reference to cricket in London.\nIn 1624, a fatality occurred following a match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes in Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the head by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first \"Laws of Cricket\" were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.\nBreaking the Sabbath.\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Sussex was in 1611 and relates to ecclesiastical court records stating that two parishioners of Sidlesham, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, had failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance, which meant confessing their guilt to the whole church congregation the following Sunday.\nThe Sidlesham case is the first of several 17th century cricket references, until the Restoration in 1660, arising from Puritan disapproval of recreational activity, especially on Sundays. Puritan interference had become enough of a problem by 1617 for James I to issue the \"Declaration of Sports\" (also known as \"The Book of Sports\") which listed the sports and recreations that were permitted on Sundays. Cricket is not mentioned. Initially, the declaration was effective in Lancashire only, partly as a reaction to Puritan suppression there of certain activities which were pursued by the Roman Catholic gentry. In 1618, the declaration was issued nationally and then reissued by Charles I in 1633. Sunday amusements were strongly opposed by the Puritans.\nThe declaration had limited success until the Civil War began in 1642. The Puritans were by then in control of Parliament which closed the theatres and issued sanctions against other recreational activities although, again, there was no mention of cricket except when individual players were accused of \"breaking the Sabbath\". The \"Declaration of Sports\" manuscript was publicly burned by order of the Puritan Parliament in 1643.\nIn 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester, were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was that \"a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt\"! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand would drastically confirm. In 1628, an ecclesiastical case related to a game at East Lavant, also near Chichester, being played on a Sunday. One of the defendants argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12 pence and ordered to do penance.\nThere are three further references before the Civil War. In a 1636 court case concerning a tithe dispute, a witness called Henry Mabbinck testified that he played cricket \"in the Parke\" at West Horsley in Surrey. Another ecclesiastical case recorded parishioners of Midhurst, Sussex, playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February 1637 (i.e., Julian date). In 1640, Puritan clerics at both Maidstone and Harbledown, near Canterbury, denounced cricket as \"profane\", especially if played on Sunday.\nWhen the English Civil War began in 1642, the Long Parliament banned theatres, as they had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, there is no evidence of cricket being prohibited. Except that players must not \"break the Sabbath\", references to the game before and during the Commonwealth suggest that it was approved; and Cromwell himself had been a player as a young man.\nIn 1654, three men were prosecuted at Eltham in Kent for playing cricket on a Sunday. As the Puritans were now firmly in power, Cromwell's Protectorate having been established the previous year, the penalty was doubled to 24 pence (two shillings). The defendants were charged with \"breaking the Sabbath\", not with playing cricket. Similarly, when Cromwell's commissioners banned sport in Ireland two years later on the grounds of \"unlawful assembly\", there is no evidence that the ban included cricket, which had probably not reached Ireland by that time.\nPuritan prejudice did not survive the Restoration. In 1671, a man called Edward Bound was charged with playing cricket on the Sabbath and was exonerated: evidence that attitudes had changed. The case was reported in Shere, Surrey.\nThe beginning of amateur cricket.\nThe beginnings of cricket's social division between amateurs and professionals, from which the annual Gentlemen v Players contest ultimately evolved, can be traced to the reign of Charles I. In 1629, Henry Cuffin, a curate at Ruckinge in Kent, was prosecuted by an archdeacon's court for playing cricket on Sunday evening after prayers. He claimed that several of his fellow players were \"persons of repute and fashion\". This statement is the first evidence of cricket achieving popularity among the gentry.\nIt was the gentry who introduced large-scale gambling into cricket and some of these gamblers subsequently became patrons by forming select teams that would improve their chances of winning. During the Commonwealth, gambling was, of political necessity, low key. The earliest reference to gambling on a cricket match is in the records of a 1646 court case concerning non-payment of a wager that was made on a game at Coxheath in Kent on Friday, 29 May that year. Curiously, considering the huge sums of money staked later in the century, this wager was for twelve candles, but the participants included members of the local gentry. The match at Coxheath is the earliest known example of an \"odds\" game as two Coxheath players were against four Maidstone players; the Coxheath two won. It was possibly a single wicket match and, if that could be proved, it would be the earliest on record.\nIn 1652, a case at Cranbrook against John Rabson, Esq. and others referred to \"a certain unlawful game called cricket\". Rabson was evidently a member of the gentry but the other defendants were all working class. Cricket has long been recognised as a sport that bridged the class divide but, in time, the cricketing gentlemen came to be called \"amateurs\" to emphasise the distinction between themselves and the professionals who belonged to the lower social classes, mostly to the working class. The amateur became not merely someone who played cricket in his spare time but a particular type of top-class cricketer who existed officially until 1962, when the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished and all the then first-class players became nominally professional. In terms of remuneration, amateurs claimed expenses for playing while professionals were paid a salary or fee. Amateur cricket was an extension of the game played in schools, universities and other centres of education, both as a curricular and extracurricular activity. The schools and universities formed the \"production line\" that created nearly all the top-class amateur players.\nThere are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools but, in 1647, a Latin poem contains a probable reference to cricket being played at Winchester College; if so, it is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire. There is a reference to the game at St Paul's School, London c.1665 concerning John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who studied there. In his \"Social History of English Cricket\", Derek Birley comments that school cricket was \"alive and well during the interregnum\" (1649–1660). He speculates that the game \"must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east\" of England. He doubts, however, that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton College and Westminster School, all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together. As evidenced by the legal cases of 1646 and 1652, described above, cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.\nThe earliest reference to cricket at Oxford University is dated 1673. In John Phillips' \"Duellum Musicum\", a 1673 pamphlet concerning music tuition, there is a criticism of his rival Thomas Salmon, who had boasted of being a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford: \"He shews but a slender sign of his University-Education: Where he seems to have spent his time rather in the more laudable Exercises of Trap and Cricket, than in any sound Reading\".\nDepending on when Salmon graduated, it would seem that cricket was a normal activity at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\". A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during the first quarter of the 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called \"In Certamen Pilae\" (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his \"Musae Juveniles\".\nDevelopment of important cricket: 1660–1700.\nIt was during the second half of the 17th century that, as Roy Webber put it, \"the game took a real grip\" especially in the south-eastern counties. The nobility withdrew to their country estates during the Commonwealth and were involved in village cricket as a pastime which, after the Commonwealth expired in 1660, they took with them when they returned to London. Even so, there is a shortage of references from this period due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed stringent controls on the newspaper industry and sports, including cricket, were not reported. The few surviving references have been found in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. In May 1666, Sir Robert Paston, a resident of Richmond, wrote a letter to his wife and mentioned that their son had taken part in \"a game of criquett (\"sic\") on Richmond Green\" which is the first reference to cricket at Richmond Green, a popular venue for matches during the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe Restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and sanctions imposed by the Puritans on sports were also lifted. According to Rowland Bowen, \"it is likely that the Restoration was the crucial factor in leading to the social acceptance of the game\". Although there are only scattered references to the game in the time of Charles II, it is clear that its popularity was increasing and that it was expanding.\nThe Restoration was effectively completed during the spring of 1660 and, in the general euphoria which both accompanied and followed these historic events, gambling on cricket and other sports was freely pursued. The nobility adopted cricket as one of their main sports along with horse racing and prizefighting. Under their patronage, the first teams representing several parishes and even whole counties were formed in the 1660s and the period saw the first \"great matches\" as cricket evolved into a major sport. A significant aspect of this evolution was the introduction of professionalism as the nobility returned to London after the Restoration. They were keen to develop cricket and brought with them some of the \"local experts\" from village cricket whom they now employed as professional players.\nH. S. Altham asserted that, within a year or two of the Restoration, \"it became the thing in London society to make matches and form clubs\". He claimed that a kind of \"feudal patronage\" was established as the nobility took control of the sport, their interest fuelled by the opportunities for gambling that it provided, and this set the pattern for cricket's development through the next century. These claims by Altham are challenged by John Major who wrote that he could find no evidence at all of matches in London before the 1700s and no mention of any club prior to 1722.\nThe Gaming Act 1664 was passed by the Cavalier Parliament to try to curb some of the post-Restoration excesses, including gambling on cricket, and it limited stakes to £100. That was equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. It is known that cricket could attract stakes of 50 guineas by 1697 and it was funded by gambling throughout the next century.\nThere was a significant development at Maidstone on Saturday, 28 March 1668 when the quarter sessions made a ruling that customs and excise could not claim excise duty on alcoholic drinks sold at a \"kricketing\"; it was further ruled that a match promoter had the right to sell ale to spectators, presumably after obtaining the necessary licence. As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to \"Puritan morality\", and it could have been the beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol. Derek Birley's comment on the excise ruling was that cricket's \"connection with public houses is historic in every sense of the word\". In his view, the sport had \"arrived\" because the brewery trade was the earliest and strongest sponsor of popular sport.\nIn 1677, accounts of Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex, include an item which refers to £3 being paid to him when he went to a cricket match being played at \"ye Dicker\", which was a common near Herstmonceux in East Sussex. In 1678, there was mention of cricket as \"a play\" (presumably in the sense of a sport that is played) in a Latin dictionary published by Dr Adam Littleton. In 1694, accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at Lewes.\nIt has been claimed that Mitcham Cricket Club was formed in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. While Mitcham is believed by some to be the world's oldest cricket club, there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1722. Croydon, Dartford and London may all have been founded by the 1720s but no dates of origin have been found, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722. John Major and his team of researchers could find no evidence for any club prior to 1722. Major mentions Mitcham as one of several localities in which impromptu games were thriving on common land. The others were Chelsea, Kennington, Clapham, Walworth and the Weald.\nLondon Cricket Club was to become chiefly associated with the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. This venue was first mentioned re cricket on Friday, 7 May 1725, when the minutes of the Honourable Artillery Company referred to its being used for cricket: there is a note which concerns \"the abuse done to the herbage of the ground by the cricket players\". The Artillery Ground became the feature venue for cricket in the mid-18th century.\nIn 1695, Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696. Censorship had already been relaxed following the Bill of Rights 1689. It was from this time that cricket matters could be reported in the newspapers, but it would be a very long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, reports. The earliest known newspaper report of a \"great match\" was in the \"Foreign Post\" dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:\n\"The middle of last week (i.e., probably on Wednesday, 30 June 1697) a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece\".\nThe match has been recorded by more than one source, starting with G. B. Buckley who said it is the earliest record of an eleven-a-side match. The stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven-a-side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled. Following the decision of the English government in 1695 to allow freedom of the press (i.e., they decided not to renew the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which had inhibited the scope of publications), it was possible for sporting events to be reported; but, as John Major says, reports in the early newspapers were sparse, although trivia tended to make good copy and large wagers between rival patrons were given coverage.\nPeriodicals called \"The Post Boy\" and \"The Post Man\" were in circulation during the early 18th century. In 1700, a series of ten-a-side matches to be held on Clapham Common, near Vauxhall, was pre-announced on Saturday, 30 March, by \"The Post Boy\". The first was to take place on Easter Monday, 1 April, and prizes of £10 and £20 were at stake. No match reports could be found so the results and scores remain unknown. The advert says the teams would consist of ten \"Gentlemen\" per side but the invitation to attend was to \"Gentlemen and others\". This clearly implies that cricket had achieved both the patronage that underwrote it through the 18th century and the spectators who demonstrated its lasting popular appeal. As the event involved \"gentlemen only\", it was probably minor in quality but is nevertheless the earliest known organised match in the county of Surrey.\nRules and equipment of early cricket.\nEarly cricketers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat is said to have evolved in the 1760s after the introduction of the pitched delivery.\nThe record of the 1622 case at Boxgrove contains the earliest reference to the cricket bat. The term \"batt\" in cricket was peculiar to Kent and Sussex, where coastal smugglers were known as \"batmen\" because of the cudgels they carried. The earliest reference to a \"flat-faced\" bat (i.e., with a flat surface at the bottom of the stick in ice hockey style) also occurs in 1622. The term \"bat\" remained comparatively rare until about 1720. The terms in more general use were \"staff\", \"stave\" or \"stick\". These tended to have regional usage: for example, \"stave\" was used in the Gloucester area and \"batt\" in the south-east; while \"staff\" and especially \"stick\" were more widely used. \"Bat\" is derived from the French \"battledore\", shaped like a table tennis bat, which was used by washerwomen to beat their washing with.\nThe earliest reference to the cricket ball is found in 1658 in \"Mysteries of Love and Eloquence\" by Edward Phillips. The pitch has been 22 yards long (i.e., a chain) since the first known code of Laws in 1744 and it is believed this length had been in use since the introduction of Gunter's chain in 1620. The over consisted of four deliveries until the 19th century.\nThe earliest known reference to the wicket is contained in lines written in an old bible in 1680 which invited \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\". Marden is in West Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to Hambledon, which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire. The wicket until the 1770s comprised two stumps and a single bail. By that time, the shape of the wicket was high and narrow after the 1744 Laws defined the dimensions as 22 inches high and six inches wide. But earlier 18th century pictures show a wicket that was low and broad, perhaps two feet wide by one foot high. The ends of the stumps were forked to support the light bail and there were criteria for the firmness of pitching the stumps into the ground and for the delicate placing of the bail so that it would easily topple when a stump was hit.\nThere has been a lot of conjecture about the origin of the wicket, but suffice to say that the 17th century outline shape is more akin to the profile of a church stool, which is low and broad. Furthermore, the legs of the stool were called stumps, which adds further credence to the idea that stools were used as early wickets. According to the \"Churchwarden's Accounts for Great St. Mary's Church of Cambridge\" (1504–1635), a church stool was sometimes known in the south-east by the Dutch name of \"kreckett\", this being the same word used for the game by John Derrick in 1598.\nThe earliest known mention of the umpire dates from 1680 and is the first entry in Buckley's \"Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket\". Buckley does not quote the reference \"that is quite unfit for publication nowadays\" but he confirms a clear reference to \"the two umpires\" and that the double wicket form of the game was already well known in London. It is also the first mention of cricket in the county of Middlesex.\nThere were two main forms of cricket in the 17th and 18th centuries. One was single wicket in which, as the name implies, there is only one batsman, although teams of threes or fives often took part. The converse is the \"double wicket\" form, with two batsmen, and this has long been associated with eleven-a-side teams playing two innings each and it is these games which, depending on the teams involved, have important match status. Although single wicket was in vogue through the period of this history, the earliest \"definite\" record of a single wicket match is in 1726, so it is out of scope in this article.\nIn early cricket, there were two umpires as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was required to touch in order to complete his run. There were two scorers who sat on the field and recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.\nEnglish cricket in the early 18th century.\nPatrons.\nOn an unknown date in 1702, the 1st Duke of Richmond's XI defeated an Arundel XI at an unspecified venue in Sussex. The source for this game is a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on Monday, 14 December 1702. The receipt was for one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke \"for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men\". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory. The venue was probably either Goodwood, where Richmond had his estate, or Arundel, possibly on Bury Hill which was used for cricket in later years. Arundel was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.\nAfter the 1st Duke of Richmond died in 1723, his son Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, quickly succeeded him as cricket's main benefactor and became a famous patron of Sussex cricket for the next thirty years. The 2nd Duke enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his friend Sir William Gage, another Sussex patron. Their teams played each other many times and their earliest known contest was on Tuesday, 20 July 1725, five days after Sir William's team was beaten by unknown opponents. Richmond wrote to Gage in early July 1725 and issued a challenge for a match to be played at Goodwood. Gage replied to him by letter on 16 July and confirmed that his team would play the Duke's on Tuesday, 20 July. Gage then stated that he is \"in great affliction from being shamefully beaten yesterday (Thursday, 15 July 1725) the first match I played ys (\"sic\") year\". He went on to wish the Duke success in everything except his cricket match. The game on 20 July was actually played at Bury Hill, Arundel and Richmond's team won by \"above forty (runs)\". The report in the \"Daily Journal\" newspaper on Wednesday, 21 July, confirms Bury Hill (then called Berry Hill), near Arundel, as the venue. The match, played before \"a vast Concourse of People\", was hosted by Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk who gave a ball at Arundel Castle in the evening.\nThe main rival to Richmond and Gage was Edwin Stead of Maidstone, who was the first of the noted Kent patrons. The Sussex teams of Richmond and Gage enjoyed an inter-county rivalry with Stead's Kent that could have originated the concept of the County Championship.\nThe terms of the wager.\nThe patrons ensured that cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally applicable to horse racing and prizefighting, was based on the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.\nSometimes, gambling would lead to dispute and two matches ended up in court when rival interests sought legal rulings on the terms of their wagers. On Monday, 1 September 1718, a game on White Conduit Fields in Islington between London and the Rochester Punch Club was unfinished because three Rochester players \"made an elopement\" in an attempt to have the game declared incomplete so that they would retain their stake money. London was clearly winning at the time. The London players sued for their winnings and the game while incomplete was the subject of a noted lawsuit in which the terms of the wager were at issue. The court ordered that the match must be \"played out\" and this happened in early July 1719 (the exact date is uncertain but it was before the 4th). Rochester with four wickets standing needed thirty more runs to win but were all out for 9. It is not certain if 30 was their overall target or if they needed thirty more in addition to runs scored in the original encounter; equally, it is not known if 9 was the innings total they achieved or if they added nine more to their \"overnight\" score. London's 21-run victory is the earliest known definite result of any cricket match. The match is the earliest known mention of White Conduit Fields as a venue.\nIn 1724 (exact date unknown), Edwin Stead's XI v Chingford ended early because the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team held the advantage. Another court case followed. It is known that Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and ordered them, as in the London v Rochester match in 1718, to play it out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Pratt \"referr'd the said Cause back to Dartford Heath, to be played on where they left off, and a Rule of Court was made accordingly\". The game was completed in 1726 but the final result is not on record, and there is no confirmation that Stead's team held their advantage and won.\nThe introduction of articles of agreement, agreed before matches by the stakeholders, largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers. The concept was more important in terms of defining the rules of play and eventually these were codified as the \"Laws of Cricket\".\nMatches of the early 18th century.\nOn Tuesday, 24 July 1705, \"The Post Man\" announced West of Kent v Chatham, an 11-a-side game to be played in Kent on Tuesday, 7 August. The primary source gives the venue as \"Maulden\" which almost certainly refers to Town Malling. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called \"West Kent\" and \"East Kent\". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.\nOn Thursday, 26 June 1707, there was a London v Mitcham match at Lamb's Conduit Field, Holborn. The result is unknown. This is the earliest known important match in Middlesex and possibly the earliest known to involve the original London Cricket Club, though the date of the club's formation is uncertain and the team here might have been an \"ad hoc\" London XI. In a similar vein to the \"all England\" term used later in the century, the source calls this team \"all London\". The Mitcham team may have represented the extant Mitcham Cricket Club, which has a claimed foundation date of 1685.\nOn Tuesday, 1 and Tuesday, 8 July 1707, Croydon played London twice, the first game played in Croydon, probably at Duppas Hill, and the second at Lamb's Conduit Field in Holborn. Both matches were advertised by \"The Post Man\" as \"two great matches at cricket (to be) plaid, between London and Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday, 1 July, and the other to be plaid in Lamb's-Conduit-Fields, near Holborn, on the Tuesday following, being the 3rd (\"sic\") of July\". No post-match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown. The match in Croydon is the earliest known important match in Surrey. As with the previous match, it is not known if the teams at this time represented formally constituted clubs and it is possible that both were \"ad hoc\" teams drawn from local residents. Croydon and London both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century. The match in Holborn was a return to the one on 1 July. There has been some confusion about the date of the second match following a misreading of the original source by H. T. Waghorn, who was the first modern researcher, but Tuesday, 8 July is believed to be correct.\nOn Wednesday, 23 June 1708, a local match took place somewhere in the Canterbury area and was recorded in the diary of one Thomas Minter, a Canterbury resident, who wrote: \"We beat Ash Street at Crickets (\"sic\")\". Although this was probably a minor match only, it illustrates the popularity of cricket in Kent.\nThe earliest known match that definitely involved county teams, or teams using the names of counties, was Kent v Surrey at Dartford Brent on Wednesday, 29 June 1709. This was advertised in the \"Post Man\" the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £50. From this time, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest \"inter-county matches\" were really inter-parish matches involving two villages on either side of a county boundary. Dartford was an important club in the first half of the 18th century and the match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.\nOne player who could have taken part in the 1709 match was William Bedle (1680–1768), of Dartford, who is the earliest great player whose name has been recorded. He was \"reckoned to be the most expert player in England\" and must have been in his prime c.1700 to c.1725. Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent; Edmund Chapman and Stephen Dingate of Surrey; Tim Coleman of London; and Thomas Waymark of Sussex.\nVillage cricket continued to thrive in the 18th century. On Friday, 31 May 1717, Thomas Marchant, a farmer from Hurstpierpoint in Sussex, first mentioned cricket in his diary. He made numerous references to the game, particularly concerning his local club, until 1727. His son Will played for \"our parish\", as he often called the Hurstpierpoint team. In total, his diaries mention 21 village matches and the entries provide evidence of the widespread popularity of cricket in Sussex. It is from the 1717 season that a continuous history of English cricket by season is possible. Records of cricket have survived from every season after 1716, although the details in most seasons through the 18th century remain sparse.\nDartford v London.\nThe first great rivalry in cricket history was between the Dartford and London clubs who are first known to have played each other in 1722. London played some matches against Kent but the county side is believed to have largely consisted of Dartford players. On Wednesday, 19 August 1719, London v Kent was played at White Conduit Fields and Kent won. The report said the teams played for \"a considerable sum of money\". There is an insight into the priorities of early 18th century cricketers as the contemporary report concludes with: \"The Kentish men won the wager\" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match).\nOn Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders were badly injured by a clash of heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the advertising and reporting of cricket after this game and he wondered if that was due to a perception of the sport as dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, \"the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased\". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. A potential impact on reporting was the Stamp Act 1712 which applied stamp duty to newspapers and so increased their publication costs. This in turn caused publishers to reduce paper size with limited space for content.\nOn Wednesday, 18 July 1722, London v Dartford was the subject of a letter in \"The Weekly Journal\" dated Saturday, 21 July 1722. It is believed the match took place somewhere in the Islington area, so the exact venue may have been White Conduit Fields. The match was abandoned following a dispute. The letter said: \"A Match at Cricket was made between the little Parish of Dartford in Kent, and the Gentlemen known by the name of the London Club\". Teams styled \"London\" were already in existence, as above, but this is the first actual reference to a \"London Club\".\nDartford and London met at Dartford Brent on Thursday, 11 June 1724 and, one week later, a return game was the earliest known match at Kennington Common, near where The Oval is now sited. The results of both matches are unknown.\nOther matches in the 1720s.\nOn Wednesday, 6 July 1720, Kingston v Richmond was played at an unknown venue and Kingston won. The secondary source is uncertain about the date due to a slight ambiguity in the primary source, a contemporary newspaper published Saturday, 16 July, which refers to \"Wednesday last\". The date of the match must therefore be either 6 or 13 July. The source says 5 or 12 July but this is an error as those dates were Tuesdays.\nThere was a Surrey v London match at Moulsey Hurst on an unknown date in 1723. The result is unknown. The source states that \"XI Gentlemen of Surrey played XI of London at Moulsey Hurst during the summer\". It is the earliest known mention of Moulsey Hurst as a venue for cricket.\nIn 1723, the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford recorded in his journal: \"At Dartford upon the Heath as we came out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence\". It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place.\nOn Monday, 10 August 1724, there was a match at Penshurst Park (result unknown) which featured the combined parishes of Penshurst, Tonbridge &amp; Wadhurst versus Dartford. This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson, who may have watched it. No details are known but Mr Dawson says it was \"a great cricket match\". Some sources have mistakenly given the venue as Islington but contemporary newspapers confirm that it took place at Penshurst Park.\nThe growth of cricket in England and overseas.\nThe earliest known mention of cricket being played outside England is dated Saturday, 6 May 1676. A diarist called Henry Tonge, who was part of a British mission at Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire, recorded that \"at least forty of the English\" left the city for recreational purposes and, having found a nice place to pitch a tent for dinner, they \"had several pastimes and sports\" including \"krickett\". At six they \"returned home in good order\".\nThe first definite references to cricket in India and North America date from the early 18th century. It so happens that these precede the earliest-known mentions of the sport in any of Ireland, Scotland or Wales occurring much later in the century.\nIn 1709, cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in the Colony of Virginia. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World.\nIn 1721, British sailors of the East India Company were reported to be playing cricket at Cambay, near Baroda, and this is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: \"When my boat was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys, we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they would come and be spectators of\".\nWhile Britain's seafaring and trading concerns ensured the spread of cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels. Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1707, Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road under the control of trustees drawn from local landowners and traders. The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 140 years until the railway network became widespread."

        "title": "History of English cricket (1726–1750)",
        "text": "In the years from 1726 to 1750, cricket became an established sport in London and the south-eastern counties of England. In 1726, it was already a thriving sport in the south east and, though limited by the constraints of travel at the time, it was slowly gaining adherents in other parts of England, its growth accelerating with references being found in many counties. Having been essentially a rural pastime for well over a century, cricket became a focus for wealthy patrons and gamblers whose interests funded its growth throughout the 18th century.\nPatrons such as the 2nd Duke of Richmond sought to ensure order both on and off the field of play. The earliest known written rules were deployed in 1727 and the first code of laws was enacted in 1744. Ground enclosure began in 1731 and, later in the decade, admission fees were introduced. Media interest grew as the newspaper industry developed, a lead being taken by two new publications. London's Artillery Ground became the sport's showcase venue with top-class matches played in front of large crowds. The single wicket form enjoyed huge popularity in the 1740s and reached its zenith in 1748. Leading players of the time included Robert \"Long Robin\" Colchin of Bromley and Richard Newland of Slindon.\nContinuing growth of cricket.\nCricket was still a regional sport in England, albeit a very popular one, as the constraints of travel limited its introduction to the rest of the country. There are the earliest mentions of cricket being played in Gloucestershire in 1729, Buckinghamshire in 1730, and Hampshire in 1733. Its focal point in the mid-18th century was the Artillery Ground at Finsbury in London. Around 1730, this succeeded Kennington Common as the preferred home venue of London Cricket Club and became the stage for numerous important matches, including lucrative single wicket contests. While London represented the metropolitan side of cricket, there were several famous rural clubs like Dartford, Chertsey and Croydon which could challenge London and provide the main strength in their respective county teams, Kent and Surrey. Middlesex and Sussex could also put strong teams into the field. Well-known venues of the time included the Artillery Ground, Dartford Brent, Kennington Common, Moulsey Hurst and Richmond Green.\nCricket thrived on the funds provided by patronage, gambling and large, enthusiastic crowds. As its popularity grew, it began to spread outwards from its south-eastern heartland. The game had already reached the Americas and India as confirmed by references to the game being played overseas by English sailors and colonists in the first quarter of the 18th century.\nThe most prominent patrons in the 1720s were Edwin Stead (Kent), the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage (both Sussex) and Alan Brodrick (Surrey). Gage and Richmond continued to support cricket through the 1730s when additional patrons were the Prince of Wales and Lord John Sackville. Among the few players whose names have been recorded in the 1730s were Thomas Waymark, Tim Coleman and John Bowra. Edwin Stead died on 28 August 1735.\nSome matches in the 1720s were arranged at places like Peper Harow and Penshurst Park which have long been horse racing locations; today, they both house point-to-point racecourses. There were strong gambling connections between cricket, racing and prizefighting throughout the 18th century with matches being staged at venues like Moulsey Hurst or, later, the Forest New Ground at Nottingham; and the fact that MCC and the Jockey Club were both founded by the \"Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Club\" which used to meet socially at the \"Star &amp; Garter\" on Pall Mall in London.\nMedia coverage.\nNo cricket had been reported in the infant newspaper industry before 1697 due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which controlled the press until 1696, but reports were beginning to increase by the mid-1720s, though it would be a very long time indeed before coverage became anything like comprehensive. Early reports tended to be an advertisement for a scheduled match or else a brief discussion of the gambling odds rather than the actual play and it was not until 1726 that players were first mentioned by name in a newspaper report. There was a significant increase in the number of matches reported during the 1730 season with four single wicket contests and several 11-a-side games, many featuring the London Club which was by then well established as the sport's premier club and taking on county opposition from Kent and Surrey. Match reports were much more common in the 1730s and were beginning to present increased detail, sometimes including the names of patrons and players. There is, therefore, a considerably larger record of the 1730s than of the previous decades.\nThe \"London Evening Post\" was founded in 1726 and the \"Daily Advertiser\" began publication in 1730. Both carried a good many cricket notices until they ceased publication in 1797 and 1798 respectively. The growth of the newspaper industry was important contemporarily for giving the sport much needed publicity and historically for providing glimpses into a developing sport that had still not learned how to record itself for posterity.\nThe match between Kent and All England played at the Artillery ground on 18 June 1744 was described in \"Cricket: An Heroic Poem\" by James Love. This was the first major piece of writing about cricket.\nThe \"Laws of Cricket\".\nArticles of Agreement, 1727.\nIn 1727, the 2nd Duke of Richmond organised two matches against Alan Brodrick and they drew up articles of agreement between them to determine the rules that must apply in these contests. This type of agreement seems to have been used throughout the period. It is the earliest known instance of rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) being formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. In early times, the rules would be agreed orally and subject to local variations so the articles of agreement were created to complement and clarify the rules. Another reference to articles of agreement occurs in 1730 when London played Kent at a venue called Frog Lane in Islington. The report says: \"but being obliged by their Articles to leave off at seven o'clock\", they could not finish it. London had a lead of 30 when play ended and there was a resumption on Kennington Common six days later. The first formalised \"Laws of Cricket\" were written in 1744.\nThe 1727 articles of agreement stated that \"the Duke of Richmond &amp; Mr. Brodrick shall determine the Ball or Balls to be played with\". Similar rules applied through the period and there was no known attempt to standardise bat or ball size until much later. Batsmen defended a two-stump wicket using a bat shaped like a modern hockey stick against a ball that was bowled all along the ground, either by rolling or skimming. The oldest known surviving cricket bat is dated 1729. It is on display in The Oval pavilion and belonged to one John Chitty of Knaphill, Surrey.\nPads, gloves and other forms of protective equipment were unknown. Umpires carried a stick, believed to be a bat, which the batsmen had to touch to complete a run. Scorers sat on a mound in the field and \"notched\" runs (then known as notches) on tally sticks. All runs had to be completed in full as boundaries were not recognised and there were no known rules concerning the care and maintenance of the wicket, although the leading bowler on the visiting team had the right to decide where the wickets would be pitched. The only early rule about pitch and wicket dimensions was re the length of the pitch at 23 yards in 1727; this became a chain (22 yards) by 1744.\n1744 code.\nThe 1744 Laws were codified by members of the London club but not typeset until 1752 and not published until 1755. Among the provisions were pitch and wicket dimensions, balls per over and the roles and responsibilities of the umpires. Referring to the 1774 Laws, John Major says that regulation had hitherto been \"rather informal\" and believes that the 1744 rules were only a revision or codification of existing practice. The dimensions of the wicket, two stumps topped by a single bail, were set at 22 inches high and six inches wide.\nSingle wicket.\nThe \"London Evening Post\" dated Saturday, 27 August 1726 carried an advertisement for a single wicket match between players called \"the noted Perry\" (of London) and \"the famous Piper\" (of Hampton), playing \"for twenty pounds a side\". The match was played at Moulsey Hurst, a multi-sport venue near Molesey in Surrey.\nThis is the first time that players are known to have been named in a newspaper and the match itself is the earliest known to have been played under single wicket rules. Single wicket was a form of top-class cricket that had periods of great popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, mainly for the opportunities it offered to gamblers. It became increasingly popular during the 1730s, with numerous big money events taking place at the Artillery Ground. This continued through the 1740s and single wicket reached a peak in the 1748 season.\nThere were four single wicket matches in the 1730 season, three of which involved four-man Kent teams led by Edwin Stead in matches against four of Brentford Cricket Club. The other game was between three of Surrey and three of Sussex. The stake was usually £50. In August 1735, there was a three against four match (result unknown) on Kennington Common, all the players being members of the London club.\nThe Artillery Ground.\nA London v Surrey match on 31 August 1730 took place at the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury, London. London won by 6 runs. It is the earliest definite match at the venue which was referred to in contemporary reports as the \"old\" Artillery Ground, but that may be because it was used frequently for other forms of sport or entertainment. It was generally used for matches involving the original London Club and also became the featured venue of all London cricket until the mid-1760s, after which the Hambledon Club increased its influence.\nMatches were recorded at the Artillery Ground until as late as 1778 but by then the London Club had disbanded, although its members continued their social and organisational existences and maintained their influence over the game as a whole.\nThe earliest known instances of ground enclosure occurred in 1731, the playing area on Kennington Common being roped off twice in an attempt to keep spectators off the field. Cricket is the first sport known to have enclosed its venues and it quickly became common practice with stakes and ropes being reported at the Artillery Ground in 1732. It is not clear when admission fees were first introduced but there was certainly a two pence charge in place at the Artillery Ground by the early 1740s.\nSchools and universities.\nIn 1727, Horace Walpole commented that cricket was already \"common\" at Eton College. This is the earliest reference to cricket both at Eton and in the county of Berkshire.\nControversies.\nCricket had some brushes with the law in the first half of the century, including two court cases about unpaid gambling debts. The second of these followed a match in 1724 between Stead's XI and a Chingford team on Dartford Brent. Terminating Stead's lawsuit, Lord Chief Justice Pratt ordered the match to be completed in order that the stakes could be settled. The replay took place in September 1726. In a letter written the same month, an Essex resident complained that a local Justice of the Peace had literally \"read the Riot Act\" to some people who were playing cricket. With reference to Pratt's ruling, the issue raised was that it was apparently lawful to play cricket in Kent but not in Essex.\nGambling was prevalent at cricket matches in Georgian England and many gambling- or alcohol-fuelled incidents occurred. The issue was not addressed by the sport's ruling body until the 1770s and it remained a significant aspect through the 1730s and 1740s. The other side of the coin was the reliance of cricket as a professional sport upon the investment accrued through gambling interests. The importance of gambling was illustrated in 1730 when a match between teams sponsored by Richmond and Gage was cancelled \"on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\". Waymark was the outstanding player of the day and stakes would have been laid on his expected performance. Without his involvement, all bets were \"off\" and so the game was a non-starter.\nA controversial match took place on Monday, 23 August 1731, when Thomas Chambers' XI took on the Duke of Richmond's XI (i.e., effectively a Middlesex v. Sussex match) at Richmond Green in a return match played for 200 guineas. It is notable in one sense as the earliest match of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23–5 (approximately). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with \"four or five more to have come in\" and needing \"about 8 to 10 notches\" clearly had the upper hand. The result caused a fracas among the crowd who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \"having the shirts torn off their backs; and it was said a law suit would commence about the play\". On Wednesday, 8 September, the \"Daily Post Boy\" reported that \"(on 6 September) 11 of Surrey beat the 11 who about a fortnight ago beat the Duke of Richmond's men\". This would suggest that the Duke of Richmond conceded his controversial game against Chambers' XI. Middlesex patron Thomas Chambers was a probable forebear of Lord Frederick Beauclerk.\nA dispute arose over scheduled finishing time in the London v Middlesex match at the Artillery Ground on 13 September 1732. London, batting last, needed seven more runs to win with six wickets standing when a Middlesex player tried to terminate the game as a draw by claiming time was up. According to the scorer's watch, there were still several minutes to go. The newspaper report said that the London players intended legal action as over £100 was at stake.\nThere were two controversies in 1734 around non-appearance by one of the teams. London and Sevenoaks were due to meet at Kennington Common on 8 July but Sevenoaks did not turn up and were obliged to forfeit their deposit. In September, London issued a challenge \"to play with any eleven men in England, with this exception only, that they will not admit of one from Croydon\". There was a dispute between the London and Croydon clubs after the latter failed to appear for an arranged match. It is not known if the challenge match was played.\nOther events.\n1726–1735.\nThere was an increasing use of county names in the 1720s. Teams called Kent and Surrey had been recorded as far back as 1709, though they were probably not representative of the whole counties. In August 1726, a combined London and Surrey team hosted Edwin Stead's Kent XI on Kennington Common. In 1728, a Middlesex team played London and then, in 1729, there was the first known use of Hampshire and Sussex in a team title, albeit not individually. In 1730, the first match took place between teams titled Surrey and Middlesex.\nIn June 1728, the Swiss traveller César-François de Saussure noted in his journal the frequency with which he saw cricket being played while he was making his journeys across southern England. He referred to county matches as \"a commonplace\" and wrote that \"everyone plays it, the common people and also men of rank\". If they were a commonplace, they were also keenly contested to the point where winning teams would proclaim their county's superiority. In August of the same year, a game at Penshurst Park (near Tonbridge) between Kent and Sussex was won by Kent. The teams were organised by Edwin Stead (Kent) and Sir William Gage (Sussex). Stead's team had earlier won two games against the 2nd Duke of Richmond's XI (also representing Sussex) and their victory over Gage's XI was reported as \"the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex\". In August 1729, there was a return match, again at Penshurst Park, between Stead's XI and Gage's XI – alternatively titled Kent (Stead's XI) v Sussex, Surrey &amp; Hampshire (Gage's XI). This was won by Gage's team, apparently by the earliest known innings victory. A match report singled out Thomas Waymark of Sussex for special praise, saying that he \"turned the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side\". Also in 1728, there was a match in Lewes (exact venue unknown) between the Duke of Richmond's XI and Sir William Gage's XI.\nRecords have been found of six eleven-a-side matches played in 1729 including the Stead v Gage return in August. London and Dartford played each other twice – Dartford won one but the result of the other is unknown. A Kent county team played in three matches: one against Sussex, one against Surrey and one against a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex team. The earliest reference to cricket at the University of Oxford is dated 1673, and the sport was being played there in the summer of 1729 on the testimony of Dr Samuel Johnson who was then a student. This was mentioned in James Boswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\".\nFifteen eleven-a-side matches were recorded in 1730 including ten which involved county teams. It is the first season from which details of more than a handful of matches have survived. The brief report of a match between Kent and London refers to the \"Kentish champions (losing) their honours\", but the context is unclear and there was no county championship until well over a century later.\nRecords of thirty eleven-a-side matches have been found for the 1731 season including one which ended in a riot (see Controversies section below). Twelve games were recorded in 1732, eleven involving London. A newspaper report in September stated that London played 13 matches in all and were unbeaten. This, however, is contradicted by a report in May stating that Croydon defeated London \"by great odds\". In 1733, ten matches involved London and/or a county team. Records have been found of seven matches in 1734, mostly involving London and Kent who played each other twice. Of nine matches recorded in 1735, London played in seven.\n1736–1740.\nIn 1736, a total of 18 eleven-a-side games are on record with two single wicket ones. The earliest known tied match result occurred in one of the single wicket games when the teams, three of London and three of Surrey, aggregated 23 runs each. The other single wicket game was two London players, named as Wakeland and George Oldner, against an unnamed pair from Richmond who were \"esteemed the best two in England\". One of the Richmond players suffered a serious facial injury when hit by the ball.\nSeven eleven-a-side games are known from 1737, all involving London. Some of the teams were sponsored by the Prince of Wales. There was crowd trouble at one match on Kennington Common between Kent and a combined London/Surrey team. Missiles were thrown and a man died a week later after being struck by a stone. The fixture was repeated twice in 1738 – Kent won one and the other is an unknown result. There are seven known matches in 1739 including the first to involve a team representing the Rest of England. It was billed as between \"eleven gentlemen (of Kent) and eleven gentlemen from any part of England, exclusive of Kent\". Kent won that game and a return match soon afterwards was drawn.\nGenerally agreed to be the \"first modern representation of cricket\", a series of engravings, \"The Game of Cricket\", was made by Hubert-François Gravelot in 1739. The six engravings show groups of children playing cricket, with a wicket of the \"low stool\" shape, probably wide by tall, with two stumps and a single bail. The engravings were used on porcelain. Gravelot helped to establish the French Rococo style in English publishing and was one of the most celebrated illustrators of the time.\nThe earliest known mention of Slindon Cricket Club is in a letter dated 30 July 1740 from the Duke of Richmond to Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, a future prime minister. Eight matches are on record in 1740, all involving London."

        "title": "English Premier Ice Hockey League",
        "text": "The English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL) was an ice hockey league of 10 teams, all of which were based in England. Headquartered in Blackpool, the EPIHL was one of two professional ice hockey leagues in the United Kingdom (the other being the Elite Ice Hockey League). A total of 27 teams played in the league at one time or another. Swindon Wildcats were the only team to have consistently featured in the EPIHL from its inaugural season in 1997-98. In 2017, the league was disbanded, with its teams either joining the top-tier Elite Ice Hockey League or the second-tier National Ice Hockey League.\nHistory.\nThe league was founded in 1997, under the banner of \"national division\", as part of the English National Ice Hockey League in order to serve former members of the British National League who couldn't afford to remain in the latter as a result of increased operating costs; but who were capable of a level of play above the import-free English leagues that made up the rest of the ENIHL. During the 1997-98 season the teams that constituted this division played dual schedules; a series of games solely amongst their own division, and another amongst all the teams that were playing under the ENIHL at that time.\nEach year, the league crowned a regular season champion, a post-season playoffs champion, and a knockout Cup champion. Solihull Blaze won the league and play-off trophies of both formats during this inaugural season. At the start of the 1998-99 season the divisions, whilst still both under the ENIHL umbrella, performed in their own separate competitions; and the national division adopted the name \"premier division\", and later on became known as the \"premier league\". By the end of the season the league had established itself outside of the ENIHL as the \"English Premier Ice Hockey League\". In 2005 the BNL disbanded; leaving the EPIHL to take its place as the second tier of the national game.\nIn 2017, the league was dissolved. The Milton Keynes Lightning and Guildford Flames joined the Elite League, Manchester Phoenix folded, and the remaining seven teams became part of the National Ice Hockey League.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe league was ruled and governed by the English Ice Hockey Association. The last chairman of the EPIHL was Ken Taggart."

        "title": "John McHale (baseball)",
        "text": "John Joseph McHale (September 21, 1921 – January 17, 2008) was an American professional baseball player and executive. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman for the Detroit Tigers during the 1940s, and later served as the general manager of the Tigers, Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves, and Montreal Expos. He was the first president and executive director of the Expos during their maiden years in the National League, and owned ten percent of the team. His son John McHale Jr. became an MLB executive vice president.\nDetroit Tigers' player and executive.\nMcHale was born in the city of Detroit, Michigan, and attended Detroit Catholic Central High School (Class of 1938) and the University of Notre Dame. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood tall, and his weight was . He signed with his hometown Tigers in 1941 and two years later made his first MLB appearance. In five seasons and 64 games with the Tigers (1943–45, 1947–48), McHale compiled a batting average of .193 with 22 hits. He was hitless in three at bats in the 1945 World Series, in which Detroit defeated the Chicago Cubs. Defensively, he recorded a .995 fielding percentage as a first baseman with only one error in 214 total chances.\nAfter the 1948 season, McHale, who had recently married a niece of team owner Walter Briggs Sr., retired from the field for a job in the Tiger front office as assistant farm system director. In 1953, he became director of minor league operations for the Tigers and was named general manager early in the season at the young age of 35. But after less than two full seasons, he was recruited by the defending NL champion Braves, where he succeeded John J. Quinn as general manager in January . Three years later, he added the title of club president.\nCareer in Milwaukee and Atlanta.\nAs it turned out, McHale presided over the slow decline of the Braves on the field. While superstar Hank Aaron was in the prime of his career, eventual Hall of Famers Warren Spahn and Eddie Mathews—along with Del Crandall, Lew Burdette, Joe Adcock and other stars of the Braves' 1957–58 NL championship clubs—aged and fell off in production. Meanwhile, the young players developed by the team's farm system could not pick up the slack. However, according to an April 8, 1963 article in Sports Illustrated, it was McHale himself who disposed of young talent and decimated the farm system: \"With General Manager John McHale trading away brilliant young pitchers (Joey Jay and Juan Pizarro) and solid everyday performers like Billy Bruton and Joe Adcock, and then unloading over half the once fertile farm clubs, Bragan will have to depend on old Braves who may prefer peace to war.\"\nAs the Braves slipped into the middle ranks of the National League, attendance at Milwaukee County Stadium declined precipitously. In , the club was sold to a group of Chicago-based investors. By , the Braves were rumored (correctly) to be moving to Atlanta. In , during their lame-duck season in Milwaukee, McHale was the figurehead for a supremely unpopular ownership.\nIn , the Atlanta Braves' first year, the club started slowly. McHale was replaced as general manager in mid-season by Paul Richards, a former Tiger teammate of McHale's and a legend in Georgia's capital since his days as playing manager of the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association from 1938 to 1942. After the season, McHale left the Braves to replace Lee MacPhail as the chief aide to Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.\nCandidacy for Baseball Commissioner.\nIn , the year before the National League expanded to 12 teams, McHale was named president of the newly born Montreal Expos by their owner, Seagrams heir Charles Bronfman. A few weeks after McHale's appointment, Eckert was fired as commissioner and McHale emerged as a leading contender to succeed his former boss, along with executives Michael Burke of the New York Yankees and Chub Feeney of the San Francisco Giants.\nHe had strong support in the American League, but NL owners—who wanted McHale's experienced hand turned toward the fledgling Expo franchise—intervened and McHale's candidacy was halted. The commissionership eventually went to National League attorney Bowie Kuhn.\nFounding president of the Montréal Expos.\nPutting the commissioner election behind him, McHale focused on building the first MLB franchise located in Canada. While McHale concentrated on upper management responsibilities during his first decade with the Expos, he eventually assumed their general manager portfolio as well, and it was during his watch (as GM from 1978 to 1984) that the Expos achieved their only playoff appearance, in . McHale resigned as general manager in favor of Murray Cook at the close of the season. He announced on September 5, 1986 becoming Expos deputy chairman upon his retirement as president and chief operating officer effective October 1. Claude Brochu succeeded him in both capacities. McHale remained as the team's chief executive officer until December 31, 1987.\nMcHale was also the last non-Hall of Fame member of the Hall's Veterans Committee, having been grandfathered in when the structure of the committee was updated in 2001. He died in Stuart, Florida, at age 86."

        "title": "John Quinn (baseball executive)",
        "text": "John Jacob Quinn (April 1, 1908 – September 20, 1976) was an American executive in Major League Baseball. His career spanned over 40 years and included almost 28 full seasons as a general manager in the National League for the Boston / Milwaukee Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. He produced three National League pennants and one World Series championship during his 1945–58 tenure with the Braves.\nQuinn was a member of one of the game's most prominent multi-generational families. During the era between the end of World War I and the end of World War II, his father, J. A. Robert Quinn, held various senior management and ownership positions in baseball: business manager of the St. Louis Browns, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and owner/general manager of both the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves. John J. Quinn's son, son-in-law and grandson have also been senior baseball executives.\nQuinn was born in Columbus, Ohio, during the period when his father was the president and business manager of the minor league Columbus Senators.\nGeneral manager of Braves and Phillies.\nBoston/Milwaukee Braves (1945–58).\nA graduate of Boston College, Quinn worked with his father in the Red Sox front office, then rejoined J. A. Robert Quinn with Boston's National League franchise from 1936 to 1945, serving as club treasurer and, later, farm system director. He succeeded his father as the Braves' general manager in 1945, working under the club's new ownership group headed by Lou Perini. He served in the GM post through the 1958 season, from the Braves' final seven years in Boston through their highly successful first six years as the Milwaukee Braves, winning the 1948 National League pennant in Boston, and the 1957 World Series and 1958 NL title in Milwaukee.\nQuinn's 1948 Boston team was anchored by starting pitchers Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn. Sain was acquired by the elder Quinn in a minor league transaction in 1942, and Spahn (a future Hall of Famer and baseball's winningest-all-time left-handed pitcher) came up through John Quinn's farm system. Tommy Holmes, the club's star right fielder, had been obtained from the New York Yankees in a December 1941 trade; he was the runner-up in 's National League Most Valuable Player balloting. However, the younger Quinn was instrumental in building the 1948 Braves. He added both young players such as shortstop Alvin Dark, signed in , first baseman Earl Torgeson and pitcher Vern Bickford, and veterans acquired in trades like second baseman Eddie Stanky, third baseman Bob Elliott and left fielder Jeff Heath. Quinn acquired so many supporting pieces from the perennially contending St. Louis Cardinals that his postwar Braves were often called the \"Cape Cod Cardinals\".\nQuinn also broke the baseball color line in Boston by purchasing the contract of fleet center fielder Sam Jethroe from the Dodgers; as a first-year player with the Braves, Jethroe was selected the National League's Rookie of the Year. Under Quinn, the Braves became the fifth of the then-16 Major League teams to integrate, and the third in the National League.\nHis Milwaukee champions of the 1950s relied heavily on the Braves' productive farm system, which developed Hall of Famers Eddie Mathews and Henry Aaron, All-Star catcher Del Crandall, shortstop Johnny Logan, starting pitcher Bob Buhl and starting outfielders Wes Covington and Bill Bruton, among many others. Quinn also acquired three key contributors via trades: Lew Burdette, the Braves' ace right-handed starting pitcher, who came from the Yankees as a rookie in a late-season transaction for Sain; slugging first baseman Joe Adcock, obtained from the Cincinnati Redlegs in a four-team trade just before spring training in 1953; and veteran second baseman Red Schoendienst, another future Hall of Famer, who was the centerpiece of a major midseason 1957 deal with the New York Giants. The Milwaukee Braves' home attendance shattered National League records during Quinn's tenure, never dipping below 1.749 million fans and exceeding the two-million mark for four straight years (1954–57).\nPhiladelphia Phillies (1959–1972).\nQuinn left the Braves, the defending National League champion, in January 1959 to take the reins of the cellar-dwelling Philadelphia Phillies as general manager. Within five years, Quinn rebuilt the Phillies into contenders. Quinn's reconstruction project produced three more last place finishes (1959–61) before the Phillies broke the .500 mark in and finished in the first division in .\nLed by players Quinn signed or acquired via trades—starting pitcher (and future Baseball Hall of Famer) Jim Bunning, relief ace Jack Baldschun, infielders Dick Allen, Cookie Rojas and Tony Taylor, outfielders Johnny Callison, Tony González and ex-Brave Covington, and catcher Clay Dalrymple, among others—his 1964 Phillies were on the verge of winning the club's third pennant in its long history. But they suffered a nightmarish ten-game losing streak in late September to fall out of the league lead and finish second. Quinn then was faced with a second rebuilding job during the late 1960s. In his final trade, he acquired another future Hall of Fame pitcher, Steve Carlton, from the Cardinals on February 25, 1972. However, the Phillies' continued struggles on the field during the season led to Quinn's replacement as GM by Paul Owens, the club's farm system and scouting director, on June 3.\nFamily.\nQuinn represented the second generation in his family's four-generation participation in baseball management. His son Bob was a longtime executive in the game who served as general manager of the Yankees, Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants; another son, Jack, was the owner and general manager of the Hawaii Islanders of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and also served as GM of the St. Louis Blues franchise in the National Hockey League. His daughter Margo married longtime baseball executive Roland Hemond. His granddaughter, Kay Quinn, is currently an anchor for KSDK in St. Louis. And a grandson, also named Bob, is the former executive vice president, finance and administration, of the Milwaukee Brewers.\nJohn J. Quinn briefly scouted for the Houston Astros after he left Philadelphia. He died at age 68 in Stanton, California, on September 20, 1976."

        "title": "1907 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1907 Tour de France was the fifth running of the annual Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488 km (2,788 mi) in fourteen stages around France. The winner, Lucien Petit-Breton, completed the race at an average speed of 28.47 km/h (17.69 mi/h). For the first time, climbs in the Western Alps were included in the Tour de France. The race was dominated at the start by Émile Georget, who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and Lucien Petit-Breton became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included. The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser Henri Desgrange, that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.\nParticipants.\nRené Pottier, the winner of the 1906 Tour de France, did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907. Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams. At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by Alcyon and the riders sponsored by Peugeot would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: Louis Trousselier, Marcel Cadolle and Léon Georget; Peugeot counted on Emile Georget.\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the \"coureurs de vitesse\" and the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\". Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the \"poinçonnée\" category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The \"coureurs de vitesse\" could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.\nRace overview.\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, François Faber and Emile Georget were the main contenders. Trousselier, winner of the 1905 Tour de France and eager to win again, won the first stage. In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city. At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to put both cyclists in first place, to keep both sponsors satisfied.\nIn the third stage, the Tour returned to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs officers and the delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted. During the stage in the Alps, Émile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, at that time in second place, fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.\nDuring the ninth stage, when Georget was leading the race, he broke the frame of his bicycle at a checkpoint. According to the rules, Georget should have fixed his bicycle alone; he knew this would take him more than five hours, so he switched bicycles with Pierre-Gonzague Privat. This was against the rules, so Georget was given a fine of 500 francs. After this stage, won by Petit-Breton, the general classification was as follows:\nUnsatisfied with the fine given to Georget, Trousselier and the other riders sponsored by Alcyon left the Tour in protest.\nAfter the tenth stage, the organisers gave Georget an additional penalty for the bicycle change in the ninth stage. They changed the classification of the ninth stage, moving Georget from 4th on the stage to last (48th place). This effectively cost him 44 points in the general classification and moved him from first to third place. The new classification, after the tenth stage, was\nLucien Petit-Breton became the new leader of the race. Although he had already finished in fifth place and fourth place in previous years, he was still relatively unknown, and had started in the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\" category. Petit-Breton finished in the top three in the next stages, so no other cyclist was able to challenge him for the overall victory. At the end of the race, he had increased his lead to a margin of 19 points ahead of Garrigou and 27 points ahead of Georget.\nResults.\nStage results.\nIn the first and final stages, the cyclists were allowed to have pacers.\nGeneral classification.\nAlthough 110 riders were on the starting list, 17 did not show up, so the race started with 93 cyclists. At the end of the Tour de France, 33 cyclists remained.\nThe cyclists officially were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together.\nThe total prize money was 25000 French francs, of which 4000 francs were given to Petit-Breton for winning the Tour. In total, he received more than 7000 francs.\nOther classifications.\nLucien Petit-Breton was also the winner of the \"machines poinçonnées\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Emile Georget the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the modern-day mountains classification.\nAftermath.\nPetit-Breton also started the 1908 Tour de France. He won five stages and the general classification, and became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France two times."

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo included show jumping, dressage and eventing. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The competitions were held from 16 to 24 October 1964. These events took place at Karuizawa, which would become the first city to host Summer and Winter Olympic event when it hosted the curling events for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.\nThis was the second time the Olympics were held in a city that required most of the horses to travel long distances (the first being the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles). Unlike the 1932 Games, however, there was a high participation rate due to the better economic conditions as well as the ability to fly the Olympic mounts to Japan. However, horses that could not be controlled had to be destroyed. This included the US eventer Markham, who panicked during departure from Newark, and an Argentinian horse had to be destroyed while flying home. Additionally, a Chilean horse died of a heart attack while flying to Tokyo. Overall there were 116 entries from 20 countries, including 13 women, with 4 nations fielding teams in all three disciplines: Japan, Germany, the USSR, and the USA. The youngest participant was Christilot Hanson-Boylen from Canada at 17 years old, while the oldest rider was the Irish Harry Freeman-Jackson at 53 years old.\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\nForty-six riders from seventeen nations contested the Shunzo Kido-designed course, which was 780 meters in length with 14 obstacles and 17 efforts. The hardest question was towards the end of the course. The penultimate obstacle was a 5 meter wide water, followed by a left turn to an impressively large oxer. Only 6 riders cleared the water in both rounds, and only 3 cleared the final oxer without faults both times. Adding to the difficulty was that the ground was very deep due to heavy rain leading up to the event. Pierre Jonquères d’Oriola became the first show jumper to win two individual gold medals (having won in 1952 with his mount Ali Baba).\nDressage.\nDressage reintroduced the team competition after removing it from the 1960 Games. 22 riders from 9 nations competed, and there were just enough teams (6 required by the IOC) to hold a team competition: Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, the USSR, and the USA. 3 judges were present, first judging a 12-minute 30 second Grand Prix test and announcing scores immediately after each ride. This was followed by the considerably shorter Grand Prix Special, at 6 minutes 30 seconds, which acted as a ride off. Each ride in the Special was filmed and examined by the judges, with a 2-hour delay before the final scores were announced publicly.\nEventing.\nHeld in Karuizawa, 150 km from Tokyo, the 31-obstacle cross-country course was criticized as being too straightforward for an Olympic Games. Phase A was 6 km at 240 m/min, followed by a 3.6 km steeplechase at 600 m/min, then 13.92 km Phase C at 240 m/min. The cross country was 7.2 km at a speed of 450 m/min, and was followed by Phase E, a 1980-meter gallop at 330 m/min. Italy gained the lead after the endurance day and held it to win the gold medal. Germany was in silver medal position but lost it on the final day to the United States.\nAmerican Lana du Pont became the first woman to ride in an Olympic eventing competition.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

Road bowling in Ireland is governed by the voluntary Irish Road Bowling Association ().\nA similar sport, Klootschieten, is played in eastern parts of the Netherlands and in northern Germany.\nRules and playing style.\nThe \"bullet\" or \"bowl\" () is a solid iron cannonball of c. circumference and weight. There are two or more players or teams in a match or \"score\". The one with the fewest shots to the finish line wins. If two players or teams approach the finish line with equal shots, the winner is decided by which throw goes farther past the finish line.\nA \"road shower\" advises the thrower about the throw (or shot) much like a golf caddy, while another helper stands ahead of the thrower, feet apart, to show the best line or path in the road.\nThe thrower runs to the throwing mark and, in the Northern or County Armagh style, extends the arm and bowl behind him as he runs. At the throwing mark the arm is snapped forward by arching the back and shoulders, releasing the bowl underhand before stepping over the mark.\nIn the Southern or County Cork style, as the thrower runs to the mark the arm and bowl are lifted up and back, then whirled downward into an underhand throw, releasing the bowl before stepping over the mark.\nWherever the bowl stops (not where it leaves the road surface), a chalk mark is made at the nearest point on the road and the next throw is taken from behind that mark. In Armagh, the mark is usually made by pulling a tuft of grass and dropping it on the road.\nOver tight curves, or corners where two roads meet, the bowl may be thrown through the air (lofted). The loft must strike the road or pass over it. If the loft fails to reach the road, it counts as one shot, and the next throw must be taken again from the same mark.\nSpectators sometimes bet on the outcome and proffer advice to their favoured competitor in the course of a match.\nHistory.\nFintan Lane, in his book \"Long Bullets: A History of Road Bowling in Ireland\", traces the sport to at least the 17th century and suggests that it was once far more widespread than it is today. While some sources state that it is an \"indigenous [Irish] sport\", other sources suggest that it may have been brought to Ireland by Dutch troops during the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–1691). Until the 19th century, the game was also played in Scotland, the north of England and in North America.\nIn the past, players were given twenty shots (a score) each, the winner determined by who went the greatest distance. Though the modern game is a fixed distance in fewest shots, the expression \"score\" for a match survives. Disputes between competitors or spectators sometimes created public disturbance and court cases resulted as recently as the 1950s.\nBól Chumann na hÉireann was formed in 1954 to replace the less organised All-Ireland Bowl Players Association. There were irregular contests between Cork and Armagh champions over the decades, but the first national championship between them was in 1963. The first World Championship was as part of Cork 800 in 1985.\nAs part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, Ból Chumann na hÉireann sanctioned a \"temporary ban on the sport\". The 2020 All-Ireland road bowling championships were rescheduled to late 2020.\nGeography.\nThe Irish form of road bowling is concentrated in counties Cork and Armagh (especially south Armagh). The 2015 All-Ireland Series took place in County Cork with the 2016 event planned for Madden, County Armagh.\nThe sport is also played in counties Mayo (Castlebar), Limerick, Waterford, Louth, Monaghan and later in Tyrone and Wexford and also in Dagenham, London, UK.\nThe Irish game also has players in Boston, Massachusetts; Cambridge, New York, and Bennington, Vermont, vicinity; Indian Lake, New York, Syracuse, New York; Traverse City, Michigan; Asheville, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Kansas City, Kansas. The sport is also growing in the fairs and festivals of the state of West Virginia. One of the world's largest Irish road bowling events is held annually in September in Wheeling, West Virginia, where it is hosted by a local division of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In Canada, a contest was held in Colborne, Canada during May 2007.\nKlootschieten is a similar game played in the Netherlands and northwest Germany, including in Friesland and Schleswig-Holstein, and international events have been staged between these regions and Ireland.\nTerminology.\nThe winners of the men's and women's All-Ireland competitions are referred to as the \"King of the Roads\" and \"Queen of the Roads\" respectively. Other game terminology, as used primarily in Ireland, includes: \nIn popular culture.\nThe song \"Out the Road\" by Gaelic Storm is about a road bowling score. Additionally, footage of a road bowling score is included in a YouTube video shot by band founders Pat Murphy and Steve Twigger about their trip to Murphy's native County Cork during the production of their album \"Chicken Boxer\" (which includes \"Out the Road\")."

        "title": "Canterbury Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Canterbury Rugby Football Union (also referred to as \"Canterbury\" or \"CRFU\") is the governing body for rugby union in a portion of the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Its colours are red and black in a hooped design. The CRFU govern the running of the Canterbury representative team which have won New Zealand's first-tier domestic competition National Provincial Championship (Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) 14 times including a \"six-peat\" from 2008 to 2013 – with five in the National Provincial Championship, two in the Air New Zealand Cup, five in the ITM Cup and one in the Mitre 10 Cup. Their most recent victory was the 2017 Mitre 10 Cup. Canterbury also acts as a primary feeder to the Crusaders, who play in the Super Rugby competition.\nThe union also administers all club rugby within the region, including senior club rugby and school rugby. Canterbury has a history of producing All Blacks, the most of any New Zealand region, with Scott Barrett becoming Canterbury's 200th All Black.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1879–1975).\nThe Canterbury Rugby Football Union (CRFU) was established in 1879 following a match between South Canterbury and North Canterbury in Timaru. It took place on 26 July 1879, where delegates representing Christchurch, Christ's College, Temuka, North Canterbury (Rangiora), Eastern (Christchurch), South Canterbury (Timaru), Ashburton, and Southbridge clubs decided to form the union. The impetus to form the CRFU was mainly provided by Montague Lewin, who had emigrated from England to Christchurch in 1873, and lobbied for local football clubs to adopt the rules of England's Rugby Football Union. He succeeded in getting Canterbury clubs to adopt the rugby rules in 1876, but a visit by an Australian Victorian Rules football team in 1879 prompted him to push for the formation of a union. It had been initially proposed that the new organisation be the New Zealand Rugby Union, but this was rejected and the Canterbury Rugby Football Union was formed. Canterbury was the first provincial union within New Zealand, with the Wellington Rugby Football Union was formed later that year. By 1890 fourteen provincial unions had been founded within New Zealand. As well as being the oldest union within New Zealand, the CRFU was actually founded before one of the Home Unions – the Welsh Rugby Union was founded in 1881.\nA Canterbury representative side had played prior to the formation of the CRFU, but the first provincial game in New Zealand played under the authority of provincial unions took place on 27 August 1881. Canterbury hosted an Otago side that triumphed by a try to nil. The first rugby match at Lancaster Park was played the following year – a ground that would be the home of Canterbury rugby until the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\nDespite being instrumental in forming the CRFU, in 1888 the South Canterbury clubs broke off to form the South Canterbury Rugby Union – this comprised Timaru, Fairlie Creek, Geraldine, Temuka, Waimate, Winchester, and Timaru Pirate clubs. The occurred only a few years prior to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (later shortened to New Zealand Rugby Union, or NZRU) in 1892. The CRFU had originally voted to join the NZRU in 1891, but when time came to ratify the agreement in 1892, they resisted following reluctance from their members. Along with the Otago and Southland provinces, the CRFU objected to the requirement that NZRU executive committee members reside in Wellington. South Canterbury had joined the NZRU, and the provinces representative sides did not meet in 1893. As well as this, players from Canterbury were not eligible for selection in the 1893 New Zealand team that toured Australia. The CRFU eventually relented, and in 1894 joined the NZRU; both Otago and Southland joined the following year. When New South Wales toured New Zealand in 1894, Canterbury players were now eligible for selection for New Zealand, and the CRFU hosted the only game between the sides which was played at Lancaster Park.\nIn 1904 a sub-union of the South Canterbury Rugby Union was formed around the Ashburton area – the Ashburton Country Rugby Union. In 1905 it came under the umbrella of the CRFU, but split away to become completely independent in 1927. It was renamed the Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union in 1952.\nNational provincial championship (1976–2005).\nThe National Provincial Championship was founded in 1976, becoming the premier national rugby competition. The NPC did not have playoffs, with the Championship awarded to the team with the best record. Canterbury had immediate success in the competition, going undefeated in 1977 to win the title. Canterbury had mixed results for the next five years, finishing between 2nd and 9th during this period. In 1983 Canterbury won their second title, once again going undefeated.\nCanterbury teams did not win the title again, until 1997. All Black laden Auckland teams constantly proved superior to Canterbury, claiming 10 titles from 1984 to 1996. The 1984 and 1989 Canterbury teams had a record of 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, and finished second to Auckland.\nIn 1992, the National Provincial Championship established playoffs, with the top four sides playing in a knockout format. In 1992 and 1993 Canterbury missed the playoffs. In 1994, Canterbury placed 3rd during the regular season. Canterbury travelled to North Harbour for the semi-final. Canterbury lost 27–59 to North Harbour. In 1995, Canterbury missed the playoffs again.

Canterbury achieved its first three-peat, only the second province (Auckland) to accomplish this.\nDue to the 2011 Rugby World Cup, there would be no semi-finals to allow more time for the world cup. As a result, only the top two sides would qualify for a final. Canterbury posted a record of 6 wins and 4 losses, allowing Canterbury to finish as the 2nd seed. Despite Taranaki having 7 wins and 3 losses, Canterbury qualified because it had more competition points, Taranaki (31), Canterbury (33).

The shield had been designed as a trophy for football (not rugby) and had to be modified to depict a rugby game. The Shield is based on a challenge system, rather than a league or knockout competition as with most football trophies. The holding union must defend the shield in challenge matches, and a successful challenger becomes the new holder of the Shield. It was first awarded to Auckland, which had the best results in the 1903 season. In the first challenge on 6 August 1904, Wellington defeated Auckland 6–3 to lift what has become known colloquially as the Log o' Wood.\nCanterbury has a proud history associated with the Ranfurly Shield. Canterbury has 15 Ranfurly Shield wins and 136 defences, second only to Auckland. Canterbury's first bid for the trophy in its second game in 1904, and challenged for the shield on 11 occasions before it was finally successful for a first time, when beating Manawhenua (an amalgamation of the modern day Manawatu and Horowhenua Kapiti provincial unions) 17–6 at Palmerston North. Canterbury's first shield tenure of any length began in 1931 and ended in 1934 after 15 successful defences. Between 1953 and 1956 the Cantabs held onto the shield in 23 challenges. In 1973 Marlborough pulled off one of the greatest Ranfurly Shield upsets of all time, by defeating Canterbury 13–6 to begin the region's only shield tenure. Canterbury's greatest shield defence occurred from 1982–1985, with 25 defences. Canterbury defeated Wellington on 18 September 1982 gaining the Ranfurly Shield for the first time in nine years. Canterbury would defend the shield for a then record number 25 times before Auckland would challenge on 14 September 1985. In front of 52,000 fans Auckland started strongly, jumping out to a 24–0 half-time lead. However, Alex Wyllie's Canterbury came back at the last minute when a Robbie Deans kick bounded over the dead ball line. Having held on to win 28–23, Auckland set about creating a new benchmark of 61 consecutive defences.\nCanterbury reclaimed the shield in 1994, defeating Waikato 29–26.

On 1 September, Canterbury defeated Waikato 33–20, winning back the shield. However, Canterbury had only one defence of the shield, losing to Auckland 15–26. Just under two years after losing the shield to Auckland, Canterbury regained it, beating Wellington 36–14. Canterbury again were host to a mighty upset as regained the Shield for the fifth time in their history after a 50-year hiatus stretching back to 1959, with Southland winning 3–9. Canterbury got revenge on Southland prevailing in a sold out game 26–15 in round 11 of the 2010 ITM Cup. received much praise for breathing life back into the shield, for their passionate ownership of the shield. Canterbury would only defend the shield twice before losing to Southland again, 19–22 returning the shield to the south.\nIn 2016, Canterbury would challenge Waikato for the shield in round 7. The two teams were locked up at 23–23 with only 10 minutes remaining. However, Jordie Barrett kicked two penalties to seal a Canterbury win 29–23, gaining the Ranfurly Shield in the process. Canterbury would defend the shield on 7 occasions before losing to Taranaki 43–55.\nStadium.\nCanterbury's main home ground was the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch, formally known as Lancaster Park. However, they stopped playing there after the 2010 season due to damage inflicted by the February Christchurch earthquake.\nWith AMI Stadium damaged, Canterbury adopted Rugby League Park (currently known as Orangetheory Stadium) in Addington as their home ground. The facility was upgraded bringing it to an 18,600 capacity and its facilities to the minimum standards required for the Mitre 10 competition.\nChristchurch is hopeful a new roofed multi-use arena will be constructed by 2022 with a capacity of 25,000, providing a world class venue for sports and entertainment events including Crusaders, All Blacks and Canterbury games. On 5 October 2020, NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that a funding agreement had been signed with the Christchurch City Council.\nHonours.\n1977, 1983, 1997, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017\n1927–28 (1), 1931–34 (15), 1935 (4), 1950 (0), 1953–56 (23), 1969–71 (9), 1972–73 (2), 1982–85 (25), 1994–95 (9), 2000–03 (23), 2004–06 (14), 2007 (1), 2009 (4), 2010–11 (2), 2016–17 (7).\nRivalries.\nAuckland\nCanterbury's greatest rivalry is with the 'old foe' Auckland, as both teams constantly battle for titles and have a long bitter history. Canterbury is the largest province in the South Island and Auckland is the largest province in the North Island. Games between the two have taken on the added intensity of North versus South and city versus country. Auckland dominated the New Zealand rugby landscape during the 1980s and 1990s, often at Canterbury's expense. However, in recent times Canterbury has turned the table, defeating Auckland in two finals in the past five years. Canterbury has even began to challenge Auckland's status as New Zealand's most successful province. Canterbury's 14 titles, 15 Ranfurly Shields wins with 139 defences, is closing on Auckland's 17 titles, 16 Ranfurly Shields wins with 148 defences.\nOther representative teams.\nIn addition to the Men's 1st XV, the CRFU has a number of other representative teams for both Men and Women. Their Women's team is part of the Women's Provincial Championship.\nClub rugby.\nThe Country Cup is the premier club competition over the Canterbury Country region. The region includes clubs from the Ellesmere and North Canterbury sub-unions and the Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union. Players who compete in this tournament are eligible for selection in the Canterbury Country representative team.\nIt is a 19 team competition with teams divided into two sections, ten teams in section 1 and nine teams in section 2. It is a round robin format, with every team playing each other once and a bonus points system being used to rank the teams. The top four sides from each section go one to the quarter-finals, and the winners from these go to the semi-finals – the two winners then compete for the Cup in the final.\nBascik transport Cup.\nThe \"Bascik transport Cup\" is the premier club competition of the Metropolitan sub-union. There are currently three divisions under the Bascik transport name, as well as a fourth division, a colts, and a classics grade. All formats are similar and the trophies include the Trophy, Plate and Bowl.\nDivision One has twelve teams competing in 2024 competition. Each team plays one another once in a round robin format that lasts eleven rounds. The top side at the end of the round robin receives the Bascik transport minor premiership Cup. Following the Cup competition, the teams are divided into three sections (1 VS 4 and 2 VS 3) (5 VS 8 and 6 VS 7) and (9 VS 12 and 10 VS 11), the winning teams from the top 2 matches get a week off, while the losing teams from those matches face the 2 winning teams from the 5th and 6th seed matches \nThe Second Division operates under a similar format to Division One, with a full round robin to determine the winner of the Cup, before splitting into two divisions that eventually compete for the Trophy, Plate, and Bowl. The Premier Colts operates under a double round robin format; the winner is awarded the Cup. The teams are split into three based on their rankings following the double round robin; the top four teams compete for the Trophy in a set of play-off matches. The teams ranked fifth to eighth compete for the Plate.\nClubs.\nThe Canterbury Union consists of 48 clubs, the most of any other New Zealand Union, split into three sub-unions, Ellesmere, North Canterbury and Metropolitan.\nEllesmere:&lt;br&gt;\nThere are 16 clubs in the Ellesmere Sub-Union.\nNorth Canterbury:&lt;br&gt;\nThere are 14 clubs in the North Canterbury Sub-Union.\nMetropolitan:&lt;br&gt;\nThere are 18 clubs in the Metropolitan Sub-Union.\nAll Blacks.\nThis is a list of players who have represented New Zealand from the Canterbury representative rugby union team. Players are listed by the decade they were first selected in and players in bold are current All Blacks. This list is taken from allblacks.com Stats"

        "text": "The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) was founded in England in 1973 for the purpose of researching and collating information about the history and statistics of cricket. Originally called the Association of Cricket Statisticians, the words \"and Historians\" were added in 1992 but it has continued to use the initialism ACS.\nThe ACS headquarters were formerly in Nottingham, opposite Trent Bridge Cricket Ground, but relocated to Cardiff in 2006.\nAlthough constituted in England, the ACS has a worldwide membership and is open to anyone with a relevant interest.\nOrigin.\nFollowing the formal definition of first-class cricket by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, and particularly given ICC's statement that \"the definition does not have retrospective effect\", a number of cricket statisticians became interested in developing an agreed list of matches played before 1947 from which to compile accurate first-class records.\nRoy Webber published his \"Playfair Book of Cricket Records\" in 1951 and stated his view that first-class cricket records (i.e., for statistical purposes) should not include matches played before 1864. In this first edition, Webber accepted the records used by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", including those that summarised the career of W G Grace. In his second edition (1961), Webber challenged many existing views about match status and produced, \"inter alia\", an alternative career record for Grace that did not include some of the matches \"Wisden\" recognised as first-class.\nThere was some support among cricket statisticians, including Bill Frindall, for Webber's basic arguments but there were (and remain) differences of opinion about his commencement date and about the details of his recommended matchlist. The controversial cricket historian Rowland Bowen wrote a lengthy critique of Webber's sources in 1961. Bowen then started \"Cricket Quarterly\" (1963–70), devoted to cricket statistics, which included among its contributors some of the original ACS members.\nThe ACS itself was founded by Robert Brooke and Dennis Lambert, two of Bowen's contributors, by means of advertisements in the October 1972 issues of \"The Cricketer\" and \"Playfair Cricket Monthly\". These attracted a nucleus of some 50 members who formed the association in 1973.\nScope of activities.\nThe ACS has sought to compile details of all known historically significant matches, and has widened its scope to include details of other competitions such as the Minor Counties Cricket Championship and the Second XI Championship in England. The bulk of its research concerns those matches that are officially or unofficially recognised as first-class or List A limited overs cricket. The findings have been published in-house in various guides (see list below) and in the Association's quarterly journal \"The Cricket Statistician\". \"The Who's Who of first-class Cricketers\" is one of the few commercially published works.\nLike Webber and Frindall, the ACS has no official position in terms of deciding the status of cricket matches. Any classification it publishes is merely its own opinion, as is the case with all other cricket writers. However, in 2006, the ICC asked the ACS to provide a comprehensive List A limited overs matchlist since the commencement of List A matches in 1963, and this has since been used as a basis for all official records.\nACS publications.\nThe ACS publishes its findings in-house, typically in the form of paperback books. Many books are issued in series format. The publications include the following: "

        "title": "Calcutta Cricket and Football Club",
        "text": "Calcutta Cricket and Football Club (popularly known by its abbreviation CC&amp;FC, or CCFC) is an Indian professional multi-sports club based in Kolkata, West Bengal. Founded in 1792 as a cricket institution, the football and rugby sections were added when it merged with Calcutta Football Club (oldest football club in Asia, founded in 1872) in 1965.\nRugby section of the club made CC&amp;FC the oldest rugby institution founded outside the United Kingdom and Ireland. Club's football section competes in the premier division of Calcutta Football League, fifth tier of the Indian football league system.\nHistory and overview.\nEarly years (1792–1960s).\nCalcutta Cricket Club.\nThe history of CC&amp;FC dates back to 1792, when the club was established by the name of \"Calcutta Cricket Club Clippers\". It was primarily a cricket institution in the East India Company rule in India. The club was also founded as one of the earliest known gentlemen's clubs (for Europeans only) in Calcutta, then capital of British India. Recent evidence in the form of an article published in the \"Hicky's Bengal Gazette\", suggests the club (described as \"Gentlemen of Calcutta Cricket Club\") existed in 1780 – that would make it the oldest cricket club in the world. In 1792 during their tour in India, Eton cricket team (Old Etonians) appeared in an exhibition match against Calcutta Cricket Club. By 1825, CC&amp;FC established themselves as one of the formidable sides in Bengal Presidency, alongside British Army-operated cricket teams in the country.\nCalcutta Football Club.\nIncorporated in 1872, Calcutta Football Club predominately introduced rugby in the country. As per the \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\", club's membership was restricted to people belonging to the upper strata of British middle class. They later contributed in introducing and developing association football; Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari (founding father of football in India) taught the game to his classmates of prestigious Hare School compound in 1877, after observing British soldiers playing the game in Calcutta FC ground. CC&amp;FC soon emerged as one of the prestigious private members' clubs in Asia; By January 1873, nearly 137 members had enrolled, while European women were granted membership in the first half of the 19th century. The club became one of the founding members of the Indian Football Association (IFA) in 1893, then headed by British administrators. The primary sport Rugby, later suffered because of the departure of British regiments. Bicycle Polo division (now known as Cycle Polo) was formed in 1901–02, and being played since then in CC&amp;FC.\nMerger and later years (1960s–present).\nAfter acquiring both \"Ballygunge Cricket Club\" (1864–1950) and \"Calcutta Football Club\" (1872–77; 1884–1965) in 1965, the institution completed all the absorptions to introduce themselves under the name of \"Calcutta Cricket and Football Club\" (CC&amp;FC). Sports still being practised at the club include: cricket, football, field hockey, rugby, cycle polo, swimming, tennis, and bridge. The football team competed in both the Premier Division A and B of Calcutta Football League. The club's cricket and football teams usually participated in their respective divisions as \"Calcutta Cricket Club\" for cricket and \"Calcutta Football Club\" for football. Their hockey and rugby teams participate under the combined name of \"Calcutta Cricket and Football Club\".\nCC&amp;FC has been hosting various tournaments, including Merchants' Cup (a corporate open tournament) since 1970s for both football and cricket. Merchants' Cup in hockey hosted by the club until its discontinuation in 2005, while cricket tournaments at the club are being sponsored by Kolkata Knight Riders. Other tournaments such as J. Thomas Cup in rugby, and Georgiadi 7s tournament are also hosted at the club ground. In November 2017, the club organized their 225th anniversary celebration, marking the 225 years of cricket in India, with presence of noted international cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar, Saurav Ganguly, MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, VVS Laxman, and Virat Kohli. In June 2023, Indian Football Association made an official announcement of merger of the both Premier Division A and B of Calcutta Football League (CFL), ahead of 125th edition, and allowed CC&amp;FC to compete in Group I.\nDepartments.\nCricket.\nCC&amp;FC's oldest sporting department is cricket, which was incepted as the \"Calcutta Cricket Club Clippers\" by British expatriates who had come over with the British East India Company. Have been in existence since 1792, it is the second oldest cricket club in the world after Marylebone Cricket Club. On 23 February 1792, \"Madras Courier\" reported the schedule of a match between Calcutta Cricket Club and a team from Barrackpore, and the news was later highlighted by Irwin Rosenwater on \"The London Times\". The club later played in annual fixtures against numerous British regimental teams stationed in both Fort William and Barrackpur Cantonment. According to \"The Bengal Hurkaru and Chronicle\", they also played against other visiting teams, consisting Old Etonians, Old Harrovians and alumni of both the Oxford and Cambridge University.\nDuring its earliest years of existence, the Calcutta Cricket Club played its home games near river Hooghly but it was not until 1841, when the institution got land to establish its home match venue. On 19 April 1864, CC&amp;FC was granted permission to build a pavilion at eastern end of the Eden Gardens. There, a large pavilion of 125 feet by 25 feet was built out of Burma teak, modelled after pavilions of the Lord's Cricket Ground. In 1889–90, the club came into limelight when Marylebone Cricket Club came to play in Calcutta by responding to the club's invitation, which was the first visit of a foreign team to play cricket in India. In 1889–90 cricket season, another English team named \"G. F. Vernon's XI\", managed by George Vernon and captained by Martin Hawke, toured to Ceylon and India; played against Calcutta Cricket Club at the Eden Gardens on 23 December, under the \"Laws of Cricket\" (prevailed in England at the time, including the compulsory follow-on and the recently introduced 5-ball over). In 1892–93 cricket season, an English team led by Martin Hawke, came to India and played against Calcutta Cricket Club.\nIn 1926–27 season during winter, CC&amp;FC played the key role in bringing Marylebone Cricket Club, which was their second tour to India, and MCC was then led by former England captain Arthur Edward Gilligan. On 15 August 1950, then club president T. C. Longfield handed over the ownership of Eden Gardens to then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Roy. In December 1962, the club made history, when its members announced and conducted a 5-match series between Calcutta Cricket Club and Merchants' XI, introducing \"limited over cricket format\" (all were 20 overs). It was later merged with the Calcutta Football Club (incorporated in 1872, where both footballs — rugby and association were practised) and the Ballygunge Cricket Club over the years to become the \"Calcutta Cricket and Football Club\" in 1965. CC&amp;FC is currently under the jurisdiction of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), and competes in the CAB First Division League, J.C. Mukherjee T-20 Trophy, N.C. Chatterjee T-20 Trophy, and other regional tournaments. Later in the 1970s, wooden pavilion of Calcutta was demolished, while the construction of the new club house (current headquarters of the CAB) began, which was named after Bidhan Chandra Roy. Club's cricket section is currently headquartered in 19/1, Garcha 1st Lane, Ballygunge, Kolkata.\nRugby union.\nIn the British Raj, Rugby union was introduced and emerged as second most popular winter sport after association football. For the first time in the country, a scratch match or two played in Calcutta and Madras during the visit of MS Galatea in 1871. At the ground of CC&amp;FC, first recorded match was played, on Christmas Day. The incident paved the way for growth of the British sport in India, and foundation of \"Calcutta Rugby Football Club\" in January the following year by expats, former students of Rugby School and soldiers of the Royal East Kent Regiment – which was stationed in the 1870s. In 1874, Calcutta Football Club joined the Rugby Football Union (RFU). After departure of British troops, and recreational facilities became disbanded, club's rugby section was discontinued in 1878. Members decided to keep the memory of the club alive by having the remaining 270 silver rupee coins in their bank vault melted down to be made into a trophy (the Calcutta Cup), which was then presented to the Rugby Football Union (described as \"the best means of doing some lasting good for the cause of Rugby Football\"). The sport came back at the CC&amp;FC in 1884. In 1890, an inter-club tournament was incepted by the CC&amp;FC, named \"Calcutta Rugby Union Challenge Cup\" (known simply as Calcutta Cup), and its second division trophy was clinched by the club. Later in 2007, they emerged as runners-up in that tournament.\nThe club is also a regular participant of prestigious All India &amp; South Asia Rugby Tournament, and hosted the championship on various occasions. Women's rugby team of CC&amp;FC also participate in that tournament. The club also hosts Georgiadi Club Rugby Sevens tournament, in which CC&amp;FC's men's and women's teams (known officially as CCFC Reds) compete. In June 2013, CC&amp;FC's affiliate club Hong Kong FC's rugby team \"HKFC Vandals\" toured to Kolkata and played against CCFC Reds. At the 87th edition of All India &amp; South Asia Rugby Championship in Mumbai, CC&amp;FC won the plate final, defeating Magicians Foundation 28–5. The club also hosted 'Asia Rugby Division 3 – South Region Championship', with backing from Bengal Olympic Association.\nAssociation football.\nRun by the British officials since its inception in 1872, \"Calcutta Football Club\" became the first of the three European football clubs, others being Calcutta Rangers and Dalhousie AC. They soon emerged as one of the leading football teams in the Bengal Presidency. It was then consisting of European players, and enjoyed fierce rivalry predominantly with indigenous outfit Mohun Bagan. Calcutta Football Club stayed away from Trades Cup, the country's first open football tournament because members felt that their \"enjoyment of the sport would be impaired if they join the competitive fray\", it was instrumental in instituting the Indian Football Association (IFA) in Calcutta very much on London lines. The team for the first time was defeated by Mohun Bagan in 1923 in the return leg of CFL, but managed to clinch both the league and IFA Shield titles in that season.\nCalcutta FC was the most successful team in prestigious Calcutta Football League in pre-independence era, oldest league in Asia, in pre-independence era (in which, native teams were barred from participating for the first fifteen seasons), clinching eight titles. The team is also nine-time winners of IFA Shield. The 1936 edition of IFA Shield was club's last notable campaign in which they reached final, failed to win title as Mohammedan Sporting became the first all-Indian team since 1911 to clinch title, beat CC&amp;FC 2–1. In 2004, the club emerged victorious in historic Trades Cup, defeating Eastern Railway 2–1 in final. In 2022, they roped in noted Indian-Iranian footballer Jamshid Nassiri as head coach.\nField hockey.\nClub's field hockey team is known as \"CCFC Gremlins\", and is affiliated with the Bengal Hockey Association (often shortened to 'Hockey Bengal'). The team was once primarily consisting of European and Anglo-Indian players. CC&amp;FC is regular participant of both the Calcutta Hockey League, and Beighton Cup (one of world's oldest hockey tournaments). They won 1924 edition of Beighton Cup, with a runner-up finish in 1919. In 2022–23, CC&amp;FC hosted inaugural edition of CCFC Hockey Premier League.\nTennis.\nTennis as a racket sport in India, introduced by the Britishers and is an important sport, still being practiced within CCFC since 1920s. The club is an affiliated member of the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA). One of the earliest tennis grass courts were installed within club grounds in Ballygunge under the supervision of R. W. Plummer. The club clinched Ballygunge Cricket Club Open Lawn Tennis Championship title in 1929. Editions of prestigious Bengal Lawn Tennis Championships (incorporated in 1887), alongside Indian Satellite Tennis Championships and Hometrust Senior Nationals, were organized by the CC&amp;FC. In 2022–23 season, inaugural edition of Calcutta Tennis Premier League (CTPL) was hosted in the club.\nCycle polo.\nCycle polo, a specific version of polo being played using bicycles, has been one of the major sports being practiced at the CC&amp;FC for decades. The club is also affiliated with both Cycle Polo Federation of India (CPFI) and Cycle Polo Association of Bengal, the national and regional governing bodies. The first Merchant's Cup tournament for cycle polo was organized and hosted by the club in 1973. They also hosted multiple cycle polo tournaments, including — Legend's Tournament, Marsh Mug, Swaroop Bhanjdeo Memorial Tournament, Apji Vaiji Singh Memorial Trophy, and CC&amp;FC Cup. The club is also a regular participant in editions of Laxmibilas Cup in Kolkata.\nOther sports.\nOther individual and team sports being played at the CC&amp;FC are: golf, bridge, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, badminton, squash, and darts. Their volleyball team takes part in Elliot Shield State Volleyball Championship. The club also won 4th edition of Monsoon League Bridge Tournament hosted by Tollygunge Club. CC&amp;FC also hosts Inter-club Darts Championship.\nCrest, colours and rivalries.\nThe crest of CC&amp;FC has numerous versions, while the present version is containing a shield, with having four stripes, in club colours black, red, and white, with initials of \"CCFC\" and foundation year 1792.\nWhen tournaments began and organized by the Indian Football Association in the late 19th century, CC&amp;FC shared rivalries with two all-European teams Dalhousie AC and Calcutta Rangers, along with fully indigenous side Mohun Bagan AC. In later years, other rivals of the club were Mohammedan Sporting, Aryans, and British regimental outfits. From 1870s and 80s onwards, club's rugby team predominantly competed against two contemporary sides Bombay Gymkhana and Madras Cricket Club, while currently sharing rivalries with Jungle Crows and Army Red.\nHome ground.\nDue to the absence of permanent venue in earlier days, the club used grounds in Esplanade, parallel with grounds on the bank of river Hooghly, between Fort William and Government House. In 1825, 'Sketch of the Maidan' was done by the club, and in 1841, they were allowed to enclose the ground. The club used eastern end of the Eden Gardens (then known as 'Auckland Circus Gardens') from 1860s until shifting their base to Ballygunge in 1950s. CC&amp;FC later established its earlier known headquarter at the Eden Gardens, and built a pavilion there in 1871.\nClub's football section uses Calcutta FC Ground (commonly known as Mohun Bagan Ground) in Kolkata Maidan. It was also used as venue of the 1954 edition of Quadrangular Series. The ground hosted exhibition matches of India and numerous visiting European teams, including a match between India and Allsvenskan club AIK in December 1954. The present CC&amp;FC ground for cricket is situated in Ballygunge, which serves as one of the venues for prestigious Ranji Trophy matches.\nNotable players and members.\nNoted players.\nRugby\nCricket\nFootball\nDarts\nNoted members.\nA large number of notable athletes are associated with the club, including:\nRecords and statistics.\nTennis captains of CC&amp;FC.\nSource:\nAffiliations and services.\nCC&amp;FC has reciprocal arrangements with over 25 private members clubs around the world, enabling members to use facilities, including notable clubs such as Kowloon Cricket Club and Hong Kong FC of Hong Kong, Penang Sports Club of Malaysia, Royal Bangkok Sports Club of Thailand, Singapore Cricket Club of Singapore, Wanderers Club of South Africa, St James's Club of England, Singhalese Sports Club of Sri Lanka, and Dhaka Club of Bangladesh.

        "title": "Equestrian events at the 1972 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich included show jumping, dressage and eventing. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The equestrian competitions were held at 3 sites: an existing equestrian facility at Riem for the individual show jumping and eventing competitions, the Olympic Stadium in Munich for the Nations Cup, and Nymphenburg, a Baroque palace garden, for the sold-out dressage. 179 entries, including 31 women, competed from 27 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, German Democratic Republic (GDR), France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. The youngest participant was Kurt Maeder from Switzerland at 19 years old, while the oldest rider was Lorna Johnstone from Great Britain at 70 years old.\nAn outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis broke out in Mexico before the Games, so the Mexican horses were not permitted into the host country. The IOC and FEI agreed to allow the Mexicans to lease horses in Germany for the show jumping and eventing competitions so that they may still compete. While this allowed the riders to attend the Olympics, the Mexicans had dismal results, including all four of the eventers being eliminated on cross-country.\nThe disciplines.\nShow jumping.\n74 riders from a total of 21 countries contested Hans-Heinrish Brinckmann's Olympic courses. The individual competition was held over two rounds. The course of the first round consisted of 14 obstacles and 17 jumping efforts over a 760-meter track, with several difficult individual fences. This included a 5-meter water, which produced 33 faults in the first round, and several massive oxers (four at 2 meters wide and a fifth at 2.10 meters) which all combined produced another 20 faults. Only 3 riders were able to produce a clear round, and 8 finished with only a knockdown. The second round was a 660-meter track with 10 obstacles and 13 jumping efforts. One rider who went clear in the first round was not in contention after the second. The two other clear rounds from the first course—Graziano Mancinelli and Ann Moore—had 2 rails apiece in the second for 8 faults. Neal Shapiro, one of the eight 4-faulters in round 1, finished the second round with only one rail so also finished both rounds with 8 faults. Therefore, a jump-off between the 3 riders decided who was to take home gold, silver, and bronze. Mancinelli managed a clear for the gold, followed by Moore who had three faults for silver, and then Shapiro who had two knock downs.\nThe Nations Cup was held in the Olympic Stadium, so horses were shipped out of Riem at 3:15 am to tent stabling nearby. Unlike the gold and silver medal winners, Shapiro managed another great performance for his team, finishing with 8.25 faults in round 1 and no faults in the second round, helping the USA finish with team silver.\nDressage.\nThe 1972 Olympics saw great changes for dressage. First, the individual medals were only awarded based on the results of the ride-off, with the Grand Prix serving as a qualifying round for the ride-off, whereas before the scores from the Grand Prix and ride-off were added together to determine the winner. The judging also changed drastically. 5 judges, instead of three, were on the panel, and two of the five were (for the first time) placed on the long side rather than having the entire panel sitting on the short side at C. Unlike recent decades where, due to accusations of unfair judging, judges were to be from non-competing countries, the 1972 Games allowed judges to be selected from countries competing in the Games and therefore to judge their own countrymen. The scores of all five judges were to count into the final score, rather than dropping the highest and lowest produced by the panel. Unfortunately this change in judging did not eliminate all problems. When the horse of French rider Patrick Le Rolland was lame during his test, Gustaf Nyblæus (the judge at C) did not ring him out. Additionally, while four of the judges deducted points for the lameness to put him somewhere between 20th to 29th place, the inexperienced Mexican judge had him finishing in 7th place.\nMore than 30 riders from 13 countries, who made up 10 full teams and a few individuals, competed at the Nymphenburg site. Despite this being the first time it was used for a competition, the palace garden proved to be a great success. However, there was a good deal of work performed to prepare it, including adding additional footing (80 cm of gravel, followed by 4 cm of cinder and clay, then 6 cm of a sand/wood shaving mix) to the already existing gravel of the park. Liselotte Linsenhoff won gold on Piaffe, making her the first woman to win individual gold in the equestrian events.\nDressage again showed the great age range possible in Olympic mounts, with 3 horses (Sod, Casanova, and San Fernando) at 17 years of age, and 1 horse (Granat) competing at age 7—who would return at the following Olympics at age 11 and win gold. 12 of the 33 mounts competing were 14 or older.\nEventing.\nA crowd of 60,000 spectators watched 73 riders from 19 nations competing on endurance day. The Roads and Tracks phases (Phase A and C) were held on flat ground. The cross-country test, designed by Ottokar Pohlmann, saw quite a few problems. Four fences in particular proved the most troublesome—producing a total of 38 refusals, 18 falls, and 7 eliminations—included a fence into the water (obstacle 12), a drop fence in a combination (obstacle 17a), a palisade up a hill (obstacle 18), and a ditch (obstacle 23).\nThe German team, despite the elimination of one of their top rider, Horst Karsten and Sioux, still managed to finish with a bronze medal, behind Great Britain (gold) and the USA (silver). The gold-winning British team included 2 women, with a third woman competing on the Canadian team. 48 of the 73 horses completed the competition, including a 5-year-old on the Argentinean team who finished next to last. 29 of the finishing horses were 8 years old or younger.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

World War II resulted in a greatly reduced number of competitors, including the absence of Germany, although Brazil made its first appearance in the equestrian events. 103 entries from 17 nations (Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States) competed. The youngest participant was Aëcio Coelho from Brazil at 23 years old, while the oldest rider was the Italian Alessandro, Count Bettoni Cazzago, at 55 years old.\nDisciplines.\nJumping.\n44 riders from 15 nations contested the 16-obstacle/19-jumping effort course. The 870 meter course had fences up to 1.60 meters in height, and was very slippery due to heavy rains during the week. One round of jumping was used for both team and individual competition.\nDressage.\nThe dressage event had 19 riders from 9 nations. Since World War II had made training dressage horses hard, the difficulty of the test was reduced and only asked for 13 minutes of work with neither piaffe nor passage included. Only 3 judges were used rather than the traditional 5. Horses were also required to be ridden in an English saddle with a double bridle. They were not allowed to use martingales, bearing reins, bandages, gaiters or blinkers.\nEventing.\n45 riders for 16 countries rode in the eventing competition. Like the dressage competition, the requirements of the eventing were reduced. This included a shortened (3500 meter) steeplechase, lowering the speed of the roads and tracks phases from 240 to 220 meters/minute, and a shortened cross-country course at 33.5 km (compared to Berlin's 36 km course in 1936). The maximum height of both the cross-country and jumping were raised from 1.15 to 1.20 meters. The ground and terrain of the course were also challenging, taking place over difficult footing on a hilly course.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics included dressage, eventing, and show jumping. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions and were held from 28 July to 3 August 1952.\nOne of the biggest changes at the 1952 Olympics was the demographics of competitors. Before this, most of the riders were officers (41 of 44 starters at the 1948 Olympics were riding in uniform), whereas the Helsinki Games saw over 50% of competitors from the civilian ranks. Additionally, women were now allowed to compete for the first time in equestrian events. At the 1952 Games, they were permitted in the dressage competition, although prohibited from the jumping (per a ruling in 1951) and most definitely not in eventing which was considered too dangerous. A total of 4 women competed out of 134 riders.\n25 nations competed: Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. This was the first appearance for Canada, Egypt, and Korea. The Soviet Union appeared for the first time since 1912; Russia had sent riders to the 1912 Games, but had not competed since. The youngest participant was Walter Staley (19) from the United States, while the oldest rider was the Danish Kristian Jensen (63).\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\n52 riders from 20 nations competed at the 1952 Games. For the first time, individual and team medals were awarded based on a two-round Prix des Nations (Nations Cup). 16 teams rode around Björn Strandell's 786 meter course with a 1 min 57.2 second time allowed and fences up to 1.60 meters in height and a 5-meter water jump. The individual gold was won by the French rider Pierre d'Oriola, aboard the gelding, \"Ali Baba\". D'Oriola would repeat the feat in 1964 and remains the only rider to win two gold medals in this discipline. The team event was won by Great Britain, anchored by a clear round for Harry Llewellyn and \"Foxhunter\". This gold medal, attained on the last day of competition, was Great Britain's only gold of the 1952 Games. They remain the only nation to have won gold medals in every Summer Olympics since 1896.\nDressage.\n27 riders, including for the first time 4 women, from 10 nations rode in the dressage competition. One of these women was Denmark's Lis Hartel, who in 1944, at age 23, had been paralyzed by polio. She gradually regained muscle function but remained paralyzed below the knee. Amazingly, despite not being able to mount or dismount unassisted, she won individual silver.\n5 judges were present at the test, with the lowest and highest scores of the panel being dropped (the only time in Olympic dressage history this method was used). The test reintroduction of the piaffe and passage, and was 15 minutes in length.\nEventing.\nThe eventing competition was slightly harder in 1952 than in 1948. Phase A was 7 km at 240m/min, Phase B (steeplechase) was 4 km at 600m/min, Phase C 15 km at 240 m/min, Phase D (cross-country) was 9 km at 450 m/min with jumping efforts up to 1.20 meters, followed by the final phase which was a 2 km \"gallop\" at 333m/min. The final stadium jumping round also had fences up to 1.20 meters.\n59 riders from 21 countries competed, forming 19 teams. 13 of those teams were strictly officers, while 2 were a mix of officers and civilians (Great Britain and Ireland) and four had civilian-only teams (Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and the USA). Of the 12 medals awarded between the individual and team competitions, 7 went to civilians.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1956 Summer Olympics were held in Stockholm due to the Australian quarantine regulations and included dressage, eventing, and show jumping. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The competitions were held from 11 to 17 June 1956 at Stockholm Olympic Stadium. There were 158 entries from 29 National Olympic Committees: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, USA and Venezuela. This would be the first appearance for Australia, Cambodia and Venezuela in equestrian events.\nAlthough Melbourne was awarded the 1956 Olympic Games, Australia had a strict six-month pre-shipment quarantine on horses. A meeting in 1953 by Australian federal authorities ruled that they would not change the quarantine laws for the Olympic horses. Therefore, the equestrian competition would not be able to be held in Australia. In 1954, the IOC selected Stockholm, Sweden as the alternate venue for the equestrian events. Therefore, the equestrian events were not only separated by city or country, but also continent, with the equestrian event being held in June (summer in the Northern Hemisphere) and the other sports held in November (late spring in the Southern Hemisphere).\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\nA total of 66 riders from 24 countries contested the difficult Greger Lewnhaupt-designed course, which no one was able to ride clear in the first round. Considered the first modern course in Olympic history, it was 775 meters in length, to be ridden at 400m/min, with 14 obstacles and 17 jumping efforts. The gold medal was awarded to Hans Günter Winkler of the Federal Republic of Germany, on his great mare Halla. He finished the first round with 4 faults, after landing heavily after an early takeoff by his mount, resulting in a pulled groin muscle. Knowing that withdrawal from the final round would result in his country's elimination, Winkler rode in the second round, and managed to complete it faultlessly. Winkler would go on to be one of the most medal-winning riders in Olympic history, with 7 medals to his name.\nDressage.\n36 riders, 11 of which were women, from 17 nations competed in dressage. Of those 11 women, 2 won an individual medal (including previous silver medalist Lis Hartel) and another placed in the top 10. There was controversy in the judging, since judges tended to have their own opinions of what was considered correct training and riding, and at the time there was no common ideal for dressage. The German and Swedish judges favored their own countrymen, and ended up being suspended by the FEI. Following this controversy, the IOC threatened to remove dressage from the Olympics. The FEI and IOC came to a compromise, resulting in only individual competitors being allowed at the 1960 Games, with up to 2 riders per country.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 29 nations competed in Stockholm. \nFive nations competed in the equestrian events in Stockholm, but did not attend the Games in Melbourne:\nEgypt and Cambodia did not compete in Melbourne due to the Suez Crisis, whilst Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland all boycotted the Australian event in protest at the Soviet invasion of Hungary.\nMedal table.\n Host nation (Sweden)\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

Team scores were also gathered and medals awarded for teams in the eventing and jumping competitions. Equestrian had been absent from the Olympic program since the 1900 Summer Olympics, making the 1912 Games the second time the sport was featured. Ten nations competed: Belgium, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA. Only Sweden and Germany were able to supply a full team for all three disciplines, with several countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Norway and the USA) having several riders and horses used in two or even all three disciplines. A total of 88 entries ran in the three events, with 62 riders and 70 horses.\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\nA total of 40 riders from 8 nations contested the jumping event, which consisted of a 15-obstacle, 29-effort course. It had a maximum height of 1.40 meters and width of 4.00 meters, and had to be completes a speed of 400 m/min. Individual and team competitions ran over the same course but were held separately. A maximum of 6 riders per country was allowed in the individual jumping event.\nDressage.\nThe dressage competition had 21 riders from 8 countries. It differed from the current format in that it did not include movements such as piaffe and passage but required five jumps up to 1.10 meters in height and a final obstacle: a barrel that had to be jumped while it was rolled towards the horse. Riders could garner bonus points for riding with one hand.\nEventing.\nThe eventing competition had 7 nations competing with a total of 27 riders. The team event had 3 or 4 riders per nation, who were required to be officers on army mounts. The format differed greatly from what is currently used, being held over 5 days. The first day was a 55 km endurance ride to be completed in 4 hours, which included a 5 km, 12-obstacle cross-country course to be completed in 15 minutes.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, and Kansas City Royals, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Seibu Lions.\nEarly years.\nCooper attended Pattonville High School in nearby Maryland Heights, Missouri, where he was a standout at baseball, and played on their 1986 state championship team. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the third round of the 1986 MLB draft.\nCareer.\nCooper rose through the Red Sox minor league system, playing for the Elmira Pioneers (1986), Greensboro Hornets (1987), Lynchburg Red Sox (1988), New Britain Red Sox (1989), and Pawtucket Red Sox (1990–1991).\nBoston Red Sox.\nCooper made his major league debut with the Red Sox on September 5, 1990, as the Red Sox hosted the Oakland Athletics at Fenway Park. Appearing for Carlos Quintana as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning of a 10–0 A's win, Cooper struck out looking, which was his only MLB at bat that season.\nAppearing in 14 games with Boston in , Cooper hit .457 (16-for-35) with seven RBI. His first MLB hit came September 12, 1991, as a pinch hitter for Jody Reed, singling off New York Yankees pitcher Rich Monteleone in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium. He picked up the first of his 33 career home runs on September 4, 1992, hitting a solo shot off A's star Dave Stewart in Oakland.\nWith future Hall of Fame third baseman Wade Boggs playing for the Red Sox, Cooper struggled to find time on the active roster and in ballgames. In 1992, Cooper played 62 games at first base; in 123 total games that season, he hit .276 with five home runs and 33 RBI over 337 at bats. When Boggs signed with the Yankees as a free agent in the offseason, Cooper became the starting third baseman and was selected to two All-Star teams.\nCooper's Red Sox career — the most productive seasons of his career — ended when he and reliever Cory Bailey were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals on April 9, 1995, for pitcher Rhéal Cormier and outfielder Mark Whiten.\nHitting for the cycle.\nOn April 12, 1994, Cooper hit for the cycle in a 22–11 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. Batting seventh and playing third base, Cooper hit a two-run double off Kevin Appier in the first inning, homered in the third inning, tripled off Hipólito Pichardo in the fifth inning (Cooper was called out at the plate trying to stretch it into an inside-the-park home run), reached on an error in sixth inning, hit another two-run double in the seventh inning off Jeff Montgomery, and singled in the ninth inning off infielder-turned-pitcher David Howard. Cooper hit the 18th cycle in Red Sox history, and was the first player to do so since Mike Greenwell in .\nAll-Star games.\nIn and , Cooper was the lone Red Sox player named to the American League All-Star teams.\nIn 1993, Cooper entered the game as a replacement for former teammate Wade Boggs at third base in the sixth inning of the All-Star game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Cooper went 0-for-2, hitting a flyout to left field off Steve Avery in the sixth inning and striking out against Rod Beck in the seventh inning.\nIn 1994, Cooper again came into the game for Boggs in the sixth inning of the Midsummer Classic, which was played at Three Rivers Stadium that year. Cooper went 1-for-2 with a run scored and a RBI in the exhibition game. In the seventh inning, Cooper hit a RBI double off Danny Jackson in the seventh inning and grounded out to second base off reliever Randy Myers in the ninth inning.\nCooper went 1-for-4 with a double, a run scored and a RBI in his two All-Star game appearances.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nCooper's Cardinals career got off to a good start when he made his debut with St. Louis on April 26, 1995, in a 7–6 Cards win over the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. Hitting in the cleanup spot, Cooper went 3-for-5 in his Cardinals debut and hit a two-run walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth to secure the St. Louis victory. He finished the day with one run scored and four RBI. He continued to hit well early in the season, having a .302 average on May 25 only to finish the year with a .230 average, three homers, 40 RBI and 29 runs over 118 games. While he struggled in 1995, Cooper was paid a career-high $1,525,000 for the season.\nCooper filed for free agency at the end of the season but found himself without a job in MLB for 1996, instead signing a one-year deal with the Seibu Lions in Japan.\nSeibu Lions.\nUnable to find a job in Major League Baseball in , Cooper signed on with the Seibu Lions of the Pacific League in Japan. Appearing in 81 games with the Lions, Cooper hit .243 with seven home runs, 27 RBI and 27 runs scored. It was with the Lions that he was given the nickname \"Super Duper Cooper Scooper\" in recognition of his tremendous defense.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 16, 1996, Cooper signed with the Kansas City Royals, earning $375,000 for the season. In 1996, the Royals had finished last in American League Central division at 75–86, 24 games behind the Cleveland Indians. Cooper was signed just three days after the Royals traded incumbent third baseman Joe Randa and three other players to the Pittsburgh Pirates for infielders Jay Bell and Jeff King. Cooper went to spring training as a non-roster invitee, and made the team.\nCooper hit just .201 with three home runs, 15 RBI and 12 runs over 159 at bats in 75 games for the 1997 Royals. By the end of the season, Cooper was primarily a defensive replacement and pinch hitter. In the last two games of his career, he appeared as a defensive replacement at third base without getting an at bat. His final MLB at bat came September 26, 1997, at Comiskey Park, striking out as a pinch hitter against Chicago White Sox lefty Jim Abbott.\nA free agent at season's end, Cooper signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers, but was released in March 1998, without appearing in a game with the club.\nPost-playing career.\nIn 1999, Cooper was named head coach of the Fontbonne College baseball team. He led the team for several seasons, and was named coach of the year for the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC) in 2003. In 2005, Cooper became part-owner of a baseball training facility in the St. Louis area. In 2007, Cooper joined the staff of the St. Louis Gamers, a baseball program for 10 to 18 year-old players.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

He played for the Oakland Athletics, Houston Astros, Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles from 1988 to 1999.\nEarly life.\nCorsi was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on September 9, 1961. His parents, Ben and Dotty Corsi, had three sons (Jim, John and Mike). He attended Newton North High School, before studying at Saint Leo University in Florida. He was subsequently drafted by the New York Yankees in the 25th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft.\nProfessional career.\nCorsi played six seasons in the minor leagues from 1982 to 1988, missing the entire 1984 season after being released by the Yankees organization. He made his MLB debut with the Oakland Athletics on June 28, 1988, at the age of 26, pitching a scoreless ninth inning and striking out one in a 4–1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. He also made the only start of his major league career on August 7 that year, receiving a no decision after surrendering six earned runs over five innings against the Seattle Mariners. He subsequently posted a 1.88 earned run average (ERA) and 21 strikeouts over innings pitched in 1989. The Athletics went on to win the World Series that year, but Corsi did not pitch in the postseason. After missing the entire 1990 season, he became a free agent and signed with the Houston Astros on March 19, 1991.\nIn his only season with the Astros, Corsi compiled a 0–5 win–loss record along with a 3.71 ERA and a career-high 53 strikeouts over innings. After being released by the organization at the end of the season, he rejoined the Athletics in March 1992. He recorded a career-best 1.43 ERA over 44 innings pitched that year, and pitched in the 1992 American League Championship Series. Corsi was subsequently selected by the Florida Marlins in the expansion draft at the end of the year. He was limited to 15 games in 1993, while his ERA ballooned to 6.64. After the 1994 strike, he once more signed with the Athletics. He then lowered his ERA to 2.20 and had 26 strikeouts in 45 innings. Corsi's playing time increased to innings in 1997, in which he finished with a 6–0 record, a 4.03 ERA, and 43 strikeouts.\nCorsi played his final major league game on October 3, 1999, at the age of 38. In 10 seasons pitching in MLB, Corsi had a 22–24 win–loss record in 368 games pitched, all but one in relief. He had a 3.25 earned run average (ERA), striking out 290 batters in innings pitched, and recorded seven saves.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring from professional baseball, Corsi worked as a studio analyst for Boston Red Sox coverage on both the New England Sports Network and UPN 38 baseball coverage from 2002 to 2005. He also ran a construction business in Massachusetts with his brothers. He was inducted to his college alma mater's athletic hall of fame in 2003. Corsi has four children, three with his first wife Diane, and the fourth with his ex-partner Jill Doherty.\nIn January 2022, Corsi announced he had been diagnosed with stage four cancer of the liver and colon. He died on the morning of January 4, 2022, at his home in Bellingham, Massachusetts. He was 60 years old."

        "title": "Equestrian events at the 1928 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1928 Summer Olympics included dressage, eventing, and show jumping. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The competitions were held from 8 to 12 August 1928. Teams were now fielded by three riders, rather than four, the purpose being to reduce pressure on national federations to find that many riders in order to compete for team medals. Riders had to be considered amateurs, which was defined as either an actively serving professional officer, or as a gentleman rider as defined by the rules of that rider's national governing body. A total of 113 entries were present from 20 nations: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. This was the first appearance for Hungary, Japan and Argentina in equestrian events at an Olympics. Additionally, after being shut out from two Olympic competitions, Germany also returned to the Games to win a few medals in the equestrian events.\nHorses were stabled in Hilversum, a town from Amsterdam and the location of the majority of the equestrian competition, with two jumping competitions taking place in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. The equestrian competitions produced an income of over 150,000 guilders, out of a total of 1,435,000 guilders income for the entire Games.\nDisciplines.\nJumping.\n46 riders competed from 16 different nations, including Olympic medalist (1920 gold and 1924 silver) Tommaso Lequio di Assaba on Trebecco, who finished 24th, and Alphonse Gemuseus, the 1924 Games gold medalists, finishing 8th on Lucette after garnering 2 time penalties. Seven riders went clear over the 720 meter, 16-obstacle course, whose obstacles ranged in height from 1.25–1.40 meters, and was considered too easy for an Olympic Games. Three riders went clear in the jump-off, so a second jump-off was held with the obstacles raised to 1.60 meters in height. Gold was given to the one clear round, Capt. Ventura of Czechoslovakia on Eliot. The other two riders had one rail apiece over the second jump-off course, but Pierre Bertran de Balanda's mount Papillon hit the rail with his hind legs garnering only 2 penalties, while Major Kuhn's mount Pepita hit a fence with her front legs, counting as 4 penalty points and thus finishing in bronze-medal position.\nDressage.\n29 riders from 12 countries competed in the dressage competition. The test was the same as for the 1924 Olympics, but the 10-minute limit was now raised to 13 minutes, giving the riders much needed time to complete it without losing points for going over the time allowed. Judging created controversy, both due to nationalistic tendencies by judges and the fact that individual judges had differing opinions on what was correct. While there was discussion on how to make it more fair—including dropping the lowest and highest scores, only having one judge from a neutral county, and removing 20 points from each score given to a countryman of each judge—no changes were made until after the judging scandal at the 1956 Games.\nEventing.\n46 riders from 17 nations competed in the eventing competition. Dressage saw the time allowed for the test raised from 10 to 11 minutes, and was now counting for 300 total points rather than 200 seen in the last Games, making it have a huge impact on final placings, since the time allowed for all phases of the Endurance was generous. There were 8 eliminations on endurance day (resulting in only 3 of the teams finishing the competition) primarily due to missing flags which were difficult to follow over the flat land. The point system for the Endurance day was kept the same (Phases A, C, and E were each worth 200 points, steeplechase was worth 500 points, and cross-country 700 points), while the show jumping phase was reduced in importance from 400 to 300 points total. The speed on steeplechase was raised from 550 up to 600 meters a minute.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 113 horse riders from 20 nations competed at the Amsterdam Games:\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

        "title": "New Mexico Lobos men's basketball",
        "text": "The New Mexico Lobos men's basketball team represents the University of New Mexico, competing in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in NCAA Division I. The university established basketball as a varsity sport in 1899 and began competing with regional colleges after establishing an athletics department in 1920.\nLobo basketball first achieved national prominence after Bob King was hired as head coach in 1962. King transformed a moribund program into a consistent winner and produced future ABA MVP Mel Daniels. The Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings. The team reached the NIT tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the NCAA tournament in 1968. The success of the program continued after King departed, winning WAC titles in 1974, 1978, and 1994, winning the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996, and regularly earning post-season tournament bids.\nThe Lobos became frequent participants in the NCAA tournament during the 1990s and have made 16 appearances overall, as well as 20 NIT appearances. They have won the MWC regular season championship and the conference tournament four times each. In addition to Daniels, other prominent players produced by the Lobo program include five-time NBA champion Michael Cooper, three-time NBA champion Luc Longley, NBA all-star Danny Granger, and Kenny Thomas.\nThe most renowned enduring feature of the Lobo basketball program is its home venue, known as \"The Pit\", recognized as one of the best college basketball arenas in the country. The Pit opened in 1966 and the Lobos have been dominant playing there, winning over 80 percent of their games, while regularly placing among national leaders in attendance. The arena has frequently hosted NCAA tournament games, including the 1983 NCAA Final Four that featured one of the most memorable finishes in tournament history.\nHistory.\nRoy W. Johnson (1920–1960).\nRoy Johnson, nicknamed \"Old Iron Head\", was fundamental to the early development of Lobo athletics. Johnson arrived in 1920 after a successful athletic career at the University of Michigan. The UNM gymnasium at the time was a small wooden building where the walls were out-of-bounds markers for basketball games. Basketball was primarily an intramural sport, with occasional games against other schools, including Albuquerque High School, and no regular schedule. Johnson set about building collegiate-level athletics facilities, performing some of the hard labor with his own hands. He oversaw construction of Carlisle Gymnasium in 1928 and Zimmerman Field in 1938, the first football stadium at UNM.\nDuring his nearly 40 years at UNM, Johnson coached every men's sport the school offered, while teaching physical education. A decorated veteran who served in World Wars I and II, he was the UNM athletic director from 1920 to 1949. He established regularly scheduled games against regional colleges, and in 1931 UNM joined the Border Conference as a founding member. Johnson coached the UNM basketball team for all but two seasons from 1920 to 1940. From 1924 to 1934, his teams posted a 104–38 (.732) record. The Lobos won 165 games with Johnson as head basketball coach, a school record for over 30 years and currently third on its all-time list.\nJohnson stepped down as head basketball coach after the 1939–40 season. The position passed to a few different coaches before Woody Clements took over 1944–51 and 1953–55, compiling a record of 113–119 (.487). The Lobos won the Border Conference in 1944 and 1945, and they appeared in the NAIA post-season tournament in 1947, losing to Hamline University in the first round. From 1951 to 1962, the Lobos competed in the Mountain States Conference, known at the time as the Skyline Eight. In 1957, while still on faculty, Johnson oversaw construction of the 7,800-seat arena that bears his name, Johnson Gymnasium. For many years, Johnson Gym was the most prominent feature of the UNM campus for those driving along Central Avenue in Albuquerque, part of historic U.S. Route 66.\nBob King (1962–1972).\nLobo basketball first achieved national prominence under Bob King, who was previously an assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Iowa. The Lobos had only two winning seasons from 1947 to 1962, compiling a 113–252 (.310) record, including a dismal 42–149 (.220) during the last eight years. King had an immediate impact on the program. The Lobos won as many games in his first two seasons as in the previous seven combined and went 116–44 (.725) over his first six seasons. They went 175–89 (.663) in ten seasons with King as head coach, winning two conference titles and making four appearances in post-season tournaments.\nNew Mexico joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) as a founding member before King's first season. His first team went 16–9, the best Lobo record in 17 years. The following season, 1963–64, the Lobos won their first WAC championship, led by Ira Harge, who King had recruited from a junior college in Iowa. The team posted wins over Kansas and at Purdue and received a berth in the 1964 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Lobos defeated Drake and NYU before falling to Bradley in the championship game, finishing with a 23–6 record and ranked 16th in the UPI poll. Harge averaged 18.8 points and 11.8 rebounds a game during his two seasons at UNM and was selected in the second round of the 1964 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nThe rise of the program continued in the 1964–65 season, led by sophomores Mel Daniels and Ben Monroe. After an early loss at Kansas, the Lobos won ten straight, later building a 19–3 record and attaining a #10 national ranking, their first appearance in the AP poll. They dropped their next four games on the road, however, including a one-point loss at #10 BYU. They were again invited to the NIT, where they lost to St. John's to finish 19–8. Daniels averaged over 17 points and 11 rebounds a game, providing the fast-growing Lobo fan base a preview of things to come. Due to the success of King's first three seasons, attendance at Johnson Gym more than doubled, and plans to build a larger arena began to take shape. In the 1965–66 season, Daniels averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds a game, and the Lobos raced out to an 11–1 record after beating #7 BYU. They faltered down the stretch though and finished 16–8, completing the team's best four-year stretch in nearly forty seasons.\nUniversity Arena opened as the home venue of the Lobos on December 1, 1966. Because the playing surface is 37 feet below grade, students nicknamed the arena \"The Pit,\" and the nickname stuck. The team began the 1966–67 season ranked 6th in the country and rose to #5 before winning at #2 UTEP, the defending national champion and highest-ranked team New Mexico had ever beaten at that point. The Lobos reached #3 with an 11–1 record but then lost four straight and fell out of the rankings. Despite a disappointing WAC campaign, they received a bid to the NIT. The Lobos beat Syracuse in the first round before losing to Rutgers, finishing the season 19–8 and ranked #18 in the UPI. Daniels averaged 21.5 points and 11.6 rebounds a game, finishing his career with a still-team record 44 double-doubles, and he became the first Lobo to be named as an All-American. He was selected as the ninth pick overall in the 1967 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals, but he chose to play in the fledgling American Basketball Association (ABA), becoming one of its greatest all-time players. He was named the first ABA Rookie of the Year in 1968, ABA Most Valuable Player in 1969 and 1971, and he led the Indiana Pacers to three ABA championships.\nStoking the popularity of Lobo basketball by this time was the success of two longtime rivals. New Mexico began playing New Mexico State in 1904, currently totaling over 200 games; they first played UTEP in 1929, with over 140 games total. Don Haskins took over at UTEP in 1961 and led the Miners to a 128–32 (.800) record in his first six seasons, including a 28–1 national championship season in 1965–66. New Mexico State hired Lou Henson as head coach in 1966, and like the Lobos under King, in his second season the Aggies began achieving national rankings and post-season tournament appearances. They went 74–14 (.841) from 1967 to 1970, including a 27–3 season in 1969–70 in which they were ranked in the top five most of the year, culminating in a Final Four appearance. The Lobos, Aggies, and Miners played one another twice every season, home-and-away, and a fierce rivalry grew among them. The teams were frequently ranked in national polls, giving their games a showdown quality extending beyond local bragging rights to the national stage.\nThe Lobos lost Daniels and Monroe to graduation and were picked in the 1967–68 preseason to finish last in the WAC. Instead, they started the season 17–0, rising to #6 before beating #5 Utah in the Pit, propelling the Lobos to #4. Four starters averaged in double-figures in scoring, led by senior guard Ron Nelson at 19.5 points a game. They swept their regular season match-ups against New Mexico State, with both teams ranked in the top ten at the time of their second game. The Lobos won the WAC championship, Nelson was named a Helms All-American, and the Lobos earned their first NCAA tournament appearance. They entered the tournament 23–3 and ranked #6. They hosted their first-round game in The Pit but lost to unranked Santa Clara. Starting center Greg \"Stretch\" Howard was ineligible due to an NCAA rule disallowing transfers to play in postseason games; without his 14 points and 10 rebounds a game, the Lobos' balanced attack withered, and Nelson was their only consistent offense. Also playing in the first round at The Pit, New Mexico State lost to eventual champion UCLA, then won the consolation game over the Lobos, who finished the season 23–5.\nThe 1968–69 season began with high expectations and the Lobos ranked in the top ten, but they dropped out after a string of road losses. Howard led a young team, scoring 19.7 per game, with sophomores Willie Long and Petie Gibson beginning their runs as three-year starters. The Lobos swept #8 New Mexico State, with Gibson hitting a memorable last-second shot in the latter game, leading to a brief return to the national rankings. The team finished the season 17–9 but failed to receive an NIT berth. The Lobos slumped to a 42–36 record over the next three seasons. Long averaged 23.9 points a game both his junior and senior seasons, earning all-WAC honors both seasons and all-American recognition in 1971. He finished with career averages of 19.8 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, and his 23 double-doubles in 1969–70 still stands as the Lobo season record. Gibson compiled career averages of over 11 points and seven assists per game, still holding UNM records for career assists per game and four other assists categories.\nAfter the 1971–72 season, assistant coach Norm Ellenberger was elevated to head coach, and King served as Assistant Athletics Director the next season. King then left to become head coach and Athletics Director at Indiana State University. In 1976, he recruited future Hall of Famer Larry Bird to ISU, where he led the Sycamores to a 48–12 record in his first two seasons. King suffered a heart attack and brain aneurysm shortly before Bird's senior season, however, and his assistant, Bill Hodges, led the team to the 1979 Final Four, where they lost to Michigan State in the championship game. King continued as AD until retiring the next year.\nBob King transformed the New Mexico program, becoming known as the \"Architect of Lobo Basketball.\" Since his arrival at UNM, the Lobos have won over sixty percent of their games and earned over thirty berths to post-season tournaments, while suffering only five losing seasons. In 1992, UNM announced that the basketball court at University Arena would be named in honor of King. \"Bob King Court\" was dedicated at formal ceremonies on December 1, 1992, the 26th anniversary of the opening of The Pit. Coach King died on December 10, 2004.\nNorm Ellenberger (1972–1979).\nUnder Norm Ellenberger, the Lobos won WAC championships in 1974 and 1978 and compiled an overall record of 134–62 (.684). Ellenberger was named head coach in March 1972 after serving as an assistant under King since 1967. It was Ellenberger's first Division I head coaching position, but he made up for what he lacked in experience with energy and enthusiasm. The program thrived, and Ellenberger became a local celebrity, restaurateur, and man-about-town, earning the nickname \"Stormin' Norman\" for his flashy attire and fiery coaching style.\nLike King, Ellenberger got off to a fast start in his first two seasons. In 1972–73, the Lobos raced out to a 9–0 record, including road wins at Oregon State and eventual Southwest Conference champion Texas Tech, leading to their first appearance in the national rankings in nearly four years. The team was led by the strong inside scoring and rebounding of Darryl Minniefield, Bernard Hardin, and Mark Saiers. In late February the Lobos were 21–3, ranked #15, and leading the WAC, before losing their last two games and finishing second in conference. The Lobos returned to the NIT, losing to eventual champion Virginia Tech and finishing 21–6.\nThe 1973–74 Lobos began the season 12–0, launching them to a #8 ranking. Hardin led the way, averaging 17 points a game, and the team became the highest scoring Lobo squad to date at over 84 points a game. Bill Hagins replaced Minniefield, and the team was again dominant inside. After a string of road losses, the Lobos recovered to win six of seven and secure the WAC championship in a strong season for the league when five of eight teams were ranked at some point. The Lobos earned their second trip to the NCAA tournament and tallied their first tournament victory, downing Idaho State before losing to San Francisco in the second round. They beat Dayton in the regional consolation game to finish the season 22–7 and ranked #18 in the UPI. Attendance at The Pit surged to its best ever, a trend that would continue throughout the Ellenberger years, regularly earning placement among the top five in the nation. The top six largest crowds ever at The Pit were during this period.\nThe 1974–75 Lobo team was depleted by graduation and slipped to a 13–13 record. Ellenberger began relying heavily on recruiting Junior College (JC) transfers, a tactic that would lead to his best season as Lobo coach but later to his downfall. The 1975–76 team improved to 16–11 with a largely mercenary squad of JC transfers who would later quit the team before the end of the season. A memorable highlight of the season was the first game in a brief but intense rivalry with UNLV before the teams were in the same conference. Ellenberger was well-respected as a teacher of defense, and he was a frequent participant in basketball coaching camps and workshops, where he became friends with UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian. In January 1976, #4 UNLV survived a scare from the underdog Lobos before a Pit-record crowd of 19,452, with fans overflowing onto the concourse and sitting in the stairways, a game still lauded as one of the greatest and loudest ever in The Pit.\nThe 1976–77 team featured JC arrivals Michael Cooper, Marvin Johnson, and Willie Howard, the nucleus for a successful and exciting two-year run. Cooper is among the best overall players ever produced by the Lobo program and was named an All-American in 1978. He averaged 16 points and five rebounds a game as a Lobo, also leading the team in assists and steals. \"Coop\" later became a mainstay of the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s, winning five NBA championships over a 12-year career. His defensive prowess made him an eight-time recipient of NBA All-Defensive Team honors, as well as the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1987. By contrast, Marvin \"Automatic\" Johnson was one of the greatest scorers in Lobo history. He became the fourth leading scorer in school history at the time in just two seasons, set single season records for total points, season points per game (24.0), career points per game (21.9), and he scored a still-school record 50 points in a single game. Willie Howard was a talented inside player averaging 13 points and six rebounds a game, frequently providing explosive scoring off the bench. Further JC transfers Jimmy Allen and Will Smiley completed a strong Lobo front line. The injection of talent made the Lobos exciting and competitive, but they took time to gel as a team, beginning the season 6–4 with a couple of disappointing losses. They beat Iowa and USC on the way to another showdown with #9 UNLV, losing a high-scoring game, then losing to #10 Arizona. The Lobos remained in the WAC race late in the season, but road struggles relegated them to third place and a 19–11 final record.\nBefore the 1977–78 season, Ellenberger installed what he called the \"Equal Opportunity Motion Offense\", a run-and-gun attack emphasizing picks and passing as players rotate through each position, taking advantage of his versatile, athletic lineup. The scheme also employed a full-court pressing, trapping defense to generate points off of turnovers. The team played at a frenetic pace and led the nation in scoring at 97.5 points per game. Phil Abney and Russell Saunders were JC additions; Abney initially backed up Howard but later moved into the starting line-up. The Lobos stood at 7–2 after losing to #10 Syracuse, then rattled off 14 straight wins, including a home-and-away sweep of #9 UNLV, pushing them into the national rankings and eventually into the top ten. Attendance at The Pit jumped to over 17,000 a game, second most in the nation, as fan enthusiasm soared. The Lobos won their fourth WAC championship with a 13–1 league record, losing only at ranked Utah, and entered the NCAA tournament ranked #5 and seeded second in the West Regional, with the opportunity to play in The Pit for the regional final with a win. They were upset in the first round by unranked Cal State Fullerton, however, in another disappointing tournament performance. The Lobos finished the season 24–4 and ranked #12, and Ellenberger was voted runner-up for the US Basketball Writers Coach of the Year award.\nThe 1978–79 Lobo squad returned starters Abney and Saunders while adding another strong JC class including Larry Belin. The team began the season 8–3 but struggled away from The Pit, losing its first seven road games. The team finally broke through, winning another exciting game at UNLV, beginning a string of nine wins in its last ten games. The strong finish earned the Lobos an NIT bid, where they lost to Texas A&amp;M, finishing the season 19–10. The 1979–80 roster appeared once again loaded with talent, and fan expectations were again high, but disaster struck the program in the early weeks of the season as the \"Lobogate\" scandal unfolded. Leading players like Belin lost eligibility and were dropped from the team. Ellenberger was fired on December 17, 1979, and the season continued with the remaining players not caught up in the scandal, along with several walk-ons.\nLobogate.\nThe \"Lobogate\" scandal involved forged academic transcripts, payments made for bogus Junior College credits, and other devices to attain eligibility for players who lacked academic credentials. In an investigation into illegal gambling, the FBI had placed a wiretap on the phone of a major Lobo booster. While Ellenberger was visiting this booster, in November 1979, he took a call on the tapped phone from assistant coach Manny Goldstein. They discussed an arrangement to transfer bogus credits from a California Junior College to the office of the UNM registrar. Based on this conversation, the FBI launched an investigation that led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, though he was acquitted of those charges at trial. In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers. The judge deferred sentence for a year, noting that it was unfair for Ellenberger alone to bear culpability, and all counts were formally dismissed in 1983.\nThe NCAA investigation into the scandal found 34 violations of recruiting rules, and the Lobo program was placed on probation and banned from post-season appearances for three years. Six players were dismissed from the team in the opening weeks of the 1979–80 season, and another was suspended. The damage to the program was devastating, as it was forced to rebuild virtually from scratch, beginning in mid-season.\nWhile the criminal charges were cleared from Ellenberger's record, he would never be a college head coach again. Despite the scandal, Ellenberger managed to remain popular in Albuquerque, running a nightclub, appearing in TV commercials, and coaching the city's Continental Basketball Association team – some fans even wanted him to be rehired as Lobo coach. In 1986, former rival and longtime friend Don Haskins hired Ellenberger as his lead assistant at UTEP, where he would coach for four years. He then became the lead assistant for Bobby Knight at Indiana for ten seasons, from 1990 to 2000, and later coached in the NBA and WNBA.\nCharlie Harrison (1979–1980).\nWhen Ellenberger was fired in December 1979, lead assistant Charlie Harrison was elevated to head coach for the remainder of the season. Only four scholarship players remained on the team, so a campus tryout filled out the roster with walk-ons. The team limped to a 6–22 record. One stand-out was Kenny Page, a transfer from Ohio State. Page was the only consistent offensive threat on the team, averaging 28 points a game, still the Lobo record for best season average. Harrison and his players gained fan appreciation for persevering under difficult circumstances, but he served primarily as a caretaker until a new head coach was named.\nGary Colson (1980–1988).\nGary Colson rebuilt the Lobo program virtually from scratch after Lobogate, restoring its integrity and eventually its success on the court. Colson inherited a program under NCAA sanctions, with only three players remaining on scholarship. While he initially relied on JC transfers to fill the roster, he also began the slow process of rebuilding the program around freshmen recruits, with a greater emphasis on academics. Colson adhered strictly to NCAA rules, as UNM officials watched the program closely, wary of falling back into disfavor with the NCAA. Colson later stated that he felt tremendous pressure to push the rules, and knew other coaches who were doing so and succeeding, but his personal integrity kept him from doing so, an attitude appreciated by his players.\nIn their first three seasons under Colson, the Lobos struggled to a 39–44 combined record. Four-year starting PG Phil Smith led those early teams, averaging 14 points, six assists, and two steals per game over his career, setting then-records for highest scoring freshman, most steals in a season, and most career assists. A highlight of Colson's first season was his fourth game as head coach, hosting an Arizona State team that would reach #3 in the nation led by future NBA players Byron Scott, Fat Lever, Alton Lister, and Sam Williams. The callow Lobo squad led for much of the game, encouraged by a delirious crowd at The Pit. The Sun Devils battled back to tie the game at the end of regulation before escaping with a win in OT, 86–83. Despite the struggles of the team, attendance at The Pit actually improved in Colson's early years, remaining in the top four nationally.\nThe 1983–84 Lobos relied almost exclusively on four senior starters, led by Smith and Tim Garrett, to the point that they took over the top four positions in school history for minutes played in a season. The Lobos opened the season with two losses before beating USC and Washington and winning at #7 UCLA. The plucky squad lacked depth, but its veterans found ways to win, building a 16–4 record. The team frequently slowed their games to a crawl, with several league games ending with both teams scoring under 50 points, such as a win at Wyoming, 40–38. The Lobos averaged 63.7 ppg, their lowest output since 1958–59, while holding opponents to 59.2 ppg, the lowest since Bob King's early years. Top ten-ranked UTEP foiled the Lobos, however, sweeping their regular season match-ups and knocking them out of the WAC tournament. Smith was named All-WAC, and Colson was named WAC Coach of the Year. The Lobos returned to the NIT, losing at The Pit to Lamar and finishing the season 24–11. The NIT appearance began a streak of eleven straight years of reaching post-season play.\nThe Lobos in 1984–85 were led by JC transfer forward Johnny Brown (18.8 points and 6.3 rebounds per game) and senior center George Scott (14 points and 6.6 rebounds), along with a nucleus of sophomores, including guards Hunter Greene and Kelvin Scarborough, who both scored in double figures. The Lobos beat a good Arizona team before losing a close game to #1 Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, the first time the Lobos had faced a top-ranked opponent. The team slipped to 6–5 before winning eight out of nine, gaining a share of the WAC lead. They then lost five of six to finish in a tie for third. They beat Texas A&amp;M in the NIT before losing at Fresno State to finish the season 19–13. Brown again led the Lobos in 1985–86 with 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds a game, earning All-WAC recognition. Scott was lost to graduation, Greene sat out the season injured, and the inexperienced team struggled badly on the road. They nevertheless reached the NIT, losing to Texas and finishing 17–14.\nThe 1986–87 season was the most successful for Colson as Lobo coach. Greene returned to average 21 points and six rebounds a game, while Scarborough added 19 points and six assists. The Lobos scored over eighty points a game and set the team record for most total points in a season. They also established still-standing records for steals in a season as a team, Greene for steals by a player in a season, and Scarborough for career steals. The Lobos logged wins over Texas and Oklahoma State on the way to a 17–5 record. They then lost three league road games and fell to third in a tight WAC race. The Lobos reached the final of the WAC tournament but lost to Wyoming, which went on to reach the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. At 25–9 in a strong WAC, Lobo fans retained hope that New Mexico would gain an at-large berth to the tournament. The selection committee granted the WAC three spots in the field, but the Lobos were left out, a disappointment that would linger through the following season. They were again relegated to the NIT, losing to Oregon State and finishing 25–10, the team record for wins in a season at the time. Scarborough was named All-WAC and finished his career second (now third) in Lobo history in total assists.\nIn 1987–88 the Lobos were led by Charlie Thomas, a junior transfer from Wake Forest (17 points and 7.5 rebounds a game), and senior Greene (16.8 points, 6.8 rebounds). The team tallied early wins over UCLA, Ohio State, and at Texas before hosting #1 Arizona, led by All-Americans Sean Elliott and Steve Kerr. The Lobos jumped out to a 25–9 lead before the Wildcats chiseled away at the lead, cutting it to two late in the game. Elliott had an opportunity to put Arizona in the lead with a three-pointer with seconds remaining, but Greene blocked the shot to seal the win, the only time the Lobos have beaten a #1-ranked opponent. A week later the Lobos beat #5 Wyoming at The Pit, pushing them to 14–3 and earning a #19 ranking, their first appearance in the polls since Lobogate. They fell into a 6–10 slide, however, including 1–9 on the road, a chronic weakness of the Lobos under Colson, whose teams compiled a 24–65 record in road games. The Lobos again returned to the NIT, beating Pepperdine and Oregon before losing in the quarter-finals to Ohio State, a team they had beaten earlier in the season, finishing with a 22–14 record. Greene completed his career as the only Lobo ever to surpass 1,500 points, 600 rebounds, 300 assists, and 200 steals, averaging 16 points and six rebounds a game as a Lobo.\nColson was forced to resign after the season ended, a move that remains somewhat controversial. Former UNM AD John Bridgers believed Colson had never received the full support of the Lobo community. Colson said the popularity and continued presence of Ellenberger during his early years were unnerving and that he sometimes felt in competition with the former coach. Bridgers had been replaced as AD the year before by John Koenig, who did not believe Colson could take the Lobos to the next level. Colson's teams had gone 107–62 (.633) in his last five seasons, but his failure to win the conference or to make the NCAA tournament were common criticisms. Colson had also clashed with Koenig in a contract dispute and had gone over his head to resolve the issue. Colson's supporters pointed to the strong recruiting class he had coming in, arguing that his best teams were ahead of him, as well as to the integrity and academic success forged by Colson. Complicating matters, Koenig himself was fired three months later and eventually faced indictment on criminal charges for his activities as AD. In the end, fans wanted more than Colson had managed to achieve, and despite the respect he had earned for rebuilding the program, the disappointment of failing to reach the NCAA tournament fueled support for a change.\nDave Bliss (1988–1999).\nDave Bliss recorded the most wins as head coach in Lobo history, compiling a 246–108 (.695) record, with seven NCAA tournament appearances and three trips to the NIT. The hiring search after Colson's departure included a brief flirtation with Indiana coach Bobby Knight, who visited Albuquerque and was reportedly offered the job. Knight acknowledged that he had seriously considered the offer but eventually declined, stating that he did not have the energy that would be required. Knight recommended Bliss, who had been his assistant at Army and Indiana before serving as head coach at Oklahoma and SMU.\nBliss inherited a strong nucleus of senior Charlie Thomas, junior Darrell McGee, and sophomores Luc Longley and Rob Robbins. All had been Colson recruits, and Bliss reportedly flew to Australia to secure Longley's return to New Mexico. The Lobos got off to a slow start in 1988–89, including losses to #11 Arizona and #6 Oklahoma. They then won 11 of 12, taking the WAC lead into the last month of the season. After a couple of upset losses at home, however, they fell into a tie for second and again settled for the NIT. The Lobos notched wins over Santa Clara and Pepperdine before losing to eventual tournament runner-up St. Louis, finishing the season at 22–11. The Lobos shot their best field goal percentage in a season, .542, placing them second in the nation, and McGee established the still-standing record for assists in a season. Thomas finished his career with over 1,000 points and 500 rebounds, one of two Lobos to accomplish that in just two seasons.\nThe Lobos had a roller-coaster season in 1989–90, buoyed by record-setting performances by Longley, Robbins, and McGee. They lost four straight early in the year, then won their next five; they lost seven of nine, but won their last seven regular season games; they carried that momentum into the NIT and reached its Final Four. Longley was named All-WAC, averaging 18.4 points and 9.7 rebounds while setting Lobo records for blocks in a season and per game. Robbins led the nation in free throw shooting, making 93.5% of his attempts, including 52 in a row at one point, both school records. McGee capped his career with Lobo records for most games played and most career assists. In the NIT, the Lobos knocked off Oregon, Oklahoma State, and Hawaii to make the Final Four in New York. They lost to St. Louis in the semi-finals, then in overtime to Penn State in the consolation game to finish the season 20–14.\nThe 1990–91 Lobos were again led by Longley averaging 19.1 points and 9.2 rebounds a game, with Robbins adding 14 points a game. The team began the season 11–2 but lost four straight, struggling on the road. They again finished strong, winning nine of their last eleven, including four of five on the road. They finished third in the WAC but received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their first berth since 1978. They lost in the first round to #14 Oklahoma State to finish 20–10. Longley was again named All-WAC and finished his career as Lobo leader in scoring and rebounding, falling since to sixth in points and second in rebounds. He remains the Lobo career leader in blocks and blocks per game; second in career field goals made; and the only Lobo to record a triple-double, doing so twice. Longley was the seventh player selected in the 1991 NBA draft, by Minnesota, and he went on to win three NBA championships as a starter for the Chicago Bulls (1996–98). Robbins finished his career with the Lobo record for best career free throw percentage, third best three-point shooting percentage, and second most minutes played, having started all 133 games of his career.\nThe 1991–92 Lobos featured a balanced offense, with all five starters averaging in double figures, but they lacked a go-to scorer. Senior Willie Banks, an Albuquerque High product, led the team along with junior guards Ike Williams and Steve Logan and center Khari Jaxon. The team started slowly, including a home loss to #2 Arizona, but later won seven of eight to gain an early share of the WAC lead. Road struggles slowed them, however, and despite another strong finish they ended up a game out of the lead. Banks was named All-WAC and finished as Lobo career leader (now second) in three-point percentage. The Lobos returned to the NIT, where they beat Louisiana Tech and Washington State before losing at Virginia, finishing the season 20–13.\nThe 1992–93 Lobos had an experienced core with Williams, Logan, and Jaxon returning as seniors. They began the season 7–1, losing only at #14 Arizona while sweeping ranked New Mexico State. They began their WAC schedule with losses at Utah and BYU but rebounded to win eight of their next nine. The Lobos led the conference in scoring defense and were 15th in the nation, allowing 63.2 points per game. A pair of upset losses prevented them from catching the #9 Utes and #21 Cougars, who were tied atop the league at 14–1 late in the season. The Lobos beat both in The Pit in the final week, however, then upset BYU on the way to winning their first WAC tournament championship, and securing a trip to the NCAA tournament. Williams was named conference tournament MVP; he and Jaxon were both named All-WAC. The Lobos broke into the AP rankings at #21 and received a five-seed in the tournament, facing George Washington in the first round. The team had relied heavily on three-point shooting, hoisting over 100 more attempts than in any previous season, making 39%. Their shooting touch eluded them in the tournament, as several players were suffering from food poisoning before the game. They got into foul trouble and could not stop George Washington's strong inside game, falling in an upset and finishing the season 24–7.\nThe 1993–94 Lobos were picked in preseason polls to finish fifth in the WAC after losing their three leading players to graduation. Senior Greg Brown, a 5ft 7in point guard from Albuquerque High, produced a monumental season, though, leading the Lobos to their first regular season WAC title in 16 years. Brown averaged 19.3 points a game, scoring over 30 four times, often in pivotal games, with a season-best 42; junior Marlow White averaged 17, senior Notch Neves 13, and promising freshman Charles Smith added over ten a game. The Lobos again relied on three-point shooting, attempting the most threes in school history while making nearly ten a game, leading the WAC. The Lobos started 11–2, with both losses to New Mexico State in close, exciting games. The team was undefeated at home in conference and won a key road game at BYU to seal the league championship, led by a torrent of points from Brown. They lost in the conference tournament but received a berth in the NCAA tournament as a ten-seed facing Virginia. The Lobos built a 15-point lead early in the second half, but their shooting touch again disappeared, missing their last ten three-pointers. Smith led with 20 points, but the rest of the team shot a combined 29%, including 18% from three-point range. Virginia scored the last eight points of the game to take the lead, and the Lobos missed three shots at tying the game in the last 12 seconds, finishing the season at 23–8. White was named All-WAC and Bliss was WAC Coach of the Year; Brown was named All-WAC and WAC Player of the Year. Brown also won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, given to the nation's top senior under six feet tall and gained an All-American Honorable Mention. Bliss stated, \"[a]s a coach, I have never compromised more of my offensive principles than while coaching Greg Brown. Because his best play is to dribble down the court and shoot it. Everybody knows that's not a great basketball play, but for us it was terrific.\"\nThe 1994–95 season was a rebuilding year for the Lobos, who finished 15–15 but won six of their last eight games. Sophomore Smith led the team, scoring 16 points a game, while three freshmen – Clayton Shields, David Gibson, and Royce Olney – played extensively. The 1995–96 team added to that nucleus Albuquerque High star Kenny Thomas, a \"USA Today\" and \"Parade\" magazine High School All-American. The young Lobo squad jumped out to a 10–0 start and a #25 ranking before losing a pair of league road games. Smith averaged 19.5 points a game and Shields added 14.5, while Thomas tallied 14.7 points and 7.8 rebounds a game, setting Lobo standards for freshmen. The Lobos were swept by #7 Utah, dropping to 17–4, but they won their last seven games to finish second in conference. They rode the momentum into the WAC tournament championship game and beat the Utes behind a dominant 30-point, 17-rebound performance by Thomas, earning their tenth straight win and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The Lobos were ranked #23 and received a seven-seed to play Kansas State. The Lobos broke open a close game in the second half with a 26–7 run. Shields led the way with 25 points and 10 rebounds, with Smith adding 15, overcoming a foul-plagued game for Thomas. The Lobos next faced two-seed Georgetown and took a slim lead into the second half. Shields again led with 19 points. With Thomas again slowed by foul trouble, the Lobos were outmatched inside and could not stop All-American Allen Iverson, who scored 20 in the second half. The Lobos finished the season 28–5, their highest season win total and winning percentage to date. Smith and Thomas were named All-WAC, and Bliss was again named WAC Coach of the Year.\nThe 1996–97 Lobos returned all their principal players, while adding freshman Lamont Long, who would become a starter by mid-season. The team entered the year #18 and would remain ranked throughout the next three seasons. The Lobos started 11–1, losing at Texas Tech but beating #11 Arizona and rising to #11 themselves. The WAC had expanded to 16 teams in the off-season, and eight WAC teams won at least 20 games. The Lobos lost three tough road games but beat #4 Utah in The Pit, pushing them to a #9 ranking – they went 18–0 at home for the season. Smith led in scoring for the third straight season, averaging 17.5 a game, while Shields scored 15.5, and Thomas added 14 points and seven rebounds a game. New Mexico later lost at Utah in a blowout, then lost a close game to the #3 Utes in the WAC tournament. The Lobos were ranked #11 and received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament, their best seed ever. Against Old Dominion in the first round, the Lobos struggled with three-point shooting and turned to their inside game. Thomas had 15 points and eight rebounds, sealing the win with a pair of late free throws, while Long added 14 points and nine boards. They then faced six-seed Louisville in a closely contested game that went down to the final play. The Lobos forced a turnover, down 64–63, but their set play broke down and Gibson missed an unbalanced, driving shot, ending the Lobo season at 25–8. Bliss would identify the loss as a particular disappointment, believing that the Lobos were the better team. Smith led with 16 points and seven rebounds in his final game as a Lobo. He was again named All-WAC and finished as the leading scorer in Lobo history, with 1,993 points, and the leader in field goals made, having started every game of his career. Smith was chosen by the Miami Heat with the 26th pick in the first round of the 1997 NBA draft, playing five seasons in the NBA and several more in Europe.\nThe 1997–98 Lobos had four starters returning and entered the season ranked #11. They began the year 11–1, rising to #8 before losing at #15 UCLA. They later lost at #5 Arizona but beat undefeated, #3 Utah as Olney hit two three-pointers in the final moments, including the game winner at the buzzer. Thomas averaged 17 points and nine rebounds, Shields 17 points and seven rebounds, and Long 14. Olney added 15 a game while shooting a Lobo record .513 from three-point range, as the team set the Lobo record for threes in a season. The Lobos were 21–3 and back at #11 when they lost at #19 TCU, at #5 Utah, and had a team record 41-game home-winning streak ended by BYU. They rebounded to reach the final of the WAC tournament before losing at UNLV but still received a four-seed in the NCAA tournament. Facing Butler in the first round, the Lobos were already without an injured Olney when Gibson suffered a concussion and broken finger; Thomas again spent the game in foul trouble. Unfazed, Long scored 22, Shields had 17, and bench reserves added 33 points as the Lobos won handily. Against five-seed Syracuse, however, the depleted Lobos shot under 26% and lost to finish the season 24–8. Thomas was named second-team All-American, and he and Shields were both All-WAC. Shields finished his career as the third (now fourth) leading scorer in Lobo history and as career leader in three-pointers. Gibson finished as Lobo career leader in minutes played. Attendance at The Pit remained in the top ten nationally during the Bliss years, finishing sixth in the nation twice and reaching its highest season average ever in 1997–98 at 17,625 per game.\nThe 1998–99 Lobos again started strong with a 12–1 record, reaching #11; they stood at 16–2 after beating #7 Arizona but then lost four of five, struggling on the road. Thomas averaged 18 points and 10 rebounds, Long 17 points and 6.5 boards. The team won seven of their last nine, both losses coming to #8 Utah, in Salt Lake and in the WAC tournament final. The Lobos advanced to the NCAA tournament for the fourth straight season, garnering a nine-seed against Missouri. Thomas had his best NCAA performance with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks, while Long added 17 points and 12 rebounds and made the game-winning basket in the closing seconds. The Lobos then fell to eventual national champion Connecticut, shooting just 26%, to finish 25–9. Thomas was named All-WAC for the third time and finished his career as the second leading scorer and top rebounder in Lobo history. He was selected as the 22nd pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft by Houston and played for 11 seasons in the NBA.\nThe four seasons with Kenny Thomas in the line-up was the best stretch by the Lobos to date. They compiled a 102–30 (.772) record while making the NCAA tournament and winning in the first round all four years. Bliss had won 246 games as Lobo head coach and reached the NCAA tournament seven times, both school records. His teams won twenty or more games and reached post-season tournaments in ten of his 11 seasons, and he coached the four leading scorers in Lobo history. Yet, despite his success, Bliss faced mounting criticism from fans and the media for poor academic performance by his players, lax discipline, lightweight schedules, and the failure to advance to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. Deciding it was time to move on, Bliss resigned and accepted the head coach position at Baylor, reportedly more than doubling his UNM salary. In 2003, he was forced to resign from Baylor embroiled in an ugly scandal that would end his college coaching career.\nFran Fraschilla (1999–2002).\nFran Fraschilla coached at New Mexico for three seasons, compiling a 55–41 (.572) record with three NIT appearances. Fraschilla was hired days after Bliss resigned, touted as a great recruiter and up-and-coming coach after leading Manhattan and St. John's to the NCAA tournament. He had left St. John's under murky circumstances, however, and worked as a broadcaster and scout during the preceding season.\nBefore the 1999–2000 season, the Lobos and seven other teams left the WAC to form the Mountain West Conference (MWC). Fraschilla inherited three returning starters, but the team was clearly heading into a rebuilding period after losing Thomas. The inconsistent squad started 5–5 but then stunned 21-point favorite, #2 Arizona in Tucson, the highest ranked opponent the Lobos had beaten on the road since 1966. The team meandered to a 13–11 record but then won four straight, including over #21 Utah. They went to the NIT and beat South Florida before losing at eventual champion Wake Forest, finishing 18–14. Lamont Long averaged 18.7 points a game to lead the league and earn All-MWC honors, finishing his career as the third leading scorer in Lobo history, three points ahead of former teammate Shields.\nThe Lobos added transfer Ruben Douglas from Arizona before the 2000–01 season, but other key recruits were sidelined by injury and disciplinary problems. Several players left the team, some claiming abuse by Fraschilla. The Lobos started the season 12–2, with an overtime win at Sweet 16-bound Gonzaga, but a blowout loss at #1 Stanford began a 1–6 slump, including several poor road performances. Douglas was an explosive scorer and led the team with 16 points a game. The Lobos heated up in the MWC tournament, reaching the final but losing on a missed shot at the end of the game. They went to the NIT and beat Bliss-led Baylor and Pepperdine in The Pit before losing at Memphis to finish 21–13.\nFraschilla felt he had his system and recruits in place going into the 2001–02 season, and Lobo fans were eager for the team to return to the NCAA tournament. The Lobos lost to #13 Stanford in their opener but moved to 10–3 as Douglas led the way with 18 points a game. Hosting #18 Gonzaga, Douglas missed a pair of free throws to send the game into overtime, and the Lobos lost; point guard Marlon Parmer ripped teammates in the locker room, beginning a string of problems on court and off. The team went on a 4–10 slide starting with a blowout loss at home to Utah, after which Parmer was dismissed, and culminating with forward Patrick Dennehy shoving teammates and walking off the court during a loss at Air Force. Fraschilla had lost the team: nine players had left the program or been dismissed during his tenure. The team finished 16–14 after another blowout loss at Minnesota in the NIT. Fraschilla resigned shortly after the season, concluding that \"it was best for everyone that I leave.\"\nRitchie McKay (2002–2007).\nRitchie McKay was head coach at New Mexico for five seasons with a record of 82–69 (.543) and one NCAA tournament appearance. After several coaches were discussed as candidates, some turning down offers, McKay was hired in a late night surprise and was not a popular choice among Lobo fans. His father played at UNM for Bob King, but McKay had only coached for brief stints at Portland State, Colorado State, and Oregon State, with an 83–89 career record.\nMcKay faced a major rebuilding project in 2002–03 compounded by further dismissals and injuries that cut the team to seven scholarship players. They languished to a 10–18 finish, the first losing season for the Lobos in twenty years. Senior Ruben Douglas was the lone offensive threat and became the only Lobo ever to lead the nation in scoring, averaging 28 points a game. He was named MWC Player of the Year and finished his career as the fifth leading scorer in Lobo history. A grim year for the program began with a severe spinal cord injury to guard Senque Carey, who would recover fully but never play again. Discipline trouble and player defections continued into the off-season. Misfortune turned to tragedy with the murder of former Lobo Patrick Dennehy – leading to a scandal at Baylor implicating Dave Bliss – and the suicide of Lobo transfer Billy Feeney. Both had close friends and long-time teammates still on the Lobo roster.\nBradley transfer Danny Granger became eligible during the 2003–04 season and led the team with 19.5 points a game. The young squad showed promising signs early but struggled in conference to finish 14–14. All returned for 2004–05, and Granger turned in a spectacular season, averaging 19 points and nine rebounds a game to gain All-American recognition. All five starters averaged in double figures, but the team had little depth and relied heavily on Granger. The Lobos were 10–1 when they lost to #5 Wake Forest, and 14–2 when Granger suffered an injury and missed three games, all losses. They won 12 of 13 after Granger returned, however, winning the MWC tournament final over #15 Utah and receiving a 12-seed in the NCAA tournament. Facing #22 Villanova, the Lobos shot 18% in the first half, scoring just eleven points and trailing by as much as 24. They battled to within five points in the second half but could not overcome their poor start. Granger was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 17th pick in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft and has placed among league leaders in scoring and been named an All-Star during his career.\nMcKay continued to attract strong transfer players, but discipline issues persisted in 2005–06. Versatile senior guard Mark Walters led the team with 16 points a game, but after winning four straight to build a 16–9 record, they lost four of five to finish 17–13 and did not receive a post-season bid. Road struggles kept the team from gaining momentum, a chronic problem as the Lobos went 8–43 in away games under McKay. The 2006–07 team featured talented Kansas transfer J. R. Giddens, who led the team with 16 points a game, but discipline problems limited his playing time. The team began 9–2 with an upset over #8 Wichita State but wilted in league play, going 4–12 and finishing 15–17. Fan criticism had reached a crescendo and attendance at The Pit had been dropping significantly. First-year Athletic Director Paul Krebs announced before the end of the season that McKay would not return for the following season.\nSteve Alford (2007–2013).\nSteve Alford coached the Lobos for six seasons, compiling a 155–52 (.749) record with three NCAA tournament appearances, at least a share of four league titles, and two conference tournament championships. As a player Alford had been a prolific scorer and two-time All-American at Indiana, winning a national championship, and earning an Olympic gold medal with the U.S. national team. He had been a collegiate coach for 16 seasons, the previous eight at Iowa, amassing over 300 career wins.\nAn early objective for Alford was to change the culture of the program regarding discipline and academic focus. Under McKay, J.R. Giddens had frequently missed games due to disciplinary problems. Alford applied a strict regimen and Giddens responded with a standout senior season, leading the team with 16 points and nine rebounds a game. Six other players averaged between seven and ten points as balanced scoring became a hallmark of Lobo squads under Alford. The Lobos began the 2007–08 season 14–2 before losing four of six in league; they then won eight of nine to close out the regular season. They lost in the conference tournament but received a bid to the NIT, losing at Cal to finish 24–9, the most wins for a first-year Lobo coach to date. Giddens was named MWC Co-Player of the Year and received an AP All-American Honorable Mention. He was selected as the 30th pick in the first round of the 2008 NBA draft by Boston.\nThe 2008–09 Lobos mixed four veterans with young Alford recruits and were picked in the preseason to finish fifth in the MWC. Senior Tony Danridge led the unit with 15 points a game, though they again relied on balance and teamwork. The Lobos struggled to a 9–7 start before pulling together in league play, going 12–4 after winning their final five games to gain a share of the MWC title. They lost in the first round of the conference tournament, however, and were again relegated to the NIT, where they beat Nebraska but lost at Notre Dame, finishing the season 22–12. Danridge was named All-MWC, and Alford was tabbed MWC Coach of the Year.\nThe 2009–10 Lobos were again a young squad picked to finish fifth in the MWC in preseason polls. Versatile JC transfer Darington Hobson joined lone senior Roman Martinez, junior Dairese Gary, and eight sophomores and freshmen. The Lobos jumped out to a 12–0 start with wins over #25 Cal and #16 Texas A&amp;M, vaulting to #12 in the national rankings. After losing at Oral Roberts, they beat #20 Texas Tech and a Dayton squad that would go on to win the NIT. Hobson led the team with 16 points, nine rebounds, and 4.6 assists a game, the only Lobo to ever lead in all three. Martinez added 14 points and six rebounds a game, and Gary 13 points and four assists. The Lobos dropped their first two MWC games but then reeled off 15 straight wins – their second longest winning streak ever – sweeping #10 BYU. The Lobos rose to #8 in the polls and won the MWC title. They lost in the conference tournament but received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament. The team had relied heavily on its starters and was worn down with fatigue and injuries. They struggled to win against first round opponent Montana, and Hobson injured his wrist and back. In the second round the hobbled Lobos could not keep up with athletic, fast-breaking Washington. They finished 30–5, the most wins in a Lobo season, while going 10–2 in road games and 6–0 against ranked teams, also team highs. Alford was again named MWC Coach of the Year, and Gary was All-MWC. Hobson was named as MWC Player of the Year and a third-team All-American. He declared for the 2010 NBA draft and was selected in the second round by Milwaukee. Martinez was honored as an Academic All-American and received the NCAA Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award for outstanding character, leadership, integrity, and talent.\nThe early departure of Hobson left the Lobos with just one senior again in 2010–11: Gary led with 14 points and 5.5 assists a game, carrying the young team at times. He was joined by UCLA transfer Drew Gordon, who averaged 13 points and 10.5 rebounds, and the program's most successful freshman class to date, including starter Kendall Williams who scored 12 points a game. The Lobos began the season 10–1, but youth caught up to them in league play and they went .500 the rest of the way. They beat #3 BYU in Provo to sweep the regular season series but lost to the Cougars in the conference tournament. Gary injured his knee in the game, a sad career end for a four-year starter and steady leader. The Lobos went to the NIT and beat UTEP before losing at Alabama, finishing 22–13.\nGordon became a dominating inside presence in 2011–12, averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds, registering 19 double-doubles, and setting the Lobo season record for rebounds. Williams and fellow sophomore Tony Snell scored in double figures. The team played exceptional defense, allowing under 60 points per game, its fewest in the shot clock era, placing among national leaders in several categories. After two early losses, the Lobos won 13 straight en route to a 15–2 mark. They dropped a pair of league games but then won seven straight, winning at #13 San Diego State and trouncing #11 UNLV to take the league lead and climb into the national rankings at #18. Two road losses made them settle for a share of the regular season MWC title, but they again beat ranked SDSU and UNLV to secure the conference tournament championship, the first time they won both titles in a season. Gordon was named All-MWC and conference tourney MVP. The #21 Lobos received a five-seed in the NCAA tournament facing Long Beach State. Gordon had 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Williams added 16 with two late baskets to seal the win. Against four-seed Louisville, the Lobos took an early lead, fell behind by 15, then battled back to within two late in the game. Gordon had 21 points and 14 rebounds, but the team shot poorly from three-point range and could not overcome the deficit, finishing the season 28–7.\nThe 2012–13 Lobo squad was dominated by juniors and sophomores, though all were veteran contributors, including three returning starters. The team was again defense-oriented, surrendering just 60 points a game and grinding out close wins, frequently coming from behind. Williams, Snell, and center Alex Kirk led a balanced attack with seven players leading the team in scoring in individual games. The Lobos climbed to #16 with a 12–0 start, with a win over #19 Connecticut, before losing to NCAA tournament-bound South Dakota State; they won at #8 Cincinnati then lost at St Louis, which later reached #13. The Lobos' strength of schedule powered them to a #2 RPI ranking, and they won a program-record 15 games away from The Pit. The MWC enjoyed its best season to date with four teams achieving national rankings and five making the NCAA tournament. The Lobos lost on the road to ranked San Diego State and UNLV but beat both at home and won nine out of ten to clinch the league title. Williams hit a school-record 10 threes and scored 46 points at Colorado State, both MWC records. Snell paced the offense down the stretch, averaging 18 points a game and leading the Lobos to the MWC tournament championship. The Lobos were ranked #10 and received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament, facing Harvard, but they again turned in a disappointing performance. Kirk led with 22 points and 12 rebounds, but the team shot poorly and trailed most of the game as the Crimson answered Lobo runs with timely three-pointers to seal the upset. The Lobos finished the season 29–6, their second-best record ever. Williams was named MWC Player of the Year, and Alford was named Coach of the Year.\nThe day before the NCAA tournament began, UNM announced a 10-year contract extension with Alford; 10 days later, he resigned to take the head coaching position at UCLA. In the interim, Snell announced he was declaring for the NBA draft. The tournament upset and departures were disheartening blows for Lobo fans. Alford had led the program back to national prominence, attaining its best six-year stretch ever while improving academic achievement. The Lobo players and fan base rallied around long-time associate head coach Craig Neal, hoping to maintain continuity, and he was hired to replace Alford. Snell was selected by Chicago with the 20th pick in the first round of the NBA draft.\nCraig Neal (2013–2017).\nCraig Neal was associate head coach under Alford for three seasons at Iowa and six seasons at UNM before taking the Lobo helm. Neal played for Bobby Cremins at Georgia Tech, earning All-ACC honors as he set the conference record for assists in a season. He played professionally for eight seasons then coached in the NBA for eight more before joining Alford at Iowa.\nNeal inherited four returning starters for the 2013–14 season, joining seven newcomers. Senior Cameron Bairstow had a breakout season, averaging 20 points and seven rebounds a game, achieving one of the best single-season improvements in school history. Williams averaged 16 points and five assists, and Kirk added 13 points and nine rebounds. The Lobos began the season 7–1, beating Cincinnati, which later reached #7, but losing to Massachusetts, later #13; they lost to Kansas, which peaked at #2, but beat Marquette. The team struggled at times as the bench developed, suffering a pair of home upsets to leave them 12–4. They then won 12 of 13, including a win over #6 San Diego State to knot the MWC race, but they lost the title showdown at SDSU after squandering a large lead. The teams met again in the conference tournament final, and the Lobos prevailed for their third straight MWC tournament championship. They received a seven-seed in the NCAA tournament, facing Stanford. Following a familiar pattern, the Lobos fell behind early then battled back. Bairstow led with 24 points and eight rebounds, but the team shot poorly and their comeback fell short. The Lobos finished the season 27–7, Neal tallying the most wins ever for a first-year Lobo coach. Bairstow and Williams were named first team All-MWC; Kirk was third team. Bairstow was named second-team All-American by Sports Illustrated. Williams finished his career as the fifth leading scorer in Lobo history, third in assists, and the MWC career assists leader.\nOn April 1, 2017, Neal was dismissed as head coach after compiling a record of 76–52 (.594).\nPaul Weir (2017–2021).\nOn April 11, 2017, Paul Weir was named head coach of the Lobos. Before the 2017-2018 season started, 10 of the 15 players from the previous season either transferred, left the team, or graduated. In his first season, Weir posted a 19-15 record and finished in 3rd place in the Mountain West. They lost in the 2018 Mountain West Championship to San Diego State 82-75.\nIn the 2018-2019 season, Weir was reliant on four transfers from both Division 1 programs or junior college transfers, as well as returning senior Anthony Mathis. UNM finished the season 14-18 and in 7th place in the Mountain West. The highlight of the season was a 85-58 win over No. 6 Nevada in The Pit. UNM lost in the Mountain West Championship quarterfinals to Utah State.\nThe 2019-2020 started promising for the Lobos. With the help of transfers JaQuan Lyle, J.J. Caldwell, Carlton Bragg Jr., and Vance Jackson, UNM exploded to a 15-3 start. This was short lived, however, and the Lobos went 3-11 to finish out the season. There were a multitude of reasons for this. Carlton Bragg Jr. was accused of sexual assault and later arrested for a DWI in January 2020. He was dismissed from the team. J.J. Caldwell was also kicked off the team in January because of a domestic violence accusation. Also in January, JaQuan Lyle hosted a party at an Airbnb where two people were shot, one of which was a UNM female athlete. It was also later revealed that UNM basketball players were also at the party after a 22 point loss to Nevada, after they had taken a charter flight that night. Lyle had not traveled to Nevada because of a knee injury. UNM would lose in the quarterfinals to Utah State in the Mountain West Championship.\nThe 2020-2021 season was completely played out of New Mexico. UNM played their \"home\" games at various venues outside of New Mexico due to the restrictions against sports competitions from COVID-19 in New Mexico. They finished the season with an 6-16 record.\nUNM released a statement on February 26, 2021, they will part ways with Weir at the end of the 2020–21 season.\nRichard Pitino (2021–present).\nOn March 16, 2021, Richard Pitino was named the 22nd head coach of the Lobos. Pitino inherited 6 transfers, including a trio of Power-5 talent in Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr., and Gethro Muscadin. The Lobos started out 8-6 in the non-conference, including a win against in-state rival New Mexico State where the game was delayed due to a power outage at Pan American Center. In Mountain West play, however, the Lobos went 5-12. The highlight of the season was a 75-66 win over No. 22 Wyoming. They went on to lose in the first round in the Mountain West Championship against Nevada.\nThe Pit.\nEarly New Mexico basketball teams played in what became known as the Old Wooden Gym, where the walls were the out-of-bounds markers. In 1928 Coach Roy Johnson organized construction of Carlisle Gymnasium, seating about 1,500 spectators with later additions doubling that figure, and in 1957 Johnson Gymnasium opened, with a capacity of 7,800. The success of the Lobos under Bob King led to rapidly growing fan interest. Attendance doubled, Johnson Gym was soon selling out, and plans for a larger arena began to be developed.\nUniversity Arena opened in 1966 but was soon nicknamed \"The Pit\" due to its innovative subterranean design, with the playing floor 37 feet below street level. The Lobos have enjoyed exceptional success at The Pit, winning over 80 percent of their games and mounting home-winning streaks of over 20 games four times, with the longest of 41 straight in 1996–98. The Lobos have made 14 NCAA tournament appearances and 17 NIT appearances since the opening of the arena. In 1992 the basketball court at The Pit was named \"Bob King Court\" in honor of the coach who made its construction possible.\nAttendance at Lobo games in The Pit has consistently been among the national leaders in college basketball, averaging over 15,400 fans per game since it opened. The Lobos finished in the top five nationally in attendance 16 times in their first 20 years at The Pit, reaching second five times, and they were in the top ten all but one season through 2002. The design of the arena makes it one of the loudest venues in college basketball, creating a hostile playing environment for visitors. A study of decibel levels at collegiate basketball arenas found that a game at The Pit registered as the loudest at 118 decibels, comparable to a turbo-fan aircraft at takeoff power. Noise levels up to 125 decibels have been measured, close to the pain threshold for the human ear. Contributing to the intimidating environment for visitors is the mile high elevation of The Pit, emphasized to visiting teams with a message along the wall of the tunnel from the locker rooms down to the playing floor saying, \"Welcome to the legendary Pit, a mile high and louder than...\"\nThe Pit has garnered praise as one of the top venues in college basketball from sports reporters, announcers, and opposing coaches. Sports Illustrated listed The Pit among its Top 20 Sporting Venues of the 20th Century. Jim Boeheim, Lute Olson, and Steve Fisher have praised Lobo fans and the exciting atmosphere coaching at The Pit. Rick Majerus, who compiled a 5–11 record against the Lobos at The Pit, tying him with Don Haskins for most wins by a visiting coach, noted the intensity and dedication of Lobo fans and their knowledge of the game, The Pit hosted the 1983 NCAA Final Four, the last time the event was held on a college campus. North Carolina State upset heavily favored Houston in the memorable championship, sealing the victory with a last second basket. The video clip of NC State coach Jim Valvano celebrating at the end of the game documents one of the most famous moments in NCAA basketball history and is a staple of NCAA tournament television coverage.\nRenovations completed in 2010 added space and state-of-the-art amenities for fans and players. Luxury suites and club seats were added, along with digital video boards, expanded concourses, additional restrooms and concession stands, and upgraded training facilities, while preserving the historic character of the building. The upgrade reduced seating capacity to 15,411, trading some seating for greater comfort and amenities. The building facade was also transformed, adding extensive glasswork and a steel superstructure.\nNaming rights.\nIn December 2014, Albuquerque-based restaurant chain WisePies Pizza &amp; Salad purchased the naming rights for the arena, whose official name became \"WisePies Arena (aka The Pit)\". On April 27, 2017, UNM asked WisePies to relinquish the naming rights, per the terms of the agreement, and WisePies agreed to do so.\nOn May 3, 2017, UNM announced a $10 million naming rights agreement with Dreamstyle Remodeling, an Albuquerque-based construction business, covering both The Pit and the UNM football stadium. The official name of the facilities became Dreamstyle Arena and Dreamstyle Stadium.\nOn September 18, 2020, it was announced that the naming rights deal with Dreamstyle Remodeling was ending after only three years.\nTraditions.\nThe official mascot of the University of New Mexico is the \"Lobo\", the Spanish word for \"wolf\", adopted by the school in 1920. Human mascots, dubbed \"Lobo Louie and Lobo Lucy\", members of the cheerleading squad, roam The Pit during games rousing and entertaining fans. During the 1980s, a popular chant among Lobo fans was \"Everyone's a Lobo, Woof Woof Woof!\", coupled with a hand gesture emulating a wolf. It was phased out during the '90s but has since become the signature cheer for Lobo fans.\nAt the start of each half during Lobo games at The Pit, fans continue to stand and clap their hands until both teams score a basket, adding pressure on teams that struggle to score for long stretches. The student section in The Pit, Section 26, is particularly noteworthy for the antics of its raucous fans, taunting and intimidating opposing players, often with personal remarks, and offering enticing visuals for television broadcasters: They chant, jump up and down in unison, shake newspapers and signs to make noise and create distractions, and some dress in costumes and body paint. The noise level of the boisterous fans, the intimacy created by seating extending to the edge of the court, and the elevation contribute to what Coach Dave Bliss termed \"a Pit game.\"\nThe Lobo Howl is an event held initially on midnight of the first day the NCAA allows teams to practice. Over the years it has evolved into a family-like atmosphere held during the evening, including player introductions, practice drills and scrimmages, three-point shooting and slam dunk contests, and other festivities. Student-athletes from both men's and women's squads participate and sign autographs for fans, and the event is used to attract recruits invited to attend. The 2013 Howl drew over 10,000 fans and featured the introduction of new coach Craig Neal, who entered the arena on his motorcycle.\nSportscaster Mike Roberts was the \"Voice of the Lobos\" on KKOB radio in Albuquerque from 1966 to 2008, becoming an icon among Lobo fans. He was an integral part of the Lobo fan experience, especially before most games were televised. Roberts noted the noise level in The Pit as a challenge for a broadcaster: \"There were a lot of times when I knew I was calling the game because my lips were moving, but I couldn't hear a thing I said.\" Many fans were disappointed and outraged when Roberts was dismissed by KKOB in 2008. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson declared May 8, 2008 as \"Mike Roberts Appreciation Day\" in honor of the sportscaster. In 1999, Roberts was inducted into the University of New Mexico Athletic Hall of Honor by the Alumni Lettermen's Association and received the Distinguished Service Award. Roberts was also inducted into the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.\nAthletic conferences.\nThe Lobos compete in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in NCAA Division I, joining as a founding member in 1999. The Lobos won the MWC regular season championship in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, and they won the conference tournament in 2005, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nIn 1931, Lobo athletic teams began competing in the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, joining as a founding member along with other regional schools. The Lobos won the conference basketball championship in 1944 and 1945, seasons with shortened schedules due to World War II. UNM left the Border Conference in 1951 to join the Mountain States Conference, then known as the Skyline Eight.\nIn 1962, the Lobos became a founding member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). They led the WAC in overall winning percentage over the 17-season span from 1962 to 1979, posting a won-loss record of 328–161 (.671). The Lobos won the WAC regular season championship in 1964, 1968, 1974, 1978, and 1994, and they won the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996. The Lobos and seven other conference members left the WAC to form the MWC in 1999.\nCoaching records.\nPre-Bob King era.\nThe following table summarizes the records and accomplishments of the coaches before Bob King.\n\"Notes:\"\nConference Season Championships (11: 5 WAC, 4 MWC, 2 Border)\nConference Tournament Championships (7: 5 MWC, 2 WAC)\nNCAA Tournament Appearances (16: 8–17 record)\n20-win seasons (27)\n30-win seasons (1)\nIndividual and team records.\nIndividual and team records are published in detail in the 2013–14 Lobo Media Guide.\nNational rankings.\nThe Lobos attained their first national ranking in the 1964–65 season, reaching #10 in the AP poll. They spent about half of the 1966–67 season in the top six nationally, reaching #3, their highest ranking ever. They were ranked in the top ten for much of the 1967–68 season, peaking at #4, and they were in the top 20 most of the following season. They were ranked for much of the 1973–74 season, reaching #8, and again in 1977–78 when they peaked at #5. They were ranked briefly in 1988 and 1993, then throughout 1996 to 1999. They have been regularly ranked from the 2009–10 through the 2013–14 seasons.\nPost-season results.\nWestern Athletic Conference tournament.\nThe Lobos compiled a 22–14 record in WAC conference tournaments, reaching the final six times and winning the championship twice.\nMountain West Conference tournament.\nThe Lobos have compiled a 20–11 record in MWC tournaments, reaching the final seven times and winning the championship five times.\nNCAA tournament.\nNew Mexico has a history of disappointing performances in the NCAA tournament, suffering noteworthy upsets in 1968, 1978, 1993, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The Lobos have made 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament, compiling an overall record of 8–17.\nNIT.\nThe Lobos have appeared in 20 National Invitation Tournaments with a combined record of 18–21.\nNAIA.\nThe Lobos appeared in the NAIA Basketball tournament one time with a record of 0–1."

        "title": "1966 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification was a series of tournaments organised by the five FIFA confederations. The 1966 FIFA World Cup featured 16 teams with one place reserved for the host nation, England, and one reserved for defending champions Brazil. The remaining 14 places were determined by a qualification process in which the other 72 entered teams, from the five FIFA confederations, competed. UEFA, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL qualification was determined within the confederations, whilst AFC and CAF teams (alongside Australia) competed for one place at the tournament.\nOf these 72 teams, 51 competed, while Guatemala, Congo-Brazzaville and the Philippines had their entries rejected.\nIn the Africa/Asia/Oceania zone:\nThe first qualification match, between Netherlands and Albania, was played on 24 May 1964 and the first goal in qualification was a penalty, scored by Dutch defender Daan Schrijvers. Qualification ended on 29 December 1965, when Bulgaria eliminated Belgium in a group tiebreaker to become the final qualifier for the World Cup.\nThere were 393 goals scored over 127 games, for an average of 3.09 goals per game and 51 teams played in qualification.\nQualification process.\nThe 16 spots available in the 1966 World Cup were distributed among the continental zones as follows:\nUEFA, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF had a guaranteed number of places, whereas the CAF and AFC had to contest a play-off to determine which confederation would be represented.\nAfter the first round of 1966 FIFA World Cup finals, the percentage of teams from each confederation that passed through to the quarter-finals was as follows:\nTiebreakers.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a league format, the method used for separating teams level on points was the same for all Confederations. If teams were even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams played a play-off at a neutral ground.\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC, CAF and Oceania.\n21 teams – Australia, three teams from AFC and 17 teams from CAF – applied to take part in qualification, but the entries of Congo-Brazzaville and the Philippines were rejected.\nSouth Africa, who had been expelled from CAF in 1958 due to the country's apartheid policies, were placed with the Asian and Oceanian teams. Also, Australia were not a member of a confederation at the time (the OFC was not founded until 1966).\nThe qualification process began with four national teams split between two sections for qualification: Israel and Syria competed in European qualification for geographical reasons, whilst North Korea and South Korea were in a group with Australia and South Africa. The winner of this group would then go on to play the three group winners from the second round of CAF qualifiers.\nHowever, South Africa was disqualified after being suspended by FIFA, and all 15 members of CAF withdrew in protest after FIFA, citing competitive and logistical issues, confirmed that there would be no direct qualification for an African team. Less than three weeks before the tournament, South Korea were forced to withdraw due to logistical difficulties after the tournament was moved from Japan to Cambodia.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAfrican boycott.\nQualification for the 15 remaining African teams saw them sorted into six groups: three groups of two and three groups of three. \nThe winners of these groups were then to play a two-legged tie in the following combinations: Group 1 winners v Group 5 winners, Group 2 winners v Group 4 winners and Group 3 winners v Group 6 winners, with the winners advancing to play in the final group with each other and the winner of the Asia/Oceania group.\nHowever, these African nations were aggrieved that their second-round winners would be required to enter a final round against the winners of the Asia/Oceania group in order to qualify for the final tournament. These nations demanded that Africa be represented in the tournament, and also objected to the readmission of South Africa to FIFA.\nDue to pressure from the African nations and CAF, South Africa was suspended again on 21 September 1964, and were subsequently disqualified. However, after FIFA declined to change the qualifying format or the allocation of places, citing competitive and logistical issues, all fifteen African teams immediately withdrew in protest: subsequently, CAF informed FIFA that they would refuse to participate in qualifying for 1970 unless at least one African team had an automatic place in the World Cup. \nIn 1968, FIFA unanimously voted to grant an automatic place for CAF from the 1970 World Cup onwards.\nCONCACAF.\n10 teams initially entered, but the entry of Guatemala was rejected.\nThe remaining nine teams were placed in to three groups of three, with the winner of each group proceeding to a final group. The winner of this group would go on to the final tournament.\nCONMEBOL.\nAs Brazil has already qualified as reigning champions, the remaining nine CONMEBOL teams were split into three groups of 3, playing each other twice (home and away). The top team from each group qualified.\nFinal positions (group stage).\nIn Group B, Chile and Ecuador finished level on points, and a play-off on neutral ground was played to decide who would qualify. Chile won the match to win the group.\nUEFA.\nEngland qualified automatically as hosts and a further 30 European teams took part in qualification. They were joined by Israel and Syria, although Syria then withdrew in support of the African teams. The teams were divided into 9 groups - four groups of 3 and five groups of 4. Syria's withdrawal meant that group 9 only contained two teams.\nFinal positions (group stage).\nIn Group 1, Belgium and Bulgaria finished level on points, and a play-off on neutral ground was played to decide who would qualify. Bulgaria won the match 2–1.\nIn Group 9, the Republic of Ireland and Spain finished level on points, and a play-off on neutral ground was played to decide who would qualify. Spain won the match 1–0."

        "text": "Leonard James Russell (born November 17, 1969) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

        "title": "Major League Baseball rosters",
        "text": "A Major League Baseball roster is a list of players who are allowed, by league agreement, to play for a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. Each MLB team maintains two rosters: an active roster of players eligible to participate in an MLB game, and an expanded roster encompassing the active roster plus additional reserve players.\nBeginning with the , the active roster size is 26 players, and the expanded roster size is 40 players (the expanded roster is commonly referred to as the \"40-man roster\"). Historically, the active roster size was 25 players, with exceptions made in some seasons, most recently in 2020 when teams could have 28 active players.\nActive roster.\nSince 1910, when teams were first allowed to carry players under contract in excess of those allowed to participate in regular season games, the latter has been called the \"active roster.\" With exceptions through the years for varying economic conditions (primarily during World War I, the Great Depression, post-World War II, and from 1986 to 1989 when the limit was set at 24 because of rising player salaries), the active roster has allowed up to 25 players to participate for a Major League team within specified dates, currently Opening Day to September 1. In 1968, the 25-player maximum for active rosters was made a part of the first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the major leagues and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). Starting in 1977, teams were required to carry a minimum of 24 players on their active rosters as well.\nActive rosters include the starting nine position players, pitchers, and reserve players on the team. Players on the active roster are also on the 40-man roster. These players are generally the only ones who dress in uniform and are the only ones who may take the field in a game at any time.\nTypically, in modern-day play, an active roster will consist of five starting pitchers, eight relief pitchers, two catchers, six infielders, and five outfielders. Teams can vary this somewhat according to preference and circumstance, and indeed the \"typical\" roster makeup has changed somewhat over the years. (Starting rotations used to consist of four pitchers, not five, well into the 1970s; third-string catchers used to be much more common; many other minor variations exist.) A full-time designated hitter (DH) is usually classified as either an infielder or an outfielder, not a DH, because most DHs do play defensive positions from time to time.\nSince 2012, teams have been allowed to carry one additional active player for \"day-night\" doubleheaders – two games scheduled on the same day, but with the stadium cleared between games, and separate tickets sold for each game – as long as the doubleheaders have been scheduled with at least 48 hours of advance notice. Teams are also allowed an additional active player for games played at neutral sites, such as the MLB Little League Classic.\nChanges made in 2020.\nOn March 14, 2019, MLB and the MLBPA reached an agreement on midterm changes to the then-current CBA, with the changes officially unveiled on February 12, 2020. Two significant changes were announced, which were planned to take effect during the 2020 season:\n26-man roster.\nUnder the agreement, teams would be allowed 26-man active rosters from the start of the season through August 31, as well as the postseason. From September 1 to the end of the regular season, two additional players (28 total) would be active. Teams would be limited to carrying 13 pitchers, except from September 1 to the end of the regular season, when this limit would increase to 14. Prior conditions that allowed an extra active player (such as day-night doubleheaders) would persist, with the extra player not counting against the limit for pitchers.\nRestrictions on position players pitching.\nThe agreement also introduced a playing rule placing severe limits on pitching by position players. Each team must designate players as either \"position players\" or \"pitchers\" before the start of the season, and that designation cannot be changed during the season. Only players who are designated as \"pitchers\" will be allowed to pitch in any regular-season or postseason game, with the following exceptions:\nA player earns two-way status by satisfying both of the following criteria, in either the current season or the immediately preceding season:\nFor the 2020 season only, a player who met the above qualifications in either 2018 or 2019 would be considered a two-way player.\nDelayed implementation.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the , the planned changes were deferred. Teams were allowed to begin the shortened season with 30 active players, and were allowed to have 28 active players from early August through the postseason.\nFor the , the 26-man active roster size took effect; however, the roster limit of 13 pitchers was waived, as were restrictions on position players pitching. The 13-pitcher limit, two-way player rule, and restrictions on position players pitching finally went into effect during the .\nExpanded roster.\nAlso called the \"40-man roster\", the expanded roster is composed of all the players in a Major League club's organization who are signed to a major-league contract. The 40-man roster limit has been in effect since 1921, except for 1945 and 1946 when it was raised to 48 to accommodate veterans returning from military service in World War II, from 1962 to 1965 when it was raised to 41 to add a reserve spot for first-year players acquired before implementation of a player draft was approved prior to the 1965 season, and in 1994 for a strike that canceled the remainder of that season.\nThe expanded roster includes all players who are eligible for call-up to the active roster at any given time. Also on the 40-man roster are any players on the 10-day (for position players) or 15-day (for pitchers) injured list (known as the \"disabled list\" prior to the 2019 season) and minor league players who are signed to a major-league contract but are on an \"optional assignment\" to the minors (each player has three \"option years\" to be sent to the minors once on the expanded roster before he must be placed on waivers to be sent there). A player who is on the 40-man roster but is later placed on the 60-day injured list is removed from the 40-man roster until his time on the injured list is over. The same applies to players who are suspended. Because players on the 60-day injured list are taken off the 40-man roster with no risk of losing the player, MLB teams often transfer injured players from the 10-day or 15-day injured lists to the 60-day injured list so that the team can add another player to the 40-man roster without having to put a player through the designated for assignment (DFA) process. DFA is the removal of a player from the expanded roster; the team has seven days to trade the player, release him, or send him to the minor leagues.\nSeptember call-ups.\nSeptember call-ups are players who, historically, were added to MLB rosters late in the season.\nHistorical practice.\nThrough the 2019 season, every MLB team's roster expanded on September 1 from the 25-man active roster to the entire 40-man roster. Thus, any player on the expanded roster on September 1 or later could play for the MLB team through the end of the regular season.\nSeptember call-ups were often younger players who were being given major league experience and, especially for teams in playoff contention, players who could provide positional depth, such as a third catcher or additional relief pitchers. In practice, teams usually did not have the entire 40-man roster on hand for games; typically, clubs would have about six additional players available over the usual limit of 25. There were exceptions – for example; during the 2018 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies used their full rosters, and in 2019 the Boston Red Sox carried 36 players (including 21 pitchers). In 2003, the Montreal Expos were leading the National League wild card race, and in what many people deemed to be a conflict of interest, Major League Baseball, which owned the Expos at the time, refused to allow them to call any players up, claiming they could not afford the additional expenses.\nDuring the final years of the 40-man active roster, one perceived problem was that teams were allowed to carry any number of players between 25 and 40 on their September rosters. Shortly after the decision to curtail September roster expansion was announced, former Milwaukee Brewers general manager Doug Melvin, who had advocated changes to September roster rules for more than a decade, made the following remarks to a \"USA Today\" writer: I think people got sick of me talking about it, but it was about the integrity of the game... It got to be such a huge imbalance. It would be one thing if teams just had a couple of more players than the other team in September, but we were seeing differences by more than 10 players a game. To me, it was destroying the integrity of it. No other sport has uneven rosters at any point in the season, and we were doing it [in] the pennant race.\nCurrent practice.\nFrom 2020 forward, expanding the active roster late in the season so it is equivalent to the expanded roster has been eliminated. Each team is still allowed to have up to 40 players under major-league contracts, and active rosters are now normally 26 players, with a limited expansion – to 28 players – from September 1 through the end of the regular season. Additionally, all teams are now required to have 28 players on their active rosters after August 31 – they cannot carry a lower number of players. Adjustments to these limits may be implemented by MLB, such as during the delayed and shortened 2020 season, when teams were allowed to begin the season with 30 players on their active rosters.\nPostseason roster.\nA postseason roster takes effect only if a team clinches a playoff berth. Players who are part of the team's final roster at the end of the regular season are eligible to participate in the postseason. Any player who has been traded from a different team, spent time in the Minor Leagues, or signed later in the season with the team (no later than August 31) is eligible to participate in the postseason; players who are suspended for drug use are not allowed to participate in the postseason. From 2020, a postseason roster is allowed up to 26 active players (up from 25 through 2019), with a maximum of 13 pitchers (new for 2020); qualifying two-way players do not count against the limit on pitchers. Other players who are not on the 26-man active roster will be assigned to the postseason secondary squad. Players who are on the injured list or any other non-active transaction by the end of the regular season will have their transactions passed on in the postseason. Rosters for a series are set at the beginning of the series and no changes to the 26-man active roster are allowed except when a player is moved to the injured list or any other inactive transaction. If a player is moved to the injured list or another inactive transaction during a series, he then becomes ineligible to be returned to the 26-man active roster for the remainder of the series as well as the next series if applicable. If any player goes on any inactive transaction, any player from the 40-man roster can be promoted to the 26-man active roster for the remainder of the series if applicable.\nFor a player to be eligible for the postseason active roster, he must have either been on his club's expanded roster or injured list as of midnight (ET) on August 31 of that year and not placed on the 60-day injured list after August 1. The one exception is for replacing players on the injured list. Since the 2014 season, an injured player eligible for postseason play may be replaced by any player within his club's organization, including players assigned to the club's minor league affiliates who are not on the major league 40-man roster. Prior to 2014, only players who were on a club's 40-man roster (including those added to the expanded roster after August 31, who would not otherwise be eligible for the postseason) at the conclusion of the regular season were eligible to replace injured players on postseason rosters. The 2015 Kansas City Royals were the first club to exploit this new provision when they added Adalberto Mondesí – who at the time was assigned to the Royals' Double-A affiliate and was not on the 40-man roster – to their World Series roster.\nNon-roster players.\nAll other professional players affiliated with Major League Baseball are signed to minor-league contracts. They can receive an invitation to spring training with their organization's Major League team without being on the 40-man roster. Two types of players generally receive a non-roster invitation: prospect players who are there to gain experience and face tougher competition as well as receive instruction from the Major League team's coaching staff; and veteran players who were not offered any major league contract by a club. The veteran player is usually signed to a \"two-way\" salary option – one for their time in the minors and another if they are placed on the 40-man during the season. All spring training invitees are under some sort of contract, to avoid liability if an injury were to occur to the player.\nAll-Star roster.\nSince 1933, an annual Major League Baseball All-Star Game has been played at approximately the mid-point of each season, except for 1945 and 2020. The game features an American League team versus a National League team. The number of players on All-Star rosters has varied; since 2010, there are 34 players on each league's roster."

        "title": "John O'Neill (rugby league)",
        "text": "John O'Neill (9 May 1943 – 9 August 1999) was an Australian representative rugby league whose club career was spent with South Sydney and Manly-Warringah during the 1960s and early 1970s. He made 2 Test appearances for the Australian national representative side; represented in 7 World Cup matches in two World Cups and in one World Championship match; and played in 5 Kangaroo tour matches in 1973.\nEarly life and club career.\nBorn in Griffith but reared in the northern town of Gunnedah, in his early twenties John O'Neill showed promise in appearances for Country against both City and the French tourists and was spotted by Sydney premiership talent scouts 1964.\nO'Neill came to South Sydney in 1965 and his aggressive play in the scrums and charging runs close to the rucks caused him to be noticed. His toughness and solidity earned him the nickname \"Lurch\", and in his debut season O'Neill played for South Sydney in the Grand final against the champion St George team. A tall and strongly framed man, O'Neill was able to develop consistently as he built up his weight from in 1965 to by 1970. Between 1967 and 1971 he played in five grand finals for South Sydney, winning all but the 1969 contest against Balmain.\nIn 1971 the financial problems at South Sydney caused him along with teammate Ray Branighan to leave for Manly until the end of 1974. There O'Neill played in two more premiership sides, and his battle with Cronulla strongman Cliff Watson in the brutal 1973 grand final (won by Manly 10–7) is regarded as one of the toughest conflicts seen in the Australian game.\nRepresentative career.\nO'Neill first played for New South Wales in 1967, and made his international debut in the 1970 World Cup. It was in this match that his remarkable strength in the toughest conflicts first showed itself. He continued to hit opponents in a way that would have been remarkable for anyone with a split shin, and refused to take first aid even when blood spilt into his sock! John O'Neill remained a regular international player until he retired, He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 449.\nIn 1975, still a major force in representative rugby league, O'Neill returned to South Sydney. Paradoxically, though he was superb in representative games, he was disappointing in club rugby league and retired during the 1976 season. O'Neill coached South Sydney in 1977 but could win only one of the last eighteen games and he stood down.\nDuring his playing days, O'Neill had developed a highly profitable building business with his Rabbitoh teammate Gary Stevens, which by 1977 would prevent him from devoting his attention fully to coaching. In the 1980s, he used the profits from this business to build a home at Lake Conjola.\nDeath and accolades.\nIn 1995, after being named in Australia's best rugby league team since the limited tackle rule was introduced, O'Neill was diagnosed with cancer. He fought a long battle, but died on 9 August 1999 at the age of 56. It is estimated that 4,000 people attended his funeral, showing the respect in which he was held.\nIn 1990, O'Neill was named in the front row for Manly in their best team from 1947 to 1990. Later in 2006 he was named in the front row for Manly's 60th anniversary \"Dream Team\".\nIn 2004 he was named by Souths in their \"South Sydney Dream Team\", consisting of 17 players and a coach representing the club from 1908 through to 2004.In February 2008, O'Neill was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia."

        "text": "The Electronic Sports World Convention (ESWC) (formerly known as Electronic Sports World Cup) was an international professional gaming championship. Every year, winners of national qualifier events around the world earned the right to represent their country in the ESWC Finals. \nThe ESWC was originally created by a French company, Ligarena, that had previously hosted smaller local area network (LAN) events in France under the name of LAN Arena. In 2003, Ligarena decided to do something on a larger scale and the ESWC was born. In 2005, Ligarena became Games-Services.\nIn 2009, ESWC was bought by another French company, Games-Solution, which became the owner of the brand.\nIn 2012, Oxent, an agency specialising in electronic sports, acquired the ESWC.\nThe grand finals and masters of ESWC have had a total prize purse of €1,721,000 between 2003 and 2010.\nIn October 2023, the ESWC brand was acquired by the Esports World Cup Foundation.\nOverview.\nThe first Electronic Sports World Cup was held in 2003 with a total of 358 participants from 37 countries and a prize purse of €150,000. To participate in the tournament, competitors had to place in their country's national qualifier. By 2006, the event had grown to 547 qualified participants from 53 countries and had a prize purse of $400,000 US. The event also featured the first competition with a game specifically made for it: \"TrackMania Nations\".\n2003.\nThe 2003 ESWC saw around 150,000 players narrowed down to just 358 players, from 37 different countries, who attended the finals at the Futuroscope near Poitiers in France. The total prize fund for the event was €156,000.\n2004.\nThe 2004 finals were once again held at the Futuroscope. Roughly 400 finalists, from 41 countries, attended to compete for a €210,000 prize purse.\n2005.\nIn 2005, the venue was moved to a larger facility: The Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. The total prize payout was again raised - this time to €300,000.\n2006.\nThe 2006 event took place at the Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy and the total prize payout was approximately €300,000.\n2007.\nThe 2007 ESWC took place at the Paris expo Porte de Versailles, Paris, from July 5 to July 8. There was a complete expo for this event, called \"Mondial du Gaming\" (World of Gaming).\n750 finalists, from 51 countries, competed for a prize purse of $180,000 US.\n2008.\nLeaving France for the first time, the 2008 Electronic Sports World Cup took place in San Jose, California, USA, from August 25 to August 27 during the bigger \"NVISION 08\" event. The disciplines announced were: \"Counter-Strike\" (open and female), \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\", \"Trackmania Nations Forever\", \"Defense of the Ancients\" and, \"Quake 3\". \"Pro Evolution Soccer\" was not included because the global Konami authority had not given its support to the competition. The prize purse was approximately $200,000 US.\nMasters of Paris.\nIn place of the ESWC, the \"Masters of Paris\" was held from July 4 to July 6, during the \"Mondial du Gaming\", taking place at the Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy. The same disciplines took place during this Masters and offered additional qualifying slots for ESWC Grand Final in San Jose. All winners won a slot to participate in the ESWC Grand Final, and hotel accommodation in San Jose, free of charge.\nMasters of Athens.\n\"Masters of Athens\" was held from October 17 to October 18, 2008, during the Athens Digital Week. Disciplines featured were \"Quake III\" and \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\". The tournament had a $30.000 prize purse, and the champion qualified for ESWC 2009.\n2010.\nThe 2010 \"Electronic Sports World Cup\", which took place at Disneyland Paris, featured a €213,500 prize purse. Games Solution (or DIP-Organisation) took over the ESWC in 2010.\n2011.\nThis event marked the transitional replacement and additions of several cornerstone tournament titles. This included the replacement of \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\" with \"\", as well as the replacement of \"Defense of the Ancients\" with \"Dota 2\". Additionally, this event marked the first and only year in which \"Counter-Strike: Source\" was present. It was also the last year that would include \"Counter-Strike 1.6\", which was the main attraction of the tournament for many years, and the last remaining game that had been featured in the inaugural ESWC event.\nMedal Tally.\nThroughout the ESWC finals the medal tally is as follows (as of ESWC 2014):"

        "title": "Four Horsemen (American football)",
        "text": "The Four Horsemen of Notre Dame comprised a group of American football players at the University of Notre Dame under coach Knute Rockne. They were the backfield of Notre Dame's 1924 football team. The players that made up this group were Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.\nIn 1924, a nickname coined by sportswriter Grantland Rice and the actions of a student publicity aide transformed the Notre Dame backfield of Stuhldreher, Crowley, Miller, and Layden into one of the most noted groups of collegiate athletes in football history, the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame.\nQuarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim Crowley, right halfback Don Miller, and fullback Elmer Layden had run rampant through Irish opponents' defenses since coach Knute Rockne devised the lineup in 1922 during their sophomore season. During the three-year tenure of the Four Horsemen, Notre Dame lost only two games; one each in 1922 and 1923, both to Nebraska in Lincoln before packed houses.\nNaming.\nGrantland Rice, sportswriter for the \"New York Herald Tribune\", gave the foursome football immortality. After Notre Dame's 13–7 upset victory over a strong Army team, on October 18, 1924, Rice penned \"the most famous football lede of all-time\":\nGeorge Strickler, then Rockne's student publicity aide and later sports editor of the \"Chicago Tribune\", made sure the name stuck. He had pitched the idea out loud at the halftime of the Army game in the press box as a tie in to the 1921 Rudolph Valentino movie \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\" After the team arrived back in South Bend, he posed the four players, dressed in their uniforms, on the backs of four horses from a livery stable in town. The wire services picked up the now-famous photo, and the legendary status of the Four Horsemen was assured.\n\"At the time, I didn't realize the impact it would have,\" Crowley said later. \"But the thing just mushroomed. After the splurge in the press, the sports fans of the nation got interested in us along with other sportswriters. Our record helped, too. If we'd lost a couple. I don't think we would have been remembered.\"\nAfter that win over Army, Notre Dame's third straight victory of the young season, the Irish were rarely threatened the rest of the year. A 27–10 win over Stanford in the 1925 Rose Bowl gave Rockne and Notre Dame the national championship and a 10–0 record.\nAs it usually is with legends, the Four Horsemen earned their spot in gridiron history. Although none of the four stood taller than six feet or weighed more than 162 pounds, they played 30 games as a unit and only lost to one team, Nebraska, twice. They played at a time when there were no separate offensive and defensive teams. All players had to play both sides. Once a player left the field, he could not come back into the game.\nBackgrounds.\nStuhldreher, a 5'7\", 151-pounder from Massillon, Ohio, was a self-assured leader who could throw accurately, return punts, and block. He emerged as the starting signal caller four games into his sophomore season in 1922. \nCrowley, who came to Notre Dame in 1921 from Green Bay, Wisconsin, stood 5'11\" and weighed 162 pounds. Known as \"Sleepy Jim\" for his drowsy-eyed appearance, Crowley outmaneuvered many defenders with his shifty ball carrying.\nMiller, a native of Defiance, Ohio, followed his three brothers to Notre Dame. At 5'11\", 160 pounds, he proved to be the team's breakaway threat. According to Rockne, Miller was the greatest open-field runner he ever coached.\nLayden, the fastest of the quartet, became the Irish defensive star with his timely interceptions and handled the punting chores. The 6-foot, 162-pounder from Davenport, Iowa, boasted excellent speed in the 40-yard dash.\nLater lives.\nAfter graduation, the lives of the Four Horsemen took similar paths. All began coaching careers, with three of the four occupying top positions. As players, the four reunited for one game for the Hartford Blues in 1925 (Stuldreher was already playing for the team that year); the Blues, however, lost 13–6 to the Cleveland Bulldogs. Two of the four, Layden and Stuhldreher, were the namesakes of the professional Brooklyn Horsemen team for whom they played in 1926.\nLayden coached at his alma mater for seven years and compiled a 47–13–3 record. He also served as athletic director at Notre Dame and later as commissioner of the National Football League. After a business career in Chicago, Layden died in 1973 at the age of 70.\nCrowley started as an assistant coach at the University of Georgia. He quickly moved to head coaching positions at Michigan State University and Fordham University, where his famed line, the \"Seven Blocks of Granite,\" included Vince Lombardi. His Fordham teams played in the Cotton Bowl Classic and Sugar Bowl. His overall record was 78–21–10. Crowley also served as commissioner of the All-America Football Conference. He later entered business in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The last surviving Horseman, Crowley died in 1986 at the age of 83.\nStuhldreher, who died in 1965 at the age of 63, was the head football coach for 11 years at Villanova University, then became athletic director and football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He later worked for U.S. Steel.\nMiller left coaching after four years each at Georgia Tech and The Ohio State University. He began practicing law in Cleveland. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for Northern Ohio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Miller died in 1979 at the age of 77.\nAll four players were elected to the College Football Hall of Fame — Layden in 1951, Stuhldreher in 1958, Crowley in 1966, and Miller in 1970. In 1998, the United States Postal Service honored the Four Horsemen with their own stamp as part of 15 commemorative postage stamps saluting \"The Roaring Twenties\" which was part of their Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.\nThe Seven Mules.\nAfter the Horsemen got their name, the Notre Dame line was nicknamed the \"Seven Mules\" to emphasize their crucial but less glamorous function. Two members of the line are also in the College Football Hall of Fame. Adam Walsh, from Hollywood, California, was the starting center and team captain. In later years, he coached at Santa Clara University and Bowdoin College and for the Cleveland/Los Angeles Rams. Walsh died in 1985. Edgar Miller was a tackle from Canton, Ohio. He later coached at the United States Naval Academy and died in 1991. Thus, a total of six members of the 1924 Notre Dame team have been elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. Yet another of the \"Mules\" was Joe Bach who went on to a coaching career that included two stints as head coach of the . Another Mule was George Vergara who later played for the Green Bay Packers and his career ended with a neck injury. Later he became the Mayor of New Rochelle, New York."

        "text": "Brian Lee (born March 26, 1987) is an American former professional ice hockey player. Lee played in the National Hockey League with the Ottawa Senators, who drafted him in the first round, ninth overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Originally considered one of the top defensive prospects, Lee had a solid NHL career but arguably did not live up to expectations of the 9th overall draft selection, only playing in 209 career NHL games.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nBrian Lee grew up in Moorhead, Minnesota, and was a stand out player for the Moorhead High School Spuds hockey team. In 2004–05, Lee played junior hockey for the Lincoln Stars of the United States Hockey League (USHL) and had an outstanding season. For his season, he was selected Minnesota's Mr. Hockey as the number one player in Minnesota high school boys hockey in 2005. He was also named the Associated Press' Player of the Year for Minnesota prep boys hockey that year. That year, his senior year, he was one of the few high school players to play for Team USA in the World Junior Hockey Championships.\nCollege.\nLee chose to attend the University of North Dakota and played for the college team for two years. Lee would play for the US at the 2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nOttawa Senators.\nIn the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, the Ottawa Senators drafted Lee in the first round, 9th overall. Lee made his professional hockey debut in the 2007–08 NHL season. Ottawa then assigned him to their AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, after training camp. Lee was named to the AHL All-Star Game roster in the 2007–08 season. Lee made his NHL regular season debut on March 25, 2008, against the Buffalo Sabres at HSBC Arena in a 6–3 win for Ottawa.\nLee played in 6 games with Ottawa in 2007–08 and in 5 games in 2008–09 before being reassigned to Binghamton for development on October 22, 2008. He was later recalled and finished the season with Ottawa, recording 13 points in 53 NHL games and assuming a more defensive role.\nFollowing the training camp for the 2009–10 season, Lee was once again assigned to Binghamton, while AHL veteran Matt Carkner and newcomer Erik Karlsson remained with Ottawa. Lee's agent stated that Lee was \"shocked and surprised that he's not among Ottawa's top-six defencemen.\"\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nOn February 27, 2012, Lee was traded by the Senators to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Matt Gilroy. In the following 2012–13 season, on May 17, 2013, while playing with the Syracuse Crunch during the American Hockey League Eastern Conference semifinals against the Springfield Falcons, Lee suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament which required surgery, and he opened the 2013–14 NHL season on Tampa Bay's long-term injured reserve list. Lee was not re-signed by the Lightning at the end of his contract and became an unrestricted free agent.\nOn December 12, 2014, Lee announced his retirement from professional hockey. Lee had attended training camp with the Nashville Predators in early October, and said he felt good. However, he started having pain in his knee. This stemmed from the same knee injury that he had two corrective surgeries on. Lee stated that he is planning on studying nursing at North Dakota State and anesthesiology at the University of North Dakota. Lee played a total of 209 NHL games with the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning. During that time he scored 5 goals, and 31 assists. Lee stated that he still wants to be around hockey and looks forward to being able to give back to the community.\nPersonal information.\nBrian's brother, John, played NCAA Division I ice hockey with the University of Denver. John was selected by the Florida Panthers in the 5th round (131st overall) of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft."

        "text": "Anthony Bernard Carter (born June 16, 1975) is an American basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Memphis Grizzlies. He played college basketball for Saddleback College and Hawaii.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Kirkwood, GA, Carter played as a freshman on the varsity team of Alonzo A. Crim High School in Atlanta. However, after his freshman year, Carter quit high school. After leaving school, Carter spent his teenage years playing basketball for money in Atlanta. The \"Rocky Mountain News\" quoted Carter stating: \"The dope man would put up the money, and we would play. We used to play for the drug dealers. That's how we were going to make our money. We didn't sell the drugs ... (I used the money) to buy shoes and food. That was the only way we could eat.\" During his teenage years, Carter's mother was on drugs, and all seven of his uncles were at one point in prison.\nRealizing Carter's basketball skills could earn him an education, several members of Carter's community helped him get a GED and enroll in college.\nCollege career.\nCarter played collegiately at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, California (1994–96), then went on to play at the University of Hawaii. At UH, Carter became the Rainbows' career leader in assist average and one of only 10 players to reach 1,000 points.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 1998 NBA draft, he began his NBA career with the Miami Heat, after having spent one season with CBA's Yakima Sun Kings.\nIn 2003, Carter's agent failed to notify the Heat that Carter wished to exercise a $4.1 million player option on his contract by the June 30 deadline. The failure allowed the team to renounce their rights to Carter, opening up cap space that was later used to sign Lamar Odom.\nCarter later signed with the San Antonio Spurs. However, after only five games, the Spurs waived him due to injury, and he remained inactive throughout 2003–04.\nAfter two relatively uneventful seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves (2004–06), on April 12, 2007, the Denver Nuggets signed Carter for the remainder of the season, after he started the year with Italy's Scafati Basket. He was waived by the team on August 29, and re-signed two days later.\nOn December 20, 2007, Carter hit a runner in the lane with 0.8 seconds left in double overtime against the Houston Rockets, which gave the Nuggets a 112–111 win. In that season, he recorded individual records in most statistical categories, averaging a career-high 8 ppg, while starting all but three of the games he appeared in.\nOn July 1, 2008, Carter became a free agent, but re-signed with Denver in October.\nOn August 14, 2009, the Nuggets again re-signed Carter to a one-year contract for $1.3 million.\nOn July 14, 2010, he re-signed with the Nuggets to a one-year contract worth $1.3 million.\nOn February 22, 2011, Carter was traded to the New York Knicks in a three-way deal which also involved the Minnesota Timberwolves that brought Carmelo Anthony to New York. Considered a throw-in in the trade, Carter forever cemented his place in Knicks lore when he nearly singlehandedly rallied New York to a playoff victory in an elimination game against the Boston Celtics on April 24, 2011. Carter substituted into the game with the Knicks trailing by 23 and brought life back to the Garden by suffocating Rajon Rondo on defense, scoring 11 points, and dishing four dimes. However, the Knicks' comeback bid ultimately fell short.\nOn December 12, 2011, Carter signed with the Toronto Raptors. He was waived by the Raptors on March 15, 2012. In October 2012, he re-joined the Nuggets for their training camp, but did not make the team's final roster.\nCoaching career.\nIn September 2013, Carter was named an assistant coach with the Austin Spurs of the NBA Development League.\nOn July 31, 2015, Carter was hired by the Sacramento Kings to be an assistant coach.\nOn September 22, 2016, Carter was named assistant coach for the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the D-League.\nOn September 21, 2018, Carter was named to the staff of the Heat as player development coach.\nPersonal life.\nCarter's son Devin also plays basketball and as of spring 2023 is a sophomore guard for the Providence College Friars.\nWhile Carter was in fifth grade at Atlanta's Fred A. Toomer Elementary School, his class was adopted by the \"I Have a Dream\" foundation. In 2003, he was appointed as the first-ever spokesperson for the foundation.\nCarter donated $100,000 to fund scholarships at the University of Hawaii."

        "title": "Mike James (basketball, born 1975)",
        "text": "Michael Lamont James (born June 23, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player. A point guard, James played college basketball for Duquesne. James spent 13 seasons in the NBA and played for 11 different teams, winning an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He averaged 20.3 points per game as a member of the Toronto Raptors during the 2005–2006 season.\nCollege career.\nJames played college basketball at Duquesne University. He finished his college career as Duquesne's all-time leader in steals (201) and was fifth in assists (348) and 10th in points (1,411). James was named to the all-Atlantic 10 Conference first team in his senior year at the university.\nJames's number 13 was retired by Duquesne in a February 2017 ceremony.\nProfessional career.\nCareer in Europe.\nJames was not drafted by an NBA team in 1998. He began his professional basketball career in Europe. James enjoyed several seasons as an integral player with both French and Austrian teams.\nIn February 2011, following several NBA seasons, James signed with Aliağa Petkim in Turkey.\nNBA career.\nJames began his NBA career when he signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat during the 2001–02 season. He went on to play for the Boston Celtics, the Detroit Pistons, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Houston Rockets, the Toronto Raptors, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the New Orleans Hornets, the Washington Wizards, the Chicago Bulls, and the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 10.0 points per game for his career.\nDetroit Pistons.\nJames was a member of the Pistons' 2004 NBA championship team as a reserve. He and fellow reserve guard Lindsey Hunter formed a formidable defensive guard combination nicknamed the \"Pit Bulls\" by Rasheed Wallace because of their aggressive nature on defense.\nToronto Raptors.\nAs a starter for the Raptors during the 2005–06 season, James averaged career highs of 20.3 points, 5.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds per game and shot 47% from the field including 44.2% from 3-point range.\nDespite being an above-average shooter from the point guard spot, James's playmaking abilities and commitment to defense were called into question, in stark contrast to his \"pit bull\" days with the Pistons. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune wrote of his big 2005–06 season: \"Previously, James had started only 68 games, so some scouts wondered if those numbers were an aberration. Others felt his impending free agency affected his play, prompting him to seek stats at the expense of play-making duties\".\nWhile playing for Toronto in the 2005–06 season, he reached a career high of 39 points in a win against the Detroit Pistons. On April 11, 2006, James became the first Raptor to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games.\nMinnesota Timberwolves.\nJames averaged a career-high 20.3 points and 5.8 assists for the Raptors, making him a coveted free agent. On July 11, 2006, James signed a four-year $23.5 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, much of the 2006–07 season was marred by mediocre play, which limited his minutes to 25 per game (down from the 37 per game that he averaged during his career year in Toronto).\nHouston Rockets.\nOn June 14, 2007, it was announced that James and teammate Justin Reed would be traded to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard.\nLater career.\nOn February 21, 2008, it was announced that James and teammate Bonzi Wells would be traded to the New Orleans Hornets for Bobby Jackson, and Adam Haluska. This ended his second short tenure as a Houston Rocket.\nJames was traded on December 10, 2008, in a three-team trade between the New Orleans Hornets, Memphis Grizzlies, and Washington Wizards. The trade sent James and Javaris Crittenton to the Wizards and Antonio Daniels to the Hornets. The Grizzlies received a conditional first round draft pick from the Wizards.\nOn March 1, 2010, it was announced that the Washington Wizards had reached a buy-out agreement with James and waived him. James averaged 9.3 points per game during his stint with the Wizards, in which he played 57 games.\nAfter joining the Erie Bayhawks in the NBA Development League, James was called up by the Chicago Bulls on January 11, 2012, but released on January 28. On February 14, James was re-signed by the Bulls on a 10-day contract to provide support while Derrick Rose was injured. He was re-signed on a second 10-day contract on March 14. \nOn April 4, 2012, James signed with the Bulls for the rest of the season.\nAfter playing with the Texas Legends of the D-League, James was signed to a 10-day contract by the Dallas Mavericks on January 8, 2013. The Mavs signed him to a second 10-day contract on January 18, 2013. He was then signed for the remainder of the season on January 28, after his second 10-day contract was up.\nIn September 2013, James signed with the Chicago Bulls. On December 16, 2013, James was waived by the Bulls, after appearing in just seven games. On January 22, 2014, he signed a 10-day contract with the Bulls, returning yet again for another stint. On February 1, 2014, the Bulls decided not to sign James to a second 10-day contract after his first 10-day contract expired. On April 10, 2014, he signed with the Bulls for the rest of the 2013–14 season. On July 15, 2014, he was waived by the Bulls.\nPost-NBA career.\nOn November 3, 2014, James was reacquired by the Texas Legends. On January 25, 2015, he recorded the Legends first triple-double of the season with 21 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds in the 115–111 win over the Delaware 87ers.\nPersonal life.\nJames and his wife, Angela, have four daughters: Jadon Miciah (b. 2000), Amaya Noel (b. 2003), Michal Mikayla (b. 2007), and McKinley Joel (b. 2008). The family appeared in a 2008 episode of ABC's \"Supernanny\"."

        "text": "The Gotham Knights Rugby Football Club is a division III men's club in the Metropolitan New York Rugby Union. Their home pitch is on Randalls Island in Manhattan. The team finished fourth in the 2012 Bingham Cup, an international gay rugby tournament, coming off a 2010 win in Minneapolis.\nHistory.\nGotham Knights RFC is New York's entry to the growing worldwide ranks of multiethnic and non-discriminatory rugby union teams worldwide. Following in the tradition of International Gay Rugby Association and Board teams like Kings Cross Steelers in England in 1995 and the San Francisco Fog RFC and the Washington Renegades in 2000, recent part-time New York City business owner and resident, Mark Bingham, discussed with local rugby player Scott Glaessgen how to form a New York team. Their plans were cut short on September 11, 2001, when Mark was lost in a terrorist attack on United Airlines Flight 93 over rural Pennsylvania.\nThe inspiration of Mark’s life, work, and dedication to the sport of rugby led Scott and other New York City rugby players to meet in late 2001 to establish Gotham Knights RFC. Practices started in December 2001 and continued in the cold, early months of 2002 under difficult pitch conditions, but within weeks the membership grew exponentially. By late February, the team had elected Toby Butterfield as its first president, a board of directors, incorporated as a New York State not-for-profit corporation, ordered equipment, decided team colors and applied for membership in the Met New York Rugby Union.\nWarm spring weather in New York City led the team into more intensive practices in March and April under coach Scott Glaessgen. The team added assistant coach Mio Nitta, formerly of Tufts Rugby, as well as a steady influx of new members. Club-wide social events coalesced Gotham into a group off the field. We started intensively recruiting in the metro New York area, searching for a fan base and sponsors to sustain our team. The Knights celebrated their first win over a union opponent in September 2004 over the Suffolk Bull Moose RFC.\nThe club invited Australian Geoff Quinn to be its first head coach for fall 2002. In 2003, Steven Cain became head coach with assistance from Harold Bahr, who took over as head coach from fall 2003 until fall 2006, when players Keiran Lanham and Callum Sigg shared the head coaching responsibility. In 2007, Peter Rizzo became head coach until his departure for Brisbane, Australia in 2008. Spencer Blake stepped into the breach as a player-coach in fall 2008. Jeff Simpson was head coach during a period of team rebuilding in 2009. Philippose Kyriacou became head coach in late 2009. Lenny Pereira became Gotham's head coach for 2011. Gotham's longtime assistant coach Bob Hoban has been with the club since 2002, joined at times by Bob Murphy, Tony Buzzeo, Jeff Simpson, John Dent and others. Currently, Lawrence Blaber, Jr. (\"Junior\"), a former New York Rugby Club Assistant Coach, serves as Gotham's head coach.\nGotham's first A-side Captain in 2002 was Scott Glaessgen, followed in 2003 by Stace Houk. Luke Martland became captain in Fall 2003, followed for several years by Joe Rice. Keiran Lanham became captain in 2006, followed in 2008 by John Bockwoldt, Eric Di Palma in 2009, Joe Hunt in 2010, and Miguel Hammond in 2011. Joe Hunt now holds the title of Team Captain going into the Spring 2013 Season.\nToby Butterfield remained as president until 2004, and went on to join the board of Met New York Rugby, becoming its president in 2008. Gotham's president in 2004 and 2005 was Adam Josephs. Alex Fallis was president in 2006 and 2007. James Bain was president in 2008. John Vernon was president in 2009. Yacov Braunstein became president in January 2010. Longtime player Jon Morgan currently holds the Gotham President position for 2011 and 2012.\nEvery November from 2002 through 2008, the Knights hosted the East Coast Rugby Invitational, at first featuring both traditional and predominantly gay rugby teams from across eastern North America, and later incorporating college teams.\nThe Knights were the host team for the 2006 Bingham Cup held over Memorial Day weekend. 29 teams from 22 clubs in 6 countries participated in various divisions, including the Bingham Cup's first ever Women's division. The Knights advanced to the quarterfinal round of the 2004 Bingham Cup held in London and were runners up for the Bingham Plate that year. In 2006, the Knights advanced to the semifinal round of the Cup division, finishing 4th place in the top division, and the B side placed 4th in the Plate division.\nIn the Fall 2007 Union season, the Knights finished 2nd in the Union—the first time a predominantly gay team has reached the championship finals in the MetNY Rugby Union. They competed in the Territorial Playoffs in April, 2008, where there were defeated by the South Buffalo Thugs.\nIn June, 2008, the Knights traveled to Dublin, Ireland to compete in the 2008 Bingham Cup. Gotham competed in the premiere Cup division, emerging as the top US side. In pool play, the Knights easily dispatched the Boston Ironsides (50 – 0) and San Francisco Fog’s B-Side (39 – 0), but lost a close match to the Kings Cross Steelers' A-side, which placed second overall (8-16). In the knockout rounds, Gotham defeated perennial rival Washington Renegades (10-0), but lost a hard-fought semifinal match to eventual world champion Sydney Convicts (10-35; notably, the Knights were the only team to score a try against the Convicts in the tournament). In the consolation final, the Knights beat the San Francisco Fog’s A-side (8-5) in dramatic fashion, with the winning try scored on the last play of the match.

        "title": "Kyle Davies (baseball)",
        "text": "Hiram Kyle Davies (born September 9, 1983) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Kansas City Royals.\nDavies grew up in Stockbridge, Georgia, and graduated from Stockbridge High School and signed right out of high school with the Braves. He made his MLB debut in 2005, and was traded to the Royals in 2007. Injuries prevented him from appearing in MLB after the 2011 season, until he pitched for the Yankees in 2015.\nCareer.\nDavies attended Stockbridge High School in Stockbridge, Georgia. He was highly recruited by many major college programs, most notably Georgia Tech.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves selected Davies in the fourth round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, and Davies signed rather than attend college. Davies was a member of the Rome Braves during their inaugural season, when they won the 2003 South Atlantic League championship. He led the team in strikeouts with 148 during that season. Davies was part of the group of rookie players nicknamed the \"Baby Braves\" that Atlanta called up from its minor league system during the 2005 season. Davies made his Major League Baseball debut on May 21, 2005, a rainy night at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, and dominated six innings against the Boston Red Sox. Braves pitchers John Thomson and Mike Hampton were both put on the disabled list with injuries, and Davies was called up. Davies immediately made an impact, as he did not allow a run in his first three starts in the Major Leagues. When Thomson and Hampton returned to the pitching rotation in August, Davies was sent back to the minor leagues. Davies began the 2006 season as a starter in Atlanta, after coming to spring training as a probable Class AAA starter.\nOn May 15, 2006, Davies suffered an injury to his right groin while pitching against the Florida Marlins. He was later diagnosed with a torn groin muscle and underwent surgery several days later. As a result of the injury, Davies was put on the disabled list and missed 10 weeks of the season. He ended up making only 14 starts in 2006, with a very poor earned run average (ERA) of 8.38. Out of spring training in 2007, Davies was initially assigned to the Richmond Braves of the Class AAA International League. However, due to the injury of Lance Cormier at the end of spring training, he was promoted at the beginning of the year to fill Cormier's spot. Cormier's inability to return to form after rehabilitating and coming off the DL, coupled with the Braves losing Mike Hampton to season ending surgery, allowed Davies role on the pitching staff to cease being a fill-in role. However, in 17 starts, Davies had a terrible time establishing any pattern of reliability and consistency, posting a record of 4–8 with a 5.76 ERA. In a start on July 16 versus the Cincinnati Reds, Davies threw just 22 pitches and did not record an out before being taken out of the game. Consequently, Davies was optioned to Richmond on July 19 as rookie Jo-Jo Reyes assumed his spot in the rotation.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn July 31, 2007, Davies was traded to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for pitcher Octavio Dotel. On August 4, Davies made his Royals debut going three innings and giving up five earned runs. He also gave up Alex Rodriguez's 500th homer in the first inning. But on August 9 he was able to bounce back with 6 and 2/3 scoreless innings against the Minnesota Twins, giving up only 3 hits and striking out 4. The Royals won the game by the score of 2–0. On August 1, 2011, Davies was placed on the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder impingement. He was released on August 10, 2011, and cleared release waivers on August 12.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn August 20, Davies signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn February 20, 2013, Davies signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. After missing April and half of May due to shoulder problems, Davies was assigned to High-A Fort Myers, where he made his first start on May 15. After one additional start, he missed another month due to injury, making a rehab start with the GCL Twins before returning to Fort Myers, where he made 3 more starts. On July 23, Davies was promoted to Double-A New Britain, where he made 7 starts to finish the season. In 12 starts in 2013, Davies went 4–3 with a 3.41 ERA and 4 quality starts, striking out 47 in 58 innings.\nCleveland Indians.\nDavies signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on February 12, 2014.\nNew York Yankees.\nDavies signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees on February 10, 2015. He was called up to the major leagues on April 12, 2015, and appeared in a game that night. He was designated for assignment by the Yankees the next day.\nTokyo Yakult Swallows.\nDavies signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2016 season.\nSomerset Patriots.\nOn May 7, 2018, Davies signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the 2018 season.\nLancaster Barnstormers.\nOn March 15, 2019, Davies signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. \nPersonal life.\nDuring the offseason, Davies works for his father's construction company. He currently resides in McDonough, Georgia.\nKyle's younger brother Jake played baseball at Georgia Tech from 2009 to 2012 and signed with the Boston Red Sox organization. He reached the Single–A New York–Penn League later that year, but was released in 2013.\nDavies was arrested in St. Petersburg, Florida after a baseball game on August 8, 2011, for disorderly intoxication."

The rest of his career, which lasted from 1947 to 1963, was mainly spent in the minor professional Western Hockey League. Anderson also played with the 1947–48 Edmonton Flyers team that won the 1948 Allan Cup the senior Canadian championship.\nPlaying career.\nAnderson played with the 1947–48 Edmonton Flyers that won the 1948 Allan Cup. In the tournament leading up to the final, played in Calgary, the Flyers played in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Out of 24 games played, the Flyer's record was 19 wins, four losses and one draw. This was a vital moment in Western Canada hockey history that helped create the foundation for Alberta's rich hockey tradition. The Flyer's thrilling victory over the Ottawa Senators energized the entire city and their victory parade attracted more than 60,000 people, half the population of Edmonton in 1948. The national title was only the third national hockey title ever won by an Alberta team.\nAnderson played two playoff games for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League during the 1953 playoffs. He scored no points and had no penalty minutes during those two games. He qualified to be engraved on the Stanley Cup, but his name was left off, since he did not play regularly with Montreal. He spent most of his career playing for the Vancouver Canucks of the minor professional Western Hockey League. He retired from hockey after the 1962–63 season.\nHe was inducted with the rest of the 1947–48 Edmonton Flyers team to the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 2005.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson, who married Barbara Gayle Webster in 1953, devoted the rest of his life to raising his three children and spending time with his family. He died on January 8, 1998. Due to his commitment to athletes getting a good education, a memorial bursary was set up in his name and memory at the University of Victoria. His death date was confirmed with a newspaper obituary in Victoria."

        "text": "In sailing, gaskets are lengths of rope or fabric used for reefing a sail, or hold a stowed sail in place. In modern use, the term is usually restricted to square-rigged ships, the equivalent items on yachts being referred to by the more prosaic \"sail ties\".\nOn most ships, gaskets are made of rope. They are attached to the top of the yard and, left loose, would hang behind the sail. Gaskets should never be left dangling, however, so when the sail is set they are brought around underneath the yard and up the back of it and then tied to the jackstay (metal rod) where they originated. Alternatively, longer gaskets - particularly the clew gaskets described below - can be secured using a gasket coil. When the sail is to be stowed it is first folded and bagged neatly within itself, pulled onto the top of the yard, and then the gaskets are brought round over it and secured to the jackstay to hold it in place. Gaskets should be tied with a slippery hitch to enable them to be let off quickly, though if the yard is large there may only be enough rope to form a clove hitch when the gasket is brought round it.\nMost ships are equipped with \"clew gaskets\" at the outer ends of the yards. These do not pass around the sail, but through a shackle or ring on the blocks of the sheet. Pulled tight and secured to the jackstay or the yard's lift, this takes the load off the clewline and sail, and should allow the blocks to be lifted higher, dragging the sail down less and enabling a neater stow."

        "text": "Mens Sana Basketball Siena, also known as simply Mens Sana, is an Italian professional basketball club based in Siena. It is a section of the sports club Polisportiva Mens Sana, founded in 1871.\nUnder the name Montepaschi Siena, derived from sponsor Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the club was a dominant presence in the Italian Serie A, winning five titles in a row from 2006–07 to 2010–11, besides two more titles later revoked by the Italian Federation, whilst also challenging for titles in Europe. \nAfter financial problems caused the club to go bankrupt in 2014, it moved down to the fourth division. In the 2015–16 season it played in the second division.\nFor past club sponsorship names, see the list below.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1871–1967).\nThe parent organisation, Associazione Ginnastica Senese \"Mens Sana in Corpore Sano 1871\", was formed on 16 April 1871 by university students. In the beginning of the 19th century the gymnastics club became a multi-sports club () by adding other sports under its wing.\nBasketball was first practiced by the club in May 1907 when – at the Venice Gymnastics competition – teacher Ida Nomi Pesciolini led a women's team in a basketball demonstration. It's claimed this was the first time the game – invented in 1891 – was played in Italy, with Nomi discovering the sport whilst in the United Kingdom and then translating the rules in Italian.\nThe official basketball section of the club was established in 1934. However, the club and the organisation as a whole had limited activities until the end of the Second World War in 1945. After that date, basketball was played again, at first by students from the Piccolomini high school.\nA professional club (1967–2000).\nOn 5 March 1967, Mens Sana played against city rival Costone for a place in the second division Serie B, with the former winning 64–63. \nIn 1973, having lost the previous year, Siena beat Brina Rieti 80–66 to reach the top tier Serie A for the first time.\nDuring the 1974–75 season, Sapori Siena finished fifth in the league thanks to a slow-paced style combined with zone defense as twin towers Carl Johnson and Enrico Bovone dominated the paint.\nIn 1978–79, Antonini Siena reached the Serie A quarterfinals, earning a place in the 1979–80 FIBA Korać Cup where they went to the Round of 16.\nOnly two seasons later the side was in the second division again and at the end of the 1986 season it moved down to the third division Serie B Eccellenza.\nSiena would stay there until 1990, returning to the Serie A in 1991 and staying there for good from 1994. At the beginning of the decade, the club had become autonomous from the Polisportiva.\nWith coaches like Gianfranco Lombardi, Cesare Pancotto and Valerio Bianchini and players Sandro Dell'Agnello, Sylvester Gray, Gerard King, and Larry Middleton the club had solid results, including two Serie A quarterfinals in 1997–98 and 1999–00 and two participations in the FIBA Korać Cup.\nMontepaschi Siena (2000–2014).\nIn the summer of 2000, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a banking company based in the city, became the majority sponsor of the side.\nThe club, now known as Montepaschi Siena, took a new dimension, first signing Italian international Roberto Chiacig and playing in the 2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague.\nA year later coach Ergin Ataman and players Vrbica Stefanov, Mindaugas Žukauskas, Boris Gorenc and Milenko Topić were added.\nThe team, with the mid-season addition of Petar Naumoski, beat Pamesa Valencia to lift the 2002 Saporta Cup, their first ever title.\nIn 2002–03, Montepaschi added guard Alphonso Ford and forward Mirsad Türkcan. For their first season in the EuroLeague, Europe's best competition, the Italians reached the Final Four (just the second team to achieve the feat), losing 62–65 to Benetton Treviso, a team that also beat them in the domestic semifinals on the way to the title.\nBefore the 2003–04 season, Carlo Recalcati, the Italian national team coach, was chosen in order to win a scudetto (Italian title), with Ford and Turkcan being replaced by David Andersen, Giacomo Galanda, Bootsy Thornton, David Vanterpool and later Michalis Kakiouzis. \nSiena would accomplish that goal, sweeping all of its playoff series 3–0 and claiming their first ever scudetto after toppling Metis Varese, Scavolini Pesaro and Skipper Bologna.\nEarlier, the same Bologna side had impeded their second Euroleague Final Four run, beating Montepaschi 103–102 in overtime.\nThe next two seasons put a brake on that success, with the sole addition of the Italian Supercup amidst two quarterfinal eliminations in the league and one Top 16 appearance in the Euroleague.\nSiena native and long serving club member Simone Pianigiani was promoted to the head coach role in 2006 whilst the roster was overhauled. \nMontepaschi went to the quarterfinals of the 2006–07 ULEB Cup (Europe's second-tier competition) before losing to UNICS. More importantly, a team led by Rimantas Kaukėnas, Joseph Forte and Terrell McIntyre won 39 of the 44 games they played in the Serie A season (with a 3–0 finals sweep) to earn their second league title.\nWith the return of Thornton and the addition of Kšyštof Lavrinovič, Montepaschi reached the 2008 Euroleague Final Four after sweeping their quarterfinals. A 17-point second-half lead against Maccabi Tel Aviv proved insufficient as the Italians lost in the semifinal.\nOn the domestic front, Siena started the season with 18 successive wins and were never challenged in their third title conquest.\nIn 2008–09, Siena became the second side to complete a domestic treble after losing just one game on their way to the league, Cup and Supercup titles.\nAfter adding Nikos Zisis, Marko Jarić, Malik Hairston and Bo McCalebb, Montepaschi reached another Euroleague Final Four in 2011, overcoming then-top scorer McCalebb's injury and a record 48-point loss to Olympiacos in the quarterfinals game 1. \nHowever, they were again stopped in the semifinals, this time by champions Panathinaikos. \nIn the league they proved unstoppable again, adding a fifth straight Serie A crown and a third straight Cup title to their trophy cabinet.\nIn 2011–12, Montepaschi achieved an unprecedented sixth consecutive Serie A title, adding the Supercup (their fifth in a row) and Cup (fourth) for good measure.\nThe 2011–12 Euroleague saw eventual champions Olympiacos avenge their preceding year's defeat by topping the Italians in the quarterfinals.\nAll the titles won during this season were to be revoked four years later by the Italian Basketball Federation, following an investigation for accounting and fiscal fraud.\n2012–13 saw two major changes with a decrease in budget that saw several players leave and a change in coach, with Pianigiani replaced by assistant Luca Banchi.\nMontepaschi wasn't as competitive, being eliminated at the Euroleague Top 16 stage whilst in the domestic league they finished the regular season in fifth place with 12 losses.\nHowever the holders rallied in the playoffs, winning two Best-of–7 series in game 7, against EA7 Emporio Armani Milano and Cimberio Varese before toppling Acea Roma 4–1 in the finals to add title number seven to the Cup they had earlier won. This title too was revoked three years later by the Italian Basketball Federation.\nThe next season (2013–2014) saw an ever-contracting budget and a more ordinary roster, Montepaschi found it harder to compete in the 2013–14 Euroleague, alternating between close wins (sometimes on the buzzer) and closer defeats, ending the season with 3 wins and 7 losses. In their final game against Unicaja that would decide who progressed from the group, the Italians were the victims of a buzzer beating shot that eliminated them from the competition.\nThough its financial problems emerged to the fore, with a relegation all but assured due to massive debts, on the court the holders kept fighting, pushing favourites Milan to seven games in the Serie A finals, though they would go on to concede the title.\nSoon after, Mens Sana Basket was declared bankrupt amidst debts of 5,4 million euros and the departure of sponsor Montepaschi even if the company had revenue for over 400 million Euro. Furthermore, an inquest had been started in 2012 after suspected undeclared payments and tax evasion by club officials for over 90 million Euro, including former president Ferdinando Minucci.\nOn 25 October 2017, following an investigation for accounting and fiscal fraud, including the destruction of some of the company's accounts by the president Ferdinando Minucci, the Italian Basketball Federation revoked all the domestic titles won by the club during the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, namely two Italian titles, two Italian Cups and an Italian Supercup.\nA new start (2014–present).\nThe Mens Sana multi-sports club then retook ownership of the basketball club, it was registered in the fourth division Serie B for the 2014–15 season, with all players having left though Roberto Chiacig returned.\nIn June 2015, Mens Sana 1871 won the third place game in the Serie B final four to earn a promotion to the unified second division Serie A2 for 2015–16. In March 2019, Siena was excluded from the West Group of the Serie A2 for economic issues. In the beginnings of 2019, the team's roster was practically dismantled due to the club's financial troubles making it impossible to pay the league's taxes and the wages. The exclusion was determined after various renounciatiouns by the team to play certain games and on the charges of \"unsportsmanlike conduct\", since its line-up altered the competitiveness of the league.\nFollowing the exclusion, the team was renamed as Mens Sana Siena Basketball Academy, after absorbing again the control of Mens Sana's former satellite youth team; and enrolled for the 2019–20 Promozione Toscana, in the 7th tier of the Italian Basketball Federation. Such league was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy with Siena in the lead.\nOn the 21st of August 2020, it was announced that Mens Sana Siena would be participating on the Group A of the Serie C silver, a regional league representing the 5th Tier of the Italian Basketball Federation.\nArena.\nMens Sana played in the Sant’Agata gymnasium before moving into the Dodecaedro (later Palazzetto Giannelli) when it was built in 1968.\nThey later moved into the Palascalavo in 1976 (now Palasport Mens Sana, capacity 6,000).\nNotable players.\nOther notable players.\n2010s\n2000s\n1990s\nSponsorship names.\nThroughout the years, due to sponsorship, the club has been known as:"

        "text": "Raymond D. Whitney (born May 8, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was given the nickname \"The Wizard\" for his passing and playmaking skills.\nWhitney is considered to have been one of the most underrated players in the NHL, as his name has rarely been mentioned amongst hockey fans and writers despite his consistently high point-production throughout his entire 22-year career, making him one of the top 65 point producers in the history of the NHL. On January 29, 2016, Whitney became the first Spokane Chiefs player to have their number retired (#14). He won the Stanley Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006.\nPlaying career.\nLong before Whitney played in the NHL, he and his brother Dean were stick boys for the NHL's Wayne Gretzky era Edmonton Oilers. The third stick boy with the Whitney brothers was another future NHL player, Ryan Smyth.\nDuring his junior career, Whitney spent three years with the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League (WHL), leading the entire league with 185 points during the 1990-91 season. Whitney and the Chiefs won the 1991 Memorial Cup as champions of the Canadian Hockey League.\nWhitney was the second player ever drafted by the San Jose Sharks, picked in the second round (23rd overall) in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. Pat Falloon, his teammate with the WHL's Spokane Chiefs, was the Sharks' first pick. The Sharks had thought the pair would be a natural scoring combination, but that didn't pan out. Whitney started his professional career in the 1991-92 season, playing with teams in the German Deutsche Eishockey Liga and the International Hockey League, as well as two games with the San Jose Sharks. He developed into a regular with San Jose over the next two seasons.\nWhitney has played for several different NHL teams during his 24-year career, including the San Jose Sharks (1991–92 to 1996–97), Edmonton Oilers (1997–98), Florida Panthers (1997–98 to 2000–01), Columbus Blue Jackets (2000–01 to 2002–03), Detroit Red Wings (2003–04), Carolina Hurricanes, Phoenix Coyotes, and Dallas Stars (details below).\nOn August 6, 2005, Whitney signed a two-year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes paying him $1.5 million per year. In his first season with the Hurricanes in 2005–06, Whitney helped Carolina win their first Stanley Cup with fellow Fort Saskatchewan native Mike Commodore.\nOn February 8, 2007, Whitney scored a natural hat trick in just 1 minute and 40 seconds.\nOn April 13, 2007, Whitney re-signed with the Hurricanes, agreeing to a three-year contract that pays him $3.5 million per year.\nOn July 1, 2010, Whitney signed a 2-year deal with the Phoenix Coyotes for $3 million per year.\nWhitney is known for his comedic tendencies for doing such things as making sure he's visible in pre-game on-screen interviews behind the interviewee, leading to the Hurricanes fans' favorite game of \"Where's Whitney\"? His commonly used nickname is \"Wizard,\" which was originally given to him by former Florida Panthers play-by-play commentator Jeff Rimer.\nWhitney was the last remaining member of the San Jose Sharks inaugural team (1991–92) active in the NHL until his retirement on January 21, 2015. He was also the last remaining active player to get his start in the NHL as a member of the expansion San Jose Sharks.\nOn March 31, 2012, Whitney became only the 79th player in the history of the NHL to score 1,000 regular-season points, when he registered an assist in a game against the Anaheim Ducks. As of the end of the 2013-14 season, he is number 62 all time for regular-season points in the NHL.\nOn July 1, 2012, Whitney signed a 2-year, $9 million contract with the Dallas Stars.\nOn January 21, 2015, he announced his retirement as an NHL player, ending a career after producing 1,064 points (385-679) in 1,330 regular-season games. At the time of his retirement, he was the leader in points, assists and games played for the entire 1991 NHL draft class.\nPersonal life.\nRay and wife Brijet married in 2000 and have three children; two daughters and a son. He is known by his nickname \"The Wizard\".\nInternational play.\nWhitney has been a member of Team Canada at four different Ice Hockey World Championships. He made his debut at the 1998 World Championship, recording six points in seven games while Canada finished out of the medals. Whitney notched seven points in 10 games at the 1999 World Championship, again missing a medal when Canada lost in the semifinals to the Czech Republic. He joined Team Canada at the 2002 World Championship with Canada again failing to medal. At the 2010 World Championship, Whitney replaced Ryan Smyth as Canada's captain, when Smyth broke his foot early in the tournament. Canada did not win a medal in that year's world championship."

        "title": "John Tudor (baseball)",
        "text": "John Thomas Tudor (born February 2, 1954) is an American former left-handed starting pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for several teams between 1979 and 1990.\nEarly life.\nTudor is the oldest of three children born to Jean and Melton Tudor, an engineer. Although born in the Capital District of New York, Tudor was raised in Peabody, Massachusetts, and attended Peabody High School, where he played hockey and was once cut from the school's baseball team.\nAmateur career.\nTudor began his college baseball career at North Shore Community College in Danvers, Massachusetts, where he was the team's best pitcher and hitter. After two years at North Shore, Tudor wrote a letter to Georgia Southern University and ABCA Hall of Fame head coach Ron Polk asking for the opportunity to walk on to their baseball program. Tudor successfully made the Eagles' roster as the team's fifth starting pitcher. He graduated from the school with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. In 1975, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Tudor was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the third round of the 1976 MLB draft (secondary phase) from Georgia Southern.\nEarly career.\nTudor debuted with the Red Sox on August 16, 1979. He spent some time in the minors in 1980 and was used as both a starter and reliever in 1981. On September 9, 1981, Tudor recorded the only save of his major league career by retiring the only batter he faced in the 11th inning to close out a 6–5 Red Sox victory over the Tigers. Tudor finally established himself as a member of the rotation in 1982, going 13–10 with a 3.63 ERA. After finishing 13–12 the following season, Tudor was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for designated hitter Mike Easler. After one year in Pittsburgh, in which he was 12–11 with a 3.27 ERA, he was sent to St. Louis as part of a deal for veteran outfielder George Hendrick. The Pirates received a career minor leaguer in the deal and sent catcher Brian Harper to the Cardinals.\n1985.\nTudor's career highlight was a spectacular season for the St. Louis Cardinals. Oddly enough, Tudor started that year with a 1–7 record and a 3.74 earned run average through May. He then went on a 20–1 run with a 1.37 ERA the rest of the season and lowering his overall ERA to 1.93. According to Tudor, the change in performance came from a phone call from his former high school catcher, who, after watching Tudor on TV, had noticed a hitch in his delivery that he had not seen Tudor have before. Tudor concluded the season by winning his last eleven decisions. Only the best season of Dwight Gooden's career stopped Tudor from winning the National League Cy Young Award and leading the league in ERA, wins and complete games. He was sixth in strikeouts for the year.\nMoreover, Tudor's ten complete game shutouts in 1985 made him the only pitcher since Jim Palmer in to reach double-digits in that category. (Bob Gibson holds the Cardinal record with 13 in 1968). To make the achievement more impressive, his ten shutouts were all in the last four months of 1985. To date, Tudor is the last Major League player to record ten or more shutouts in a season. The most since then is eight, by Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser and Boston pitcher Roger Clemens in 1988 and Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher in 1989.\nThe Cardinals were in the heat of a division race against Gooden and the New York Mets in September 1985. Tudor improved even more by starting the month with two consecutive shutouts and then pitched against Gooden himself in a matchup on September 11. Gooden and Tudor locked horns pitch-for-pitch and the score was 0–0 after nine innings. Jesse Orosco took over for Gooden in the tenth inning and gave up a home run to César Cedeño. Tudor came back out in the bottom of the inning and finished the three-hit, ten-inning masterpiece for his third consecutive shutout of the month. After two sub-par performances, he pitched his fourth shutout of the month and then pitched another ten innings of shutout ball against the Mets' Ron Darling but the Mets turned the table and beat the Cardinals' bullpen in the eleventh inning.\nTudor's pitching propelled the Cardinals into the playoffs. He lost Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers but won Game 4 to even the series and St. Louis won 4 games to 2. Tudor was masterful in Game 1 of the 1985 World Series against the long-shot Kansas City Royals, and even better with a shutout in Game 4. However, after a devastating and controversial Cardinals' loss in the 9th inning of Game Six in which the team fell just short of clinching the World Series, Tudor and the Cardinals completely fell apart in Game 7. Tudor allowed five runs and four walks before being pulled in the third inning, as the Royals rolled to an 11–0 victory for their first World Championship. Tudor was saddled with the loss. Upset by his performance in Game 7, he cut his pitching hand in a post-game fit by punching an electrical fan.\nAfter 1985.\nTudor never matched his dominance of 1985. While still posting low ERAs, he never won more than 13 games. In , he was again in the World Series but again lost with a chance to win the World Series. Injuries limited Tudor's playing time after 1985 and eventually ended his career. He was the victim of a freak accident in 1987 when Mets' catcher Barry Lyons went into the Cardinals' dugout trying to catch a foul ball and crashed into Tudor, breaking Tudor's leg. In , Tudor was traded to the Dodgers despite having the league's best ERA. He pitched well again and won his only World Series ring for the 1988 World Series, but severely injured his elbow during the postseason. That injury caused Tudor to miss almost all of and then retire despite a good comeback season (12–4, 2.40 ERA) in ."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1981",
        "text": "The tour by the Australian cricket team in England in 1981 included the 51st Ashes series of Test matches between Australia and England. Despite having been 1–0 down after two Tests, England won the next three to finish 3–1 victors (with two draws), thus retaining the Ashes.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia's regular captain Greg Chappell made himself unavailable for selection, and Kim Hughes was re-instated. The Australian squad selected for the tour was as follows:\nSelection controversies.\nDoug Walters was overlooked despite a strong summer at home. This resulted in protests from fans and Walters' eventual retirement from first class cricket.\nBruce Yardley had been Australia's most successful spinner that summer with 47 wickets, followed by Jim Higgs with 38. The selectors preferred Ray Bright (22 wickets at 40) and Graeme Beard (29 wickets at 25).\nReplacements.\nMike Whitney was called up as a replacement during the tour.\nTest series.\nAlthough the two teams were ranked below the mighty West Indies of that era, the 1981 Ashes is nevertheless widely regarded as one of the most entertaining Test series ever due to the see-sawing nature of both the individual games and the series as a whole.\nEngland won the series 3–1 despite being 1–0 down after the first two Tests.\nBefore the third Test at Headingley, the inspirational Mike Brearley was reinstated as England captain, replacing Ian Botham, whose 12-Test tenure as captain had been winless and whose previously excellent form with both bat and ball had fallen away (he had made a pair in the second Test at Lord's).\nThe series turned around in the legendary third Test at Headingley. A galvanised Botham took 6 for 95 in Australia's first innings and scored 50 in England's, but Australia nonetheless compiled 401 for 9 declared (John Dyson scoring 102) and bowled England out for 174, thus forcing England to follow on 227 runs in arrears. Despite a stubborn 46 from Geoff Boycott, in the second innings Botham came to the crease with England on 105 for 5, still requiring 122 runs to avoid an innings defeat. He played an outstanding innings of 149 not out, sharing partnerships of 117 with Graham Dilley for the eighth wicket, 67 with Chris Old for the ninth and 37 with Bob Willis for the tenth, to set Australia a target of 130. Australia then reached 56 for 1, seemingly well set, before Brearley switched Willis's bowling end to allow him to bowl down the slope. Willis bowled a superb spell of 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for 111; England became only the second team in Test Match history to win a match after being made to follow-on.\nThe fourth Test at Edgbaston was a similarly inspired comeback victory for England. England conceded a 69-run first innings deficit, and set Australia a target of only 151 in the fourth innings. Australia reached 105 for 4 before Botham took five for 11, including a spell of five wickets for a solitary run, to end Australia's second innings at 121 and give England victory by 29 runs.\nEngland also went on to win the fifth Test at Old Trafford to retain the Ashes, including another century for Botham (who reached his hundred in 86 balls). Botham scored 118 from 102 balls, dominating a chalk-and-cheese partnership of 149 with Chris Tavaré, who blocked his way to 78 from 289 balls. Botham's innings included 6 sixes, which was an Ashes record until Ben Stokes's innings of 135 at Headingley in the 2019 Ashes series. Second-innings centuries from Allan Border and Graham Yallop could not avert defeat.\nThe sixth Test at The Oval was drawn, with Dennis Lillee taking 11 wickets in the match and Botham taking 10.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nThree ODIs were played on this tour prior to the Test series. Australia won the Prudential Trophy 2–1, winning at Edgbaston and Headingley, after losing the first match at Lord's.\nVisit to Sri Lanka.\nThe Australian team visited Sri Lanka in May 1981 en route to England. They played three limited-overs matches and one first-class match against the Sri Lanka national team, which at that time was on the brink of achieving Test status. The first-class match was played at Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo and ended in a draw after being badly affected by the weather."

Floyd is the last fullback to be selected in the first round of the NFL draft. A brash and loud rookie but also thought to have a very bright career in front of him, he helped San Francisco win Super Bowl XXIX during his rookie year. In a 1995 divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears, he became the first rookie to score three touchdowns in a playoff game. He also scored a touchdown in the NFC title game, assisting the 49ers to a 38–28 win over the Dallas Cowboys after 2 frustrating losses to Dallas in the previous 2 NFC Championship Games. In Super Bowl XXIX, Floyd rushed for 32 yards, caught 4 passes for 26 yards, and scored a touchdown in San Francisco's 49–26 victory.\nFloyd's 1995 season was cut short in Week 9 when he tore three ligaments in his right knee on a goal-line running play that put him on the reserve list for the remainder of the season. He was leading the NFL in receptions (47) at the time of the injury.\nHe finished his career playing with the Carolina Panthers from 1998 through 2000. In his 7 NFL seasons, Floyd rushed for 1,141 yards, caught 191 passes for 1,427 yards, returned 1 kickoff for 22 yards, and scored 25 touchdowns (20 rushing and 5 receiving).\nPersonal life.\nHe lives in Orlando, Florida, with his wife Bonita and their three children William, Thai and Jaden, the latter of which currently plays safety for Florida State. The family is active in his non-profit community-benefit foundation, William Floyd's Bar None Foundation ('Bar None' was his nickname while playing with the 49ers).\nOn April 30, 2008, Florida State University and ISP Sports announced that Floyd, who helped win a national championship for the Seminoles in 1993, would join Gene Deckerhoff as color analyst on the Seminole ISP Sports Network for radio broadcasts of FSU football games. Floyd is also in his third season as a color analyst on Tailgate Overtime, airing live every Monday at 7PM on Sunshine Network during the college football season.\nFloyd also rapped one verse on the track \"Bay Riders\" by Vallejo artist Celly Cel on the 1996 compilation album, \"NFL Jams\". The song was later included on the Celly Cel compilation album, \"Song'z U Can't Find\", in 2002."

        "title": "Brian Shaw (basketball)",
        "text": "Brian Keith Shaw (born March 22, 1966) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both guard positions, but was used primarily at point guard in his 14 seasons in the NBA. He won three NBA championships playing with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nEarly life.\nBrian Keith Shaw was born on March 22, 1966, in Oakland, California. Shaw grew up with other future basketball stars such as Antonio Davis, and Gary Payton, as well as Demetrius \"Hook\" Mitchell. In his youth, he was a participant at the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local community organization where he played basketball. He attended Westlake Middle School and then Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, where he excelled in basketball.\nCollege career.\nShaw attended St. Mary's College of California for his freshman and sophomore years of college, then transferred to UC Santa Barbara for his junior and senior seasons. In his senior year, he was named Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA) player of the year as he led the Gauchos to their first-ever NCAA tournament berth.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (1988–1989).\nHe was taken with the 24th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 1988 NBA draft.\nIl Messaggero Roma (1989–1990).\nIn 1988, Shaw signed a one-year contract with the Celtics. In 1989, Shaw signed a two-year contract to play with an Italian team, Il Messaggero Roma.\nBoston Celtics (1990–1992).\nAt the end of January 1990, Shaw signed a 5-year deal with the Celtics. In June of that year, Shaw told the Celtics he planned to play for Il Messaggero during the 1990–91 season. The ensuing contract dispute, Boston Celtics v. Brian Shaw, which Shaw lost, became a relatively famous sports law case and is read in many law school contracts classes. Upon returning to the NBA, Shaw played only two seasons with Boston.\nMiami Heat (1992–1994).\nIn 1992, Shaw was traded to the Miami Heat for Sherman Douglas.\nOrlando Magic (1994–1997).\nIn 1994, Shaw signed as a free agent with the Orlando Magic.\nGolden State Warriors (1997–1998).\nThree years later, Shaw was traded to the Golden State Warriors as part of a package for Mark Price.\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1998).\nIn 1998, after Shaw became disgruntled with his role with the Warriors, he was traded alongside Joe Smith to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jim Jackson and Clarence Weatherspoon.\nPortland Trail Blazers (1999).\nDuring the lockout-shortened 1998-1999 season, Shaw signed a ten-day contract with the Portland Trail Blazers in April, and signed a rest-of-season contract afterwards. During the 1999 offseason, the Blazers resigned Shaw to be traded alongside Ed Gray, Walt Williams, Carlos Rogers, Stacey Augmon, and Kelvin Cato to the Houston Rockets for Scottie Pippen. The Rockets subsequently waived Shaw.\nLos Angeles Lakers (1999–2003).\nShaw then signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was a member of four squads that made NBA Finals appearances: in 1995 with the Magic and in 2000, 2001, and 2002 with Lakers (winning three NBA championships with the Lakers).\nHe also played for the US national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal. In the final between the United States and Soviet Union, Shaw hit a key three-pointer in the closing seconds. The American team won the game by two points.\nShaw joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999, reuniting with former Orlando teammate Shaquille O'Neal. He served as a backup to All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant throughout the season and playoffs as the Lakers had the league's best record winning 67 games. Shaw played in all 22 of the Lakers' playoff games as they advanced past the Sacramento Kings and the Phoenix Suns before facing the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers took a 3–1 lead in the series before the Trail Blazers won games 5 and 6 to tie the series at three games apiece. In game 7, the Trail Blazers lead 75-60 in the fourth quarter. The Blazers shot 5 for 23 in the final quarter as the Lakers made a comeback bolstered by two clutch three-point baskets by Shaw. The Lakers won the game and made the NBA Finals to face the Indiana Pacers. Shaw started in game 3 in place of the injured Bryant, and then played critical minutes in the Lakers overtime win in game 4. The Lakers won the series 4–2, and Shaw won his first NBA championship.\nShaw continued to back up Bryant in the 2000–01 season, but started a total of 28 games. He once again played a key role for the Lakers as they steamrolled through the playoffs and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4–1 in the 2001 NBA Finals. The Lakers won a third title in the 2001–02 season before losing in the Western Conference Semifinals to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2002–03 season, and Shaw then retired following the season.\nLegacy.\nWhile a member of the Heat, on April 8, 1993, Shaw hit a then-NBA record ten three-point field goals (out of 15 attempts) against the Milwaukee Bucks at the Bradley Center, finishing with 32 points. Starting in 1994, he was one-half of the popular \"Shaw-Shaq Redemption\" (named after \"The Shawshank Redemption\"), an alley-oop from Shaw to Shaquille O'Neal that was popular with fans in both Orlando and Los Angeles (Shaw and O'Neal were also Laker teammates). In an interview with \"The Miami Herald\" in 2007, O'Neal claimed that the teammate he had most respected in his career was Shaw.\nOn NBA All-Star Weekend in 2000, held in Oakland, Shaw received a key to the City of Oakland along with his fellow Oakland natives Jason Kidd and Gary Payton.\nCoaching career.\nLos Angeles Lakers (2003–2011).\nShaw retired following the 2002–03 season. He worked for the Lakers as an Oakland-based scout during the 2003–04 season. He was appointed assistant coach of the Lakers during the 2004–05 season. He was considered for the Lakers head coaching job following Phil Jackson's retirement, but was ultimately passed over in favor of Mike Brown.\nIndiana Pacers (2011–2013).\nShaw left the Lakers to join the Indiana Pacers as an assistant coach. He was later promoted to associate head coach. Shaw was a highly respected assistant coach by other NBA coaches as well as the media.\nDenver Nuggets (2014–2015).\nAfter spending two years on the Pacers' bench, on June 25, 2013, Shaw was announced as the head coach of the Denver Nuggets, replacing former coach George Karl. On March 3, 2015, he was fired by the Nuggets after compiling a record of 56–85 (.397) in just under two seasons.\nReturn to the Lakers (2016–2019).\nIn July 2016, Shaw returned to the Los Angeles Lakers as the team's newest associate head coach under new head coach Luke Walton's coaching staff.\nNBA G League Ignite (2020–2021).\nOn June 10, 2020, Shaw was named as the inaugural head coach of the G League Ignite. He led the team to an 8–8 record and a playoff berth but stepped down from the role after the season.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2021–present).\nOn September 24, 2021, Shaw was announced as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 26, 1993, both of Shaw's parents and his sister were killed in a car accident in Nevada. His sister's daughter survived the crash and Shaw, with help from his aunt, helped raise her.\nShaw reportedly dated Madonna when he played for the Miami Heat. Shaw has three children with his wife, Nikki Shaw, who is a professional chef. They met when he was signed as a free agent by the Orlando Magic in 1994 and they married in 1998."

        "title": "Nintendo World Championships",
        "text": "The Nintendo World Championships (NWC) is a nationwide video game competition series, organized by Nintendo of America at no particular interval.\nThe first Nintendo World Championships was in 1990, touring 29 American cities, being hosted in Los Angeles, CA twice. The NWC was conceived by Steve Grossman and Jay Coleman, principals at EMCI, Nintendo's marketing agency. The event won numerous marketing awards and was sponsored by Pepsi, Reebok, and Nabisco. It was based on a custom Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak, which would historically become one of the most rare and valuable NES cartridges. The NWC is considered one of the first ever esports event. In 2014, Nintendo released \"NES Remix 2\", featuring the reminiscent \"Nintendo World Championships Remix\", which uses emulation and online leaderboards for amateur global competition. On June 15, 2015, the second Nintendo World Championships took place for its 25th anniversary as part of Nintendo's E3 2015 coverage. The third Nintendo World Championships was on October 7, 2017.\n1990.\nPreceding the Nintendo World Championships, the Nintendo Challenge Championship (NCC) was in Canada in 1989 and 1990, coinciding with Nintendo's 100th anniversary. This was Nintendo's first annual nationwide video game competition series. Nintendo assumed full distribution and marketing from its partners and rebranded its competitions as the Nintendo World Championships.\nThe Nintendo World Championships began March 8–11, 1990, in the Fair Park's Automobile Building in Dallas, Texas, and toured 29 cities across the United States. Players from three separate age groups (11 and below, 12–17, and 18 and above) competed across three days. The top two scorers then competed for the title of City Champion. The finalists won a trophy, , and a trip for two to the World Finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. The runners-up won a Power Pad and a Game Boy.\nThe World Finals were held December 7–9, 1990, conducted similarly to the City Championships and were located at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California within the \"Star Trek\" Theater, now \"Shrek 4-D\". There, contestants played a special \"Nintendo World Championships 1990\" cartridge for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nThe cartridge contains three customized minigames based upon the popular games \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985), \"Rad Racer\" (1987), and \"Tetris\" (1989). The objective is to achieve a high score according to a custom cumulative scoring formula across all games, within a total time limit of 6 minutes and 21 seconds.\nThree 1990 World Champion titles were given. Jeff Hansen won in the under-11 category, Thor Aackerlund won in the 12–17 category, and Robert Whiteman won in the 18+ category. There was no official competition round to crown a single winner. However, after the competition ended there was an informal face-off between the three winners, with Thor Aackerlund taking first place, Jeff Hansen taking second, and Robert Whiteman finishing third. The top winner in each age category was awarded a U.S. savings bond, a 1990 Geo Metro Convertible, a 40\" rear-projection television, and a golden Mario trophy. Runners up in each age category received a $1,000 U.S. savings bond and a silver Mario trophy.\nImmediately after winning the NWC, Thor Aackerlund became the official video game spokesperson for Camerica Corporation, a direct competitor to Nintendo. Jeff Hansen later became the United States representative to Japan to win the World Championships title in Tokyo, Japan, and again in Las Vegas at a rematch with the Japanese champion, Yuichi Suyama.\nNintendo sponsored similar competitions including the Nintendo Campus Challenge in 1991 and 1992, Nintendo PowerFest '94, and revived the Nintendo World Championships in 2015.\nCartridge.\nThe competition was based on the NES cartridge titled \"Nintendo World Championships 1990\". It is unknown how many gray cartridges were made, and the highest numbered is #353. Copies of the gray cartridge were given to the ninety finalists after the championships concluded. Another twenty-six gold copies are known to exist, similar to the gold cartridge design of \"The Legend of Zelda\", which were given as prizes in a separate contest by \"Nintendo Power\" magazine. Both versions have an exposed bank of DIP switches to set the amount of time the player has to complete the three games, shorter and longer than the 6 minutes 21 seconds used in the actual competition.\nThe \"Nintendo World Championships 1990\" Game Pak is considered to be the most valuable NES cartridge ever released, and one of the rarest. Collectors have paid six-digit prices for a single copy.\n2015.\nOn May 13, 2015, Nintendo announced the return of Nintendo World Championships for the 25th anniversary of the original event, as part of the company's E3 2015 coverage. Qualifying competitions began on May 30, 2015, in eight Best Buy locations across the United States. At each location, contestants competed for the high score in a custom mode of \"Ultimate NES Remix\". The winners from each of these eight locations, plus eight players invited by Nintendo (six speedrunners and two celebrity contestants), became the contestants for the live event. \nThe competition used an elimination tournament format with a repechage bracket named the Underground, with a wide history of Nintendo's game library. The live video of the final event was streamed online from Los Angeles on June 14, 2015; commentators included Audrey Drake of Nintendo Treehouse and competitive Pokémon VGC commentator Justin Flynn. An edited exclusive one hour television special aired on Disney XD later on in the year, featuring retrospective interviews with many contestants and a shortened overview of the competition. Notable competitors who failed to make it to the finale included Trihex, Arin Hanson, and The Mexican Runner.\nThe last contest consisted of custom levels within the then unreleased \"Super Mario Maker\" on Wii U, played by the two finalists: professional \"Smash Bros.\" player John Numbers, the qualifying player from New York City; and professional speedrunner Narcissa Wright. In the first two levels, the players were alternately blindfolded while the other played. The player who completed the levels the fastest would receive a 5-second advantage in the final level. In the final level, they raced simultaneously to the end, where Numbers won the championship title. \"Gamesradar\" said Numbers demonstrated \"impulsive mastery\" of the \"Super Mario Maker\" levels which were \"hellish\", \"sadistic\", \"evil\", and \"truly weird\". Shigeru Miyamoto made a surprise appearance to present a trophy to the winner, and an autographed New Nintendo 3DS XL system to each of the two finalists.\n2017.\nOn August 8, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the return of the Nintendo World Championships. Qualifying rounds took place from August 19, 2017, through September 10, 2017, at selected Best Buy locations across eight cities in the United States. John Numbers, the returning champion of 2015, was one of the 13-and-older qualifiers. Eight invited competitors were slated in advance to compete against the sixteen qualifiers, including Bayley and Asa Butterfield.\nThe main event was held at the Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom on October 7, 2017, and was streamed via YouTube and Twitch, and simulcast on Disney XD's \"D|XP\" block. As in 2015, it used an elimination tournament format including the returning Underground repechage bracket, showcasing select gameplay modes and levels from recent and retro games.\nThe overall winner was Thomas Gonda (Thomas G.), who defeated the 2015 champion John Numbers.\nReception.\nIn 2015, \"Gamesradar\" said the \"Super Mario Maker\" levels were \"hellish\", \"sadistic\", \"evil\", and \"truly weird\", summarizing: \"The \"Super Mario Maker\" climax ended Nintendo's championships on a pitch-perfect retro note.\" Contestant Joshua Ovenshire of Smosh Games said that the Nintendo World Championships should be \"a staple at every E3 ... I was a part of Nintendo history. That's where the magic is at.\"\nIn 2017, the Underground was noted to be generally more forgiving than 2015, as multiple contestants had the opportunity to advance."

Sweden as the hosts and West Germany, as the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 14 spots open for competition.\nQualification Process.\nThe qualification rounds for the four previous World Cups differed widely, with controversial rules and many withdrawals. From this tournament onwards, FIFA divided the teams into several continental zones, assigned a pre-determined number of places in the final tournament to each zone, and delegated the organisation of the qualifying tournaments to its confederations: UEFA of Europe, CONMEBOL of South America, NAFC of North America, CCCF of Central America and Caribbean, CAF of Africa and AFC of Asia (and OFC of Oceania after it was formed later).\nThe 16 spots available in the 1958 World Cup would be distributed among the continental zones as follows:\nHowever, FIFA also imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match because many teams qualified for previous World Cups without playing due to withdrawals of their opponents. Because Israel won the African and Asian zone under this circumstance, FIFA required them to enter a play-off against a team from Europe who initially did not qualify, with the winner of this play-off qualifying. Therefore, effectively in the end, a total of \"11.5 places\" were granted to Europe while only \"0.5 places\" were granted to Africa and Asia.\nA total of 46 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 89 qualifying matches were played, and 341 goals were scored (an average of 3.83 per match).\nListed below are the dates and results of the qualification rounds.\nConfederation qualification.\nCCCF and NAFC.\nThe 6 teams were divided into 2 groups with 3 teams each (Group 1 with teams from North America and Group 2 with teams from Central America and Caribbean). The teams played each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners advanced to the Final Round. The two teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis with the winner qualifying for the final tournament.\nCONMEBOL.\nThe 9 teams were divided into 3 groups of 3 teams each. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners would qualify.\nUEFA.\nThe 27 teams were divided into 9 groups, each featuring 3 teams. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners would qualify. Denmark, East Germany, Iceland and the Soviet Union made their debuts in World Cup qualification.\nInter-confederation play-offs: AFC/CAF v UEFA.\nA special play-off was created between Israel and the runner-up of one of the UEFA/CONMEBOL/CCCF/NAFC Groups, where the teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis, with the winner qualifying. Two-time champions Uruguay withdrew, while Northern Ireland and Italy had one final match yet to play, so all three were left out. Belgium, Bulgaria, Wales, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Peru, Bolivia and Costa Rica were left to draw. After Belgium refused, Wales, the runner-up of UEFA Group 4, was the team drawn from the UEFA group runners-up.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

A total of 32 events were contested at the two competitions, comprising 23 events for men and 9 for women.

Until the 1980s it was the premier sporting competition in Brisbane, attracting large crowds and broad media coverage. The Brisbane Rugby League however, had been in slow decline for some 15 years as large numbers of its players left to compete in the more lucrative Sydney Rugby League, and began to lose popular interest with the creation of the Brisbane Broncos in 1988. Also in 1988, the Sydney Rugby League de facto superseded the Brisbane Rugby League by going national and including the Brisbane and Gold Coast clubs. However, the BRL maintained legal top-flight status until the advent of the national Australian Rugby League premiership in 1995, which superseded both Brisbane Rugby League premiership and the Sydney Rugby League premiership. The Brisbane Rugby League premiership then became a second-tier competition until it ceased and was fully replaced at this level by the Queensland Cup before the 1998 season. The FOGS Cup, a third-tier competition under the NRL and Queensland Cup, changed its name to the Brisbane Rugby League in 2016.\nHistory.\nPredecessor: QRFL.\nThe Queensland Rugby Football League (QRFL) was formed in 1908 by seven former rugby union players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU). The new organisation was attacked by both the local press and the QRU for introducing professionalism, which they claimed would destroy the sport. The \"founding fathers\" of the QRFL included John Fihelly, an Australian Labor Party Member of Parliament who became Minister for Railways and Deputy Premier.\nThe first official club competition kicked off in Brisbane on 8 May 1909. Norths played against Souths before a handful of spectators at Brisbane Cricket Ground. Matches were played under the auspices of the Queensland Amateur Rugby Football League (later renamed Queensland Rugby League). The foundation clubs were:\nNote: Queensland Rugby League era statistics are not counted as Brisbane Rugby League statistics.\nSchism: establishment of the Brisbane Rugby League.\nIn 1922 the Brisbane Rugby Football League (Brisbane Rugby Football League, later Brisbane Rugby League) was formed out of dissatisfaction with the way the Queensland Rugby League ran the game. Those involved took particular exception to the salary being earned by Harry Sunderland as secretary of the Queensland Rugby League. The Brisbane Rugby League took control of the local competition. Competing in the Brisbane Rugby League competition that year were Brothers, Carltons, Coorparoo, University, Valley and Wests, with Past Grammars rejoining in 1924. Although the Queensland Rugby League attempted to regain control of the Brisbane Rugby League competition in 1923 and 1924, the Brisbane Rugby League remained steadfast and the dispute simmered into the next decade. so dire did the situation become, that by the late 1920s, the Queensland Rugby League commenced its own competition involving Ipswich clubs and two supporting Brisbane clubs.\nUntil 1932 Brisbane Exhibition Ground was the home of rugby league in the city. The complicated arrangement between the Brisbane Rugby League, Queensland Rugby League and Royal National Association (who administered the Exhibition Ground) led to Brisbane Cricket Ground being used for rugby league matches.\nIn 1933 district football was introduced to provide community support and player equalisation. This meant that players had to live within a certain distance of their club. Accordingly, Brisbane was divided into Eastern Suburbs (incorporating Coorparoo and Wynnum), Southern Suburbs (incorporating Carltons), Western Suburbs, Northern Suburbs (incorporating Past Grammars), Fortitude Valley and Past Brothers (whose players had to prove that they had attended a Christian Brothers school). In 1934, the University Amateur Rugby League Club folded and disappeared from the competition.\nIn 1953 the friction between the Queensland Rugby League and Brisbane Rugby League ended, with the Brisbane Rugby League being replaced by the Brisbane division of the Queensland Rugby League. Former Brisbane Rugby League chairman and Queensland Rugby League secretary Ron McAullife eventually secured the use of Lang Park as a permanent home for rugby league in Queensland. Teams that joined the Brisbane Rugby League competition around this time were South Coast (1952–1953), Wynnum-Manly (1951) and Redcliffe (1960).\nA then-record crowd at Lang Park of 19,824 saw Northern Suburbs defeat Fortitude Valley in the Brisbane Rugby League grand final in September 1961.\nGolden Years.\nIn 1967 the Queensland Rugby League removed the residential qualifications for players in Brisbane Rugby League clubs, meaning that players did not have to reside in their certain suburbs to play for their teams. This reduced community support for teams, and club decisions began to be made on a more commercial basis.\nThis coincided with the commencement of television broadcasts of Brisbane Rugby League games in the same year. The money made from jersey sponsorships and advertising hoardings at grounds was not able to compete with poker machine money available to Sydney Rugby League clubs in the Sydney Rugby League, and an increasing number of players left the Brisbane Rugby League. This also affected the popularity of the Bulimba Cup which had been held between the cities of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba since the 1930s.\nIn 1978 the premiership trophy, the Kirks Cup was replaced by the Winfield Cup.\nThe Queensland Rugby League commissioned Eric White Associates to investigate the administrative structure of the game in Queensland in 1977. One of the recommendations was the creation of a statewide competition. The Winfield State League was created in 1982. The State League competition ran in parallel to the Brisbane Rugby League competition from 1982 to 1995. Also, like with Sydney's competition, Brisbane's competition was also called the Winfield Cup during the 1980s, due to sponsorship from Winfield cigarettes. The Queensland Cup would eventually replace both the State league and the Brisbane Rugby League premiership in 1996 and 1998.\nIn the 1980s, two further teams were added to the Brisbane Rugby League competition: Ipswich (1986) and Logan (1987).\nDespite some New South Wales Rugby League (Sydney Rugby League) premiership games being re-broadcast during late night timeslots from the late 1970s, the Brisbane Rugby League remained the more popular competition in Queensland until 1988 with the weekly live broadcast of the Match of the Round being played at Lang Park.\nDecline.\nIn 1986 the New South Wales Rugby League decided to allow a team from Brisbane to enter the Sydney Rugby League premiership. While the New South Wales Rugby League was originally negotiating a Brisbane team sponsored by the Queensland Rugby League, a private bid in the form of the Brisbane Broncos was instead accepted by the New South Wales Rugby League. The Brisbane Broncos debuted in the Sydney Rugby League premiership in 1988.\nAs the Broncos began to represent Brisbane at rugby league in the public eye the Brisbane Rugby League competition entered the terminal phase of its decline. The dominance of the Brisbane Broncos in the media resulted in the Brisbane Rugby League losing live coverage of games and receiving only minor interest from the sports media. The drop in interest saw the Brisbane Rugby League, its clubs and its junior development base incurring significant and crippling financial losses. Several longstanding clubs were not able to survive the impact over the coming years.\nFrom 1988, Brisbane Rugby League players weren't chosen to represent Queensland again. The Brisbane Rugby League premiership was fully superseded by the ARL Premiership which took nationwide first-class status in 1995. The BRL became a state competition from 1995-97 until the Queensland Cup, which became a league-style competition in 1998, superseded the BRL as the top state league. Redcliffe won the last Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final in 1997 defeating Easts 35–6, and the league was declared defunct.\nReturn of the Brisbane Rugby League Premiership.\nOn 26 September 2014, the South East Queensland Division announced that they will be scrapping the existing FOGS Cup structure and reforming the Brisbane Rugby League as the state's secondary competition. Legally, although they share the same name, this competition is completely separate from the original BRL.\nBrisbane Rugby League Club Teams.\nR.G. = Reserve Grade side to the Senior Grade side.\nRepresentative Brisbane Rugby League team.\nSelected players from the Brisbane Rugby League clubs, represented Brisbane in a representative team called Brisbane Firsts or Brisbane Capitals against various Sydney Rugby League clubs or against Sydney Firsts or Sydney Capitals\nFirst-grade wins, losses, win percentage and draws.\nTeams in bold still existed during the at the end of the 1st-grade competition in 1994."

He led the nation in scoring his sophomore season. Undrafted, he was then signed by the New Jersey Devils on June 24, 1984. He played three seasons with the Devils until he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on September 15, 1987, along with Kirk McLean for Patrik Sundstrom and a fourth round pick in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft (Matt Ruchty). The following season, when Greg C. Adams was traded to Vancouver, the younger Greg Adams became identified by the nickname Greg \"Gus\" Adams.\nAdams would go on to play eight seasons in Vancouver. During the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Adams scored a goal in what many Canucks fans believe to be one of the greatest moments in team history. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Adams scored the game-winning goal in overtime, catapulting the team to their second-ever Stanley Cup Finals berth. He would also score the overtime winner in Game 1 of that Stanley Cup Finals against the New York Rangers.\nAdams was traded to the Dallas Stars in the 1994–95 season. After four seasons in Dallas, he moved on to play for the Phoenix Coyotes for two seasons (1998–99 and 1999–2000). After Phoenix, Adams played one season (2000–01) with the Florida Panthers and then retired from the NHL.\nAdams was a decent goal scorer who managed to score more than 30 goals four times in his career and had nine seasons with more than 20. Twice he scored over 70 points, once with the Devils (77) and once with the Canucks (76). Unfortunately, Adams was often plagued with the injury bug and only once managed to play one full season."

In his final year in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Victoria Cougars he scored 62 goals playing on a line with Barry Pederson. He spent the 1980–81 season with the Flyers' farm team, the Maine Mariners, and impressed in a six-game stint in Philadelphia, scoring three goals. The following season he appeared in 33 games, scoring 19 points.\nAdams was traded to the Hartford Whalers in the Mark Howe trade in the summer of 1982. In the 1982–83 season, he spent his first full season in the NHL, scoring 10 goals and 23 points in 79 games. He established himself as a gritty, physical presence and registered 216 penalty minutes (PIM), the highest total of his career.\nAdams was dealt again in the summer of 1983, this time to the Washington Capitals. While the Whalers had just 19 wins in 1982–83, the Capitals were one of the deepest squads in the league, and he found it more difficult to get ice time. In his first two years in Washington, he scored just eight goals in 108 games, and was demoted briefly to the American Hockey League (AHL). However, he established himself as a key member of the team in the 1985–86 season, and put up surprising numbers with 18 goals and 56 points, along with 152 PIM. He continued to perform well over the next two seasons, posting totals of 14 and 15 goals while providing his usual physical presence. \nFor the 1988–89 season, Adams was moved to the defending Stanley Cup champions Edmonton Oilers. However, he struggled to find a niche with the Oilers, scoring just four goals in 49 games, and was dealt again at the trade deadline, this time to the Vancouver Canucks. This created one of the more unusual situations in NHL history, as the Canucks' lineup already featured star winger Greg \"Gus\" Adams.\nAdams's stint in Vancouver was brief, scoring four goals in 12 games for the team. He was claimed in the 1989 NHL Waiver Draft by the Quebec Nordiques just prior to the 1989–90 season, but spent most of the season in the AHL. He finished the season with the Detroit Red Wings before retiring.\nAdams finished his career with 84 goals and 227 career points in 545 NHL games, and recorded 1,173 PIM.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter Adams retired from the NHL, he moved back to Duncan, British Columbia, close to where he grew up.

        "text": "The 1906 Tour de France was the fourth edition of the Tour de France, and the second to use the points system. Taking place from 4 to 29 July, the total race distance was run over 13 stages, with the winner averaging . New to this year's edition were the mountain climbs in the Massif Central. However, like its predecessors, cheating and sabotage still took place. Four competitors were disqualified for taking trains as a shortcut and spectators threw nails on the road. However, this did not stop René Pottier from taking a big lead in the first stages. Free of the tendinitis that had plagued his 1905 chances, he dominated the entire race.\nInnovations and changes.\nTour organiser Henri Desgrange had been happy with the increased length of the 1905 Tour de France, and decided to put even more stages in the 1906 version.\nThe introduction of mountain stages had also been successful, so this edition included not only the Vosges, but also the Massif Central.\nThe increased length made it possible to follow the borders of France, and in 1906 the perimeter was closely followed.\n The points system in the 1905 Tour de France had been successful enough in reducing cheating, so the Tour organisers used it again in the 1906 Tour de France, with a few changes: whereas in 1905, time differences still had some effect on the points distribution, in 1906 time differences were unimportant, and points were only given for the order in which the cyclists finished. The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, et cetera. After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and the results from the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.\nThe first stage ended in Lille and the second stage started in Douai; this was the first time that a stage did not start where the previous stage ended. And, for the first time, the Tour also went outside France. The second stage crossed the border into Germany (Metz in Alsace-Lorraine, then part of Germany), and several days later riders visited Italy (Ventimiglia) and Spain (Irun).\nThe 1906 Tour also saw the introduction of the \"flamme rouge\" (red flame), a red flag that indicates that the cyclists only have one kilometre to go.\nParticipants.\nThere were 100 cyclists signed up for the race, but only 76 of them came to the start. One of the absentees was Henri Cornet, winner of the 1904 Tour de France. Four cyclists were Belgian, one was Luxembourgian (later winner François Faber), two were German, and the rest were French. Louis Trousselier, winner of the 1905 Tour de France, was present. The riders were not grouped in teams, but some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together. Before the race started, most was expected from Cadolle, Aucouturier, Georget, Pottier, Trousselier, Dortignac and Petit-Breton.\nAs in 1905, the cyclists were divided in two categories, the \"coureurs de vitesse\" and the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\", where the riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors had not been so enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, more than half of the cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.\nRace overview.\nAs in previous years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders by trying to impede their opponents. On the first stage, nails had been thrown on the road, and all cyclists except Lucien Petit-Breton punctured. This stage was won by Emile Georget in a sprint.\nIn the second stage, René Pottier, who had shown his climbing abilities in the previous edition, aimed for the victory. He was stopped after with mechanical failure, and he lost 58 minutes. The other main contenders worked together to stay away from Pottier, but Pottier chased them for , caught them before the finish, and even left them behind, winning the stage with a margin of 1'30\" on Petit-Breton and more than 9 minutes on the rest.\nIn the third stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified for taking the train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which had been the first real mountain in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.\nPottier also won the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says that he decided to stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, and drank it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall classification firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form in the second half of the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.\nResults.\nStage results.\nAfter the 13th stage, the race was followed by two timed exhibition laps on the Velodrome in Paris, the result of which was not counted for the overall classification. The winner was Emile Georget, who finished the in 2:07.20.\nGeneral classification.\nOne hundred cyclists had entered for the 1906 Tour de France; only 82 of them showed up at the start. Only 49 cyclists finished the first stage, and the number of active cyclists quickly fell to 37 in stage two, 29 in stage three, until 16 after stage eight. At that point, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages. At the end of the Tour de France, only 14 cyclists finished. The cyclists were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, but they were not allowed to work together.\nOther classifications.\nLucien Petit-Breton was the winner of the \"machines poinçonnées\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named René Pottier the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.\nAftermath.\nThe Tour organisers did not make many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they had worked in the 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed a little bit in 1912 before being replaced by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.\nRené Pottier would not defend his title in the 1907 Tour de France, because he would commit suicide before, after discovering that his wife had had an affair while he was riding the Tour. Petit-Breton and Georget would start again in the 1907 Tour and duel for the overall victory, which would be won by Petit-Breton.\nTo honor Pottier's achievements on the Ballon d'Alsace, a monument was placed for him on top of that mountain."

        "text": "Thomas Franklin McDonald (July 26, 1934 – September 24, 2018) was an American football flanker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles, the Dallas Cowboys, the Los Angeles Rams, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Cleveland Browns. He played college football as a halfback for the Oklahoma Sooners. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nMcDonald agreed to repeat the eighth grade, because his father felt the extra time would give him a chance to grow. He attended Roy High School in Roy, New Mexico, with an enrollment of around 150 students during his freshman year, where he played quarterback.\nAs a sophomore, he transferred to Highland High School in Albuquerque. As a senior, he averaged over 20 yards per carry in football and set the state scoring record with 157 points.\nHe also set the city scoring record in basketball, and won five gold medals in the state track meet (100, 220, low hurdles and 2 relays).\nCollege career.\nMcDonald accepted a football scholarship from the University of Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma basketball coach Bruce Drake, saw him play in an All-star football game in Albuquerque and encouraged him to have his parent write a letter to the football head coach Bud Wilkinson. Based on Drake's recommendation, Wilkinson invited McDonald to visit the school's campus and offered him a football scholarship soon thereafter.\nIn 1953, he spent the season on the freshman team. In 1954, he was a backup running back, registering 27 carries for 128 yards, 2 receptions for 28 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nIn 1955, he was named a starter at running back, tallying 114 carries for 715 yards (led the team), 16 rushing touchdowns (led the team), 7 receptions for 110 yards (second on the team) and one receiving touchdown (tied for the team lead). He also was a passer on the option play. He became the first player in school history to score a touchdown in every game of a season.\nIn 1956, he led the team with 119 carries for 853 yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, 12 receptions for 282 yards and 4 receiving touchdowns. At the end of the season he received the Maxwell Award as the nation's most outstanding college football player and finished third in the 1956 Heisman voting.\nHe excelled as a running back, never played in a losing game and was one of the key players during the school's 47-game winning streak. In 1985, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nMcDonald was also a member of the Delta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity while he was at Oklahoma.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nMcDonald was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 1957 NFL draft. As a rookie, he was moved to wide receiver after he replaced an injured Bill Stribling in the ninth game of the season, making a 61-yard reception and a 25-yard receiving touchdown from quarterback Sonny Jurgensen.\nHe was a part of the team that won the 1960 NFL Championship against Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers. In the contest, he had a 35-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Norm Van Brocklin.\nIn 1961, he led the NFL in receiving yards (1,144) and touchdowns (13). Against the New York Giants, he had 7 receptions for 237 yards and 2 touchdowns, which still is a franchise single-game record.\nOn March 20, 1964, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for Sam Baker, John Meyers, and Lynn Hoyem.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn 1964, he was switched from flanker to split end, because the Cowboys already had an accomplished flanker in Franklin Clarke and split end Billy Howton had just retired. Looking to improve the receiving corps to help the young quarterback Don Meredith, they also traded with the Pittsburgh Steelers to get Buddy Dial.\nIn his only season with the club, he registered 46 receptions for 612 yards (13.3 average) and 2 touchdowns (one of them against the Eagles). In 1965, with the emergence of rookie Bob Hayes he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for placekicker Danny Villanueva on May 14.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nMcDonald recorded a career-high 67 receptions for 1,036 yards and 9 touchdowns in 1965. He was selected to his last Pro Bowl. In 1967 he was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a draft choice.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn September 10, 1968, he was waived following a season with 33 receptions for 436 yards and 4 touchdowns.\nCleveland Browns.\nIn 1968, McDonald was picked up by the Cleveland Browns for whom he caught 7 receptions for 113 yards and one touchdown. With the retirement of Raymond Berry the previous year, McDonald was technically the league's active leader in career receiving yards during the off-season but was surpassed in Game 1 by Don Maynard.\nHis last NFL game was the 1968 NFL Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts. On March 15, 1969, he announced his retirement from pro football.\nLegacy.\nMcDonald was selected for six Pro Bowls, led the league in touchdown receptions twice (1958, 1961), and led the league in receiving yards once (1961). McDonald was the last non-kicker to play in the NFL without a facemask.\nHe finished his career with 495 receptions for 8,410 yards and 84 touchdowns, the second-highest total of touchdown receptions in NFL history at the time. He also rushed for 22 yards and gained 1,459 yards and a touchdown returning punts and kickoffs on special teams, giving him 9,891 career all-purpose yards. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.\nPersonal life and death.\nFollowing the Eagles NFL Championship victory, McDonald wrote an autobiography: \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\", published by Chilton in 1962.\nHe also dabbled in art. He owned Tommy McDonald Enterprises, a studio that did portrait paintings and plaques, mainly of athletes. He did not paint the portraits himself, but had two painters who created them, although he signed them as being by McDonald (Enterprises). A portrait of Joe DiMaggio sold at auction for $4,000.\nHe became great friends with Pro Football Hall of Fame writer, Ray Didinger, who was a huge fan of Tommy's during his time with the Eagles. As a child, Didinger would spend time with Tommy at Eagles training camp in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Didinger helped get Tommy into the Hall of Fame, and then went on to present Tommy into the Hall of Fame. Didinger also wrote a 75-minute play, \"Tommy and Me\" which tells the tale of Ray and Tommy.\nHe died on September 24, 2018, at the age of 84. \"Tommy McDonald lived life like he played the game of football,\" Pro Football Hall of Fame president and CEO C. David Baker said in a statement. \"He was charismatic, passionate and had fun. He was such a character. Heaven is a happier place today.\nHe is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head."

His fast, all-court-game stumped Godbout...\" Bédard won the Oakville Invitational at Oakville, Ontario.\n1961.\nBédard reached the semifinal of the Canadian Open where he led Whitney Reed two sets to one, but lost in a marathon five sets. Reed won the final over Mike Sangster. Bédard also won the Ontario Championships in August against John Swann. Bédard won the Oakville Invitational at Oakville, Ontario.\n1962.\nBédard won the Oakville Invitational at Oakville, Ontario defeating Paul Cranis in the final in three straight sets. He also won the Verdun Invitational at Woodland Park Tennis Club beating Val Harit in the final.\n1963.\nBédard again reached the semifinal of the Canadian Open played at Vancouver on grass, where he lost to Whitney Reed in four sets, Reed again winning the tournament.\n1964.\nBédard won the Oakville Invitational in June over George Sokol, winner of the Eastern States Clay Court and the Middle States Clay Court, in the final in three straight sets. Bédard lost in the final of the Quebec Open in August to Ronald Holmberg. \"The fair-haired Texan steadily outplayed Bédard over the clay courts of the Civil Employees' Tennis Club\".\n1965.\nIn June, Bédard beat Godbout in the final of the Oakville Invitational tournament. In August, Bédard won the Quebec Open Championships on clay at the Montreal Monklands Tennis Club in dramatic fashion, the same clay court venue where he had won the 1957 Canadian Open. Bédard defeated Billy Lenoir in the semifinal in five sets after Lenoir, the Cincinnati Masters Clay Court champion that year, had a two sets to love lead over Bédard, when many in the crowd then left the stadium. Bédard stated that at that point \"I realized what I was doing wrong with my serve and my forehand, and all of a sudden it came back.\" He then faced defending champion Holmberg, an outstanding clay player, in the final. Bédard lost the first two games of the match to Holmberg but then won the next eight games. Late in the second set, Bedard sprained his ankle and then trailed 5 to 2 in the third set. However, he rallied and won the last three games to win the set at 8 to 6, and the match in three straight sets. Bédard stated, \"I don't think that [Holmberg] was prepared for the game I was ready to give him.\" The following day at the Quebec City International round robin, still recovering from his sprained ankle, Bédard defeated Pierre Darmon after trailing 5 to 3 in the deciding set, winning at 10 to 8, after Darmon had twice served for the match. Darmon would eventually win the tournament. Bédard won his final match of the event over Bobby Wilson. Bédard lost to Lester Sack in three straight sets at the Canadian Open and Sack would be runner-up that year to Holmberg. Bédard returned the favour by beating Sack in three straight sets at the U.S. Open in the first round. Bédard was ranked the No. 1 Canadian player for the 11th consecutive and final time in 1965.\n1966.\nBédard came from 5-3 down in the final set to beat Godbout in the final of the Dow Invitational at La bohème Tennis Club in June. The following week he successfully defended his Oakville Invitational title, defeating Val Harit, John Powless, and Godbout in the final. He lost to Mike Belkin in the final of the Quebec Open in July. \"Bédard started strongly but the toil of the three-and-a-half hour final began to show in the final set when cramps completely immobilized him\".\n1967.\nBédard announced his retirement in August, having played only a limited schedule in the previous few years, usually consisting of just a few Canadian events in the summer months each year.\n1969.\nBédard won the gold medal in men's singles tennis in the 1969 Canada Games in Halifax. He defeated Don McCormick, a later Canadian No. 1 ranked player, in the Gold Medal match.\nProfessional.\n1970.\nIn 1970, Bédard claimed he was still retired and only entered a few events because they \"fell during his holidays\". He won the Quebec Open Championships, which included wins over much younger players, including Jim Boyce in a four-set match. Boyce was a later Canadian National men's singles champion (closed) and Canadian No. 1, and had already won the Western Ontario Open in that same 1970 season. In the semifinal Bédard defeated Bailey Brown, winner of multiple U.S. clay titles, and in the final Australian Ken Binns, winner of multiple Australian tennis and squash titles. Bédard was awarded the first prize money for the event. This was a record seventh Quebec Open title for Bédard.\nSeniors/veterans tennis.\nBédard has remained active playing in senior's tennis over the years, in particular doubles with his sons.\nBédard won the Canadian National outdoor singles championship in 2006 for Age 70 players, defeating Crichton Wilson in the final.\nBédard won the Sid Stevens Senior National Tennis Championships for the 80-and-over category in 2015. His former Davis Cup team-mate, Lorne Main, won the 85-and-over category.\nIn 2015, Bédard participated with another Pan American Games medalist in a doubles match at a museum house which contained early tennis equipment.\nRanking.\nBédard was considered among the top ten clay court players in the world. At the height of his career, he was unbeaten in 216 consecutive matches against Canadian players. Bédard was the top-ranked Canadian player in singles for 11 consecutive years from 1955 to 1965. During this time he lost only once to a fellow Canadian in competition, to Reider Getz of Vancouver at the Verdun invitational in July 1964. Bédard was ranked no lower than third in Canada between 1952 and 1970. He was first ranked No. 1 in Quebec in 1953.\nDavis Cup.\nBédard was a Canadian Davis Cup member from 1953 to 1961, and again in 1967, and had a career win-loss record of 11 and 22, 8 and 15 in singles, and 3 and 7 in doubles.\nBédard lost all three of the Davis Cup rubbers he contested in 1953. Despite this Canada did go on to face the Americans in the final of the America Group, played in Canada. Bédard and his partner Henri Rochon lost the doubles match in their quarter-final tie against Mexico, played at the Mount Royal Tennis Club; fortunately, Lorne Main won both of his singles rubbers, including the Round 4 match over Mario Llamas, which gave Canada an insurmountable 3–1 lead. (It was the last time Canada beat Mexico until 2001.) In the next round, also played at Mount Royal, Canada won the first three rubbers to seal victory against Cuba. He played his first singles match, losing the Round 5 dead rubber to Orlando Garrido in four sets. The American Group final was played at the Mount Royal Tennis Club in Montreal on grass, chosen by the Canadian Davis Cup Association, even though the Canadian players (Rochon, Main, and Bédard) were all specialists on clay, and the American team won 5–0. Bédard's match was a singles dead rubber four-set loss, this time to American Tut Bartzen.\nIn 1954, Canada opened with a tight tie win over Chile 3–2, again in Montreal. After Main came back from 2 sets to 1 down in Round 1, Bédard got his first Cup singles win, in straight sets over Ricardo Balbiers. Main and Paul Willey next lost in straight sets to Andrés Hammersley and Chilean star Luis Ayala. Main came through to seal victory with hard fought marathon win over Hammersley in five sets. Bédard lost the fifth match dead rubber to Ayala. Canada lost to Mexico 4–1 in Mexico City.\nCanada began 1955 Cup play with an expected comfortable opening win over the West Indies. Bédard defeated Trinidadian Ian McDonald in four sets in the first match and teamed with Don Fontana to win the doubles rubber in straight sets, as Canada won 5–0. Canada next faced 1954 runner-up and eventual 1955 champion Australia in the America Group final. The tie was chosen by the Canadian Davis Cup Association to be played in Montreal at the Mount Royal Tennis Club, on grass, even though both Bédard and Main were outstanding on clay. Bédard had the unenviable task of opening proceedings against World No. 2 (amateur) Ken Rosewall, and lost the match in four sets, Lorne Main lost to Hartwig. Bédard and Fontana lost the doubles rubber in four sets as well, Fontana lost a dead rubber to Hoad in singles. Bédard's won sets were the only two sets during the tie that Canada won.\nIn the 1956 Davis Cup, Canada again opened with a win over the West Indies, this time in Port of Spain on clay courts, the Canadians' most successful surface, and dropping only one set. This set up an encounter with the United States in Victoria, British Columbia, with the Canadian Davis Cup Association again choosing grass courts even though the Canadian players were clay court specialists. Fontana was soundly defeated by Ham Richardson to open the tie. In the second match, Bédard won the first set against Herb Flam, 6–2, before eventually losing the match. The two Canadians then came back from dropping the first set to go up two sets to one against Ron Holmberg and Barry MacKay in the doubles, only to lose the last two sets, and with it the tie. Bédard lost a dead rubber to Richardson in straight sets and Paul Willey gave the Canadians some consolation in winning the fifth match over MacKay.\nIn 1957, Canada played just one Cup tie, losing 2–3 to Brazil in Montreal. Bédard played the opening match and twice came from a set down against Carlos-Alberto Fernandes only to lose the close fifth set. Fontana squared matters in winning the second match over Armando Vieira, also in five sets. In the crucial doubles rubber, Fernandes and Viera proved too good, winning in four. Fontana then went down in straight sets in the fourth match.\nCanada started the 1958 campaign superbly, playing at home on clay in Toronto, sweeping aside Cuba without conceding more than 4 games in any set. At the same venue, the Toronto CS &amp; C Club on clay, they next faced the Americans. Canada managed to win just two sets. Fontana was soundly beat by MacKay, one, two, and five. Bédard played Whitney Reed closer but also went down in straight sets. He and Fontana then lost the doubles in straight sets as well. The U.S. went on to retake the Cup in the finals from holders Australia.\nThe following year after an opening round bye, Canada faced Australia in Montreal in the group final. The Canadian Davis Cup Association selected a grass surface to host the tie, although Bédard was a clay specialist. The Australians fielded a team featuring three future icons: Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Neale Fraser. Canada won only two sets in two dead rubbers. Fontana lost the first singles match against Emerson. Next Bédard lost to Laver, receiving the only foot fault in his career while serving at 5-6 and 15–30 in the first set. (The official was a French Canadian.) Australia then won the tie by taking the doubles rubber, with Emerson and Fraser defeating Fontana and Bédard. In consolation, Bédard and François Godbout had taken the first sets off of Emerson and Laver in the last two matches.\nCanada played just one tie in 1960, an opening round loss, once more to the United States by a score 0 matches to 5 score. On clay in Quebec City this time, Bédard started well, winning the first two sets against Tut Bartzen. Fontana took only 6 games off of Barry MacKay in the second match. The two Canucks made a stand in the first set of the doubles taking it to 12 games all before succumbing and losing the next two sets handily. Bédard won Canada's third set of the tie in the fourth match.\nIn 1961, Canada once more lost in the first round of Cup competition – they would not win a Cup tie again in fact until 1966. The tie was held at Civil Employees Tennis Club, Quebec City on clay, and Bédard was certainly not at fault for the loss to Mexico as he won the opening rubber over Mario Llamas – as well as his second singles match, a dead rubber, over Rafael Osuna in four sets. François Godbout did not fare as well, losing both of his singles matches. The two Quebeckers played a very close doubles match but came up just short in what would prove to be the decisive encounter.\nAfter six years absent from play, Bédard returned for a 1967 tie versus Great Britain, played in Bournemouth on shale. (From 1966 through 1969 Canada competed in the Europe Group.) Young Canadian star Belkin got proceedings off well for the visitors defeating Mike Sangster in four sets. In the second match Bédard twice won a set to level before losing to Roger Taylor in the fifth 5–7. Belkin and Keith Carpenter then battled Taylor and Bobby Wilson to a 12–10 fifth set, which they lost. At one point, the Canadian doubles team had led two sets to love and 5–2 in the third, Carpenter missing a high volley. In the fifth set the Canadian team held five match points, some of them on serve. Belkin started very strongly against Taylor in the fourth match, winning the first two sets by a 6–2 score and holding four match points against Taylor. The home player however came back to win the final three sets of a close match. Bédard then lost the fifth match dead rubber to Sangster.\nIn March 2023, Bédard acclaimed the Canadian Davis Cup victory in 2022 as the greatest win in Canadian tennis history.\nPlaying style and assessment.\nBédard was a natural, muscular multi-sport athlete, whose excellence in baseball and ice hockey led to contract offers from professional teams, including the New York Rangers ice hockey team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Fred Perry stated that Bédard was the most complete athlete in the 1954 Wimbledon tournament and noted his competitive zeal in matches.\nHe received only one season of tennis coaching, at UCLA. His academic career left little time for tennis practice, most of which was with his wife and children at his home backyard courts. His wife and sons were excellent players.\nHis playing style was described by Lucien Laverdure, a racket ace also inducted into the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame in 1991, in his book \"Tennis Mon Obsession\", published around 1965: \"[Bédard's] dominant qualities of determination, patience, strength, control, combined with an extraordinary sense of anticipation led him straight to the goal he had set for himself and far beyond\".\nLaverdure later remarked in a 2012 assessment, \"One of Bédard's competitors, Don Fontana, stated that his physical conditioning was most remarkable: he spoke of rare speed (Bédard ran the 100 meters in 10.3 seconds!), and of superb eye-hand co-ordination, and of intense concentration. It is through perseverance and motivation that Robert Bédard will succeed in triumphing in tennis: he will never have enough time to perfect his technique and bring it up to the level of European or American players who were training at the year long. A bit like Rafael Nadal, Bédard excelled more on clay and exhausted his opponents: I am not comparing his level of play here to that of the Spaniard but rather trying to highlight his qualities as a player.\"\nLaverdure further referenced that \"Raymond Summers, a Toronto journalist wrote (1956) that it would have been better for [Bédard] to spend a few seasons working on his shots than to engage in international competitions, referring to a lack of technique to deal with this elite level. He will add that Bédard had to compensate with exhausting work combined with great determination and enormous perseverance to achieve his goals. In short, we can conclude that Robert Bédard played instinctively and that he was above all motivated by his desire to win; if he had had the chance to perfect his basic skills, he could have performed at another level and who knows, reached heights that Canadian players still dream of. It must be admitted all the same that it shows the psychological nature of [his] character in addition to illustrating what type of man he was in life, outside of sports practice.\"\nTennis executive.\nBédard served as the president of Tennis Quebec from 1967 to 1970 and the vice president of Tennis Canada from 1973 to 1977.\nHonours.\nBédard was awarded the Queen's Jubilee Prize in 1977. He was inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame and Quebec Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. He was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was inducted into the Aurora Sports Hall of Fame in 2013 as an inaugural inductee.\nThe St. Andrew's College Bédard Athletic Centre is named after him.\nCommentating.\nBédard was a tennis colour commentator for coverage of a round robin tournament held in Canada in 1967 and again in 1968, that featured four of the world's top amateur players. Coverage was broadcast on CBC Television. He was joined in the booth by play-by-play announcer Bob McDevitt.\nOutside of tennis/personal.\nAn amateur tennis player in the days before Open tennis, Bédard has been a long-time educator, first as a French and geography school teacher at Bishop's College School in Sherbrooke, Quebec and as longtime headmaster (principal) for 16 years at St. Andrew's College in Aurora, Ontario where he and his wife Anne still live.\nOne of Bédard's near neighbours in Aurora was his former Davis Cup team-mate Lorne Main, who lived in an adjacent town about 15 minutes drive away."

They are organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of world cycling.\nThe first three finishers in each discipline at the World Championships are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winner of each discipline is also entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in events of the same discipline until the following year's World Championships. Unlike other UCI-sanctioned mountain-bike races, the competitors in the World Championships represent national rather than commercial teams. The World Championships are usually held towards the end of the season.\nHistory.\nThe first UCI Mountain Bike World Championships took place in Durango, Colorado, USA in 1990 and featured only cross-country and downhill events. A separate UCI Trials World Championships had been held since 1986. From 2000 to 2016, the mountain bike and trials disciplines were combined and run as the UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships. Beginning in 2017, the UCI world championships in trials will be run as part of the newly-created UCI Urban Cycling World Championships.\nThe cross-country team relay was added in 1999. The dual slalom was added in 2000 but replaced by four-cross in 2002. Mountain bike marathon was included on the schedule at the 2003 championships in Lugano, but run separately as the UCI Mountain Bike Marathon World Championships from 2004 onwards. The cross-country eliminator was introduced in 2012 but will be part of the UCI Urban Cycling World Championships from 2017 onwards. In 2014 and 2015 the four-cross events were held separately from the other disciplines as the UCI Four-Cross World Championships, but were again included alongside the other mountain-biking disciplines in 2016.

        "text": "Cycling Australia (CA), the trading name of the Australian Cycling Federation Inc, was the national governing body for bicycle racing in Australia, and represented the interests of affiliated cycling clubs and State federations. It covered the disciplines of road, track, mountain bike, cyclo-cross, and BMX.\nIn 2013, Cycling Australia had nearly 50,000 members including Mountain Bike Australia (MTBA) and BMX Australia (BMXA) members. In late November 2020, the three organisations rebranded as AusCycling.\nCycling Australia was a member of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and the Oceania Cycling Confederation (OCC). It was also recognised by the Australian Government, the Australian Olympic Committee, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and the Australian Paralympic Committee.\nHistory.\nAfter World War II, the two organisations controlling cycling were the Australian Cycling Council and the Amateur Cyclists’ Association of Australia. In 1963, the UCI gave Australia \"approximately 12 months to form one controlling body, to be recognised as the Australian Cycling Federation\". It took more than 30 years for that to happen.\nUnder the direction of Charlie Walsh at the Australian Institute of Sport and national cycling coach from 1980 to 2001, Australia's international cycling performance ranking moved from between 20 and 30 in track cycling in the world, to the number one ranked nation in 1993 and 1994, and placed third at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.\nThe national coaching team of Shayne Bannan, Martin Barras, Ian McKenzie and Neil Stephens built on this foundation to take Australia to the leading nation in track cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\nIn late 2011, federal Sports Minister Kate Lundy called for an investigation into Cycling Australia. A review by Justice James Wood produced a 95-page report which described the organisation's set-up as outdated and complicated. In 2012, the national coach Matt White was sacked due to his admissions regarding performance-enhancing drugs. Stephen Hodge stepped down as vice-president for similar reasons following the publicity surrounding the Lance Armstrong doping allegations.\nThe federation suffered financial problems in the early 2010s, after the approval of a strategy in 2010, which attempted to increase Cycling Australia's revenue through a programme of events organisation, led to the organisation making significant losses, compounded by lower than expected sponsorship revenue. Under the subsequent short-term presidency of Orica–GreenEDGE team owner Gerry Ryan, the federation's involvement in events organisation reduced, a new board was appointed and a A$2 million loan package was agreed with the Australian Sports Commission, state affiliates and Mountain Bike Australia.\nIn November 2020, Cycling Australia was amalgamated with two other national cycling bodies BMX Australia and Mountain Bike Australia to form AusCycling the national sporting organisation representing all cycling disciplines in Australia.\nDepartments.\nCycling Australia had eight operation departments.\nCommissions.\nCycling Australia had nine advisory and planning commissions.\nAffiliates.\nCycling Australia was affiliated with following organisations as of 2013:\nState associations.\nThere is a bicycle racing body in each Australian state and territory:"

        "title": "Major League Baseball schedule",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months – a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 26½ weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States or Canada before the official Opening Day. It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 22 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (3 games in the Wild Card series, 5 games in the Division Series, 7 games each in the League Championship Series/World Series).\nThe regular season is constructed from series. Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game, or, formerly, a one-game playoff to determine a postseason berth); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark. Teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week. Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday. Teams start and end their season on a weekend and play for 26½ weeks. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play 27 weekend series and 25 mid-week series for 52 total series (16 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 16 inter-league series). A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.\nBeginning with the 2023 season, teams play a balanced schedule as follows: thirteen games are played against each of the four other teams in their own division (52 games total), six or seven games against each of the other ten teams in their own league (64 games), four games against one \"geographic rival\" from the other league, and three games each against the other fourteen teams from the other league, for 46 total interleague games. Under this schedule, divisional games consist of two, three or four-game series, intraleague games consist of three or four-game series, and the interleague games consist of two two-game series against the geographic rival,(One series home and one away) and a single three-game series against the other interleague opponents (home team alternates every year).\nNote that rainouts and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders. However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there is no impact on the divisional or wild card races. For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was originally cancelled due to rain. Because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it did not affect the divisional race, the game was not rescheduled. In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it played a part in the division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins.\nFrom 1953 to 1981, Harry Simmons was responsible for devising the Major League Baseball schedule. Henry and Holly Stephenson, a husband-and-wife team, were in charge of constructing the MLB calendar for over two decades (1981-2004). For the 2005 schedule, the MLB selected the Sports Scheduling Group, a small company located outside Pittsburgh, to craft the schedule for that year. Each year, the MLB considers the scheduling proposals from various external groups.\n19th century.\nThis account gives the length of the major league \"championship season\" schedule by league and year. During this era, there were a number of different leagues that would be deemed Major League.\nPrior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs. Some may have practically dictated their arrangements with some others, but there was no central control or coordination.\nThe listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule. For example, the National League (NL) scheduled 84 games during 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882 – that is, four seasons from 1879, ending before 1883, the next listing. 1876 is listed here for convenience although the NL did not schedule games (see 1871 to 1876, below).\nNational Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871–1875).\nThe National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871–1875) did not schedule games, nor did it control the number of teams, a major reason for its demise after the 1875 season. Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy investment, there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs going out of business.\nThis listing gives the greatest number of games played by any club for each season. Naturally, the leader by games played was always a strong club fielding one of the better gate attractions.\nThe leading numbers of games played to a decision were 33, 54, 59, 71, and 70 decisions; by the listed teams except the Mutuals in 1872.\nNational League (first 25 years of 1876-present).\nThe National League organized for 1876 on a different basis than the NAPBBP, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year – it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But in its first season in 1876, the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date. Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions with 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.\nAmerican Association (1882–1891).\nThe AA expanded its schedule to 140 games two years before the National League did so. After 1891 this incarnation of the AA dissolved with four teams bought out and four others joining the NL, nominally creating one big league, the \"National League and American Association\" of 12 clubs.\n20th century.\nThis account gives the originally announce length of the major league \"championship season\" schedule by league and year.\nThis does not include later announced curtailments of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the strike that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited spring training.\nRecent season schedules.\n1998 to 2012.\nSince 1998, there have been 30 major league teams with a single advance schedule for every season that comprises 2430 games. Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the \"home\" team, 81 as the \"visitor\". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.) Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.\nBefore 2013, the schedule included 252 \"interleague games\" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games. These interleague games were played from mid-to-late May to late June or early July.\nDivision games (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.\nOther intraleague games (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.\nInterleague play.\nThe schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\nAmong the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \"home and home\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.\nThese special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998 to 2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.\n9/11 rescheduling.\nThe 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the September 11 terrorist attacks and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11–16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and World Series being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates. This resulted in the World Series continuing into early November for the first time.\n2013–2017.\nSchedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games. Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.) With this change, interleague games were now scattered throughout the season.\nThe matched divisions rotate annually:\nEach team played its four other interleague games against a designated \"natural rival\", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league. In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.\nTen of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the Houston–Texas \"Lone Star\" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 , including one each for Houston and Texas.\nFor 2014, four of the five new rivalries have been revised (‡), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.\nEvery team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), as well as 6 games each against 4 opponents and 7 games against each of the other 6 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).\nWhen corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3-game series (20 total) against the other two teams in the opposing division. This was done in 2015, 2018, and 2021.\n2018–2019.\nUnder the collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, several changes were made to the scheduling pattern for the 2018 season. The overall length of the season was extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams were scheduled to play on Opening Day, which for 2018 was March 29. \"Sunday Night Baseball\" will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally televised night game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.\n2020.\nDue to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic the start of the season was delayed until July 23. Each team would only play 60 games this season and every game will be against the teams in their division and teams in the corresponding division of the other league.\n2023.\nUnder the collective bargaining agreement reached in March 2022, every team will play every other team regardless of league under a new balanced schedule. Teams will play 13 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (52 games), as well as 6 games each against 6 of the other 10 opponents within its own league and 7 games each against 4 of the other 10 opponents within its own league (64 games). Interleague play will consist of a four-game home and away series against the geographic rival and a single three-game series against the other 14 interleague opponents (46 games), with location to rotate every other year.\nTime of first pitch.\nStart of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. As of 2021, most games start at 6:30 p.m., 7 p.m., or 7:30 p.m. in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for Cubs home games. The last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are often day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with more day games on the Pacific time zone, especially with teams in the Eastern or Central time zone. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\". As of 2022, most Sunday afternoon games start at 1 p.m. or 1:30 p.m. in the local time zone.\nAbout half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4 p.m. ET) In some markets, Saturday night games start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for final games of series while many weekend games are played during the day.\nFirst pitch typically occurs between 5 and 10 minutes past the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.\nSince 2021, MLB has implemented NFL-style flexible scheduling procedures for the final four weeks of each season for ESPN Sunday night and Fox Thursday or Saturday games on national television. Networks release their schedules without September games listed so to ensure games with playoff implications are broadcast on national television.\nWashington Nationals home games played on the Fourth of July and Boston Red Sox home games played on the local Patriots' Day holiday start at 11 a.m. in order to coincide with the events of the two cities that are scheduled to take place on the two respective days. These games, and starting in 2022, Peacock Sunday Leadoff games (with the first game of the package every season on NBC) are usually the only games to start before noon local time during the season. (Peacock games are only in Eastern time zone, but the Central time zone was added in 2023.)"

        "title": "Rob Johnson (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Garland Johnson (born March 18, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the USC Trojans and was a fourth-round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft by the expansion team Jacksonville Jaguars.\nWith USC, Johnson won the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic. In the Jaguars' opening game of 1997, Johnson started for an injured Mark Brunell and had a breakout performance that set a record for the best completion percentage by a debuting starting quarterback. Johnson signed a $25 million contract with the Buffalo Bills the following season and was named starting quarterback by coach Wade Phillips. Johnson had a tumultuous, injury-ridden run with the Bills and a reputation for frequently being sacked (140 in his career, including 49 in 2000), the inspiration for the nickname \"Robo-sack\". Johnson's injuries and poor performance led Phillips to replace Johnson with the more experienced Doug Flutie as starter. Controversially, Phillips started Johnson over Flutie for the that the Bills lost to eventual AFC champion Tennessee Titans, after Flutie helped the Bills to an 11–5 record in the 1999 season. Phillips later said that Bills' owner Ralph Wilson had instructed the head coach to start Johnson over Flutie.\nAfter two losing seasons with the Bills, Johnson joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 2002 and won a Super Bowl title with the team as a backup to Brad Johnson (no relation). Rob Johnson played his final games with the Washington Redskins and Oakland Raiders in 2003. He also tried out in 2006 for the New York Giants and in 2008 for the Tennessee Titans. In 2004, Johnson became an assistant football coach at Mission Viejo High School with his brother, both under their father as head coach.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Newport Beach, California and graduated from El Toro High School in 1991. In his senior season of 1990, Johnson completed 207 of 303 attempted passes for 2,788 yards and 28 touchdowns. The \"Los Angeles Times\" selected Johnson as first-team All-Orange County.\nCollege career.\nJohnson played college football at the University of Southern California, where he was teammates with Keyshawn Johnson, Curtis Conway, Johnnie Morton, Willie McGinest, and All America tackle and fellow Jacksonville Jaguars draftee Tony Boselli. Johnson left USC holding virtually every major passing record and spent much of his senior year as a Heisman Trophy candidate. In his final game for the school, Johnson led his team to victory in the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic, dominating Texas Tech by a final score of 55–14.\nProfessional career.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\n1995.\nIn the 1995 NFL Draft, the expansion team Jacksonville Jaguars drafted Johnson as the first draft pick of the fourth round (99th overall). As a rookie, Johnson was the second- and third-string quarterback behind Steve Beuerlein. Johnson played in one game in 1995, a 44–0 loss to the Detroit Lions. With 3:57 remaining in the third quarter, Johnson entered the game for Beuerlein. In three drives, Johnson threw one interception and failed at two fourth down conversions. Johnson was 3 for 7 in passing for 24 yards, one interception, and one sack, and he rushed for 17 yards. The Jaguars finished their inaugural season 4–12.\n1996.\nStarting in 1996, Mark Brunell became starting quarterback for the Jaguars. Rob Johnson played in all the preseason games and completed 30 of 43 passes (69.8%) for 336 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. He rushed for 23 yards, including a 7-yard touchdown run against the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson did not play in any regular season or postseason games in 1996. The Jaguars finished the 1996 season 9–7 and lost the to the New England Patriots.\n1997.\nFor the final two games of the 1997 preseason, Johnson was the starter in place of an injured Mark Brunell and won both games. Johnson started his first game on Week 1 of 1997 as Brunell was still recovering. In that game on August 31, 1997, Johnson completed 20 of 24 passes for 294 yards and two touchdowns. For the Jaguars' first two possessions, Johnson led 84- and 93-yard touchdown drives. Johnson also ran four times for 31 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown on a scramble. Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith caught the winning 28-yard touchdown pass from Johnson in the Jaguars' 28–27 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. This performance set the record for the highest completion percentage of any first-time starting quarterback. Twice in the game, Johnson left due to high ankle sprains. Due to his ankle injury, Johnson would miss the next three games. In Week 7 (October 12), Johnson played his next game of the season, a backup role to Brunell in a 38–21 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Johnson completed one 10-yard pass and was sacked once for 6 yards. For three more games, Johnson would play in minor roles: a week 9 (October 26) loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a week 11 (November 9) win over the Kansas City Chiefs, and a week 17 (December 21) win over the Oakland Raiders for a cumulative five games played in 1997 (including one start). Johnson did not play in the Jaguars' only postseason game, a 17–42 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XXXII champion Denver Broncos in the .\nBuffalo Bills.\n1998.\nOn February 14, 1998, the Jaguars traded Johnson to the Buffalo Bills in exchange for the Bills' first and fourth round picks in the 1998 NFL Draft. Johnson was immediately named the starting quarterback after signing a five-year, $25 million contract with the team. First-year Bills' head coach Wade Phillips proclaimed Johnson's arrival as the start of a \"new era\" for the franchise.\nYet, Johnson's hold on the starting job was tenuous from his first game. Facing the San Diego Chargers in week 1 of the 1998 season, Johnson left with a concussion. With the Bills trailing 10–0, backup quarterback Doug Flutie led two scoring drives, but the Bills lost 16–14. Over the first four games of the year, Johnson completed 63.2% of his passes with five touchdowns and three interceptions. He was sacked 24 times, as the Bills stumbled to a 1–3 start.\nWith the Bills facing the Indianapolis Colts in week 5, Johnson suffered a separated rib cartilage during the first quarter and left the game. Appearing in relief, Flutie led the Bills to a 31–24 victory over the Colts with 24 unanswered points in the second half. While Johnson was still recovering from his injury, Flutie led the Bills to four consecutive wins before Phillips officially named him the new starting quarterback on November 5, 1998. Speaking to the media following the announcement, Johnson publicly expressed his displeasure, erroneously saying, \"I'm not a backup.\" Flutie led the Bills to a 10–6 record before losing to the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the playoffs.\n1999.\nEntering training camp for the 1999 season, Phillips named Johnson and Flutie \"co-number ones\" before ultimately awarding Flutie the starting job. Flutie led the Bills to a 10–5 record before Phillips decided to rest him for the final week of the season. Facing the Indianapolis Colts and the Colts' second-year quarterback and number-one draft pick Peyton Manning, Johnson completed 24 of 32 passes for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Bills won 31–6, ending the Colts' 11-game winning streak. This performance led owner Ralph Wilson to \"discuss\" the QB position with Phillips, on the day after the game Phillips named Johnson the starter for the Bills' opening round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans.\nFacing the Titans on the road, Johnson played poorly, completing only 10 of 22 passes for 131 yards, taking six sacks, and fumbling three times. However, the Bills still led 16-15 after a Steve Christie field goal with 16 seconds remaining. On the ensuing kickoff, however, Titans tight end Frank Wycheck completed a pass that was ultimately ruled to be a lateral to returner Kevin Dyson, who returned the ball for a touchdown and the Titans victory. This play would be known later as \"Home Run Throwback\" or the \"Music City Miracle\". The Bills did not make the playoffs after the 1999 season until the 2017 season.\n2000.\nRob Johnson started the first six games of 2000 and finished those games 3–3 after a 2–0 start as Doug Flutie recovered from a groin injury that forced him to miss much of training camp. The Bills' opening game of the season was against the Tennessee Titans, a rematch of last season's Wild Card playoff game. With nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, Johnson left the game with a leg injury, and Alex Van Pelt took over and set up the winning field goal for a 16–13 Bills victory. Johnson completed 9 of 18 pass attempts for 107 yards and one touchdown and rushed six times for 60 yards. However, Johnson was sacked five times. The following game against the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers, Johnson again was sacked five times but led the Bills to a 27–18 victory, on 18-for-26 passing for 259 yards. The Bills lost their next three games. In the week 6 game against the Miami Dolphins, a 13–22 loss, Johnson was sacked five times and finished 11-for-26 for 178 yards before leaving due to tendinitis. Johnson's injury provided the opportunity for Doug Flutie to play for the first time this season, and Johnson had been sacked 25 times by the time of his injury. The Bills snapped the three-game losing streak with a 27–24 overtime win against the San Diego Chargers, but Johnson separated his right shoulder during the first play of the Bills' opening drive in overtime and was expected to miss two to four weeks. Flutie led the winning offensive drive that game. With Johnson out with his shoulder injury, Flutie led the Bills to a near-upset of the then-undefeated Vikings, 31-27, then engineered an upset 20-17 win over the New York Jets and a 16-13 overtime win over the New England Patriots. Johnson returned in Week 11 against the Bears and received some playing time off the bench as Flutie led the Bills to another win.\nDespite Flutie's win streak, Johnson was again named the starter heading into the Week 12 game at Kansas City. Johnson threw two touchdowns (albeit one coming after a Chiefs player dropped an interception) and ran for the go-ahead score with 2:58 remaining as the Bills won over the Chiefs, 21-17. After this win, which put the Bills at 7-4 and in playoff contention, Johnson began to struggle. The Bills lost to the Bucs, 31-17, in Tampa Bay in Week 13, despite two touchdown passes from Johnson before being injured again when Bucs linebacker Derrick Brooks threw him to the ground while he miraculously completed a screen pass to running back Shawn Bryson. The following week against the Dolphins, Johnson was only 6-18 for 44 yards with 2 interceptions and was benched late in the game for Flutie as the Bills lost, 33-6. A Week 15 Monday Night loss to the Colts eliminated the Bills from the playoffs, as it gave the Bills their seventh loss of the season, while all teams that made the playoffs in 2000 lost six games or fewer. Early in the Bills's next game against the Patriots, Johnson received a season-ending injury, and Flutie replaced him for the remainder of the season.\nThe Bills finished the 2000 season 8–8, with a 4–1 record with games started by Flutie and 4–7 under Johnson. After the 2000 season, it was clear that the Bills could not keep both Johnson and Flutie on the same team. Tim Layden reported for the August 6, 2001 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" that Johnson had the highest sack-to-dropback ratio among quarterbacks who threw at least 190 passes in the 2000 season.\n2001.\nAfter an 0–4 start, Johnson's only win of 2001 came in a Thursday night 13–10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, against the team where his career began. Johnson led a late-game drive, setting up a tie-breaking field goal that gave Buffalo its first win of the season. The Bills would lose the next three games, which Johnson started. Johnson broke his collarbone and left the Week 9 (November 11) game against the New England Patriots late in the fourth quarter, and Alex Van Pelt assumed the starting job for the rest of the 2001 season. Johnson finished 2001 134 for 216 in completed passes for 1,465 yards with 5 touchdowns, 7 interceptions, and 31 sacks.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (2002).\nAfter a dismal 2001 campaign that saw Johnson miss half the season with a broken clavicle, Johnson signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2002 season. Under new head coach Jon Gruden, the team was looking for a mobile signal caller in the mold of Rich Gannon. For opening week, Gruden named Rob Johnson the backup to starter Brad Johnson (no relation).\nRob Johnson played his first regular season game with Tampa in Week 7 (October 20) against the Philadelphia Eagles after Brad Johnson left due to a rib injury. However, the Buccaneers lost 10–20. However, Rob Johnson led the Buccaneers to a defense-filled 12–9 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Week 8 (October 27). 22-for-33 in passing, Johnson passed for 179 yards but had one interception and 6 sacks. While Brad Johnson was recovering from being poked in the eye, Rob Johnson played for part of the first quarter in the Week 12 (November 24) game against the Green Bay Packers, a game that Tampa won 21–7. Johnson completed 3 out of 5 passes for 60 yards, threw one interception, and had two sacks.\nBy late November 2002, Rob Johnson had nine sacks in 54 passing plays and a 59.8 quarterback rating, in contrast with Brad Johnson having 16 sacks in 335 attempts. Gruden promoted Shaun King to be Brad Johnson's backup on November 29, making Rob Johnson the third-stringer. In Week 16 (December 23), King played so poorly against the Pittsburgh Steelers, throwing three interceptions (one of which was returned for a touchdown) versus only five completions, that Rob Johnson started the second half. Rob Johnson led the Buccaneers to a late touchdown drive in a 17–7 loss. Johnson had 12-for-18 passing for 159 yards, one touchdown, and 5 sacks.\nOn Week 17 (December 29), with a first-round playoff bye on the line, Johnson led the Buccaneers to five field goals against the Chicago Bears at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium for the franchise's first-ever victory when the kickoff temperature was below freezing. Johnson completed 16 of 25 passes for 134 yards and rushed three times for 29 yards. Like the previous game, Johnson was sacked five times. In the Buccaneers' against the San Francisco 49ers, Rob Johnson completed one 21-yard pass and rushed one time for 7 yards in the 31–6 Buccaneers win. During Super Bowl XXXVII, Rob Johnson would watch from the bench as Brad Johnson led the Buccaneers to the NFL title.\nWashington Redskins (2003).\nOn March 2, 2003, Johnson signed with the Washington Redskins. As a backup to starting quarterback Patrick Ramsey, Johnson played only two games with the Redskins, in Week 6 (October 12) against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Week 7 (October 19) against the Buffalo Bills, both against teams for which Johnson used to play. In the Redskins' 13–35 loss to the Buccaneers, Johnson completed 4 of 4 passes for 35 yards and was sacked twice. The following game against the Bills, Johnson took over in the fourth quarter after Ramsey suffered a hand bruise, to a chorus of boos from the crowd at Ralph Wilson Stadium. On his second play of the game, Johnson was sacked by Aaron Schobel, a play that the crowd cheered. Johnson completed only one 4-yard pass out of three passes. On October 22, owner Daniel Snyder terminated Johnson's contract and replaced Johnson with free agent Tim Hasselbeck.\nOakland Raiders (2003).\nOn November 6, 2003, Johnson signed with the Oakland Raiders, who were seeking replacements for injured quarterbacks Rich Gannon and Marques Tuiasosopo. Succeeding Rick Mirer, Johnson played in the second half of a Week 16 \"Monday Night Football\" game on December 22 hosting the Green Bay Packers. His last pass attempt was directed at the legendary Jerry Rice and was intercepted. Johnson finished the game passing 6-for-13 for 54 yards, one sack, one interception, and 15 rushing yards.\nComeback attempts (2006–2008).\nFollowing his release from Oakland in 2004, Johnson underwent Tommy John surgery, a procedure more commonly performed on baseball pitchers. A tendon was taken from Johnson's wrist and transplanted into his elbow to replace the injured tendon that resembled \"a frayed rope\" from overuse. After a year of recovery, Johnson worked out for the Tennessee Titans, but was not signed. Reports suggested his arm strength was still under 50%. In 2006, Johnson was signed by the New York Giants to compete for a roster spot behind starter Eli Manning. Johnson was released before the preseason came to an end. In an NFL.com interview, Johnson vowed to continue his career for as long as he could play at \"an NFL level.\"\nIn September 2008, Johnson was invited to a Titans workout, along with Joey Harrington and Chris Simms. However, the Titans signed Simms as a backup for veteran Kerry Collins. This was Johnson's last reported NFL workout.\nPost-NFL career.\nJohnson and his family live in Ladera Ranch, California. Since 2004, Johnson has been an assistant football coach at Mission Viejo High School under head coach, father Bob Johnson, and with assistant coach and brother Bret Johnson. The Johnsons also run a camp for high school quarterbacks. In 2012, Johnson joined a series of class-action lawsuits against the NFL contending that the league knew or should have known concussions and repeated head impacts put players at risk of brain disorders later in life.\nIn a 2015 oral history of the Music City Miracle, Johnson announced his intention to bring his family to a Bills game that season, but admitted to his unpopularity among Bills fans by adding, \"The fans might boo me.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 2008, the NFL Network ranked Johnson number eight in the network special \"Top Ten One-Shot Wonders\", citing Johnson's one wonder as his game from Week 1 of 1997. NFL Network also ranked the Doug Flutie/Rob Johnson quarterback controversy with the Buffalo Bills #6 in the special \"Top Ten QB Controversies\" the following year. For holding the NFL record for most sacks per passing attempt, Johnson earned the nickname \"Robo-sack\"."

        "title": "American Junior Golf Association",
        "text": "The American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) is a \"501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the overall growth and development of young men and women who aspire to earn college golf scholarships through competitive junior golf.\" AJGA is considered by many leaders in the golf industry to be the premier junior golf association of the world. Evidenced of AJGA's premier standing is shown through support from such organizations as TaylorMade Golf, adidas Golf (national sponsors), Rolex (Premier Partners), the PGA TOUR and United States Golf Association (Association partners), and partnerships with more than 100 other organizations nationwide. These relationships span multiple decades and help the AJGA focus its efforts on providing an unparalleled membership experience.\nThe AJGA has run elite tournaments for junior golfers of both sexes in the United States since 1978. In 2023, the AJGA stages over 200 total events (including one-day qualifiers) per season. The Association is headquartered at Chateau Elan Resort in Braselton, Georgia. Currently, the AJGA focuses more on developing golfers at the highest skill levels of both sexes, preparing them for college golf, rather than fostering the recreational side of the sport, which is clearly conveyed in its mission statement.\nPlaying with the AJGA.\nJunior golfers between the ages of 12 and 19 are eligible to play in American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) events, and members come from around the United States and nearly 70 world countries. Players can qualify to take part through local and regional tournaments via the AJGA's Performance Based Entry system which consistently evaluates events for quality. Players who have the ability, but not the financial means to play a national junior golf schedule may qualify for the AJGA's Liberty National ACE Grant program. This grant provides reimbursements of tournament fees and travel expenses to provide an equal playing field for all junior golfers.\nHow to qualify.\nIn 2003, the AJGA abandoned a tournament selection process based on the strength of a tournament application and resume in favor of the Performance Based Entry process. This enables more junior golfers ages 12–19 to earn their way into AJGA Open tournaments based on performances at top events on the national, regional and state levels.\nThe player's performance, not the AJGA, dictates acceptance into an event. The expanded opportunities to gain entry into AJGA events through success at the state and regional levels ensure all deserving juniors receive an opportunity to play in an AJGA event. Entry into AJGA events can be earned through numerous tournaments, major USGA events, and other state championships.\nRankings and awards.\nThe AJGA runs a variety of rankings, teams and awards. The AJGA has developed its own ranking system, the Polo Golf Rankings, that helps fill tournament fields and determine Rolex Junior All-America teams and the Rolex Junior Player of the Year recipients. Past winners of the Rolex Junior Player of the Year awards include Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods in the Boys Division and Cristie Kerr and Paula Creamer in the Girls Division. In addition, the AJGA developed FJ Live Scoring to provide service to members and families during all rounds of AJGA events.\nBeginnings.\nThe AJGA was conceived in the mid-1970s by Mike Bentley, a sportswriter in DeKalb County, Georgia. Bentley first formed the DeKalb Junior Golf Association in 1974, which eventually evolved into the Atlanta Junior Golf Association . Bentley soon realized the need for organized golf at the national level. At the time, several national junior golf tournaments existed but there was no cohesive administration of junior golf events on a national scale. Bentley envisioned such an organization, and created the American Junior Golf Association to meet the need.\nThe AJGA conducted its first national junior golf event in 1978, the AJGA Tournament of Champions, at Inverrary Country Club in Lauderhill, Florida. Later that same year the AJGA introduced and conducted its second national event. In addition, the AJGA also named its first Rolex Junior All-Americans in 1978, and has done so every year since.\nIn 1984, Stephen Hamblin was hired as the Executive Director, the same role he continues to serve today. The AJGA's first permanent home was built in 1983 at Horseshoe Bend Country Club. In September 2000, the Association moved to a new facility in Braselton, Ga., at Chateau Elan Resort. The building was paid through capital gifts and accrued zero debt.\nGrowth.\nThe AJGA has experienced consistent growth throughout its history in many aspects. A staff of five in 1983 has grown to a group of more than 60 full-time employees. The number of AJGA tournaments has also increased, moving from two in 1978 to its current total of 130+ events per year. In addition, AJGA memberships have increased to nearly 9,000 annually. The AJGA also serves more than 300 college coaches who help the AJGA accomplish its mission by providing players opportunities at the next level.\nAchieving its mission.\nThe AJGA focuses on running high-level, consistent golf tournaments that give college coaches the ability to accurately judge the skill level of junior golfers. This is accomplished through adherence to the USGA Rules of Golf, the AJGA Code of Conduct, a strict Pace of Play policy and the use of its Performance Based Entry system to fill tournament fields.\nEach year, the vast majority of AJGA graduates go on to compete at the college level. In addition, most graduates are awarded college golf or academic scholarships.\nThe AJGA also has implemented a \"Care for the Course\" initiative in an attempt to revolutionize the way junior golfers give back to tournament courses. With this new program, the AJGA hopes to teach proper course maintenance habits that will carry on throughout a junior golfer's career. Disciplinary measure are taken to make sure respect is given to the course.\nAJGA alumni.\nMany AJGA alumni have found success at the college level and more importantly success at the professional level. AJGA college Alumni have competed successfully. AJGA college alumni have won 25 of the past 33 NCAA Division I Men's Champions (1986-2022) and 25 of the past 32 NCAA Division I Women's Champions (1986-2022). Additionally, many AJGA alumni have also found success at the professional level. With more than 200 AJGA alumni players combined on both PGA Tour and LPGA Tour, there has been a total of more than 1,000 professional victories collectively.\nAJGA Alumni on the PGA TOUR include: Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Cantlay, Sam Burns, Max Homa, Scottie Scheffler, Collin Morikawa, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Stewart Cink, Bob Estes, Keegan Bradley, Bill Haas, Steve Marino, Jim Furyk, Sergio Garcia, Lucas Glover, J.B. Holmes, Charles Howell III, Matt Kuchar, Dustin Johnson, Justin Leonard, Davis Love III, Hunter Mahan, Joe Ogilvie, Sean O'Hair, David Toms, Bubba Watson, and Scott Verplank.\nAJGA Alumnae on the LPGA Tour include: Paula Creamer, Rose Zhang, Alison Lee, Lexi Thompson, Nelly Korda, Jessica Korda, Stacy Lewis, Morgan Pressel, Brittany Lang, Brittany Lincicome, Jessica Korda, Amanda Blumenherst, Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, Julieta Granada, Pat Hurst, Cristie Kerr, I.K.

They entered athletes in Boxing, Athletics and Rugby Sevens, but took home no medals. Boxer Star Tauasi made it to the quarter-finals in the superheavyweight category, but was defeated by England's David Dolan.\nOrganized sport on Niue was a fairly recent development. Prior to their entry, Niue had also entered both the Oceania Games and South Pacific Games.\nA precedent was set in June, 2001 when the island's first professional men's rugby team lost to Cook Islands 28–8. Almost all of the island's 1700 residents turned out to watch."

        "title": "2014 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The 2014 Commonwealth Games (), officially known as the XX Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Glasgow 2014 (; ), was an international multi-sport event celebrated in the tradition of the Commonwealth Games as governed by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). It took place in Glasgow, Scotland, from 23 July to 3 August 2014.\nGlasgow was selected as the host city on 9 November 2007 during CGF General Assembly in Colombo, Sri Lanka, defeating Abuja, Nigeria. It was the largest multi-sport event ever held in Scotland with around 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports, outranking the 1970 and 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Over the last 10 years, however, Glasgow and Scotland had staged World, Commonwealth, European, or British events in all sports proposed for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, including the World Badminton Championships in 1997.\nThe Games received acclaim for their organisation, attendance, and the public enthusiasm of the people of Scotland, with CGF chief executive Mike Hooper hailing them as \"the standout games in the history of the movement\". Held in Scotland for the third time, the Games were notable for the successes of the Home Nations of the United Kingdom, with England, Wales and hosts Scotland achieving their largest ever gold medal hauls and overall medal hauls at a Commonwealth Games. England finished top of the medal table for the first time since the 1986 Commonwealth Games, also held in Scotland. Kiribati also won its first ever medal at a Commonwealth Games, a gold in the 105 kg men's weightlifting competition.\nHost selection.\nScotland was the first country to consider hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games in 2004, with Scottish cities being invited by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland to consider making a bid. In September 2004, Glasgow was announced as the Scottish candidate city over Edinburgh (which hosted the Games in 1970 and 1986, and the inaugural Commonwealth Youth Games in 2000) following a cost-benefit analysis by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. The Scottish Executive under then First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell, with the support of the United Kingdom government and all main parties in the Scottish Parliament, formally announced Glasgow's intention to host the games on 16 August 2005.\nIn March 2006, the bidding process began, with the Glasgow Bidding team presenting their case to the Commonwealth Games Federation at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, along with the other confirmed candidate cities; the Nigerian capital, Abuja and Halifax in Canada. In October 2006, the first voting delegates arrived in Glasgow, to inspect the city's existing and proposed amenities and facilities. Glasgow announced on 16 January 2007, the 17 sports to be included should its bid be successful. Halifax later withdrew its bid on 8 March 2007, following the withdrawal of funding from the municipal government.\nThat left Abuja and Glasgow as the remaining bidders, with Abuja seen as a likely favourite due to the basis of its campaign that an African nation has never before hosted the Commonwealth Games. The deadline for formal submission of bids to the Commonwealth Games Federation, in the form of a Candidate City File, was set for May 2007. Both bids were highly recommended, though Glasgow's bid team had made use of extensive benchmarking against the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and as a result, its bid was deemed technically superior according to the CGF Evaluation Report that was released in September 2007. The Commonwealth Games Evaluation Commission concluded that: \"Glasgow has shown it has the ability to stage the 2014 Commonwealth Games to a standard which would continue to enhance the image and prestige of the Games.\" This put Glasgow ahead in terms of the technical comprehensiveness of its bid.\nThe final decision on the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Colombo, Sri Lanka on 9 November 2007 at the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly, attended by all 71 Commonwealth Games member associations. Each bid city made a presentation to the General Assembly, the order of which was determined by drawing lots. Glasgow's delegation was led by Louise Martin, chair of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, First Minister Alex Salmond, athlete Jamie Quarry and Leader of Glasgow City Council Steven Purcell. The presentation also included a promotional film narrated by Sean Connery. Abuja's delegation was led by General Yakubu Gowon, head of the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid team.\nThe CGF members later voted for their preferred candidate in a secret ballot. As there were only two bids, the winner was announced by the CGF President, Mike Fennel, after the first round of voting, with the winner only requiring a simple majority. The results of the bidding process were as follows:\nDevelopment and preparation.\nThe Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee was responsible for organising and delivering the Games. It was established as a limited company whose members included the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and Commonwealth Games Scotland. The Glasgow City Council was responsible for delivering a number of the venues and lasting benefits from the Games for the city and people of Glasgow. The Scottish Government was the third organisation in the partnership and was the main funder of the Games. Lord Robert Smith was the chairman of the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee.\nVenues.\n Celtic Park hosted for the opening ceremony of the Games. The Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome precinct, situated at Parkhead in the East End of the city, hosted the Badminton as well as Track cycling. Glasgow Green was the starting point for the free Athletics (Marathon), Cycling (Road Race) and Cycling (Time Trial) events. Glasgow Green was the venue for Field hockey and saw the construction of a new Glasgow Green Hockey Centre. Tollcross International Swimming Centre, was the venue for Swimming events. It already had one Olympic standard 50 metre swimming pool, which was extensively upgraded, and a second 50-metre pool was added for the Games as a warm-up facility. The existing permanent seating capacity was increased by 1,000. Combined with additional temporary seating the venue had over 5,000 seats for the Games.\nIbrox Stadium, in the South Side, was the venue for the Rugby Sevens tournament. Mountain biking was held on the Cathkin Braes in Rutherglen, the Royal Burgh neighbouring the City. Hampden Park hosted all the track and field events as well as the closing ceremony.\nThe Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, located in the West End of the city, hosted the Wrestling, Judo and Boxing, as well as the Main Press Centre and the International Broadcast Centre, benefiting from its strategic position adjacent to the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV at Pacific Quay. The Clyde Auditorium hosted Weightlifting, whilst the new OVO Hydro was used for the Gymnastics and Netball events. Kelvingrove Park, also in the city's West End, was the venue for Bowls and has five bowling greens installed for competitive use. A comprehensive upgrade and refurbishment of the park was completed ahead of the Games. Scotstoun Leisure Centre hosted Table tennis and Squash.\nThe Shooting competitions took place at the Ministry of Defence full-bore rifle and clay target ranges at Barry Buddon, near Dundee, which were also used in the 1986 Commonwealth Games. There were temporary ranges built for the small-bore rifle and pistol events. Diving was held at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh, located 45 miles (72 km) to the east, which held the annual Edinburgh Festival at the same time as the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Strathclyde Country Park, beside Hamilton and Motherwell, hosted the Triathlon event.\nAthletes' village.\nThe Athletes Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was situated on a site, in Dalmarnock, Glasgow. The whole project was designed by RMJM. Primarily the site was used as accommodation for the athletes competing in the games as well as team officials from every competing nation for the duration of the games. As well as accommodation, the athletes' village also housed a retail zone, dining hall, medical facilities, gym, religious centre and recreational spaces.\nCountdown.\nThe countdown clock was unveiled at the Glasgow Central Station on 10 March 2014 during the Commonwealth Day. The clock was sponsored by the Swiss watchmaker Longines. A special ceremony was organized for the clock inauguration at the station which was attended by the members of the organising committee of the Games and Scottish swimmer Michael Jamieson.\nBudget.\nThe total budget for the Games was £575.6 million. This figure included £472.3 million for Glasgow 2014 and £90 million for security. The Glasgow 2014 budget of £472.3 million was made up of £372 million of public money with the remainder coming from commercial income generated through sponsorship, ticket sales, broadcasting rights and merchandise sales. The budget included contingency of £66.1 million, which was made up of a £42.3 million general contingency and £23.8 million special reserves. In February 2015, it was reported that the Games was delivered £35.5 million under budget.\nTicketing.\nThe first round of the Games ticket sales were from 19 August to 16 September 2013. Over two-thirds of tickets sold were priced at £25 or less. The ticket price ranges for the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were £40-£250 and £30-£200 respectively. The 100m men's final event received over 100,000 applications which was the most of any event of the Games. Boxing had the most expensive ticket of any sport in the Games whose category 1 tickets cost £120. A total of 96% of tickets were sold. Ticketmaster was the official ticket services provider of the Games.\nMedals.\nThe medals for the Games were unveiled on 14 April 2014 at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. The medals were designed and hand-crafted by the renowned jeweller Jonathan Boyd and a team of specialist jewellery-makers from the prestigious Glasgow School of Art. The hand-turned quaichs gifted to winning athletes and the carved ceremonial podiums were all created from local woods by Glasgow-based artisan Paul Hodgkiss. Scottish designer Kerry Nixon designed the medalbearers' dresses.\nQueen's baton relay.\nThe Queen's Baton Relay began its 190,000 km journey on 9 October 2013. The baton travelled via 70 nations and territories over 288 days before opening the games on 23 July 2014. At the ceremony, 32 inspiring volunteers from across Scotland carried the baton around Celtic Park Stadium after being nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Prince Imran and the Queen who then declared the games open.\nThe Queen's Baton was designed by the Glasgow based firm 4c Design. The BBC provided coverage of the relay. Adventurer Mark Beaumont presented a series of documentaries filmed on the relay for BBC One Scotland, there were also weekly updates for BBC News and a BBC News website and blog written by Mark.\nTransport.\nThe Glasgow Airport was used to welcome and depart the athletes and officials of the Games. The main terminal building of the Glasgow Airport was upgraded at a cost of £17 million.\nDuring the games, spectators were encouraged to use the public transport, particularly for longer journeys as they make their way to the venues of the games. The Glasgow 2014 ticket included access to local public transport services (trains, buses and Subway) to and from the venue on the day of the event. In order to access those services, the spectators had to show the valid event ticket on request. The spectators were also encouraged to walk or use bicycles instead of motor vehicles to reach the venues in order to avoid traffic jam.\nThe athletes were transported in minibuses or coaches, which used, where necessary, dedicated lanes – known as the Games Route Network – to ensure they were given priority over other traffic in a similar way buses are in bus lanes. These lanes formed part of a larger dedicated Games Route Network that was also used by the people working on the Games.\nVolunteering.\nApproximately 12,500 volunteers were hired for the Games out of over 50,000 applicants which was more than the number who applied for Melbourne 2006 and Manchester 2002. The army of volunteers enlisted to help during the Games were known as Clyde-siders. The uniforms for the volunteers were created by the outdoor clothing manufacturer Trespass.\nSecurity.\nAn integrated security team which involved Police Scotland, Glasgow 2014's Security team and private sector partners, was developed to manage the security and stewarding requirements for the Games. More than 17,000 individuals were involved in this operation, where over 2,000 members were from the armed forces and the rest from the Police Scotland and 17 private sector companies. The budget for the Games security was around £90 million.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured Karen Dunbar, John Barrowman, Amy Macdonald, Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle, Nicola Benedetti, Julie Fowlis, Eric Whitacre, and Pumeza Matshikiza, as well as a message from the International Space Station. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, explaining the partnership between the Games and UNICEF. Following the arrival of the Queen there was a flypast by the Red Arrows display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe, supplied by Sports Technology. Scotland's then First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster. The final part of the Queen's Baton Relay was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device. The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children's lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\" In the culmination of a groundbreaking partnership with UNICEF, the ceremony inspired millions to text donations to our shared 'Put Children First' campaign, which raised £3.5 million on the night and more than £5 million to date. The ceremony was directed by David Zolkwer with David Proctor (Executive Producer) and Sarah Gardiner (Creative Producer).\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony took a visual theme of a music festival, with performers, tents, and flags within the stadium. The ceremony began with Scottish singer Lulu welcoming the athletes of the games. Scottish band Deacon Blue performed their signature song \"Dignity\". During this the workers of Glasgow were recognised as they paraded along the front of the main stand at Hampden, some on foot, others in their work vehicles. Local band Prides performed their hit song \"Messiah\". Speeches followed, with Prince Imran telling the crowd that the games were \"pure dead brilliant\", a local Glaswegian term. The games were officially closed and handed over to the Gold Coast for 2018, who began their own performance with Australian singer Jessica Mauboy. Kylie Minogue then performed a seven-hit songs set list, while the volunteer cast told the story of \"a typical Glasgow night out\". Her costume was designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and headpiece designed by millinery designer Lara Jensen. The show ended with Dougie MacLean performing Caledonia with the other performers, and a performance of \"Auld Lang Syne\". The closing ceremony was directed by David Zolkwer with David Proctor (Executive Producer) and Sarah Gardiner (Creative Producer).\nThe Games.\nParticipating Commonwealth Games Associations.\nThere were 71 participating nations at the 2014 Commonwealth Games with approximately 4,950 competing athletes, making it one of the largest Commonwealth Games staged to date. On 7 October 2013, The Gambia, having withdrawn from the Commonwealth five days earlier, confirmed that it would not be taking part in the Games.\nCalendar.\nThe following table shows a summary of the competition schedule.\nSports.\nA total of 18 sports and 261 medal events were contested at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nA record 22 para-sport events were contested in five different sports (athletics, cycling, lawn bowls, swimming and weightlifting) and para track cycling was held for the very first time.\nArchery and tennis from the 2010 games were replaced on the sports programme with triathlon (who turned back after the 2010 absence) and judo (after eight years absence). Among sport disciplines removed from 2010 include the walking events in athletics, synchronised swimming and Greco-Roman wrestling, while mountain biking also returned after the absence in Delhi.The number of Shooting medal events also dropped from 44 in 2010 to 19. Among new disciplines on the Commonwealth Games programme for the first time were the triathlon mixed relay event, more medal chances for women at shooting and the addition of women's boxing to the programme.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each sport.\"\nMedal table.\nOnly the top ten successful nations are displayed here. \nBroadcasting.\nSunset + Vine Global Television Host Broadcasting Limited (SVGTV), a joint venture between Sunset + Vine, subsidiary of Tinopolis, a Wales-based television production group and Australia-based television production company, Global Television served as the host broadcaster of the Games.\nMarketing.\nBid and interim logo.\nThe interim logo for the Games was first used during Glasgow's bid, with the \"Candidate City\" section removed following 9 November 2007, when the bid was approved. The logo depicts two sprinters woven into a tartan motif, representing Scotland. The logo also vaguely resembles the Clyde Auditorium, one of Glasgow's most recognisable landmarks. The pattern, forming the Roman numerals XX, also represents the 20th edition of the Commonwealth Games. The text is more specifically Glaswegian, with its stylised Mackintosh font.\nA flag featuring the logo was used extensively during the bid process. The flag was flown above Merchant House in George Square daily.\nThe Games brand identity.\nThe full Games brand identity was developed by Glasgow design studio Tangent Graphic, the lead creative agency between 2010 and 2014. Tangent's first major project was the official sport Pictograms, launched on 23 July 2011, and they continued to deliver and influence every aspect of the Glasgow 2014 identity. Tangent inherited the official logo which was designed by Marque Creative. The logo was unveiled on Commonwealth Day, 8 March 2010. It was inspired by three factors, time, data and measurement. Its rings are proportioned to represent the 20th Commonwealth Games, across 17 sports, over 11 days in 1 city. An animated version of the logo has also been produced.\nThere is also a version of the logo in Scottish Gaelic. Arthur Cormack, the Chair of Bòrd na Gàidhlig, made the following official statement:\nBòrd na Gàidhlig welcomes the Gaelic version of the logo for the Glaschu 2014 Commonwealth Games and we have been happy to work with the Glaschu 2014 team in helping them develop their identity. Given the unique importance of Gaelic to Scotland and the many Scots in the diaspora throughout the Commonwealth, we believe it should be seen, heard and spoken as widely as possible.\nGiven the worldwide interest there will be in the Games when they take place in Glasgow, a city with a large number of Gaelic speakers, we believe they offer an exciting opportunity for Gaelic to be seen and, we hope, heard and appreciated in an international setting. We hope this is just the start; we wish the Games well and look forward to working further with Glaschu 2014 to enhance the status of Gaelic within this hugely significant event.\nThe official website was built in phases, delivered by Dog Digital and Blonde. The Scottish art firm Artpistol were commissioned by the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee to paint a series of murals across Glasgow to help celebrate and promote the Games.\nThe Big G.\nThe Big G is a standalone stage-set that was situated in George Square, Glasgow. It was unveiled in May 2014; with Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson commenting that it provided an “opportunity for everyone – residents, visitors and spectators – to be part of the Games”. British designing firm Evolve designed the Big G.\nMascot.\nClyde, an anthropomorphic thistle named after the river which flows through the centre of Glasgow, was the official mascot of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The mascot was designed by Beth Gilmour, who won a competition run by Glasgow 2014 for children to design the Mascot. Beth's drawing was then brought to life by digital agency Nerv, who turned it into a commercial character, created a full backstory, gave it a name – Clyde – and created a website for him. Clyde was finally revealed in a seven-minute animated film created by Nerv at a ceremony at BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow. The organiser, Glasgow 2014, said the mascot's design was chosen because of its \"Scottish symbolism and Glaswegian charm and likeability\".\n25 life-size Clyde statues were erected at places of public interest across the city including the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and at George Square. However following vandalism at a statue in the Govan area of the city, the statues were taken down. They are expected to be re-erected in secure areas. By the final day of the Games, over 50,000 Clyde mascot cuddly toys had been sold.\nDue to popularity in the city, the Clyde mascots are currently proposed official mascots of the Glasgow City Council.\nControversies.\nDrug doping and testing.\nNigeria's Chika Amalaha failed a doping test and was stripped of a gold medal in the women's 53 kg weightlifting. In the women's 400 metres final, Botswana's Amantle Montsho placed fourth; she was subsequently provisionally suspended pending the results of a B sample after failing a doping test. Montsho's B sample was reported as positive on 14 August 2014."

        "title": "John Bateman (baseball)",
        "text": "John Alvin Bateman (July 21, 1940 – December 3, 1996) was an American professional baseball catcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Colt .45s / Astros, Montreal Expos, and Philadelphia Phillies. Bateman batted and threw right-handed. During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing .\nBorn in Killeen, Texas, Bateman grew up in Lawton, Oklahoma and attended Lawton High School. He signed with the expansion Houston Colt .45s, as an amateur free agent, in . In 10 MLB seasons, Bateman compiled a .230 lifetime batting average; he ended his big league career with the Phillies.\nHouston Colt .45s.\nBateman clubbed 22 home runs for the minor league Modesto Colts in 1962, and made the Colt .45s out of spring training the following season as Jim Campbell's back-up behind the plate. Campbell, however, sputtered, and soon lost his starting job to Bateman. On May 17, , Bateman caught the first no-hitter in Houston franchise history. Don Nottebart held the Philadelphia Phillies hitless in a 4–1 Houston win. For the season, Bateman batted .210 while leading his team with ten home runs and 59 runs batted in. He then split time behind the plate with Jerry Grote in .\nHouston Astros.\nIn , the Colt .45s rebranded as the Astros. During that first season in the Astrodome, Bateman struggled, ultimately spending almost half the season with the AAA Oklahoma City 89ers. While in the big leagues, he managed only a .197 batting average, with seven home runs — and spending only 39 games behind the dish — while backing up starting catcher Ron Brand.\nIn , Bateman won back his starting job behind the plate, and set a franchise record with sixteen home runs by a catcher; the record was tied by Jason Castro in , who hit two more as a designated hitter.\nMontreal Expos.\nBateman and Brand shared catching duties for the Astros through the season. On October 14, 1968, Bateman was drafted by the Montreal Expos as the sixth overall pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft; 52 picks later, the Expos selected Brand, and the two resumed their platoon in Montreal. Bateman batted sixth in the inaugural game versus the New York Mets on April 8, 1969, going 1-for-5 in the 11-10 win. \nAs he had with Houston, Bateman also caught the Expos' first no-hitter: the first of Bill Stoneman's two, on April 17, 1969 against the Philadelphia Phillies, in only the ninth game in the franchise's history.\nIn 1970 for Montreal, Bateman was second on the team in hits and triples, third on the team in home runs, runs batted in, doubles, extra-base hits, and stolen bases. That season Bateman also led all MLB catchers in stolen bases with eight, and finished 25th in the National League in power/speed.\nBateman was a member of the Expos in October , during the October Crisis gripping Canada. Bateman was friendly with the Montreal police, and on November 6, the hiding place of one of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) terrorist cells was discovered. Expos manager Gene Mauch was watching coverage of the events with his staff, and was not amused to see Bateman's bulky frame coming out of the hiding place on national television.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn June 14, , Bateman was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Tim McCarver. He was released at the end of the season to make room for rookie prospect Bob Boone behind the plate. Steve Carlton was 7-6 with a 2.86 ERA before Bateman was traded to the Phillies. With Bateman catching the rest of Carlton's starts that season, Carlton was 20-4 with a 1.60 ERA. Carlton called Bateman the best signal caller he ever played with, and unsuccessfully lobbied the Phillies' front office to re-sign Bateman in 1973.\nThe King and His Court.\nBateman toured with the Fast Pitch softball team The King and His Court from 1977 to 1980. He acquired his softball skills while playing for the Texas State Amateur Softball Champion Houston Bombers."

As of 2015, she had left the table tennis field and was studying finance at Tsinghua University.\nCareer.\nShe was a left-handed shakehand attack player and came from Liaoning, China, the province where Wang Nan, Chang Chenchen and Li Jia (all left-handed players) came from. She was the potential leading player in Chinese woman team. Her original partner in women's doubles was Niu Jianfeng, who came from Hebei. Her new partner was Li Xiaoxia, who was also her roommate.\nGuo experienced series of losses in international games which led to her disappearance from the public eye for almost half a year. It is officially claimed \"To help her mentally adjust\". At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Guo returned to competition and took first place in women's singles, women's doubles and women's team. In 2007 from January to July, Guo attended six international opens and won four gold medals. At the selection match for 2007 World Table Tennis Championships in Zagreb, Guo qualified early on.\nGuo Yue won the 2007 World Championships in Zagreb, Croatia, by defeating her compatriot Li Xiaoxia in the women's singles final. She also won the mixed doubles title with Wang Liqin.\nControversy.\nRumours were rife in 2010 when Guo Yue was cited for \"poor behaviour\" and lack of interest in playing table tennis. An incident, cited on Chinese forum Tianya, stated that she was once tasked to attend a meeting and failed to do so, hence causing friction with China's top player Wang Nan. After the London 2012 Olympics, she was switched to a provincial team. In 2015, she was officially kicked out from the National Team and has gone on to study finance at Tsinghua University."

        "text": "The European Cricket Council (ECC) was an international body which oversaw cricket in European countries other than the Test-playing cricketing nation of England, the only European Full Member of the ICC for the duration of the ECC's existence until 2010. Since 2008, ICC Europe, the International Cricket Council region for Europe has succeeded the operations of ECC, akin to ICC East Asia-Pacific and ICC Americas.\nHistory.\nCricket is recorded as having first been played in Europe by Admiral Nelson's troops and sailors whilst they were stationed in Naples in 1793. The game quickly grew in popularity, and was regularly played at amateur level throughout the 19th century. Many professional clubs formed at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the most famous of which, the Milan Cricket and Football Club, was the forerunner of A.C. Milan. However, the rise of Fascism across Europe in the 1920s and 1930s saw a decline in the game's popularity. Although it continued to be played at amateur level, it was not until the 1990s that it began to revive on a larger scale.\nThe ECC was founded in 1997, replacing the administration heavy European Cricket Federation, and expanded from an initial membership of 14 to having 34 member associations (as of 2022). Nine of the member nations had ICC associate status, a further 17 had affiliate status, and 11 were ICC prospective members. The game continues to grow in popularity, and three ECC members, Scotland, Ireland, and The Netherlands, along with test status England, competed in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup. Ireland became the 11th Test nation in the world &amp; 2nd in Europe on 22 June 2017.\nActivities.\nThe ECC was the regional authority for Europe under the auspices of the worldwide governing authority of cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was based in London, England, and hosted its executive meetings at Lord's. Its last chairman was Roger Knight.\nThe ECC was responsible for the promotion and development of the game of cricket across the European continent and Israel (for cricketing purposes, as with nearly all sports, Israel is considered to be a European country). Europe is a region where the game has not traditionally flourished. Cricket also faces tough competition from much more popular sports, such as football and basketball. It listsed its key objectives as: Participation, High Performance, Tournament Structure, Widening the Market, and promoting the Spirit of Cricket.\nThe ECC was responsible for organising the European Cricket Championship along with junior, indoor and women's tournaments. The tournament structure was part of the qualification for the Cricket ICC World Cup.\nThe ECC ran development programmes that support coaching, umpiring, training, clinics and sports medicine programmes in member countries. These programmes were the responsibility of the European Development Manager and a small team of staff, within the framework of the ICC Development Programmes's Key Objectives. Responsibility for hosting and supporting the ICC's five regional programmes falls to the Full Member in each region, in this case the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who have, in turn, involved Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on the basis of MCC's existing strong links with Europe. The programme was financed largely by the ICC (through the biennial ICC Champions Trophy, at that time played between Full Members and Associate qualifiers) with assistance from the ECB and MCC, and a growing level of commercial sponsorship.\nThe ECC was brought under the auspices of the ICC Development programme as ICC Europe in 2008, and later dissolved as an independent body in 2010."

He played for the St. Louis Cardinals (–, –), and later coached for them (–, –). Moore managed the Philadelphia Phillies, taking the reins from Steve O’Neill, for the second half of the season.\nPlaying career.\nA right-handed batter and thrower, Moore began his professional baseball career in 1932. In 1934, he hit .328 in the American Association and earned a roster spot with the Cardinals the following season.\nMoore joined the Cardinals the year after the Gashouse Gang won the 1934 World Series. He hit for a career .280 batting average in 1,298 games, with 80 home runs. He played on two National League championship and world champion teams: the 1942 and 1946 Cardinals. During his career (interrupted by World War II service), he played with greats such as Dizzy Dean, Joe Medwick, Frankie Frisch, Johnny Mize, Enos Slaughter, and Stan Musial — all members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. However, Moore was the captain of those Cardinals teams.\nOn September 5, 1935, Moore went 6-for-6 against the Boston Braves in a 15-3 rout at Sportsman's Park.\nMoore was also known for being a great center fielder, who would have won several Gold Gloves had the award been available. Moore compiled a career .985 fielding percentage at that position. He was an All-Star for four straight seasons, from 1939 to 1942.\nLater life.\nWhen his playing days ended, Moore served two terms (1949–52; 1956–58) as a Cardinals coach. He also managed the Philadelphia Phillies in 1954. After beginning the 1954 season as a Phillies scout, he replaced Steve O'Neill as the club's manager on July 15. He managed the Phils for exactly half a season — 77 games — and the team won 35 of those games (for a winning percentage of .455)."

        "title": "Substitute (cricket)",
        "text": "A substitute in the sport of cricket is a replacement player that the umpires allow when a player has been injured or become ill, after the nomination of the players at the start of the game. The rules for substitutes appear in Law 24 of the \"Laws of Cricket\".\nOverview.\nA substitute can act for the injured or ill player in the field, although they may not bowl, bat or act as captain, unless otherwise agreed by the captains. A player may bat, bowl and field even if they have had a substitute for part of the game, though they need to wait for a period equal to their time off the field until they bat or bowl again. Substitutes are generally not listed in the official squad list, unless they were in the starting XI for other games in the wider squad, or were the twelfth player, as some forms of cricket have 12 players listed prior to the match, at which point one player is omitted from the match squad. However, this is not required under the laws, and the substitute can be anyone, providing the umpires approve the use of a substitute. This can lead to members of the crowd, on-site media or a team's coaching staff taking the role. One example being a New Zealand journalist who was following their tour of India in 1988, taking the field.\nHistory.\nThe use of substitutes is known from the 18th century. In the report of a match on Monday, 5 September 1748, the role is termed a \"seeker-out\"; this was in the sense that George Smith, who was carrying an injury and had been granted a substitute fielder in previous matches, was denied one in this match. The practice of allowing substitutes was varied and inconsistent in the 19th century. In 1870, a match occurred between the MCC and Nottinghamshire. Substitutes were allowed early in this match, but this was condemned by the press, and by the conclusion of the match they were refused.\nThe first-ever use of a substitute in first-class cricket occurred in The University Match between Oxford and Cambridge in 1891, when Thomas Case replaced Frederic Thesiger in the Oxford XI, after Thesiger had injured himself while fielding on the first morning of the match.\nFielding substitutes.\nA substitute is permitted to take catches as with any other fielder, and on some occasions does. The first occasion in Test cricket was in the Test between England and Australia in 1884, when Australia's captain, Billy Murdoch, took a catch from his teammate Tup Scott while playing as a substitute for England. The highest number of catches by a substitute fielder in a Test match is four, a record shared by Gursharan Singh, Younis Khan, Virender Sehwag, and Jackson Bird. However, substitute fielders' catches do not count towards individual stats.\nRecent changes.\nIn recent years, there have been arguments made for cricket to allow substitutes in first-class games, as cricket forbids full substitutes for most injuries or tactical reasons. In 2019, concussion substitutes were allowed in Test matches and other international games for the first time. Arguments in favour of general substitutes have been made from a perspective of improving the game, coping with increasing injury rates due to the modern schedule, to follow the lead of other sports in trying to manage concussion more responsibly and to provide greater opportunities for players to gain experience in first-class cricket. However, there is an equally strong viewpoint that the nature of the first-class contest may be diminished with a summary suggesting that although medical experts would recommend introduction of substitutes the majority of players are still not in favour.\nRestrictions on returning player.\nWhen a player leaves the ground due to injury and is replaced by a substitute fielder, they are generally not permitted to return and immediately resume bowling (or batting if their team's innings commences while they are off the field). The injured player is required to spend a period back on the field at least equal to the time that they were absent before resuming bowling, or batting should a change of innings occur. Variations of the time periods required and the circumstances of the players return to the field apply in different forms of the game.\nInjured bowler.\nIf a bowler is injured during an over and cannot complete it, another bowler must bowl the remaining deliveries. The bowler chosen to do so cannot be the bowler who bowled the previous over, and must not bowl the following over either. A substitute fielder may take the place of the injured bowler whilst they are off the field, but they may not bowl.\nTactical substitute.\nIn 2005, the International Cricket Council announced, as part of a package of changes to the playing conditions for One Day Internationals to be trialled over a ten-month period, that tactical substitutions would be permitted. Each team was to be allowed one substitute, who had to be named before the toss was made, and could be introduced at any stage of the match. The ODI series between England and Australia in July saw the first use of these new regulations, which did not apply to other forms of cricket such as Test matches.\nThis change, however, was widely criticised by players, commentators, and fans. In particular, it was said to give the team that wins the toss an even greater advantage than usual.\nIn March 2006 players and officials started to rebel against this controversial rule and a One Day International series between South Africa and Australia saw the players agree to boycott the rule. Just a few weeks later the International Cricket Council announced that the rule was being withdrawn, and it is no longer used.\nIn the 2005 Ashes Test series, Australian captain Ricky Ponting repeatedly complained that England were abusing the substitute system by bringing on specialist fielders in place of bowlers with poor fielding skills, which he argued was against the spirit of cricket. English bowlers were frequently substituted at the end of bowling spells and temporarily replaced with fresh fielders. The England coach Duncan Fletcher argued that these substitutions were either legitimate injuries or players \"answering the call of nature\" (i.e. using the toilet). The issue came to a climax in the 4th Test, when Ponting was run out by substitute Gary Pratt, causing him to angrily shout and gesticulate in the direction of the England dressing room. At the time, Pratt was on the field for bowler Simon Jones - who was nursing an ankle injury that proved to end his Test career after this match. Ponting was fined 75% of his match fee for dissent.\nIn 2008, the International Cricket Council tightened the regulations on the use of substitutions, saying \"Substitute fielders shall only be permitted in cases of injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons... and should not include what is commonly referred to as a 'comfort break'\".\nConcussion substitute.\nIn the mid-2010s there were calls for concussion substitutes who could bat or bowl to be introduced, with increased awareness of the risks of continuing to play following a concussion. New Zealand introduced such a rule for their domestic limited-overs competitions, having had two concussion-related substitutions in 2016. The England and Wales Cricket Board introduced concussion replacements to English domestic competitions at the start of the 2018 season. The replacements can bat and bowl in place of a player with concussion or suspected concussion; match officials have to determine that the new player is a \"like for like\" replacement.\nIn July 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) agreed to allow the use of concussion replacements in all international cricket matches from 1 August 2019, with substitute having to be a \"like-for-like replacement\" and approved by the Match Referee.\nICC Playing Conditions.\nFor example: If David Warner, a pure batsman, is injured in a Test match and Australia name Mitchell Marsh, an all-rounder, as his replacement, then the match-referee has the power to restrict Marsh from bowling in the match.\nThe rules were implemented for saving a team from having a disadvantage if one of their players suffers a concussion and is out from the match. The rules also restrict a player from taking unnecessary risks by putting their health on the line in a bid to help their team in a match.\n—Geoff Allardice, ICC General Manager explained before 2019 Ashes series.\nFirst usage.\nThe first use of such a substitute was during the Second Test at Lord's in the 2019 Ashes series between England and Australia, when Steve Smith was hit on the neck by a bouncer by Jofra Archer in the first innings. He was later diagnosed as having suffered concussion and was ruled out of the remainder of the Test. Marnus Labuschagne was named as the official replacement for Smith and came to bat on the final day of the Test.\nOn November 1, 2019, the West Indies player Shabika Gajnabi became the first concussion substitute in women's cricket when she replaced Chinelle Henry, who was concussed after hitting the advertising boards while fielding in an ODI game against India.\nCOVID-19 substitute.\nIn June 2020, the ICC approved a rule providing that if a player was found COVID-19 positive in the middle of a series they would be quarantined immediately, not allowed to take part in the remainder of the series, and would be replaced by a \"like for like\" substitute.\nIn October 2020, in the opening round of the 2020–21 Plunket Shield season, Ben Lister became the first COVID-19 replacement in a cricket match. Lister replaced Mark Chapman, who reported feeling unwell, in line with the updated International Cricket Council (ICC) playing conditions for a substitute due to COVID-19.\nIn April 2022, in the second Test match between South Africa and Bangladesh, Glenton Stuurman and Khaya Zondo replaced Sarel Erwee and Wiaan Mulder as COVID-19 substitutes at the start of day 4 for South Africa. As a result, Khaya Zondo made his Test debut.\nIn June 2022, Oshada Fernando replaced Angelo Mathews as a COVID-19 substitute for Sri Lanka during the second innings of the first test against Australia. In the second Test of the series, Fernando again replaced Pathum Nissanka as a COVID-19 substitute for Sri Lanka."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLV",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLV was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Green Bay Packers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2010 season. The Packers defeated the Steelers 31–25. The game was played on February 6, 2011, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the first time the Super Bowl was played in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\nUnlike most other Super Bowls, this game featured two title-abundant franchises: coming into the game, the Packers held the most NFL championships with 12 (9 league championships prior to the Super Bowl era and 3 Super Bowl championships), while the Steelers held the most Super Bowl championships with 6. The Packers entered their fifth Super Bowl in team history, and became the first 6-seed team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl, after posting a 10–6 regular season record. The Steelers finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and advanced to an, at the time, league-tying 8th Super Bowl appearance.\nSuper Bowl XLV was initially dominated by Green Bay, jumping to a 21–3 lead before Pittsburgh cut it down to 21–10 just before halftime. Then after the teams exchanged touchdowns, the Steelers cut their deficit to 28–25 midway through the fourth quarter with wide receiver Mike Wallace's 25-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and a two-point conversion. But the Packers answered with Mason Crosby's 23-yard field goal with 2:07 remaining, and then prevented the Steelers from scoring on their final drive of the game. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions.\nThe broadcast of Super Bowl XLV on Fox averaged about 111 million viewers, breaking the record for the most-watched program in American television history. The game's attendance was 103,219, just short of the Super Bowl record 103,985 set in Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The halftime show featured the American hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas, with additional performances by Usher and Slash.\nPrior to Super Bowl LV, it was the last time that a wild-card team made or won the Super Bowl. This is also the most recent time either of the teams have made the Super Bowl, despite appearing in a combined five conference championships since then.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nThree NFL cities presented bids for the game:\nNFL owners voted to select the North Texas site on May 22, 2007. It marked the first Super Bowl in the Dallas–Fort Worth area after numerous unsuccessful bids in the 1960s-1970s.\nTeams.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished the 2010 season with a 12–4 record. They earned the AFC North division title, and the second seed in the AFC and advanced to their 8th Super Bowl, tying the Dallas Cowboys' record of most Super Bowl appearances.\nAfter missing the first four games of the year on suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy (during which the Steelers went 3–1), quarterback Ben Roethlisberger returned for his seventh season as the Steelers starting quarterback, finishing the season with 3,200 yards and 17 touchdowns, with just five interceptions, for a 97 passer rating. He also rushed for 176 yards and two touchdowns. The team's top receiver was Mike Wallace who caught 60 passes for 1,257 yards and 10 touchdowns, giving him a 21 yards per catch average. Other reliable options included 13-year veteran Hines Ward (59 receptions for 755 yards and 5 touchdowns), the Steelers all-time leading receiver, and tight end Heath Miller who caught 42 passes for 512 yards. Halfback Rashard Mendenhall was the team's leading rusher, gaining 1,273 yards and 13 touchdowns while also catching 23 passes. The line was led by rookie center Maurkice Pouncey, the Steelers only Pro Bowl selection on offense. However, Pouncey was injured in the AFC championship game and would be inactive for Super Bowl XLV.\nThe Steelers had one of the league's top defenses, leading the NFL in sacks (48), and fewest points (14.5) and rushing yards (62.8) allowed per game, while ranking second in fewest total yards (276.8). The line was anchored by Pro Bowl end Brett Keisel. The Steelers also had four excellent linebackers: LaMarr Woodley, James Harrison, James Farrior, and Lawrence Timmons. For the third consecutive year, Woodley and Harrison each recorded at least 10 sacks. Woodley also forced three fumbles and Harrison forced six. Farrior had 109 total tackles and six sacks. Timmons led the team with 135 total tackles, while also recording three sacks and two interceptions. The secondary was led by Pro Bowl safety Troy Polamalu, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award, tying his career-best seven interceptions and returning them for 101 yards and a touchdown.\nCoach Mike Tomlin, already the youngest coach to ever win a Super Bowl, became the youngest coach ever to make it to the Super Bowl twice at age 38. The Steelers also continued their streak of reaching the Super Bowl in five different decades, and in every decade since the post AFL-NFL merger (1970s: 1975, 1976, and 1979; 1980s: 1980; 1990s: 1996; 2000s: 2006 and 2009; 2010s: 2011).\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Green Bay Packers finished the season with a 10–6 record and became the first sixth-seeded team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl. They are only the second sixth-seeded team to reach the Super Bowl, with the only other number 6 seed to accomplish this feat, coincidentally, being the Pittsburgh Steelers, who won Super Bowl XL following the 2005 season. Green Bay also joined the 2005 Steelers as the only teams ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs. In order to secure their fifth Super Bowl bid they defeated their longtime rivals, the Chicago Bears, in the at Soldier Field.\nThe offense was led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was in his third year as a starter after taking over for the team's all-time leading passer Brett Favre. Rodgers finished the season completing 65.7% of his passes for 3,922 yards and 28 touchdowns, with only eleven interceptions, giving him his second consecutive season with a triple digit passer rating (101.2). He was also a good rusher, adding 356 yards and 4 touchdowns on the ground. His top target was Pro Bowl receiver Greg Jennings, who caught 76 passes for 1,265 yards and 12 touchdowns, giving him a 16.6 yards per catch average while also ranking him fourth in the NFL in yards and second in touchdown catches. Other reliable targets included receivers James Jones (50 receptions, 676 yards, 5 touchdowns), Donald Driver (51 receptions, 565 yards, 4 touchdowns), and Jordy Nelson (45 receptions, 582 yards, 496 kick return yards). The Packers lost star tight end Jermichael Finley (21 receptions 301 yards, 1 touchdown) to injury in week five who was their leading receiver at the time. The Packers ground game was crippled by injuries, especially the Week 1 loss of Ryan Grant, who had rushed for over 1,200 yards in each of the last two seasons. In his absence, the team relied prominently on Brandon Jackson, who rushed for 703 yards and caught 43 passes for 342, and fullback John Kuhn, who added 281 yards on the ground. The team's offensive line was anchored by pro bowl tackle Chad Clifton, an 11-year veteran.\nThe Packers defense ranked second in the league in fewest points allowed per game (15). The line was led by Cullen Jenkins, who recorded seven sacks in just eleven games, and 338-pound defensive tackle B. J. Raji, who had 6.5. The linebackers were led by Pro Bowler Clay Matthews and A. J. Hawk. Matthews ranked fourth in the NFL with 13.5 sacks, while Hawk led the team in combined tackles (111) and intercepted three passes. Three of the Packers starters in the secondary also made the Pro Bowl. Tramon Williams led the team with a career-high 6 interceptions, while adding 326 punt return yards. Other Pro Bowl selections included safety Nick Collins (4 interceptions and 70 combined tackles) and hard hitting 13-year veteran cornerback Charles Woodson, who recorded 92 total tackles and forced five fumbles, while also intercepting two passes.\nThe Packers entered the Super Bowl never having trailed by more than 7 points at any point during the season—a feat that had never been accomplished during a complete season in the Super Bowl era. The last team to complete a season with this distinction was the Detroit Lions in 1962. In the Super Bowl game itself, the Packers never trailed.\nOf note, this was Green Bay's first Super Bowl against an AFC team that was not one of the \"Original 8\" American Football League franchises. The Packers had played Kansas City, Oakland, New England, and Denver in their four previous Super Bowl match-ups, defeating the Chiefs, Raiders and Patriots, and losing to the Broncos. The Steelers, like the Packers, predated the AFL's launch, having begun play in 1933 (12 years after the Packers joined the NFL after two years as an independent team), and moved to the AFC in 1970 as a result of the AFL–NFL merger to even out the two conferences.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Steelers advanced to the Super Bowl with two close wins in the playoffs. After a first-round bye, the Steelers defeated their division rival, the number 5 seeded Baltimore Ravens 31–24, with Ben Roethlisberger's 58-yard completion to Antonio Brown on third down and 19 setting up Rashard Mendenhall's game winning 2-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left in the game. Roethlisberger finished with 226 passing yards and two touchdowns, while the defense forced three turnovers and sacked Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco five times, three by James Harrison.\nThen the Steelers defeated the number 6 seeded New York Jets 24–19 in the AFC Championship Game. The Steelers seemed to be in complete control at first, taking a 24–0 lead in the first half. Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez rallied his team back, cutting the score to 24–10 going into the fourth quarter. The Jets then drove to the Steelers 2-yard line on a 17-play drive, but the Steelers defense made a key stand, keeping them out of the end zone on four consecutive plays near the goal-line to force a turnover. The Jets subsequently forced a safety and scored a touchdown with just over three minutes left, but Roethlisberger's 14-yard completions to Brown and Heath Miller allowed the Steelers to hang onto the ball until time expired. Mendenhall finished with 121 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 2 catches for 32 yards.\nThe Packers started off their postseason with a 21–16 win over the number 3 seeded Philadelphia Eagles after Tramon Williams intercepted a pass from Michael Vick in the end zone with less than a minute left to play. Aaron Rodgers threw for 180 yards and three touchdowns while James Starks, who only rushed for 101 yards during the season, rushed for 123 yards in the game.\nThe Packers then went to Atlanta, where the top-seeded 13–3 Atlanta Falcons were waiting. Although the Falcons took advantage of an early turnover and a kick return touchdown to build a 14–7 lead, the Packers quickly buried the Falcons with 35 straight points. By the end of the first half, the Packers held a 28–14 lead, and went on to win comfortably, 48–21. Rodgers was nearly perfect, completing 31 of 36 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns, while adding another score on the ground. Jordy Nelson and James Jones both had touchdown catches, while John Kuhn added scores by air and ground and Tramon Williams returned one of his two interceptions 70 yards for a touchdown. The Packers' special teams unit never had to punt the ball, while Mason Crosby contributed two field goals.\nThe Packers next faced their rival, the number 2 Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship Game, defeating them 21–14. This time Rodgers had a rougher day than his previous two games, throwing no touchdown passes and being intercepted twice. But he still threw for 244 yards and scored a 1-yard touchdown run, while Starks added 74 rushing yards, including a touchdown run in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the Packers' defense knocked Bears quarterback Jay Cutler out of the game and intercepted three passes, one of which was returned 18 yards for a touchdown by B. J. Raji. The other two were made by rookie Sam Shields, who recorded his second interception near his own end zone with 37 seconds left to put the game away.\nSuper Bowl pregame notes.\nBoth teams are known to have sizable fanbases that often travel to away games, largely due to season tickets for home games having decades-long waiting lists. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the two teams tied as having the best fans in the NFL. ESPN's own John Clayton, a Pittsburgh native, broke the tie in favor of the Steelers.\nAs the Packers were the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the team elected to wear their green jerseys. Although both teams are known to wear their colored jerseys at home and have rarely worn white at home, the Packers decision contrasted with the Steelers decision as the home team in Super Bowl XL to wear white jerseys. Both the 2005 Steelers and 2010 Packers were number 6 seeded teams when they reached the Super Bowl, forcing them to play all of their postseason games on the road and wearing their respective white jerseys in those games.\nThe retractable roof at Cowboys Stadium was closed for the game.\nA severe winter storm blanketed the Dallas–Fort Worth area in hard ice and snow the week before the game, threatening to disrupt game preparations. Snow fell from the roof of Cowboys Stadium's East end on February 4, injuring six people. Over 3,000 tickets were sold to watch the game in the stadium's East Plaza, which experienced the falling ice tragedy earlier in the week. However, the snow had melted by game time and fans who paid $200 per ticket were allowed to watch the game outside Cowboys Stadium, in the open air, as the weather turned from sleet to sun.\nSince the Steelers and Packers were two of the six teams that did not have cheerleaders during the 2010 NFL season (the others being the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Cleveland Browns, and New York Giants), this marked the first Super Bowl without cheerleaders.\nPackers lineman, Bryan Bulaga, became the youngest player to start in a Super Bowl, at the age of 21 years and 322 days old. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey would have been the youngest player (21 years, 197 days), but he could not play because of a high ankle sprain.\nPossible presidential appearance.\nDuring a press conference on January 19, 2011, President Barack Obama (a longtime Chicago Bears fan) said he would attend Super Bowl XLV if Chicago defeated Green Bay, saying \"If Chicago wins, I'm going no doubt\". Chicago ended up losing the NFC Championship game a few days later on January 23 to Green Bay 21–14. In a post-game locker-room speech, Green Bay Packers corner Charles Woodson poked fun at the President's comment saying \"The President don't want to come watch us at the Super Bowl, guess what? We'll go see him\" (implying that Green Bay would win the Super Bowl and visit the White House as the winning team usually does each year; a statement that would come true). Woodson then broke the Packers meeting with a team cheer of \"White House!\". On January 26 President Obama visited Green Bay and was greeted by Mayor Jim Schmitt and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker who presented the President with two Green Bay Packers Jerseys. The first had Obama's name on the back with the number 1 and the second was an autographed Charles Woodson jersey with the message \"See you at the White House. Go Packers!\" written on the back by Woodson.\nOn August 12, 2011, Woodson's promise came true and the Packers visited the White House and met with President Obama. Their visit was delayed because of the NFL lockout and took place a day before the Packers first preseason game against the Cleveland Browns. President Obama was presented with a Packers jersey with the number 1 and the words Commander-In-Chief on the back. He was also presented with a stock share of the Packers organization, thus making him a part owner of the Packers. When Obama jokingly asked if this meant he could trade Aaron Rodgers to the Bears, Woodson responded that Obama was just \"a minority owner\".\nObama, who is also a Steelers fan and considers the team to be his second-favorite after the Bears, openly supported the Steelers two years earlier in Super Bowl XLIII after the Rooney family helped with his campaigning work and later appointed Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, an ethnic Irish Catholic, the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He did not attend the game; instead, he hosted a 100-person Super Bowl party at the White House. Attendees included his family, elected leaders from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, DNC member Andres Lopez of Puerto Rico, Buffalo, New York mayor Byron Brown, Buffalo deputy mayor Steve Casey, Newark, New Jersey mayor Cory Booker, Jennifer Lopez and her husband Marc Anthony, both actors/singers, ESPN columnist Michael Wilbon, and Tony Kornheiser.\nAlthough the sitting president did not attend the game, former president and former Texas governor George W. Bush was present, along with his wife Laura and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\nLocal commemoration.\nFrom June 15, 2010, through February 6, 2011, the 30-mile section of Interstate 30 between Dallas and Fort Worth along which Cowboys Stadium is situated had been temporarily designated as the \"Tom Landry Super Bowl Highway\" in commemoration of Super Bowl XLV. The former Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike is normally known as the \"Tom Landry Highway\" in honor of former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry.\nLogo.\nWhile past Super Bowl games used their own unique logo designs that changed yearly and featured imagery which reflected the host city, Super Bowl XLV introduced a new standardized, silver-colored emblem, featuring an image of the Vince Lombardi Trophy sitting atop the traditional Roman numerals used to denote each edition, with a stylized image of the host stadium shown in the background. It was introduced as part of a new, standardized branding scheme for the NFL's postseason games, which also saw the redesign of the conference championship trophies.\nThe only changes made to the logo for future games, until Super Bowl 50, was to change the number and the stadium depicted. Super Bowl 50 deviated slightly from the standard design to emphasize the game's \"golden anniversary\", featuring the number \"50\" in large gold numbering on each side of the trophy rather than below it in Roman numerals. This modified layout, but with Roman numerals, no stadium, and different accent colors or, later, designs within the numerals, has been used for subsequent Super Bowl games.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nFox televised the game in the United States, with Joe Buck as the play-by-play announcer and Troy Aikman, himself a three-time Super Bowl winner as a Dallas Cowboys quarterback, as the color analyst. Mike Pereira joined Buck and Aikman in the broadcast booth to comment on instant replay reviews, while Pam Oliver and Chris Myers served as sideline reporters. The pre-game show featured the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew of host Curt Menefee and a group of analysts with extensive Super Bowl experiences of their own: Terry Bradshaw (4 time Super Bowl-winning quarterback with the Pittsburgh Steelers), Howie Long (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the then-Los Angeles Raiders), Michael Strahan (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the New York Giants) and Jimmy Johnson (two-time Super Bowl winning head coach with the Dallas Cowboys). They were joined by a variety of other commentators.\nFive days prior to the game, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, seized and shut down several websites that had provided access to pirated Internet television feeds of NFL games.\nWith an average US audience of 111 million viewers, this was the most-watched Super Bowl as well as the most-watched program of any kind in American television history, beating the previous record of 106.5 million viewers for Super Bowl XLIV. However, Super Bowl XVI still holds the record for the highest rated Super Bowl in history with a 49.1 national rating and a 73 share. An estimated 162.9 million total viewers watched all or part of the game. The game drew a national household Nielsen rating of 46.0 and a 69 share. It drew a 59.7 local rating in both Milwaukee (WITI) and Pittsburgh (WPGH), the second-highest local rating for a Super Bowl after the 63.0 that Super Bowl XX drew in Chicago. In the host market of Dallas–Fort Worth (KDFW), the game drew a 53.7 rating.\nFox's lead-out program was an episode of \"Glee\" titled \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\". At the conclusion of \"Glee\"'s airing, Fox became the first media network in U.S. television history to garner a single-night primetime average of at least 100 million viewers.\nAdvertising.\nBy September 15, 2010, Fox had sold 90 percent of all available slots; all slots were completely sold out by October. The price of an advertisement began at US$3 million. Pepsi-Cola returned after a one-year retreat with three ads for their Pepsi Max drink, which has been named as the official soft drink of the NFL. Pepsi's Frito-Lay brand also advertised Doritos. Both brands had their advertisements created by web users as part of the annual USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter contest, which offers a prize of US $5 million. In addition, regular purchasers Anheuser-Busch InBev, GoDaddy.com, Coca-Cola, CareerBuilder.com, and E*TRADE purchased advertisements; InBev advertised Stella Artois imported beer for the first time in the Super Bowl in addition to its usual Budweiser and Bud Light advertisements. Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Audi also advertised, as did General Motors, who returned for the first time since their bankruptcy with advertisements for the Chevrolet Cruze, Camaro, Silverado and Volt. Chrysler purchased a 2-minute-long advertisement for its Chrysler 200 featuring Eminem.\nAdvertisements for 15 films were shown during the pregame show, the game itself, and the postgame.\nInternational.\nNFL International provided television coverage for viewers outside of North America, with Bob Papa and Joe Theismann calling the English language feed. The game was shown live on the following channels:\nRadio.\nWestwood One broadcast Super Bowl XLV across the United States and Canada, with play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan (calling his first Super Bowl for the network) and color analyst Boomer Esiason. Univision Radio carried a Spanish language feed for its stations throughout the US. The flagship stations for each team also carried the game with their respective local announcers:\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live carried radio coverage with Darren Fletcher and Greg Brady announcing.\nSirius XM Satellite Radio carried 14 feeds in ten languages to Sirius subscribers, as well as to XM subscribers with the \"Best of Sirius\" package. In addition to the Westwood One and local team broadcasts, Sirius carried the following international feeds:\nFieldPass, the subscription Internet radio service provided by the league at NFL.com, also carried most of these feeds. Due to contractual restrictions, only Sirius XM and FieldPass were permitted to carry the local team broadcasts along with WTAQ, WIXX, WTMJ, WDVE and WBGG, with the teams' other network radio affiliates instead airing the Westwood One feed.\nAttendance.\nCowboys Stadium installed 15,000 temporary seats and utilized its standing room to increase its capacity to over 105,000 fans. If the stadium had been filled to capacity (its record for an NFL game is 105,121 spectators), it would have set a record for Super Bowl attendance, breaking the previous record of 103,985 fans for Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl; however the actual attendance of 103,219 fell 766 fans short. League officials had indicated that they would also count spectators watching the game on large television screens from outside the stadium in the tally, which generally is not allowed in official attendance counts. However, Super Bowl XLV was the first Super Bowl game to break the 100,000 threshold in attendance since Super Bowl XXI in 1987.\nDue to numerous delays, including damage sustained from an ice storm, 1,250 temporary seats weren't ready in time for the game. According to a police officer standing near the affected area, the seats hadn't been installed in time for the fire marshal to inspect them. The NFL scrambled almost until kickoff to find replacement seats. Eventually, 850 fans in four sections were relocated, while 400 fans in two sections were given a refund equivalent to three times the face value of their ticket. The latter set of fans were later offered the chance to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench, but would still get the triple refund. Some of these fans were still upset, since they had spent thousands on airfare and hotels. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that when the league decided to relocate the 850 fans, it lost any shot of setting the attendance record.\nThe NFL subsequently offered affected fans a ticket to the next Super Bowl in addition to the refund. It also offered fans the option of a ticket to any future Super Bowl, along with round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. However, this wasn't enough to mollify several fans, who on February 9 filed a $5 million class-action lawsuit against the NFL, the Cowboys and Jones. In addition to Steelers and Packers fans left without seats, the suit includes Cowboys fans who paid $100,000 for personal seat licenses, only to have to watch the Super Bowl in metal folding chairs without a view of the stadium's giant video replay board. The NFL at first offered $2,400 to fans who did not receive a replacement seat, but later offered tickets to a future Super Bowl with airfare and hotels included.\nNot all of the fans accepted the NFL's settlement offer, so the case went to trial. The outcome of the lawsuit was a finding for the plaintiffs against the NFL in the matter of breach of contract, and not liable for fraudulent inducement. The Cowboys and Jerry Jones were dismissed as parties to the lawsuit since the plaintiffs' contracts were solely with the NFL. The plaintiffs were awarded between $5,600 and $22,000 depending on the value of their tickets.\nEntertainment and other ceremonies.\nPregame.\nKeith Urban and Maroon 5 performed during the pregame. The Texas Christian University Horned Frog Marching Band also performed during the pregame show. 22-year-old Candice Villesca of Lewisville, Texas, performed the national anthem and \"America the Beautiful\" in American Sign Language. Lea Michele performed \"America the Beautiful\" supported by the Air Force Tops in Blue. Pop singer Christina Aguilera sang the national anthem but performed the wrong lyrics for the fourth line of the song, later issuing an apology.\nThe coin toss ceremony was the first to commemorate two anniversaries—the 25th anniversary of Super Bowl XX and 15th of Super Bowl XXX, which marked the Dallas Cowboys' most recent Super Bowl championship. In honor of those occasions, Super Bowl XX MVP Richard Dent and former Dallas Cowboys defensive back Deion Sanders, both of whom were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011, took part in the ceremonies. They were joined by fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees and past Super Bowl participants Marshall Faulk, Chris Hanburger and Shannon Sharpe.\nHalftime.\nThe Black Eyed Peas performed a medley of their greatest hits: \"I Gotta Feeling\", \"Boom Boom Pow\", \"Pump It\", \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\", \"Let's Get It Started\", and \"Where Is the Love?\" Slash made a guest appearance, performing \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" with Fergie, while Usher made an appearance to perform his song \"OMG\" with will.i.am. The show also displayed a long list of other performers, including Prairie View A&amp;M University's \"Marching Storm\" Band. Country music was originally in the planning until the Black Eyed Peas agreed to perform. This halftime show was intended to bring youth back into the Super Bowl halftime show as legacy artists were book for the past halftime shows following the incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show where Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's breast on live television. This was also the first halftime show to feature a female co-headliner in 7 years, Fergie, since Jackson.\nIn Jermaine Jackson's book \"You Are Not Alone: Through a Brother's Eyes\", it reveals that after the This Is It tour, Michael Jackson wanted to perform in the Super Bowl one last time, which unfortunately never came to pass because of the singer's sudden death in 2009.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nAfter the first three drives of the game ended with punts, Green Bay opened up the scoring with Aaron Rodgers's 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson, who managed to pull slightly ahead of cornerback William Gay enough to make a leaping catch and fall into the end zone. Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was hit by Howard Green as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go well short of his intended target near the left sideline where it was intercepted by Nick Collins and returned 37 yards for a touchdown, giving Green Bay a 14–0 lead. This score continued the unbeaten streak of Super Bowl victories recorded by teams scoring on an interception run-back, improving to 11–0 in such games. It was also the third consecutive Super Bowl with an interception return for a touchdown, as well as the eighth such score in the last ten Super Bowls. The Packers also tied the Miami Dolphins' record which still stands for the largest Super Bowl lead (14 points) at the end of the first quarter, set in Super Bowl VIII against the Minnesota Vikings and later tied by the Oakland Raiders against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV.\nThis time Pittsburgh managed to respond, driving 49 yards in 13 plays including Roethlisberger's 18-yard run on 3rd down and 9. Shaun Suisham finished the drive with a 33-yard field goal to cut the score to 14–3. Then after forcing a punt, the Steelers drove to midfield, but turned the ball over again when Roethlisberger's pass was intercepted by defensive back Jarrett Bush at the 47. After the interception, Rodgers led the Packers to another score, completing two passes for 20 yards before James Starks's 12-yard run moved the ball to the 21-yard line. On the next play, Green Bay increased their lead to 21–3 with Rodgers' 21-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings. Taking the ball back with 2:24 left in the second quarter, Roethlisberger made a 37-yard completion to Antwaan Randle El on their first play. After that, receiver Hines Ward caught three passes for 39 yards on the drive, the last one an 8-yard touchdown catch with 37 seconds left in the half, making the score 21–10 at halftime. This was the fourth time in their four 2011 postseason games that the Packers finished the first half with a lead of at least 11 points. The first half had taken a heavy toll on both teams. The Steelers lost wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders to injury, while the Packers lost receiver Donald Driver along with defensive backs Charles Woodson and Sam Shields. Shields would be the only player among them who would return.\nSecond half.\nPittsburgh's defense forced Green Bay to punt on the first drive of the second half, and got the ball at midfield after a face-mask call on Tom Crabtree while tackling Antonio Brown on the punt return. The offense then scored in five plays (all runs). First, Rashard Mendenhall broke free along with right sideline for a 17-yard run, then Isaac Redman rushed for 3 yards, and Roethlisberger ran for 6, bringing up third down and 1. On the next play, Redman tried to run up the middle, but was held up at the line, so he backed away and ran to the outside for a 16-yard gain to the 8-yard line. Then Mendenhall scored an 8-yard touchdown run on the next play, making the score 21–17. After forcing a punt, Pittsburgh mounted a drive to the Packers 29-yard line, but Green Bay's defense made a stand. First Roethlisberger's pass was batted down behind the line by linebacker Clay Matthews, then Roethlisberger tried a screen pass to tight end Heath Miller, but Desmond Bishop tackled him for a 3-yard loss. Then on third down Frank Zombo sacked Roethlisberger on the 34, and Suisham's ensuing 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, the Steelers lost their third turnover of the game when Mendenhall fumbled the ball while being tackled behind the line by Matthews and Ryan Pickett. Bishop recovered the ball and returned it 7 yards to the Packers 45. Five plays later on third down and 10, Rodgers completed a 38-yard pass to Nelson at the Steelers 2-yard line. Pittsburgh linebacker LaMarr Woodley sacked Rodgers for a 6-yard loss on the next play, but Rodgers threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jennings after that, increasing the Packers lead to 28–17. Roethlisberger led the Steelers right back with 6 of 7 completions. After a 9-yard pass to tight end Matt Spaeth, he threw three completions to receiver Mike Wallace for 27 yards to the Green Bay 40-yard line. Then after a 15-yard completion to Ward, he finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Wallace. On the two-point conversion play, Roethlisberger faked a hand-off to Mendenhall and ran up to the line before pitching the ball to Randle El, who scored on an outside sweep, cutting the Steelers deficit to 3 points at 28–25.\nGreen Bay took the ball back with just over 7 minutes left, and found themselves facing third down and 10 after two plays, but Rodgers kept the drive going with a 31-yard completion to Jennings over the middle. Starks then ran 14 yards to the Steelers 30. Two plays later, James Jones caught a 21-yard pass at the 8. The Steelers defense kept Green Bay out of the end zone, forcing the Packers to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Mason Crosby that gave Green Bay a 31–25 lead with 2:07 left in regulation.\nFollowing a penalty on the kickoff, Pittsburgh got the ball back on their own 13-yard line with the opportunity to start a game-winning drive. On their first play, Roethlisberger completed a 15-yard pass to Miller. But after a 5-yard reception by Ward, his next three passes were incomplete, turning the ball over on downs and allowing the Packers to run out the rest of the clock. In a nod to Green Bay's defensive dominance, Pittsburgh did not take the lead at any time in the entire game.\nStatistical overview.\nThe Packers joined the New York Giants as the only teams to win Super Bowls in 3 different decades (1966, 1967, 1996, and 2010).\nNelson was the top receiver of the game with 9 receptions for 140 yards (both career highs) and a touchdown, while also gaining 19 more yards on a kick return, all despite 3 dropped passes. Jennings added 64 yards and 2 touchdowns. Roethlisberger completed 25 of 40 passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns, with 2 interceptions, and ran for 31 yards. His top target was Wallace, who caught 9 passes for 89 yards and a score. Mendenhall was the top rusher of the game with 64 yards and a touchdown.\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XLV, Super Bowl XLV Play Finder GB, Super Bowl XLV Play Finder Pit\nIndividual statistics.\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted"

        "title": "Baltusrol Golf Club",
        "text": "The Baltusrol Golf Club is a private 36-hole golf club in the eastern United States, located in Springfield, New Jersey, about west of New York City. It was founded in 1895 by Louis Keller.\nIn 1985, Baltusrol became the first club to have hosted both the U.S. Open and Women's U.S. Open on two different courses. Both courses were originally designed by A. W. Tillinghast in 1918. The club has been the site of seven U.S. Opens and two PGA Championships.\nIn 2005, the club was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2014, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of its importance to Tillinghast's career as a course designer.\nHistory.\nBaltusrol Golf Club was named after Baltus Roll (1769–1831), who farmed the land on which the club resides today. In 1831, he was murdered at age 61 on February 22 by two thieves who believed that he had hidden a small treasure in his farmhouse on Baltusrol mountain. Two men, Peter B. Davis and Lycidias Baldwin were suspected of the murder. Baldwin fled to a tavern in Morristown where he killed himself with an apparent overdose of narcotics. Davis was apprehended and stood trial in Newark. Despite the overwhelming but circumstantial evidence, much of which the trial judge ruled as inadmissible, Davis was acquitted of murder. He was, however, convicted of forgery and sentenced to 24 years in prison, and later died in Trenton State Prison.\nThe land was purchased in the 1890s by Louis Keller, who was the publisher of the New York Social Register. He owned of land in Springfield Township. On October 19, 1895, Keller announced that the Baltusrol Golf Club would open. The club's original 9-hole course was designed by George Hunter in 1895 and expanded to 18 holes in 1898. This course, which is called the Old Course, was further modified by George Low and no longer exists.\nKeller hired A. W. Tillinghast to build a second golf course to complement the Old Course. However, Tillinghast recommended that the Old Course be plowed over and he would design and build two new courses. The club approved his design recommendation and commenced construction of the Upper and Lower courses in 1918. In August 1919, \"Golf Illustrated\" declared that \"what they are planning at Baltusrol is on a vaster scale than anything that has ever been attempted in American Golf for the opening of the Dual Courses.\" The Dual Courses, or Upper and Lower, were the first contiguous 36-hole design built in America. Both courses officially opened for play in June 1922. In the years following their opening, refinements were made to prepare these courses for National Championship play. The first national championship held on the Lower was the 1926 U.S. Amateur. The first national championship on the Upper was the U.S. Open in 1936. Tillinghast served as the club's architect until his death in 1942.\nIn 1948, Robert Trent Jones was retained to update and lengthen the Lower course for tournament play. The Lower course was lengthened again by his son Rees Jones in 1992 in preparation for the U.S. Open in 1993. He also updated and lengthened the Upper course in advance of the 2000 U.S. Amateur. On both the Lower and Upper courses, Jones and his senior designer Steve Weisser reinstated and restored various Tillinghast design features which had been lost over the years. Some famous golfers to win tournaments at Baltusrol include Ed Furgol, Mickey Wright, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Janzen, and Phil Mickelson. In 1995, \"Golf Magazine\" recognized Baltusrol as one of \"The First 100 Clubs in America.\"\nClubhouse.\nIn March 1909, the original clubhouse burned down. That same year, a new clubhouse was quickly designed by Chester Hugh Kirk, a member of the golf club, in a Tudor revival style and construction begun in June.\nIn 1912, it became the first clubhouse to host a President of the United States, William Howard Taft.\nTournaments hosted.\nIn its history, Baltusrol has hosted 15 USGA-sponsored championships and three PGA-sponsored Championships. It has hosted the U.S. Open seven times, in 1903, 1915, 1936, 1954, 1967, 1980, and 1993. It has hosted the U.S. Amateur four times, in 1904, 1926, 1946, and 2000. It has hosted the U.S. Women's Open twice, in 1961 and 1985, and the U.S. Women's Amateur twice, in 1901 and 1911. The 2005 PGA Championship was Baltusrol's first time hosting a PGA Championship, and it returned in 2016. The 79th Women's PGA Championship for 2023 and the 111th PGA Championship for 2029 were awarded to Baltusrol in a joint deal.\nBolded years are major championships on the PGA Tour\nCourse information.\nThe Upper and Lower courses are very different, being built on two distinct geological formations. Tillinghast designed them as \"Dual Courses\" which were to be \"equally sought after as a matter of preference.\" The Lower is spread out over rolling parkland, the remains of a terminal moraine deposited during the last glaciation about 18,000 years ago. The Upper runs along a ridgeline known as Baltusrol Mountain, the east side of the First Watchung Mountain (Orange Mountain) that was formed from vast lava flows about 200 million years ago. Both courses have ponds and other man-made and natural hazards that come into play. On the Lower Course, the 4th hole and the 18th hole have ponds, and on the Upper Course, the 9th and the 13th holes have ponds. The 10th, 13th, and 15th holes have creeks in play. As of 2010, Baltusrol Golf Club holds the distinction of being the only two-course club to ever host both the U.S. Men's and Women's Open Championships on both of its courses.\nLower Course.\nThe Lower course from the black tees measures and is a par 72, but for the 2005 PGA Championship, the course measured and was par 70.

With about 1800 members, at present ASK is one of the biggest swimming clubs in Norway according to memberships, second only to its neighbour Bærumssvømmerne.\nIt was founded in 1957. In the seventies and eighties, ASK was the dominating club in Norwegian swimming, with athletes like Øyvind Miller, Lasse Nagell, Knut Arne Landbøe, Fredrik Sørvig, Haakon Schram-Stokke, Kristine Moen and Karina Samuelsen. In the nineties ASK experienced a downfall, and one of their training-facilities, Bondihallen, was shut down due to poor maintenance. Still the club fostered talents, and swimmers like Aleksander Hetland and Andre Bratgjerd developed their skills at Asker before transferring to other clubs.\nAround the year 2000 ASK again began climbing to the top. Coach Øyvind Marstein took charge in Asker and under his leadership the environment blossomed. Marstein scouted Kenneth Olsen for the top position as head coach, and presented him with a large number of talented swimmers whom he had prepared for him. \nAt the Nationals in 2006 (NM Langbane), ASK took 20 medals (7 gold, 8 silver and 5 bronze). Swimmers like Ingvild Snildal, Michael Poulsen, Christian Aaserud, Siri-Eva Kristiansen, Joachim Haugen and Ola Riise are now top in their classes. \nASK's over 1300 members have an experienced team of coaches. Head coaches of today are Kenneth Olsen, Michael Poulsen, Martin Skavang and Ulf Riise. There are five assistant coaches and over 40 swimming instructors and assistant instructors who every day coach and teach swimming at top level."

Apart from France, who qualified automatically as defending champions, a total of 13.5 slots in the final tournament were available for UEFA teams.\nThe 50 teams were divided into nine groups, five groups of six teams and four groups of five teams. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners would qualify. Among the runners-up, Group 2 was drawn randomly to advance to the UEFA–AFC Intercontinental play-off while the remaining eight runners-up would advance to the UEFA play-offs.\nIn the play-offs, the eight teams were paired up to play knockout matches on a home-and-away basis. The four aggregate winners qualified. The qualifying process started on 2 September 2000, after UEFA Euro 2000, and ended on 14 November 2001.\nQualification seeding (UEFA).\nThe draw was made in December 1999, and was based on average points per game achieved in 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification and UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying. France qualified automatically as title holders, and because Belgium and Netherlands, as hosts, had not had to qualify for UEFA Euro 2000, only their 1998 World Cup result was used. Andorra made their debut in World Cup qualifying.\nSummary.\nTable - top row: group winners, second row: group runners-up, third row: others. The winner of each group qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup together with winners of play-off. Group 2 was the last team drawn for its runner-up to participate in the UEFA/AFC intercontinental play-off. As runner-up in group 2, Republic of Ireland played a play-off against a team from the AFC confederation, whereas the others played against each other (UEFA play-off).\nFirst round.\nThe winner of each group qualified directly, the runner-up advanced to play-off (either UEFA playoff or UEFA-AFC playoff). \nSecond round.\nThe draw for the play-offs was held on 31 August 2001 at FIFA's headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The nine group runners-up were placed into one pot, with eight teams drawn into four pairings (with the first team drawn hosting the first leg). The remaining team then faced an AFC team in the inter-confederation play-offs. UEFA were paired to face the AFC team by decision of the FIFA Executive Committee in October 1999.\nBelgium won 2–0 on aggregate and qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nGermany won 5–2 on aggregate and qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nSlovenia won 3–2 on aggregate and qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nTurkey won 6–0 on aggregate and qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nAs the Group 2 runner-up was the last team to be selected in the play-off draw on 31 August 2001, that team then faced an AFC team in the inter-confederation play-offs. UEFA were paired to face the AFC team by decision of the FIFA Executive Committee in October 1999, though the order of legs was decided by the draw on 31 August 2001.

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal included show jumping, dressage and eventing. All three disciplines, except for the Nations Cup, were held at the equestrian stadium in Bromont, which had a capacity of 15,000 spectators, and the cross-country and steeplechase were also nearby. Building this stadium provided some headache for the Organizing Committee after the original estimate of 1 million Canadian dollars increased to CAD 4,425.\nPoland and Chile were not allowed to ship horses into the host country due to the concern of piroplasmosis, and France and Italy also had to keep some horses home due to veterinary regulations. Overall 23 nations competed: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Guatemala, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, and the US, with the Montreal Games being the first for Guatemala and Puerto Rico in equestrian events.\nThe 1976 Olympics was also the first Games with a disqualification due to a positive equine drug test, after San Carlos, ridden by Ronald McMahon of Ireland, received treatment following an injury during transport. Although the treatment was needed, the rules did not allow for him to compete.\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\nTom Gayford, assisted by Robert Jolicoeur, built the massive courses ridden by 61 riders from 20 countries. All courses were to be ridden at 400 m/min, and had 15 obstacles with 18 jumping efforts, including a 5m water. Round A, 950 meters in length, had verticals up to 1.60 meters and a 2.20 meter wide oxer with a 1.55 meter front rail and a back rail at 1.60 meters. Round B (660 meters) had a narrow 1.70 meter vertical, and the oxers were also raised in height. The final jump off was 470 meters long. Only 39-year-old Alwin Schockemöhle was able to pull off two clear rounds to win gold. The next three highest placed riders had 12 penalties apiece, and they had to jump off for silver and bronze.\nThe Nations Cup was held in the Olympic Stadium in front of 55,000 spectators, despite a great debate to move it to Bromont after intense rain. However, course dimensions were reduced. Alwin Schockemöhle managed to complete the 2 Nations Cup courses with 4 and 8 penalties respectively, helping Germany finish with team silver.\nDressage.\nThe 10-minute Grand Prix dressage test was ridden by 27 riders from 11 nations. The Grand Prix awarded up to 500 points per judge—2500 points total—with Christine Stückelberger winning the test on Granat with 1869 points (74.7%). The top 12 riders from the Grand Prix competed in a second test, the Grand Prix Special. The Special, with an 8-minute 45 second time allowed, was also won by Granat with 1486 out of 1950 possible points (76.2%), earning Stückelberger the individual gold medal. They finished 51 points ahead of silver medal winner Harry Boldt and Woycek, who was 40 points ahead of the bronze medal winners, Reiner Klimke riding Mehmed.\nThe favorites for the team competition were Germany, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union to medal, but the US managed to clinch the bronze ahead of the USSR for their first dressage medal since the 1948 Games.\nEventing.\n49 riders from 13 countries competed, including Princess Anne from Great Britain, becoming the first member of the British Royal Family to have participated in the Olympic games. There were also several sets of family members: Guatemala had a mother and daughter pair competing on their team (Rita and Silvia de Luna), while Australia had a father and son (Bill and Wayne Roycroft). The cross-country course designer, Barbara Kemp, was the first woman to design an Olympic equestrian course. It wouldn't be until 1996 when show jumping would have its first woman course designer with Linda Allen. The endurance day track was 27,465 meters in length, of which 7,695 meters was a 36-obstacle cross-country course. The track was very varied, traveling over meadows (2300 meters), gravel roads (1300 meters), through the woods (900 meters) as well as a manicured golf course (3200 meters).\nParticipating nations.\nIn the 1976 Summer Olympics, 135 contestants, including 111 men and 24 women, competed from 23 countries. The youngest participant was Silvia de Luna from Guatemala at 18 years old, while the oldest rider was the Australian Bill Roycroft at 61 years old.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

Collegiate Baseball League.\nFor many years the Drury University Panthers Baseball Team used the stadium as their home field until 2024.\nStarting in 2022 the stadium became the home of the Mission University Patriots Baseball Team.\nIn 2024 the stadium became the home of the Mission University Patriots Softball Team. \nHigh School Baseball.\nThe stadium hosts various high school baseball games throughout the fall and spring baseball seasons.\nThe stadium is the host of the MSHSAA State Baseball tournament for the years 2020-2025. \nYouth Baseball.\nIn 2009, the Springfield Metro Baseball League moved into the stadium and began play. The open registration league operated in the park with 19 &amp; under, 15 &amp; under, and 12 &amp; under divisions through 2014. Players registered starting each January and new teams are drafted each year in April. The summer season ran from mid-May through the end of July. A fall league also operated on weekends in September and October. The league's annual ceremonies in May had been host to a number of former Major League Baseball (MLB) players including Jack Clark, Willie Wilson, and others. Every third year (2011, 2014) the league ran a unique \"retro\" season with all the teams outfitted as MLB teams of the past including teams like the St. Louis Browns, Kansas City Athletics, and Washington Senators. The 2014 season was the first where the league operated entirely with wooden bats only. Just prior to the beginning of the 2015 season, the league was informed that the ballpark ownership and the city of Ozark were negotiating with fledgling semi-pro baseball leagues, and Springfield Metro Baseball relocated to ballparks on the near west side of Springfield (Barnhouse &amp; Optimist Fields). No baseball ended up taking place at Price Cutter Park in 2015.\nRevival.\nIn 2016, the facility was purchased by U.S. Baseball, who became the owner and operator. They invested $2 million to renovate the ballpark, including a new artificial surface, a new scoreboard, and upgraded concessions and press box.\nRenamed as U.S. Baseball Park, the facility again began hosting some college baseball games, starting with a contest between Drury University and William Jewell College in April. U.S. Baseball also used the ballpark to host the Show Me League, a four-team collegiate wooden-bat summer league. The facility also hosts Missouri high school state tournaments, and is used by the Queen City Crush, a team in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes baseball league.\n, the ballpark serves as the home field of the Drury Panthers baseball team."

        "title": "General Grant (sailing ship)",
        "text": "General Grant was a 1,005-ton three-masted bark built in Maine in the United States in 1864 and registered in Boston, Massachusetts. It was named after Ulysses S. Grant and owned by Messers Boyes, Richardson &amp; Co. She had a timber hull with a length of 179.5 ft, beam of 34.5 ft and depth of 21.5 ft. While on her way from Melbourne to London, \"General Grant\" crashed into a cliff on the west coast of main island of the Auckland Islands of New Zealand, and subsequently sank as a result. Sixty-eight people drowned and only 15 people survived.\nWreck.\nThe ship departed Melbourne on 4 May 1866 bound for London via Cape Horn, under the command of Captain William H. Loughlin. It was carrying 58 passengers and 25 crew, along with a cargo of wool, skins, 2,576 ounces of gold, and 9 tons of zinc spelter ballast. Included in the passenger list were a number of successful miners from the Australian gold fields.\nAt 11pm on 13 May 1866, the Auckland Islands were sighted dead ahead. With only light winds, the crew were unable to change course, and eventually collided against the cliffs and drifted into a large cave on Auckland Island's western shore. The rising tide and increasing swell caused the main mast to hit the cave roof repeatedly until the mast forced a hole through the hull; the ship sank on 14 May 1866. Although the weather remained calm, the boats were not launched immediately on the ship entering the cave as it was very dark, there was no obvious landing place, and pieces of spars and rock were falling down continually.\nOnce daylight arrived the three boats on board were prepared for launch. The boats consisted of two quarter boats (each 22 feet long) and a long boat of 30 feet. One of the quarter boats was launched first and sent outside to see if landing could be made. The boat was expected to return for more people but instead waited outside the cave as no landing could be found. By this time the swell was increasing. The second quarter boat took a number of passengers and crew, including Mrs Jewell, to the first boat for transfer. The long boat was lying on the quarter deck and was filled with passengers. The ship was sinking fast and the long boat floated off \"General Grant\"s decks. Unfortunately, the long boat was swamped with water just after getting clear of the ship. The second quarter boat stayed out of the danger area, but three people (David Ashworth, Aaron Hayman, and William Sanguily) were able to swim through the surf to the quarter boat. A total of fifteen people, including 9 crew and 6 passengers, survived the wreck. The captain did not leave the ship.\nPassengers and crew.\nThe list of those on \"General Grant\" includes:\nCastaway.\nAfter the sinking of the ship and the capsizing of the long boat, the remaining two quarter boats pulled up outside the cave and decided to row for Disappointment Island. They reached there at dark and then the next day made for the Auckland Island and Port Ross. They arrived there after three days and two nights. After exploring, the group found two huts at Port Ross and, on 13 July 1866 Musgrave's hut. The group split in two in order to keep watch for passing ships. After nine months ashore, four of the crew decided to attempt to sail to New Zealand in one of the quarter boats. They set sail on 22 January 1867 without a compass, chart, or nautical instrument of any kind and were never seen again. Another survivor, David McLelland, died of illness on 3 September 1867. He was 62.\nThe ten remaining survivors moved to Enderby Island, where they lived on seals and pigs. On 19 November, they sighted the cutter \"Fanny\", but she did not see their signals. The brig \"Amherst\" noticed their signals on 21 November 1867 and rescued the group.\nAs a result of this shipwreck and two previous wrecks (\"Grafton\" and \"Invercauld\"), the New Zealand government established a network of castaway depots and regular visits by government vessels to the subantarctic islands to relieve further shipwreck victims.\nFrom as soon as 1868, \"General Grant\"s cargo of gold attracted numerous recovery attempts, several of which proved deadly for the wreck seekers, but the exact location of the wreck has yet to be confirmed."

All matches were played in the \"Celso Morbach Gimnasium\", in São Leopoldo.\nThe competition is not one of the main events in the FIVB international calendar, but it is perceived by the participating countries as an important test for their national teams. Those with a younger group were using the event to provide international experience to their players.\nThe format adopted was very simple. Six teams, divided in two groups of three, played for the berths in the semifinals. That being the case, only the last team of each group failed to qualify, the remaining four advancing to the semifinals in the following system: winner of Group A versus second place of Group B and winner of Group B versus second place of Group A. The winners of the semifinal matches would play for the title, whereas the losers played for the third place.

The competitions were held from 10 to 14 August 1932. Due to the Great Depression, only 31 entries from 6 nations competed—which was to be the lowest participation of any Olympic Games.\nDisciplines.\nJumping.\nThe jumping competition had 11 riders from 4 nations. While individual medals were awarded, none of the teams managed to have three riders finish the course so team medals were not awarded.\nThe 18-obstacle, 20-effort course was 1,060 meters in length, and included two fences at 1.60 meters, a very difficult wall, and a water that was 5 meters in width. 100,000 spectators were present at the show jumping competition.\nDressage.\nThe dressage had 10 riders from 4 nations, and was held on the Riviera Country Club's polo field. 25,000 spectators watched the 16-minute tests, which now for the first time included piaffe and passage. A controversy arose after Swedish rider Bertil Sandström was accused of clicking to his horse, which was not allowed under FEI rules. Sandström claimed it was simply his new saddle squeaking. After being reviewed by the Appeals Committee consisting of FEI President Guy Henry, FEI Vice President Clarence von Rosen of Sweden, and FEI Secretary General Georges Hector of France, the decision was made to place Sandström, who was in silver position, last individually but to allow his score to count for his team. This resulted in a French rider moving into individual silver position and an American moving into bronze.\nEventing.\n14 riders competed with only 3 teams starting: the United States, The Netherlands, and Sweden. Sweden's Arne Francke was eliminated during the cross-country phase, so only team gold (United States) and silver (The Netherlands) were awarded. Pahud de Mortanges won his second consecutive individual gold medal, while individual silver went to Earl Foster Thomson on Jenny Camp who was to repeat that performance at the 1936 Olympic Games. The bronze winner in the eventing competition, Clarence von Rosen junior, also won bronze in the Jumping competition.\nParticipating nations.\nEach country was allowed to enter three riders in every event.

        "title": "Equestrian events at the 1936 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The equestrian events at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics included dressage, eventing, and show jumping. All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The host country, Germany, had a stellar year, winning both individual and team gold in every equestrian event, as well as individual silver in dressage. The competitions were held from 12 to 16 August 1936. Moderately priced tickets meant huge crowds at all equestrian events, with 15,000–20,000 spectators at any time during the dressage competition, 60,000 on the endurance day of eventing, and 120,000 for the Nations Cup in jumping.\nThere were 127 riders total (133 entries) from 21 nations (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States). Seven countries (Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the USA) fielded 3-person teams for all three disciplines. Of those 127 riders, only two were civilians: a Dutch eventer and a jumper rider from Norway. The majority of horses were German (24/133) or French-bred (23/133), with 25 coming that were either British or Irish-bred (it is thought 17 from Ireland and 8 Britain), 8/133 US-bred (all on the US team, in addition to one French-bred horse), and the Japanese riders using 2 Japanese, 2 Australian, 1 British and 1 French-bred horse.\nDisciplines.\nJumping.\n54 riders from 18 nations competed in the jumping competition, with only 38 riders finishing the first round. Course designer August Andreae built a 1050 meter long course of 13 fences/20 jumping efforts at 1.30–1.60 meters in height. It included one double and three triple combinations and a 5-meter water jump. The jump-off course raised many fences, widened the water to 5.50 meters, and altered some of the distances between fences. Germany won its fifth equestrian gold medal in the Nations Cup. The individual medal placements required two jump-offs: the first to decide gold and silver between 2 riders who had only 1 knockdown up to that point. The second to determine bronze between 3 riders with 2 knock downs each.\nDressage.\nThe dressage competition had 29 riders from 11 nations, with the youngest rider, Heinz Pollay (age 28) winning individual gold. The 17-minute test had 22 movements, and was fought out between the Germans and the French, each with their own views of correct training. Both the individual gold and individual silver medal horses, Kronos and Absinth respectively, were originally trained by Otto Lörke. The youngest horse was 7-year-old Revue, and 5 of the horses competing, including the gold-medal winner Kronos, were only 8 years of age. There were also older horses competing, including 18-year-old Csintalan.\nEventing.\n50 riders from 19 nations contested the eventing competition, but only 4 of the 14 nations fielding a team would finish, most with incredibly high scores. Germany won both individual and team gold medals, and there is some speculation as to whether, as the home nation, they knew some of the pitfalls of the cross-country course that the other teams did not. Three obstacles on the August Andreae-designed course would have been removed under today's standards of competition, especially after the heavy rain that fell the day before Endurance. Germany won with 676 points, Poland finishing second with 991 points. Britain finished third with 9,195 points, after one of their riders fell on cross-country and his horse had to be caught (the penalty clock continued to run, and with no time limit, the team just continued to rack up penalty points). Czechoslovakia finished fourth with 18,952 points, after Capt Kawecki fell (breaking 2 ribs) and loose his horse that had to be caught, while Otomar Bureš took nearly 3 hours to complete the course, resulting in him accruing 18130.70 penalty points.\nThe dressage test was 13 minutes in length. The 36 km endurance course included a 7 km Roads and Tracks (Phase A) to be completed in 29 min 10 sec, followed by a 12-obstacle, 4 km steeplechase (6 min 40 sec optimum time), then Phase C (15 km Roads and Tracks in 62 min, 30 sec). The cross-country (Phase D) was an 8 km, 35-obstacle course with an optimum time of 17 min and 46 seconds. Phase E was a 2 km gallop in 6 minutes. The jumping phase had obstacles with a maximum height of 1.15 meters, width of 1.50 meters, and a water jump 3.5 meters wide.\nControversy.\nThe 1936 Olympics produced controversial results, with the Germans winning all 6 gold medals, the only time in Olympic history where one team has made a clean sweep. One incident occurred on the cross-country course in the eventing competition, where the 4th fence, a 3 ft post-and-rail dropping into a pond, produced a great number of falls. The landing was much deeper than anticipated and the footing underneath did not hold up well.\nIt should also be of note that future Lieutenant colonel and 1932 Olympic gold medal holder Takeichi Nishi participated in this event as well but Nishi fell off his horse, \"Uranus\", mid-course. There is speculation this was intentional and done for the benefit of host country Nazi Germany, with whom Japan would sign the 1940 Tripartite Pact, forming the Axis powers. Lt.Col. Nishi would go on to command a tank regiment in the Battle of Iwo Jima. \"Uranus\" remained alive throughout the war, but his fate is unknown.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 127 horse riders from 21 nations competed at the Berlin Games:\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

        "text": "American Football is an American midwest emo band from Urbana, Illinois, originally active from 1997 until 2000. They reformed in 2014.\nThe band was formed by guitarist/bassist and singer Mike Kinsella (formerly of Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc and currently of Owen), guitarist Steve Holmes (also a member of the Geese), and drummer and trumpet player Steve Lamos (formerly of the One Up Downstairs, one-time member of the Firebird Band and Edward Burch &amp; the Staunch Characters, and currently of the Geese and DMS). Lamos left the band in 2021 but rejoined in 2023.\nDespite the group's short initial lifespan, their self-titled debut album became one of the most acclaimed emo and math rock records of its era. After reuniting in 2014, with Kinsella's cousin Nate Kinsella joining the band, American Football has released two more albums, both bearing the same name as their debut: \"American Football\" (2016) and \"American Football\" (2019).\nHistory.\nMike Kinsella and Steve Holmes knew one another at an early age. Both were students at Wheeling High School in Wheeling, Illinois, where Kinsella played drums for Cap'n Jazz; Holmes played guitar in a variety of bands. Kinsella and Lamos began playing together with David Johnson and Allen Johnson in 1997 under the name \"The One Up Downstairs\", in which Kinsella was exclusively a vocalist. Three songs were recorded under this name, with the intention of releasing them as a 7\" record on Polyvinyl Records. However, the band splintered before the record could be pressed, and the songs were shelved. The three tracks recorded by The One Up Downstairs would finally be released in 2006 as a digital download EP and in 2009 as a 7\" record through Polyvinyl.\nDavid Johnson and Allen Johnson went on to form the band Very Secretary (and later Favorite Saints), while Kinsella and Lamos began working with Steve Holmes. American Football completed a total of two releases—a titular EP in 1998 and its debut album in 1999, both through Polyvinyl Records. Though the band did not record bass on the EP, Kinsella played bass guitar on some songs for the LP.\nWithin a year of the release of its full-length, American Football became a studio project. Shortly thereafter, the band mutually decided to stop recording together. Still, American Football gained critical acclaim for that album, which merged the plain-spoken, confessional lyrics and the varying time signatures of math rock with a softer musical sensibility. These characteristics carried on in Mike Kinsella's solo project Owen, and Kinsella would later re-record \"Never Meant\" as Owen in 2004.\nReformation.\nIn March 2014, Polyvinyl Records announced a deluxe reissue of the band's eponymous debut album, including 10 additional unheard demos and live recordings. Live dates, in Champaign and New York, were announced the following month, all of which sold out. For these dates, Mike's cousin Nate Kinsella joined the band on bass – becoming a permanent fixture of the band thereafter. Further tour dates followed in the US, Canada, Spain, UK, Japan, and Australia.\nTwo years after reforming, the band released their second album. Again eponymous, and again on Polyvinyl, the album was released in October 2016, preceded by the single \"I've Been So Lost for So Long\", which was made available for streaming through SoundCloud. The album's cover featured the same house photographed on the band's first full-length album. The American Football House had become a landmark for emo music fans around the world since the first album's release, who would travel to Urbana, Illinois, to take photos outside of the home.\nAmerican Football's third album, once again eponymous, was released in March 2019, with the single \"Silhouettes\" made available upon announcement the preceding December. A second single, \"Uncomfortably Numb\", followed in January 2019. It featured vocals from Paramore's Hayley Williams, marking the first time the band had implemented a featured artist on a song.\nSteve Lamos announced his departure from the band in July 2021, citing a change of situation in his life. A single with the tracks \"Rare Symmetry\" and \"Fade Into You\", a Mazzy Star cover, was released in December the same year.\nOn February 13, 2023, the band were announced as the opener for The 1975's outdoor show at Finsbury Park in London on July 2. Later that day, Lamos confirmed his return to the band via Instagram. In May 2023, the band announced that they had purchased the American Football House pictured on the cover of their debut album, in order to save it from being turned into a condominium. The following month, the band played their first public show since December 2019 at Beat Kitchen in Chicago.\nMusical style.\nAmerican Football is usually described as an emo band and is considered one of the most important bands of the late 1990s Midwestern emo scene and subgenre. The band's musical style has been also described as math rock and post-rock due to the band using uncommon time signatures in their songs, which is a staple in both genres. The band has also been variously described as indie rock, dream pop, and slowcore.\nTalking about the group's sound, Tim Sendra of AllMusic stated, \"The trio spent almost a year coming up with a clean, melodic approach that blended the intimacy of emo with the empty space of jazz, while adding pop hooks and jangling guitar interplay to the mix.\"\nIn their article about the history of math rock, specialized online magazine Fecking Bahamas described American Football as \"a second-wave emo band rooted in unconventional melodic song structures as well as containing elements of math rock and slowcore\".\nSteve Holmes has commented on the band's sound, their influences, and relationship with emo, saying:\"With this band, we really did make a conscious shift away from the post-hardcore, emo, whatever sound and scene that we had come out of. Freshman year, I was turned on to a lot of the bands that would influence our sound: Nick Drake, Red House Painters, Elliott Smith, Codeine, the Sea and Cake, The Smiths/Morrissey, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Can, Steve Reich, etc. Mike always liked the slow, sad, dreamy, pretty stuff and I picked that up from him. Tortoise and post-rock bands like Slint were an influence. Lamos brought in his love of 70s jazz fusion via Weather Report and Miles Davis. I was also big into The Beatles and The Beach Boys and lesser known 60s bands and 90s bands that aped that sound.\"\nMembers.\nCurrent members\nCurrent touring musicians\nFormer touring musicians"

        "title": "Gerald Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Gerald Floyd Williams (August 10, 1966 – February 8, 2022) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and New York Mets from 1992 to 2005.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe New York Yankees selected Williams in the 14th round, with the 366th overall selection, of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft out of Grambling State University. In 1988, in the New York–Penn League for Oneonta, he batted .365/.447/.504 with two home runs in 115 at bats. He was then promoted to High-A ball where he hit .210 in the next two seasons. Playing in a league that is notoriously tough for hitters (Florida State League) he hit .289/.344/.461. Mid-season, he was sent up to AA and the Eastern League. There, he batted .250/.328/.435. Combined, he hit .265 with 140 hits, 20 home runs, 101 runs batted in (RBIs), and 37 stolen bases. For 1992, he hit .285/.334/.452 with 16 home runs, 86 RBIs, and 36 stolen bases.\nNew York Yankees (1992–1996).\nWilliams, at the age of 25 years, made his MLB debut September 15, 1992. After a brief stint in the minor leagues in 1993, Williams returned to the big leagues in 1994, but he was injured and played infrequently. He batted only .239. He had more opportunity to play off the bench in 1995 and batted .247 with six home runs in 182 at bats.\nWilliams saw more action in 1996, hitting .270 with five home runs in 233 at bats. He started in seventy games for the Yankees in left field that season, more than any other player. On May 1, he set a Yankees team record with six hits against the Baltimore Orioles in a 15-inning game. On May 14, in the top of the sixth inning against the Seattle Mariners, Williams made a running, back-handed catch in deep center field to rob Alex Rodriguez of an RBI double and preserve Dwight Gooden's no-hitter.\nMilwaukee Brewers (1996–1997).\nOn August 23, 1996, the Yankees traded Williams and Bob Wickman to the Milwaukee Brewers for Graeme Lloyd, Pat Listach, and Ricky Bones. After the trade in 1996, Williams batted .207. For the season, Williams had 325 at bats, and batted .252 with 28 extra-base hits. Despite the trade, Williams received his first World Series Championship ring when the New York Yankees later won the series that year.\nWilliams was the regular center fielder for the Brewers in 1997 which was Williams' first season as a regular. With the Milwaukee Brewers that season, he batted .253 with 10 home runs, 41 RBI, 23 stolen bases, and 44 extra-base hits.\nAtlanta Braves (1998–1999).\nAfter the 1997 season, the Brewers acquired Marquis Grissom to be their new starting center fielder. They traded Williams to the Atlanta Braves for reliever Chad Fox. Williams then spent the 1998 and 1999 seasons as a semi-regular player for the Atlanta Braves, batting .286 with 27 home runs. In 1999, he played against his old team, the Yankees during the 1999 World Series, but the Braves lost the series in a four-game sweep.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2001).\nAfter the 1999 season, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays signed Williams to a two-year contract worth $5.75 million. In 2000, Williams set career highs with 21 home runs, 34 walks, 89 RBIs, 173 hits, 87 runs, and 30 doubles. Tampa Bay writers named Williams the team's most valuable player. On August 29, 2000, Williams was hit by a pitch thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez. Williams charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. During the brawl, he was one of eight members of the Rays ejected.\nWilliams began the 2001 season batting .207, and the Devil Rays released him on June 25.\nNew York Yankees (2001–2003).\nWilliams went back to the Yankees to finish the 2001 season and served as a backup outfielder. He remained on the postseason roster until the team lost the 2001 World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2002, he spent most of the season in the minors, but played 33 games in the majors.\nFlorida Marlins (2003).\nWilliams signed a one-year contract for the Florida Marlins in 2003. He played 27 games and batted .129 overall. Williams got his second career World Series ring after the Marlins won the 2003 World Series over his former team, the New York Yankees. The Marlins signed Williams to a minor league contract for the 2004 season, but released him in April.\nNew York Mets (2004–2005).\nIn April 2004, Williams signed a minor league contract with the Mets. During his two years with the Mets, he batted .233 in 57 games in 2004 and batted .233 in 39 games in 2005.\nPersonal life and death.\nWilliams had 12 brothers and sisters. He resided in Tampa, Florida, and was one of the best friends of Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter. Jeter said of Williams that he \"always looked out for me\". During his playing career, \"The New York Times\" described him as Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams' best friend.\nWilliams was one of three Atlanta Braves to appear on \"Saturday Night Live\" when he made a cameo appearance alongside teammates Mark Wohlers and Pedro Borbón Jr. on the December 20, 1997 episode hosted by Helen Hunt.\nWilliams died of cancer on February 8, 2022, at the age of 55."

        "title": "Neil Smith (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Neil Smith (born January 9, 1954) is a Canadian ice hockey broadcaster, and previously the general manager of both the New York Rangers from 1989–2000 and (briefly) the New York Islanders in 2006. He was also the owner and head coach of the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL. He last was the president, general manager, and governor of the Greenville Road Warriors of the ECHL. He now is an on-air analyst for the NHL Network.\nBiography.\nEarly career.\nSmith played junior hockey before attending Western Michigan University. As a freshman, he was selected to the All-American team as a defenceman, and was named team captain his sophomore season. He was drafted in 1974 by the New York Islanders as the first ever draft pick from WMU. He spent several seasons in the minor leagues before working for the organization as a talent scout. With Smith working in an important capacity for the Islanders minor league system, the Islanders' Central Hockey League affiliate, the Indianapolis Checkers (which at the time was the Islanders most prominent minor league team) won the Adams Cup in 1981–82. While on the Island, he worked closely with the Islanders chief scout and assistant GM, Jim Devellano, and when Devellano was contacted by the new Detroit Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch to become GM in the summer of 1982, Smith moved with him to the Red Wings, where he won two Calder Cup championships as the general manager of the team's minor league affiliate, the Adirondack Red Wings in 1985–86 and 1988–89.\nDuring the 1988 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Smith and assistant coach Colin Campbell discovered several Red Wings players, including Bob Probert and Petr Klima, out past curfew. The incident occurred at a suburban Edmonton bar called \"Goose Loonies\", and led to an apology being issued by Red Wings head coach Jacques Demers. Smith would later hire Campbell as head coach of the New York Rangers in 1994.\nSuccess with the New York Rangers.\nSmith was hired by the Rangers in 1989 to be their general manager, inheriting a team that included future stars Brian Leetch and Mike Richter. Under Smith's watch, the Rangers groomed Tony Amonte. Smith was also responsible for drafting star players such as Sergei Nemchinov, Alexei Kovalev, Doug Weight, and Sergei Zubov before he made his mark in 1991 with a blockbuster trade for superstar Mark Messier, who was immediately given the captaincy by the Rangers organization. Over the next three seasons, Smith continued to shape the team through trades and free-agent signings, acquiring several players from the Edmonton Oilers dynasty of the 1980s, including Kevin Lowe, Adam Graves, Esa Tikkanen, Jeff Beukeboom, Craig MacTavish and Glenn Anderson.\nMessier became one of the most popular athletes in New York, winning the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1992, and the Rangers grew into an elite team. The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy as the team with the NHL's best regular season record twice, and in 1994 won their long-awaited fourth Stanley Cup championship. Neil Smith remains the only GM in the modern era to win a Stanley Cup with the Rangers.\nFall of the Rangers.\nThe next few years saw the team struggle to stay in contention, but having traded away many of its prospects for the Stanley Cup run, the team had to increasingly rely on aging veterans acquired through expensive free agency. A major dispute between Smith and hard-driving coach Mike Keenan ended when Keenan left for the St. Louis Blues after the championship season. Unfortunately, none of the coaches that succeeded Keenan could motivate the highly-paid stars that played for the Rangers in the mid to late 1990s.\nAttempting to once more bring in an older superstar to re-ignite the magic of 1994, Neil Smith signed Wayne Gretzky in 1996, reuniting him with his old teammate Messier. During the 1996–97 playoffs the Rangers earned their way into the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were beaten by a bigger and younger Philadelphia Flyers squad. The reunion would last only a year, however, as Messier left amid an acrimonious dispute with the organization. With his departure the Rangers sank into mediocrity; though Smith acquired a succession of veteran players with expensive contracts and drafted a host of promising young players, the team continued to underperform and miss the playoffs until Smith's departure from the organization following the 1999–2000 NHL season. The Rangers did not again reach the playoffs again until 2006, nor did they win another playoff series, nor mere postseason game until a decade later when they swept the Atlanta Thrashers during the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals in 2007.\nShort tenure with the New York Islanders.\nOn June 8, 2006, Smith was introduced as the New York Islanders' general manager, making him the only person in NHL history to serve as general manager with both New York teams. Smith stated, \"Knowing that I'll be working in the same office where one of my mentors, Bill Torrey, created a dynasty is an unbelievable feeling. Al Arbour, whom I owe everything to, gave me my first hockey job as an advance scout. I wear my Islanders Stanley Cup ring with immense pride. To be able to come full circle and return home to the Islanders is a dream.\" On July 18, 2006, before the season began, Smith was fired and replaced by Islanders goaltender Garth Snow, who retired from his playing position on the team upon being hired.\nSmith reportedly had grown frustrated with his lack of authority on personnel and staffing decisions, as owner Charles Wang had at that time instituted a setup where decisions were made collectively by a group of advisors rather than by the general manager alone. Wang believed that Smith was incapable of fitting within this model and subsequently fired him. Pat LaFontaine, who had recently been hired by the team as a senior adviser, quit his post the same day in reaction to the firing of Smith. Smith was named as an assistant to Dallas Stars general manager Doug Armstrong shortly after being let go by the Islanders, October 27, 2006.\nBroadcasting.\nSmith has spent time broadcasting NHL games for various networks, and has also done some studio work. Smith has worked for ESPN, TSN, Versus and NHL Network.\nNeil Smith has also served as a guest host on \"Hockey Night in Canada Radio\" on Sirius offering his insight alongside host Jeff Marek.\nPresent.\nSmith was also the owner and governor of the Johnstown Chiefs hockey team. He also served as the team's head coach.\nIn 2010, Johnstown relocated their franchise to Greenville, SC. The franchise now serves as a Carolina Hurricanes affiliate, the Greenville Swamp Rabbits."

        "title": "Afghanistan national cricket team",
        "text": "The Afghanistan men's national cricket team (, ) represents Afghanistan in international cricket. Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the mid-19th century, but it was only in the early 21st century that the national team began to enjoy success. The Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed in 1995, becoming an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 and a member of the cricket confederation, Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in 2003. After nearly a decade of playing international cricket, on 22 June 2017 full ICC membership (and therefore Test status) was granted to Afghanistan. Alongside Ireland, this took the number of Test cricket playing nations to twelve. Afghanistan is the first country to achieve Full Member status after holding Affiliate Membership of the ICC. In view of the persistent conflict and insecurity in Afghanistan, following this status, the team moved to a new home ground in Dehradun, in India. The current home ground of the Afghanistan Men's Cricket team is the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the UAE.\nThe team is ranked 10th in Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket as of February 2023, and holds the world record for the 2nd highest ever T20I score, with their score of 278/3 against Ireland at Dehradun on 23 February 2019.\nIn August 2021, concerns and doubts were raised over the participation of the Afghanistan national cricket team in the future international matches after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan . Concerns were raised over the safety of Afghan national cricketers and their families who were still in Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021. , three of the Afghanistan women's national cricket team had evacuated to Canada, while the others were afraid of how they, as women, would be treated by the Taliban.\nTaliban spokesmen stated that the Taliban would not disrupt the men's cricket team's participation in international matches and that they would allow Afghanistan to play its first ever bilateral series against Pakistan in Sri Lanka which was scheduled to start in September 2021. The Pakistan Cricket Board announced in August 2021 that the tour would be rescheduled to 2022. This was later moved to 2023 and the tour took place between 24 – 27 March 2023.\nHistory.\nPre-ODI history.\nCricket in Afghanistan was popularised by Afghan expatriates who learnt the sport while living in Pakistan in the 1980s and 1990s, during the post-Soviet invasion era. Most members of the early Afghanistan national cricket team grew up in Pakistan and participated in the country's domestic cricket structure, making use of cricket facilities in Peshawar with the support of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). It was during this time that the Afghanistan Cricket Federation (now ACB) was also founded, in 1995. Like all sports, cricket was initially banned by the Taliban, but cricket became an exception in 2000 (being the only sport in Afghanistan to be approved by the Taliban). The ACF received recognition from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001.\nAfghanistan fielded their cricket team in Pakistan's domestic setup for the first time in the 2001–02 season, participating in the second division of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy where they drew two and lost three of their five games. They returned for the Cornelius Trophy in the 2002–03 season, drawing one and losing three matches. In the 2003–04 season, they made an appearance in the PCB's inter-district tournament in Peshawar, where they registered their lone victory against Swabi, drew twice and lost two matches.\nThey began playing in Asian regional tournaments in 2004, finishing sixth in their first ACC Trophy. More success began in 2006 when they were runners-up to Bahrain in the Middle East Cup and beat an MCC side featuring former England captain Mike Gatting by 171 runs in Mumbai. Gatting was dismissed for a duck.\nThey toured England in the summer of 2006, winning six out of seven matches. Three of their wins came against the second XIs of Essex, Glamorgan and Leicestershire. They finished third in the ACC Trophy that year, beating Nepal in a play-off match.\nThey won their first tournament in 2007, sharing the ACC Twenty20 Cup with Oman after the two tied in the final. They began their qualifying campaign for the 2011 World Cup in Jersey in 2008, winning Division Five of the World Cricket League. They finished third in the ACC Trophy Elite tournament the same year, and won a second consecutive WCL tournament, Division Four in Tanzania later in the year.\nThe Afghanistan national team was coached by former Pakistani cricketers Kabir Khan and Rashid Latif in its initial years. During this period, a number of Afghan international cricketers made appearances for Pakistani domestic outfits in the first-class circuit.\nIn January 2009, Afghanistan progressed to the 2009 World Cup Qualifier by winning Division Three of the World Cricket League in Buenos Aires, topping the table on net run rate ahead of Uganda and Papua New Guinea.\nIn 2010, Afghanistan competed at the Asian Games, a non-ICC T20 event hosted by China, where they defeated a second-string Pakistan side by 22 runs in the semi-finals in what was considered an upset. In May 2011, the Afghan side embarked on a tour of Pakistan to partake in a three-match limited overs series against Pakistan A, where they were whitewashed by the home side 3–0. They followed this up with another tour in September to participate in Pakistan's domestic National T20 Cup in Karachi as the Afghan Cheetahs, but had another poor outing, losing all three of their matches.\nODI status.\nIn the 2011 Cricket World Cup qualifying tournament, Afghanistan failed to progress to the World Cup, but earned ODI status for four years. Their first ODI was against Scotland in the 5th place playoff, having previously beaten the Scots earlier in the tournament; Afghanistan won by 89 runs. Afghanistan became the only affiliate member to have ODI status.\nIn the Intercontinental Cup Afghanistan played its first first-class match against a Zimbabwe XI in a four-day match in Mutare. During the match, which was drawn, Afghan batsman Noor Ali scored centuries in both his innings, making him only the fourth player to do so on their first-class debut. Later, in August 2009, they played the Netherlands in the same competition at the VRA Cricket Ground, winning a low-scoring match by one wicket.\nAfghanistan then took part in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup in the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan were drawn in Group A, a group which Afghanistan topped at the end of the group stages by winning all five of their matches. In the semi-finals the Afghans defeated Kuwait by 8 wickets. In the final they met the hosts, the United Arab Emirates, whom they defeated by 84 runs.\nOn 1 February 2010, Afghanistan played their first Twenty20 International against Ireland, which they lost by 5 wickets. On 13 February 2010, Afghanistan defeated the United Arab Emirates by 4 wickets to make their way to the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 to be in the West Indies in April 2010. Later the same day they defeated Ireland by 8 wickets in the Final of 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier to win the qualifier. Afghanistan were in Group C of the main tournament, with India and South Africa. During their first match against India, opening batsman Noor Ali hit 50 runs, helping Afghanistan to a score of 115 in their 20 overs. Despite this they lost the match by 8 wickets. In their second match, the team were reduced to 14/6 at one stage, before a late rally from Mirwais Ashraf and Hamid Hassan helped Afghanistan post 88 all out, resulting in a loss by 59 runs.\nThe team's Intercontinental Cup campaign continued in 2010, with wins over Ireland, Canada, Scotland and Kenya before they beat Scotland by 7 wickets in the final in Dubai. Also in 2010, they won the ACC Trophy Elite tournament in Kuwait, beating Nepal in the final and finished third in Division One of the World Cricket League in the Netherlands. They took part in the cricket tournament at the 2010 Asian Games in China and won the silver medal, losing to Bangladesh in the final.\nIn 2011, Afghanistan begun the 2011-13 ICC World Cricket League Championship. They beat Canada and drew with the UAE. In the parallel one-day league, they won two matches against Canada and lost twice to the UAE. In December once again took part in the ACC Twenty20 Cup, this time in Nepal. They went on to win all of their matches to once again take the Cup.\nOn 10 February 2012, Afghanistan played a one-off One Day International (ODI) match against Pakistan at Sharjah, the first ever official game between the two sides and also the first ever ODI between an Affiliate and a Test-playing nation. Billed as a historic occasion for Afghan cricket, the game was won comfortably by Pakistan by seven wickets with 13 overs to spare. They also took on the Australia Cricket Team in an Only ODI at Sharjah in August 2012. They fell short in both matches, but their performance showed they were continuing to make progress. Their 2012 ICC International Cup games were also challenging, resulting in a split with the Netherlands and a loss to Ireland.\n2013 brought greater success for Afghanistan. In March, they played two T20 Internationals against Scotland in UAE and prevailed in both matches. They also won two ODIs in the World Cricket League Championship against the same opponents.\nIn the WCL Championship table, as 2013 dawned Afghanistan was level with Scotland in third, trailing Ireland and the Netherlands for the two automatic qualification spots for the 2015 World Cup. However, two convincing wins in spring over Scotland boosted hopes some. Then in July the Netherlands failed to take any points against Ireland, leaving Afghanistan in position to qualify if they could win their final four matches, against poorer performing Namibia and Kenya. Despite the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands both being able to win their remaining games, keeping the pressure on Afghanistan, Afghanistan handled Namibia, then defeated Kenya by 8 wickets on 2 October. With one final win over Kenya on 4 October by 7 wickets, Afghanistan secured second in the Championship with 19 points, and qualified for World Cup.\nAfghanistan also crushed Scotland in their one-day ICC Intercontinental Cup league in March in Abu Dhabi: Afghanistan (275: Shah 67*, Davey 4–53) beat Scotland (125: Taylor 48*, Dawlatzai 6–57 and 145: Coetzer 57, Dawlatzai 5–37) by an innings and 5 runs. Izatullah Dawlatzai took eleven wickets.\nIn July 2014 Afghanistan toured Zimbabwe to play its 1st full series against a full member. The 4 match ODI series finished 2–2 and the 2 match first class series finished 1–1.\nWith their victory over Zimbabwe on 25 December 2015, Afghanistan entered the top 10 of the ICC's ODI rankings for the first time.\nAssociate Membership.\nAfghanistan had become an Affiliate member of the ICC in 2001. Then in 2009 it had attained one-day status until 2015.\nIn 2012, the Asian Cricket Council decided to nominate Afghanistan for Associate membership with the ICC, with the request being looked into at the ICC's annual conference in June. Becoming an Associate would mean higher funding (the ICC had been paying $700,000 in annual funding to Afghanistan's organization, suggested to rise to $850,000 for Associate status), and also importantly would mean more exposure for the passionate and cricket-starved players from war-torn Afghanistan.\nIn March 2013, Afghanistan received a further support boost when a two-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the development of Afghanistan cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\nThe PCB provided technical and professional support, including game-education programmes, coaching courses, skill and performance analysis, and basic umpiring and curator courses. High performance camps for emerging players were also organised. The PCB-regulated National Cricket Academy (NCA) helped in improving technical, tactical, mental and physical skills, and hosted lectures on doping, anti-corruption and various codes of conduct.\nIn April 2013, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) was also allocated US$422,000 (22,400,000 AFN approx.) from the ICC's targeted assistance and performance programme. The world governing body of cricket approved the grant at its IDI (ICC Development International) board meeting, which concluded in Dubai. The money, to be given over three years, was aimed at developing more competitive teams among ICC Full, Associate and Affiliate members. Previous countries to receive similar funding programmes included the Netherlands, Scotland, the West Indies, Zimbabwe and Ireland. An ICC statement suggested the funding was targeted towards the development of the National Cricket Academy in Kabul.\nOn 26 June 2013 at the ICC's annual meeting in London, England, Afghanistan received its Associate Membership with the statement:\n2015 Cricket World Cup.\nQualification for the tournament was a historic feat for cricket in Afghanistan, one amplified by the fact that the team included many players who picked up the game in refugee camps outside their war-torn country.\nAfghanistan made their World Cup debut in the 2015 Cricket World Cup which their first game was against Bangladesh at the Manuka Oval in Canberra, Australia. The match resulted in a 105 run defeat. On 26 February 2015, Afghanistan won their first World Cup match against Scotland, winning by one wicket. The team however, lost all its remaining games and were knocked out of the tournament in the opening round.\n2019 Cricket World Cup.\nThe 2019 Cricket World Cup was the second Cricket World Cup in which Afghanistan participated in. Thus, it was Afghanistan's first consecutive World Cup appearance (2015-2019). This World Cup was in a \"round robin\" format where Afghanistan faced all the other teams but did not manage to claim victory against any national team in the tournament for the first time in their short history in the World Cup tournament.\n2023 Cricket World Cup.\nIn the 2023 Cricket World Cup, Afghanistan secured a victory by 69 runs against the defending champions, England, in their third match of the World Cup on 15 October 2023. This was the first time Afghanistan defeated England and the first time Afghanistan defeated the defending Cricket World Cup champions. This was backed up by a first ever victory over Pakistan by 8 wickets in ODI in their 5th match. They also defeated Sri Lanka for the first time in the Cricket World Cup by 7 wickets on 30 October 2023. This was also the first time in a Cricket World Cup that Afghanistan had won two matches consecutively. In the following match, they defeated Netherlands for the first time in the Cricket World Cup. This was the first time Afghanistan achieved three consecutive victories in the Cricket World Cup.\nPost-World Cup tours.\nThe team visited Zimbabwe for the second time in October where Afghanistan clinched a historic one-day international series over Zimbabwe after a 73-run victory in Bulawayo saw them win 3–2.\nDoing so, they became the first non-Test-playing country to win a multi-game bilateral ODI series against a Test side. The Afghanistan cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates to play the United Arab Emirates cricket team in December 2016. The tour consisted of three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Afghanistan won the series 3–0. The Afghanistan cricket team toured Bangladesh in September and October 2016 to play three One Day Internationals (ODIs) matches. This was Afghanistan's first full series against a Test-playing side other than Zimbabwe and was the first bilateral series between the two sides.\nAhead of the ODI series there was a fifty-over warm-up game between the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI and Afghanistan in Fatullah. Afghanistan won the warm-up match by 66 runs and Bangladesh won the ODI series 2–1.\nIn February 2017 the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded first-class status to Afghanistan's four-day domestic competition.\nThe Afghan cricket team toured Zimbabwe between January and February 2017. The tour consisted of five One Day International (ODI) matches. Prior to the ODI series, the Afghanistan A cricket team played five \"unofficial\" ODI matches against the Zimbabwe A cricket team. All of those matches had been designated List A status. Afghanistan won the initial List A series 4–1 and the ODI series 3–2.\n2017\nThe Ireland cricket team toured India during March 2017 to participate in a series of matches against Afghanistan, consisting of three T20 matches, five ODI contests and an ICC Intercontinental Cup match. All the matches took place in Greater Noida. The Afghan team were highly successful, emerging victorious in both the T20I series 3–0 and the ODI series 3–2. Afghanistan also won the ICC Intercontinental Cup match, by the margin of an innings and 172 runs.\nThe Afghanistan cricket team completed another tour in June 2017, this time facing the West Indies. The tour marked Afghanistan's first bilateral tour against a full member nation other than Zimbabwe. (Later that month, Afghanistan itself was awarded that status.) The tour was less successful for the Afghans, who were convincingly defeated 3–0 in the T20 series. They performed better in the ODI series, seizing a 1–1 draw after the final match was washed out with no result. Afghanistan registered their first win against Sri Lanka in Asia Cup.\nTowards Test status.\nAfghanistan qualified for 2012 ICC World Twenty20 held in Sri Lanka as the runner up of the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier and joined India and England in the group stage. In the first match against India on 19 September, Afghanistan won the toss and elected to field. India posted 159/5 in 20 overs but Afghanistan fell short of that target by scoring 136 in 19.3 overs. In the second match against England on 21 September, Afghanistan won the toss and again elected to field. England set a target of 196/5 (20 overs) but Afghanistan were all out for 80 in 17.2 overs. England and India qualified for the Super Eights and Afghanistan were eliminated as a result of this match.\nOn 3 October 2013, Afghanistan beat Kenya to finish second in the WCL Championship and qualify for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, becoming the 20th team to gain entry into the tournament overall. Afghanistan secured their passage to Australia and New Zealand in 2015 by beating Kenya comprehensively for the second time in succession in Sharjah, sealing their maiden World Cup qualification. They finished second in the World Cricket League Championship — nine wins in 14 matches — and joined Ireland as the second Associate team in the 2015 World Cup, while the remaining two spots for Associates will be decided by a qualifying tournament in New Zealand in 2014. Afghanistan will join Pool A at the World Cup along with Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and another qualifier. On 24 November 2013, Afghanistan beat Kenya to qualify for the 2014 T20 world cup.\nIn March 2014, Afghanistan beat Hong Kong in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 but could not make it to the next stage of super 10 having lost the two matches to Bangladesh and Nepal.\nOn 25 February 2015, Afghanistan won their first Cricket World Cup match beating Scotland by one wicket. Afghanistan participated in the World Twenty20 2016 in India. They were unable to qualify for the Semi-Finals of the International Tournament. They defeated the eventual champions, West Indies, during their final group match of the tournament.\nTheir third match was against the full member test team Zimbabwe. They played exceptionally well beating Zimbabwe by 59 runs. Afghanistan qualified for the Super 10 stage of the tournament as a result of this match, while Zimbabwe were eliminated. Afghanistan progressed to the second phase of a World Twenty20 tournament for the first time. On 25 June 2016, Lalchand Rajput was named as head coach of Afghanistan Cricket Team replacing Pakistan's Inzamam ul Haq with his first outings with the team being a tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands in July and August of that year. He was chosen ahead of Mohammad Yousuf, Herschelle Gibbs and Corey Collymore Rajput is in line for a two-year contract, but that decision would be finalised after the upcoming tour of Europe.\nIn July 2016, ACB unveiled a strategic plan and set targets for Afghanistan cricket team to be a top-six ODI team by 2019 and a top-three team in both T20Is and ODIs by 2025. In order to achieve this, ACB created a proposal to be presented to BCCI, to secure annual bilateral matches against India and teams touring India beginning the following year. Shafiq Stanikzai, Chief Executive of ACB, said the draft had been presented to BCCI president Anurag Thakur in May and further discussions occurred during the ICC Annual Conference in Edinburgh in June 2016.\nOn 25 July 2016, Afghanistan confirmed its first full series against West Indies a top-8 ranked Full member. Its earlier full series came against a permanent member of ICC was against Zimbabwe. Afghanistan toured the Caribbean islands in mid-June 2017 and played 5 ODIs and 3 T20Is.\nOn the same day, it was announced that Afghanistan would host a full series against Ireland at Greater Noida. Besides a 4-day intercontinental cup match, Ireland and Afghanistan would play five ODIs and three T20Is in March 2017. Afghanistan won the T20I series 3-0 and in the process set a new T20I record of 11 consecutive victories.\nOn 22 June 2017, the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded Afghanistan full Test status, along with Ireland. In December 2017, the ICC confirmed that Afghanistan were scheduled to play their first Test against India, in late 2018. According to the ICC Future Tours Programme for 2019–23, Afghanistan are scheduled to play thirteen Tests. In January 2018, both the ACB and the BCCI confirmed the Test would be played in June in Bengaluru.\nIn June 2018, Afghanistan lost their maiden Test match to hosts India by an innings and 262 runs, despite being able to bowl out a strong Indian team in the first innings.\nRise as a Test team.\nIn March 2019 against Ireland, Afghanistan achieved their first Test match victory in their only second Test match, becoming the fourth team after Australia, England and Pakistan to win one of their first two Tests.\nIn September 2019, Afghanistan beat hosts Bangladesh by 224 runs in a one-off Test tour. Rain almost resulted in the match being drawn, but finally the weather cleared, allowing the spin-unit of Afghanistan to take the final four wickets.\nGrounds.\nAfghanistan typically do not play their home matches in Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and the lack of international standard facilities. Afghanistan played their 'home' Intercontinental Cup fixture against Ireland at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Following Afghanistan's World Twenty20 qualifying campaign they played two One Day Internationals against Canada at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the UAE.\nAs plans to resurrect Afghan cricket developed, at least three international standard cricket stadiums have been built in Afghanistan. In 2016, Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex in Greater Noida became the home ground for the Afghanistan national cricket team after they decided to shift their home ground from Sharjah. In June 2018, after acquiring test status, Afghanistan changed their home base to Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Dehradun, India. In May 2019, Afghanistan Cricket Board requested BCCI for a new home stadium. In August 2019, BCCI approved Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow, India as the new home stadium for the team.\nThe following are the main cricket stadiums in Afghanistan:\nTeam colours.\nIn Test matches, Afghanistan wears cricket whites. Fielders wear a baggy red cap or red sun hat displaying the ACB logo.\nIn limited-overs cricket, Afghanistan wears a predominantly blue kit with splashes of green, red, black, and, occasionally, yellow. Grey was previously used as the main color between 2012-2013. Fielders wear a blue baseball-style cap or red sun hat.\nFor both Test and limited-overs kits, the ACB logo is featured on the left breast, with the main sponsor logo in the center of the shirt. The secondary sponsor is displayed on the leading sleeve and back of the shirt, with the manufacturer's logo on the non-leading sleeve. For ICC tournaments, the main sponsor logo moves to the leading sleeve.\nPreviously also red, batters' helmets are blue as of late February 2024, with the Afghanistan tricolor flag displayed above the ACB logo.\nThe current sponsors are Etisalat and Super Cola (previously Monarch Mart and Alokozay Group); the kit manufacturer is TYKA Sports.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Afghanistan in the past 12 months or was named in the most recent Test, ODI or T20I squad.

        "text": "The 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup was the sixth FIFA Women's World Cup competition, the world championship for women's national football teams. It was held from 26 June to 17 July 2011 in Germany, which won the right to host the event in October 2007. Japan won the final against the United States on a penalty shoot-out following a 2–2 draw after extra time and became the first Asian team to win a senior FIFA World Cup.\nThe matches were played in nine stadiums in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt. Sixteen teams were selected for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in 2009. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These eight teams advanced to the knockout stage, where two rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.\nHost selection.\nSix nations, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Peru and Switzerland, initially declared their interest in hosting the 2011 Women's World Cup. The German Football Association announced its hopes to host the tournament on 26 January 2006, following a pledge from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to fully support a potential bid. All six nations officially announced their interest by a 1 March 2007 deadline and acknowledged their intention of bidding by 3 May 2007 to FIFA.\nThe final bidding dossiers had to be handed over before 1 August 2007. Switzerland withdrew on 29 May 2007, stating that Europe is heavily focused on France and Germany, and a third European bid appeared futile. On 27 August 2007, France also withdrew, reportedly in exchange for Germany's support for their bid to host the men's UEFA Euro 2016. Later Australia (12 October 2007) and Peru (17 October 2007) voluntarily dropped out of the race as well, leaving only Canada and Germany as the remaining candidates. On 30 October 2007, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to assign the tournament to Germany. Canada was eventually awarded the 2015 Women's World Cup four years later.\nUpon the selection, Germany became the third country to host both men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's twice in 1974 and 2006.\nVenues.\nAfter the German Football Association (DFB) expressed its intention to bid for the Women's World Cup, 23 German cities applied to host World Cup games. Twelve cities were chosen for the official bidding dossier handed over to FIFA in August 2007. On 30 September 2008, the DFB executive committee decided to use nine stadiums for the tournament; the original candidates Essen, Magdeburg and Bielefeld were not chosen as World Cup venues.\nThe official opening game was held between Germany and Canada at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, the venue of the 2006 men's World Cup Final; it was the only match played in Berlin. However, it was not the first match of the tournament—it was preceded by a match at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim pitting France and Nigeria. The final of the tournament took place at the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, the venue of the 2005 men's Confederations Cup final. Borussia-Park in Mönchengladbach and Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena hosted the semi-finals. The third place play-off was held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena.\nSince 2007, five of the stadiums were either newly built (Augsburg, Dresden and Sinsheim) or remodelled (Bochum and Leverkusen). Six stadiums would be home grounds for German First Bundesliga clubs in the upcoming 2011–12 season, while the other three would be home to Second Bundesliga clubs in the same season. Compared to the 2006 men's World Cup, several smaller venues were chosen; six stadiums have a capacity of 20,000 to 30,000 seats. All cities would stage a total of four matches, with the exceptions of Berlin and Mönchengladbach; the latter would host three games. The total capacity of the nine venues is roughly 330,000. Overall, approximately one million tickets would be available.\nSeveral of the stadiums were officially referred to simply as \"FIFA Women's World Cup Stadium\" because FIFA prohibited sponsorship of stadiums unless the stadium sponsors were also official tournament sponsors. With no standing-room terraces allowed, all stadiums had a lower total capacity compared to German Bundesliga games. Capacity data is given according to FIFA:\nTeams and qualification.\nNumber of participating teams.\nFIFA had considered the prospect of increasing the number of teams from 16 to 24, to reflect the growing global popularity of women's football and the Women's World Cup. However, on 14 March 2008, the FIFA Executive Committee decided to keep the number of participants at 16, concerned that more teams would dilute the quality of play. The idea of having 20 teams taking part, which had been discussed briefly, was ruled impossible to implement in terms of fixture planning and logistics. During the 2007 Women's World Cup, FIFA president Sepp Blatter had campaigned for the idea to increase the number of teams, although this proposal was not unquestioned. In particular the 11–0 victory of Germany over Argentina in the opening game of the 2007 tournament had caused a debate over whether there were 24 national teams on a comparable level.\nConfederation allocation.\nIn October 2008, the FIFA Executive Committee announced a change to the allocation of the qualifying berths for its continental confederations. Asia was granted 3 automatic berths instead of 2.5 for the finals (although in 2007 the host nation was an additional qualifier from Asia). Europe's allocation was reduced from 5 to 4.5 (although it effectively increased to 5.5 because of the automatic qualification of the host nation). The North/Central American and Caribbean confederation (CONCACAF) retained their 2.5 qualifiers, Africa and South America 2 each, and Oceania 1. The 16th qualifying spot was determined through a play-off between the third-placed team in CONCACAF and the winner of repechage play-offs in Europe.\nFIFA also ruled that each confederation has to ensure that at least one third of its member associations enter their women's national teams for World Cup qualification, otherwise FIFA would re-examine the current slot allocation. In Africa and the Middle East a considerable percentage of teams had withdrawn from World Cup qualification in the past.\nFor European teams, the 2011 Women's World Cup was also used as a qualification tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Besides Team Great Britain, Europe had two additional qualifiers for the Summer Olympics. With Germany losing their quarter-final, France, which had already reached the semi-finals, secured qualification to the Olympics. Sweden followed as UEFA's second team with its win against Australia.\nQualified teams.\nQualification for the tournament took place between April 2009 and November 2010. As the host nation, Germany were granted automatic qualification, while the remaining national teams qualified through their continental confederations. Most confederations used their continental championship tournaments – the AFC Women's Asian Cup, CAF Women's Championship, OFC Women's Championship, Sudamericano Femenino and CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup – to determine qualification. The exception to this was UEFA, which used its own qualifying tournament. One qualification spot was determined by a play-off between a UEFA and CONCACAF team.\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Women's World Ranking before the tournament were:\nColombia and Equatorial Guinea made their debuts in the FIFA Women's World Cup. Brazil, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Norway, Sweden and the United States maintained their streak of qualifying for all six tournaments so far, while China PR failed to qualify for the first time ever. This is Mexico's first appearance since 1999 and France's first appearance since 2003. As of 2023, this is the last time that Equatorial Guinea and tournament stalwarts North Korea -- who were banned from the 2015 tournament and have been inactive since 2019 -- qualified, as well as the last time the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, and China (only time) failed to qualify.\nOrganization.\nLocal organising committee.\nThe tournament is supervised by the \"Women's World Cup 2011 Organising Committee Germany\". President of the Organising Committee (OC) is former German international Steffi Jones; she started her work on 1 January 2008. German president Christian Wulff was named the patron of the tournament.\nThe Organising Committee is chaired by Jones and supervised by the board of the German Football Federation (DFB). On 25 January 2009, Jones opened the committee offices and named her OC team. It is led by managing director Uli Wolter, who headed the Leipzig branch during the 2006 men's World Cup. Aside from Wolter, four department heads were named. Heike Ulrich is responsible for the tournament organisation, former German international Doris Fitschen heads the marketing department, Winfried Naß leads the department \"Cities and Stadiums\", and Jens Grittner, who served as the press officer for the 2006 Organising Committee, heads the communications department.\nIntended to advertise the tournament primarily in Germany, the Organising Committee named four national Women's World Cup ambassadors: former German internationals Britta Carlson, Renate Lingor, and Sandra Minnert, as well as shooting Paralympics gold medallist Manuela Schmermund. In October 2009, former U.S. international Mia Hamm was presented as the World Cup's international ambassador. Each host city except for Berlin also named two city ambassadors. They include footballers Matthias Sammer, Karl-Heinz Riedle and Rainer Bonhof, fencer Britta Heidemann or biathlete Magdalena Neuner.\nEmblem and mascot.\nThe official World Cup emblem, called Arena Deutschland, was presented by Steffi Jones and Franz Beckenbauer in the break between the women's and the men's game of the German Cup final on 19 April 2008. It shows a stylised stadium with stripes in the national colours of Germany, black, red and gold, and a pictogram of the Women's World Cup trophy in the upper right corner. It was designed by the Stuttgart advertising agency WVP.\nThe tournament mascot, cat \"Karla Kick\", was presented during the opening game of the 2010 Under-20 Women's World Cup on 13 July 2010. The mascot was developed by the Frankfurt agency GMR Marketing. According to Jones, the mascot represents \"important attributes of women's football: passion, fun and dynamics\".\nTickets.\nApproximately one million tickets were available in total, with 900,000 on general sale. 350,000 tickets were offered at discount prices, mainly intended for families, clubs and schools, one of the key target groups of the Organising Committee. As of 22 June 2011, 700,000 tickets have been sold.\nThe World Cup tickets were offered in several sales phases. During the first sales period from 29 October 2009 to 31 August 2010, only so-called city series tickets were offered. Each city series includes tickets for all games of that particular host city. The prices ranged from €30 to €415. In the second sales period from 17 February to 31 August 2010, so-called 20Eleven tickets were sold to groups of at least 11 people, offered at a 20 percent discount and directed primarily at schools and clubs. Single tickets for all matches were first sold starting 15 September 2010. The prices of individual tickets range from €10 to €200. On 18 March 2011, 100 days before the opening game, the last sales phase started, with all remaining tickets being sold in the order in which orders are received.\nUnlike tickets at the 2006 men's World Cup in Germany, the tickets for the Women's World Cup were not personalised. The same city series ticket can be used by different people for different games.\nBudget and sponsors.\nThe tournament's budget has been set at €51 million. The German Football Association plans to cover these costs in almost equal parts from ticket sales and from sponsors, primarily from six so-called National Supporters. In order for the tournament to break even, the DFB has said about 80% of the tickets need to be sold, which would translate to an average attendance of 25,000. The DFB estimates to earn roughly €27 million through the general ticket sale.\nFrom 2008 to 2010, the six National Supporters were presented: the tele-communications company Deutsche Telekom, the bank Commerzbank, the insurer Allianz, the retailer Rewe, the national mail company Deutsche Post and the national railway company Deutsche Bahn. Aside from Deutsche Bahn, the sponsors are identical with those of the 2010 U-20 Women's World Cup.\nMedia coverage.\nThe television coverage of the tournament was unprecedented. For the first time, all matches were produced in high definition, with in-goal cameras and two steadicams being used for all matches. For selected matches, the broadcast production comprised up to 18 cameras, including a spidercam and a helicopter camera.\nIn Germany the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF showed all 32 tournament games live. Across Europe, all games were available on Eurosport in 34 countries and territories. In the United States, ESPN and ESPN2 served as the official English-language broadcaster, while Univision carried coverage in Spanish. In Canada, CBC Television and Sportsnet broadcast the tournament; the event was the first in a sub-licensing partnership for FIFA tournaments between the two networks. In the United Kingdom, the games of the England national team were shown live by BBC Red Button and the BBC Sport website. The final was shown live on BBC Three. SBS held the broadcasting rights for Australia, while Al Jazeera broadcast matches in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe tournament was the first women's event to be the subject of a Panini sticker album, available only in Germany.\nThe final match between Japan and the United States broke the record for most tweets per second on Twitter – 7,196.\nMatch officials.\nFIFA's Referees' Committee selected 16 referees to officiate at the World Cup: three from the AFC, one from the CAF, two from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC and six from UEFA. In addition 32 assistant referees and three fourth officials were selected. The oldest referee was 42-year-old Swede Jenny Palmquist, while the youngest referee was 29-year-old Finau Vulvuli of Fiji.\nSquads.\nAs with the 2007 tournament, each team's squad for the 2011 Women's World Cup consisted of 21 players, two less than men's World Cup squads. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 21-player squad no later than 10 working days before the start of the tournament. Replacement of seriously injured players was permitted until 24 hours before the team in question's first World Cup game.\nDoping cases.\nOn 25 June 2011 the A sample of Yineth Varón, goalkeeper of Colombia, tested positive to an as yet unknown substance. She was provisionally suspended by the FIFA until the B sample result was known. On 25 August 2011, it was confirmed that she had received a two-year ban.\nOn 7 July 2011, FIFA announced that two players from North Korea, Song Jong-Sun and Jong Pok-Sim, were provisionally suspended prior to their team's match against Colombia after failing doping tests during the tournament. On 16 July, FIFA announced that three additional players (Hong Myong-Hui, Ho Un-Byol and Ri Un-Hyang) from North Korea tested positive following target testing of the whole team. On 25 August 2011, the Korean team was fined 400,000, which is equal to the prize it received by finishing 13th in the 2011 tournament, and was excluded from participation at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nFinal draw.\nThe Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 28 November 2010. Four teams from different geographic regions – Germany, Japan, United States, Brazil – were seeded based on their FIFA Women's World Rankings. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, with the exception of Group A, which would include two European teams.\nThe group draw was staged in Frankfurt, Germany, on 29 November 2010 at the Congress Centrum. The ceremony was presented by Organising Committee president Steffi Jones, assisted by FIFA Head of Women's Competitions Tatjana Haenni. The balls were drawn by former German international Günter Netzer and Slovak model and women's football ambassador Adriana Karembeu.\nGroup A was the group of death of this FIFA World Cup with three top 10-ranked teams: Germany (2), Canada (6) and France (7). \nGroup stage.\nThe first round, or group stage, sees the sixteen teams divided into four groups of four teams. Each group is a round-robin of six games, where each team plays one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group qualifies for the quarter-finals.\nThe match schedule for the tournament was released on 20 March 2009, with the hosts placed in position A1. Unlike previous Women's World Cup final tournaments, there were no double-headers, but matches on the same day were held in different venues. According to the Organising Committee, this \"signals the increased quality and status of the women's finals\".\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage comprised the eight teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There is also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there would be a penalty shootout to determine who progressed to the next round.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Ball (best overall player), Golden Boot (top scorer) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were sponsored by Adidas, while the Best Young Player award was sponsored by Hyundai Motor Company. FIFA.com shortlisted ten goals for users to vote on as the Goal of the Tournament, which was sponsored by Sony.\nControversy.\nPlayer gender check.\nIn June 2023, Nilla Fischer revealed in her book, \"I Didn't Even Say Half Of It\", that the Swedish team were told to show their genitalia to prove that they were women during the 2011 competition. This came after protests from Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana relating to allegations that the Equatorial Guinea squad included men. Fischer described the process, which was conducted by a female physiotherapist on behalf of the doctor, as humiliating but did not have a choice in order to not jeapordise the opportunity to play at a World Cup. FIFA said it had taken note of recent comments made by Nilla Fischer around her experiences and gender verification testing conducted by the Swedish national team at the World Cup."

        "title": "Super Tennis",
        "text": "Super Tennis is a 1991 tennis video game for the Super NES. It was an early release for the Super Nintendo and uses mode 7.\nGameplay.\nThe game itself features three different modes: Doubles mode, World Circuit mode, and Singles mode, in which the player competes against a human or chosen computer opponent. In doubles mode, the player and a human teammate can face the CPU. Said-players can each pair with a CPU opponent, or one player can pair with a CPU opponent to face two other computer opponents. Circuit mode is the most unlike the other modes and featuring a wide range of sequential tours the player can choose to battle through each to earn ranking points, with aim to finish number one in the rankings. There are four minor tournaments and four major tournaments, each taking place on one of three surfaces that each have different effects on how the ball bounces; the tournaments are based on real-life counterparts and include nearly every world tournament in existence at that current time.\nAll tennis players, whether playable or the opponents, are cute, short representations of the then-top world players, though their last names are left out of the game. Each playable tennis player has their own talents on the court. Multiple of the right-hand buttons of the SNES controller perform different tennis racket moves and the direction of the ball when hit is influenced by the control pad, which also moves the player around their side of the tennis court in anticipation of the ball. \"Super Tennis\" takes time to master, as the game itself neither tells the player how to play, nor gives them any knowledge on how the many different playable characters subtly differ in play style.\nReception.\n\"Super Tennis\" was met with critical acclaim by media in the United Kingdom and North America. \"Mean Machines\" magazine declared it to be \"the best tennis game available [as of October 1991]\" and scored all aspects of the game very highly, from sound, to gameplay, to their impressions overall. They were impressed by the attention to detail, like how ball runners get the ball off of the court whenever it gets caught in the net. \"Computer and Video Games\" editors said that \"Super Tennis\" is \"more fun than should be allowed\" when a set is played against a friend. They also echoed the declaration that this was the best tennis game available up until that point.\nIn a 2000s retrospective, Mean Machines' then-editor Damo stated that the game was still \"the best representation of the sport to date\" and also the most \"fantastically competitive\", but also said the single player was \"nothing special\". \"Super Tennis\" was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\". IGN ranked the game 84th in their \"Top 100 SNES Games of All Time\". In 1995, Total! rated the game 40th on their Top 100 SNES Games. They commented that \"Super Tennis\" is superb and it does not have as many features compared to \"Smash Tennis\" and praised the gameplay as \"unbelievably slick\"."
