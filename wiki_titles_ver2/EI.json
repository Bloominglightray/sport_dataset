McBreen) and John Stuart. They married in 1902 and had 3 sons. Bill was the eldest, born on 27 June in Blenheim 1905. His younger brothers were James, born in 1908 and Allan Oswald born in 1914. His mother Elizabeth died on 22 August 1929, aged just 47. His father John died in 1954.\nPlaying career.\nStuart played for Hornby in the Canterbury Rugby League competition before being selected for New Zealand in 1924 despite having suffered a knee injury in trials that troubled him for the rest of his career. He scored a try in his debut Test against the Great Britain Lions in Auckland and also played in the third Test in Dunedin.\nStuart was a South Island reserve in 1928 and a reserve for the Canterbury team to play Otago in the same season but was not required to play. He switched to Addington in 1929, helping the club to a Thacker Shield victory. He spent much of his time in moving from the centre to the wing positionally, before later playing often at standoff. After his move to Addington and suffering an injury in early 1930 he returned to play mainly at lock.\nDuring 1931 he moved back to the wing and showed good form scoring tries consistently. He was then selected for the Canterbury team to play the West Coast in a match for the Anisy Shield. It had been seven years since he had last pulled on the Canterbury representative jersey. The match was played at Wingham Park in Greymouth before a crowd of 1,500. West Coast won 37–19 with Stuart said to have \"made no mistakes\", and he also scored a try."

Bob Marlin is in his thirteenth season as head coach. Louisiana has appeared in the NCAA tournament eleven times, most recently in 2023. The Ragin' Cajuns have won the Sun Belt Conference tournament title seven times.\nHistory.\nNCAA sanctions.\n1968 infractions.\nIn 1968, Southwestern Louisiana was placed on two years' probation and barred from postseason play during that time for recruiting violations and for student-athletes receiving financial assistance from an outside organization.\n2007 major violations.\nIn 2007, The Ragin Cajuns were found guilty of major violations in its men's basketball program. An NCAA investigation found that now-former player Orien Greene had relied on 15 hours of correspondence courses taken through another institution in order to remain eligible for the 2004 spring semester and the entire 2004–05 academic year. NCAA rules do not allow student-athletes to use correspondence courses taken from another institution to remain eligible. According to the NCAA, this was an \"obvious error\" that should have been caught right away, but the school's then-compliance coordinator, director of academic services and registrar all failed to catch it. When school officials learned about the violations, they vacated every game in which Greene participated—43 games in all, including NCAA tournament appearances in 2004 and 2005—and scrubbed Greene's records from the books. The NCAA accepted Louisiana's penalties and also imposed two years' probation.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Ragin Cajuns have unofficially appeared in 10 NCAA Division I Tournaments. However, they have officially only appeared in six; the other four appearances have been vacated. In 1972, they became the first school to make the tournament in their first year of eligibility, advancing to the Sweet Sixteen. They repeated this feat in 1973. However, both of these appearances were vacated as a result of the 1973 infractions case. The Ragin Cajuns participated in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA tournaments, but both appearances were vacated due to major violations involving Orien Greene. Their official combined record is 1–6. All appearances prior to 2000 were when the school was still named Southwestern Louisiana.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nThe Ragin Cajuns appeared in the 1971 NCAA Division II Tournament. However, that appearance was later vacated due to the same rules violations that stripped them of their 1972 and 1973 Division I Tournament results.\nNAIA Tournament results.\nThe Ragin Cajuns appeared in two NAIA Tournaments. Their combined record is 3–2.\nNIT results.\nThe Ragin Cajuns appeared in six National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 6–7. All appearances prior to 2002 were when the school was still named Southwestern Louisiana.\nCIT results.\nThe Ragin Cajuns appeared in three CollegeInsider.com Tournaments (CIT). Their combined record is 4–3."

Dimensions of regulation U-12 Baseball World Cup ballparks (distance to the outfield fence, pitching mound, base paths, etc.) are significantly increased compared to local youth leagues, due to the superior nature and strength of the players involved.\nBecause the U-12 Baseball World Cup is considered a \"world championship\" event, the results of the tournaments affect the WBSC World Rankings.\nThe inaugural tournament took place in July 2011 and was won by its host Chinese Taipei. The tournament was slated to include 13 national teams and crowned the first ever world champion. Through this tournament, the WBSC looked to assume a leadership position for this age bracket in conjunction with major youth baseball organizations to further develop and promote baseball across the world. The tournament was hosted in Taipei City, one of the prominent tournament venues for international baseball competitions.\nResults.\n2"

It is therefore possible for clubs from some countries to take part in several levels of competition in the same season. Clubs usually qualify for European competitions through performance in their national or regional leagues, with the exception of wild cards.\nContinental competitions.\nThere are currently four competitions which are branded as Europe-wide, two controlled by Euroleague Basketball, and two by FIBA Europe. Clubs which compete in these competitions also play in their national and/or regional leagues. Clubs usually qualify for these competitions based on their performance in the national or regional leagues in the previous season.\nThe EuroLeague is a competition with currently 18 teams. It has historically been the most prestigious competition in European basketball and is widely recognised as the top-tier league in Europe.\nThe EuroCup is Euroleague Basketball's secondary competition, and currently made up of 20 teams from around Europe. The two finalists of the EuroCup qualify for the next season's EuroLeague.\nThe Basketball Champions League, which began in 2016, is FIBA Europe's highest competition. Initially, FIBA established EuroLeague in 1958 but never trademarketed the name which was later taken over by Euroleague Basketball. The Basketball Champions League involves 52 teams.\nThe Europe Cup is FIBA Europe's secondary competition. 47 teams compete, and the teams which did not enter in the Basketball Champions League regular season have the option to drop down into the regular season of the Europe Cup.\nRegional leagues.\nIn addition to national leagues in individual countries, there are leagues which include clubs from several countries.\nThe ABA League, commonly called the Adriatic League, began in 2001, and consists of clubs from the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia). At different times, the league has also included clubs from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Israel. Clubs generally also compete in their own national leagues in the same season, after the conclusion of the ABA League season. The winner of the league qualifies for the next season's EuroLeague.\nBalkan International Basketball League began in 2008 and European North Basketball League started in 2021.\nThe VTB United League is made up of mostly Russian clubs, as well as a smaller number of clubs from nearby countries - currently Belarus and Kazakhstan. It serves as the top division of the Russian national league system.\nOther multi-national leagues in Europe have included the North European Basketball League (1999–2003), the Baltic Basketball League (2004–2018), the Central European Basketball League (2008–2010), the Latvian-Estonian Basketball League, the BNXT League, and the Alpe Adria Cup.\nNational leagues.\nEach country generally has its own league system, with various divisions which involve promotion and relegation, as well as playoffs following the regular season. \nThe Spanish Liga ACB contributes the most, three to four clubs to the EuroLeague each season. Other leagues among the strongest include Turkey's BSL, Russia's VTB United League, Italy's LBA, the LNB Pro A in France, the Greek Basket League, the Basketball Bundesliga in Germany, and the ABA League."

Taylor was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He has also been a member of the Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins, and Kansas City Chiefs.\nEarly years.\nTaylor attended Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and played on all sides of the ball. During his time on the team, he was a two time all-conference selection and went 12-2 in his sophomore season, making it into the state championship. As a senior, Taylor broke the single season records with 64 receptions that went for 1,180 yards and had 13 touchdowns. On top of that, he rushed the ball 13 times for 85 yards and an additional three scores. On special teams, he returned nine kicks and 16 punts for 177 and 116 yards respectively. Coming out of high school, Taylor received scholarship offers for lacrosse at the University of Virginia, but turned them down to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Rivals.com ranked him as the 47th best tight end in the country and he was considered the 21st best player in the state of North Carolina; he was also a member of the state's Shrine Team.\nCollege career.\nTaylor played four seasons at North Carolina and departed as a redshirt senior. His role for the Tar Heels was limited to special teams during his first year. He was one of four true freshman to see playing time. Playing special teams he had four tackles, two solo stops and two assists. He again continued to play primarily on special teams during his sophomore season. He had five tackles, and in a game against James Madison University recovered a blocked punt. Taylor began to have a bigger role in his junior season, and was named as a special teams captain. He played in all thirteen games and had 19 tackles, the majority of which were on special teams, but the others as a backup linebacker. During a game against NC State, he played on all three sides of the ball as a Tight End, Linebacker, and on special teams. In 2009, he was redshirted after injuring his knee in camp. In his final year with the Tar heels, he again played on all the sides of the ball and was the special teams captain for the second time in his career. After the loss of starting tight end Zack Pianalto, he took over as the starter and went on to break the school record for receptions as a tight end with 36, two of those for touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor was considered to be a possible H-back candidate in the National Football League. Scouts stated that he had \"solid hands\" and \"snatches low and high throws with equal aplomb\". They also stated that he was quick on his routes and could separate linebackers from the inside or outside. For his negatives they stated that he only had \"average\" size for his position and did not possess the strength to be an inside linebacker. They also stated that he could not separate with the speed of NFL linebackers. \nGreen Bay Packers.\nTaylor was selected in the seventh round (218th overall) by the Green Bay Packers in the 2011 NFL Draft. On July 29, 2011, he signed a contract with the Packers.\nOn December 14, 2011, Taylor caught his first reception and touchdown as a professional, against the Oakland Raiders. The catch was a four-yard completion from Aaron Rodgers.\nOn October 6, 2014, he was waived by the Packers.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn October 7, 2014, Taylor was claimed off waivers by the Baltimore Ravens. He was inactive for weeks 6 and 7 and did not play in any games during his tenure with the Ravens. \nOn October 25, 2014, he was waived by Ravens.\nCleveland Browns.\nTaylor was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Browns on October 27, 2014. On December 27, 2014, he was released by the Browns.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThe Miami Dolphins signed Taylor on February 10, 2015. On May 11, 2015, Taylor was released to make room for the signing of TE Tim Semisch.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nTaylor signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in May 2015.

        "title": "Surfing Madonna",
        "text": "The Surfing Madonna is a mosaic of the Virgen de Guadalupe created by artist Mark Patterson. It was covertly installed in Encinitas, California by Patterson and his friend Bob Nichols, who posed as construction workers during the installation. The city declared that the artwork was to be considered graffiti because of the illegality of its installation. Patterson came forward to accept responsibility for it, and was fined $500 and ordered to pay approximately $6,000 for the art's removal. It was removed in 90 minutes, and Patterson was allowed to keep the art.\nThe response to the installation was divided: while some members of the Catholic and Latino communities took issue with it, others felt that it symbolized their Mexican heritage. The art is now in place across the street from where it was originally installed. It inspired a 501c3 non profit founded by Mark Patterson and Bob Nichols called \"Surfing Madonna Oceans Project\". Since the inception of the non-profit in 2013 the Surfing Madonna Oceans Project has donated nearly $600,000 to local ocean/beach/park and humanitarian programs.\nInstallation and legality.\nThe piece was installed on a 10 foot-square concrete wall on a rail bridge in the city of Encinitas. Dressed as construction workers, Mark Patterson and longtime friend Bob Nichols installed the mosaic clandestinely in about two hours on the afternoon of April 22, 2011. It was covertly installed in Encinitas, California (on Earth Day/Good Friday).\nThe mosaic features the Virgin of Guadalupe on a white surfboard, hands in an attitude of prayer, with her green cloak waving in the wind. The words \"Save the Ocean\" are displayed vertically to her left.\nAs the piece was installed without prior permission, it was considered to be graffiti. $2,000 was spent by officials for an art consultant to review how best to remove it without destroying it. During that process, they discovered — underneath the glass — part of Mark Patterson's name. He soon came forward and admitted to being the mosaic's creator.\nPatterson was fined $500 by the city, and at the city's demand, paid approximately $6,000 to a local contractor to remove the mosaic from the train bridge wall. The mosaic came down in about 90 minutes, with minimal damage. The city allowed Patterson to reclaim the mosaic.\nResponse.\nWhile some members of the Catholic and Latino communities found it offensive, others identify with it as symbol of their Mexican heritage. The local Catholic priest was fond of the artwork, and even asked that a local church be able to display it.\nThe state believed that the mosaic could violate the separation in the constitution between state and church. As a result, the state denied the request to put the Surfing Madonna at the entrance of Moonlight Beach State Park.\nReinstallation.\nFor a period of time the mosaic was on display on an exterior wall at Cafe Ipe, next door to Surfy Surfy, in the neighborhood of Leucadia, north of its original location.\nThe mosaic is now out of storage and back in public view. It has been reinstalled in Encinitas directly across the street from its original location now called Surfing Madonna Park at Leucadia Pizzeria, on the corner of Highway 101 and Encinitas Boulevard.\nThe Surfing Madonna Oceans Project raised $100,000 for the Encinitas community in 2014 with its 2nd Annual Surfing Madonna \"Save the Ocean\" 5K/10K and 10 Mile Beach Run/Walk. In 2014 it set up a brick paver project to raise money for ocean and humanitarian programs, www.surfingmadonna.org, and will have its 3rd annual run/walk in hopes of raising $150,000 for the community in October, 2015.\nThe Surfing Madonna Foundation recently donated $60,000 to local causes. The nonprofit organization donated $20,000 to the City of Solana Beach toward its upcoming skatepark and $40,000 to the Encinitas Arts Culture and Ecology Alliance (EACEA) otherwise known as Pacific View, a former elementary school now turning into an arts and ecology center. They've donated $70,000 to this artful and ambitious nonprofit's Pacific View project since January 2017. https://www.encinitasadvocate.com/news/sd-cm-enc-0323-surfing-madonna-20180320-story.html\nSince 2013, the Project has donated thousands of dollars to ocean conservation initiatives and humanitarian projects including the Surf Camp for Special Needs Children, oceanography scholarships, marine mammal rescue equipment and student grants for ocean-minded projects. The Project has also donated floating beach wheelchairs and mobility mats for physically disabled people to access the water at Moonlight Beach in Encinitas."

        "text": "The Saint Peter's Peacocks men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program that represents Saint Peter's University in Jersey City, New Jersey. The school's team competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and plays their home games in Run Baby Run Arena. They are currently led by second-year head coach Bashir Mason, who was hired on April 12, 2022. The Peacocks have appeared in the NCAA tournament five times.\nHistory.\nSaint Peter's University is one of the founding members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), which began play in men's basketball with the 1981–82 season. Since then, the Peacocks have compiled the second most wins of any MAAC team and have won the MAAC Championship five times (1991, 1995, 2011, 2022, 2024), tied for the second most all-time. Saint Peter's previously competed in the Metropolitan Collegiate Conference (MCC) from 1965 to 1969. Basketball has long been the most popular sport at the university.\nSaint Peter's first season of basketball was 1930–31 which was the also the same year the college re-opened following its twelve-year closure from the impacts of World War I. To celebrate the school's rebirth, the dean named the Peacock as its official mascot.\nThe Peacocks recorded their first consecutive winning seasons under head coach George Babich in 1947–48 (16–5) and 1948–49 (18–5).\nIn the 1950s, Saint Peter's found sustained success with the hiring of head coach Don Kennedy ahead of the 1950–51 season as the fifth head coach in program history. The Peacocks would make back-to-back NAIA Tournament appearances in 1953 and 1954. Saint Peter's would make a run to the NAIA Quarterfinals in 1954 where they would lose to Arkansas Tech 77–81. They would then go on to make back-to-back appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1957 and 1958.\nThe Peacocks first gained national recognition on March 18, 1968, with a stunning upset. Led by head coach Don Kennedy, Saint Peter's defeated the nationally ranked No. 10 Duke Blue Devils 100–71 in the 1968 NIT Quarterfinals in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,500 at Madison Square Garden. This was the first sell-out for a college basketball game at the current Madison Square Garden. The Peacocks advanced to the sold-out semifinal game against the Kansas Jayhawks led by future Hall of Famer Jo Jo White. Demand to attend the game was so high that Saint Peter’s arranged for the game to be shown on a CCTV feed in the Stanley Theater at Journal Square to a capacity crowd. The Peacocks NIT run ended in a 46–58 defeat and a fourth-place finish. This was the second of three consecutive NIT appearances for Saint Peter's. During the 1967–68 season, the Peacocks went 24–4, 8–0 in conference play and averaged 94 points per game. The team was later nicknamed the \"Run, Baby Run\" Team after that phrase was found written on a blackboard by Peacocks reserve center Tom Schwester inside the door to the Peacock locker room after their win over Duke.\nIn 1972, Don Kennedy ended his twenty-two year career as the winningest head coach in program history with a 323–195 (.624) record from 1950 to 1972. Under Kennedy, the Peacocks became known for their fast-pace offensive tactics even with the addition of the shot clock in 1954. During his tenure, the Peacocks registered a winning season in 19 of 22 seasons, three 20-win seasons, including the program's first 20-win campaign in 1957–58, a program-record 24 victories in 1967–68 and appearances in five NIT Tournaments and two NAIA Tournaments.\nOn November 29, 1975, the Victor R. Yanitelli, S.J. Recreational Life Center (Yanitelli Center) opened on campus as the new home court of the Peacocks with an inaugural game against the Dartmouth Big Green. Prior to its opening, Saint Peter's hosted its home games at the nearby Jersey City Armory and still occasionally use the venue for high-profile games.\nFrom 1975 to 1989, the Peacocks made seven appearances in the NIT (1975, 1976, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989). Saint Peter's would make its deepest run during that span in the 1980 NIT. Led by head coach Bob Dukiet, the Peacocks defeated the UConn Huskies (71–56) and the Duqesnse Dukes (34–33) en route to a tough Quarterfinal matchup against the Sidney Green led UNLV Runnin' Rebels where they would lose 63–67.\nDuring this period, prior to joining the MAAC in 1981, the Peacocks participated in the ECAC men's basketball tournaments (regional end-of-season tournaments played by Division I schools that were independent, with Saint Peter's being in the Metro region) in 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981. The Peacocks defeated the Fordham Rams 65–47 in the semifinals to make it to the 1980 ECAC Metro Championship game where they were defeated by their future MAAC rival, the Iona Gaels, 64–46.\nIn the early 1990s, Saint Peter's began to find success in the MAAC Tournament under head coach Ted Fiore. In 1991, the Peacocks won their first MAAC Championship over the Iona Gaels 64–58 to send them to their first ever NCAA Tournament. The No. 5 Texas Longhorns would defeat them 65–73 in the First Round of the Midwest Region. In 1995, the Peacocks were again MAAC Champions after upsetting the No. 1 Manhattan Jaspers 80–78 in overtime. They would be matched up against the Marcus Camby led No. 2 Umass Minutemen in the NCAA Tournament where the Minutemen would be victorious over the Peacocks 68–51 in the First Round of the East Region.\nOn June 17, 2002, Saint Peter's was one of sixteen schools selected to participate in the NIT Season Tip-Off Tournament. On November 18, 2002, the Peacocks played fellow Jesuit university program the Xavier Musketeers with the Peacocks falling in the opening round 48–87.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, the Peacocks were led by starting point guard Keydren \"Kee-Kee' Clark who was one of the most prolific scorers in NCAA Division I history. During his college career at Saint Peter's, Clark amassed 3,058 points and averaged 29.5 points a game. In 2003, he was named MAAC Rookie of the Year. In 2004 and 2005, he led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion. On March 4, 2006, Clark became only the seventh NCAA player to score more than 3,000 points in his career; on the next day, he passed Hersey Hawkins to become the sixth-leading scorer of all time. The milestone happened in a game where the Peacocks upset the No. 1 Manhattan Jaspers 84–74 in the MAAC Tournament semi-finals. He was later named 2006 MAAC Player of the Year. Clark finished his college career as the sixth all-time NCAA leading scorer and as the NCAA record holder for the most three-pointers made with 435. He was later passed by JJ Redick who finished his college career with 457. Clark led the MAAC in scoring in all four seasons at Saint Peter's and is the all-time leading scorer in Saint Peter's University and New Jersey collegiate history. He also holds the Yanitelli Center scoring record for most points in a game with 44. Clark returned to the Peacocks ahead of the 2022–23 season and is currently Director of Player Development and an assistant coach.\nOn December 27 and 28, 2005, Saint Peter's played in the \"Panasonic Holiday Festival\" at Madison Square Garden. They took on the UMass Minutemen in the opening round where the Minutemen defeated the Peacocks 66–49. They were then matched up against the Columbia Lions where the Peacocks won 63–54 to finish third in the regular season tournament.\nOn November 17, 2009, Saint Peter's garnered national exposure by hosting the Monmouth Hawks as part of the second annual ESPN's 24–Hour College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon. The marathon of live games across ESPN's networks marked the first day of the college basketball season. Ahead of the game, the university hosted an 11-hour \"all-nighter\" of campus activities with free breakfast and a pre-game pep rally. The game tipped-off at 6:05 a.m. and ended with the Peacocks defeating the Hawks, 58–34 in front of 1,246 fans.\nIn 2011, the Peacocks won their third MAAC Championship over the No. 2 Iona Gaels 62–57 which sent them to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This was their first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 1995 and third trip overall. Saint Peter's drew the No. 3 Purdue Boilermakers in the First round. Purdue would go on to defeat Saint Peter's 65–43 in the Southwest Region.\nIn 2017, led by head coach John Dunne, the Peacocks went 23–13 and 14–6 in conference to play to finish second in the MAAC. In the MAAC Tournament, they defeated the Canisus Golden Griffens in the quarterfinals 61–58 before losing to the lona Gaels in the semifinals 65–73. They were invited to play in the 2017 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) where they won their first-ever national postseason title by defeating the Texas A&amp;M–Corpus Christi Islanders 62–61. Saint Peter's hosted and defeated the Furman Paladins in the semifinals of the CIT 77–51 at the Yanitelli Center marking the first time Saint Peter's ever hosted a national post-season tournament.\nOn July 22, 2020, Saint Peter's announced that through a $5 million lead gift from alum and former basketball player Thomas P. Mac Mahon, they would begin a phased renovation of the Yanitelli Center. The renovation included the creation of a more modern basketball/volleyball arena with new retractable bleachers with an allotment of chairback seating, a full replacement of the hardwood court surface, updated branding and signage, a reimagined entryway to the facility, enhanced lighting and new video scoreboards. Mac Mahon, a 1968 graduate of Saint Peter's, and a member of the Saint Peter's University Board of Trustees, decided to honor his former 1967–68 teammates by naming the renovated space the \"Run Baby Run Arena\" after that team's nickname for its high-scoring offense. The new arena debuted on November 1, 2021, with Saint Peter's defeating fellow Jersey City school New Jersey City University 90–66 in an exhibition game.\nIn 2022, the Peacocks won their fourth MAAC Championship defeating the Monmouth Hawks 60–54 and earning a spot in the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they would again earn national recognition. Led by head coach Shaheen Holloway, Saint Peter's became the tenth No. 15 seed in history to upset a No. 2 seed after knocking off the Kentucky Wildcats 85–79 in overtime. They then defeated the Murray State Racers in the next round 70–60, becoming the third No. 15 seed in tournament history (and the third in the last nine years) to make the Sweet 16. In the Sweet 16, they upset the No. 3 seed Purdue Boilermakers 67–64, to become the first No. 15 seed in tournament history to advance to the Elite Eight. Their historic Cinderella run came to an end with a 49–69 loss against No. 8 North Carolina. The Peacocks concluded their historic 2021–22 season with an overall record of 22–12 and the best NCAA post-season run with the most wins in a single NCAA Tournament by any MAAC program (men or women) in the conference's 41-year history.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Peacocks took on the FDU Knights in a regionally and nationally televised game on the YES Network dubbed the \"Battle of the Bracket Busters\" at the Knights home court, the Bogota Savings Bank Center. Both New Jersey programs were recent NCAA Tournament bracket busters with Saint Peter's being the first No. 15 seed to make a run to the Elite Eight in 2022 and FDU becoming the second No. 16 seed and first First Four team to beat a No. 1 seed when they defeated the Purdue Boilermakers, 63–58 in 2023. The Knights made two free throws with 1.7 seconds left to defeat the Peacocks 71–70.\nIn 2024, the Peacocks returned to the NCAA tournament after they defeated the No. 2 Fairfield Stags in the MAAC Championship, 68–63 for their fifth conference title. Saint Peter's would not be able to replicate their 2021–22 Cinderella run season and lost in the First Round to the No. 2 Tennessee Volunteers 49–83 in the Midwest Region.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Peacocks have appeared in the NCAA Tournament five times.

Hurley has credited the \"speed and precision\" of Kennedy's fast break offense as ahead of its time and the template for the principals he employed as the head coach of the St. Anthony High School Friars in Jersey City. Hurley used those principles to lead St. Anthony's to become the winningest high school basketball program in United States history.\nThe following is a list of Saint Peter's Peacocks men's basketball head coaches."

        "title": "2013 World Baseball Classic qualification",
        "text": "The qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic was held from September 19 to November 19, 2012. Although the 2006 and 2009 editions of the World Baseball Classic were contested by the same pre-selected field of 16 teams, for the 2013 tournament only the 12 teams that won at least one game in 2009 were guaranteed a berth in the main tournament. The other four (Canada, Chinese Taipei, Panama, and South Africa) contested the qualifying round along with 12 additional teams invited by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF).\nThe qualifiers were organized as four independent modified double-elimination tournaments featuring four teams each. The final game was winner-take-all, even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket. That is, the team emerging from the winner's bracket might be eliminated despite losing only one game (as, in fact, happened to Israel in Qualifier 1).\nCanada and Chinese Taipei dominated in Qualifiers 2 and 4 to advance easily. In Qualifier 1, Spain and Israel both won in the first round, then Israel beat Spain in the winner's bracket. Spain then eliminated South Africa (the only team in the qualifier to have previously contested the WBC) to earn a rematch with Israel, which was without its several Major League players due to the qualifier taking place during the MLB season. Spain won the winner-take-all final game, 9–7 in 10 innings, to advance to the main tournament.\nIn Qualifier 3, favorites Panama and Nicaragua lost in the first round, and Panama then eliminated Nicaragua. After both teams defeated Colombia, underdog Brazil defeated Panama 1–0 to advance to the main tournament.\nPlayers.\nUnder the Classic's rules, Team Israel was entitled to have non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage play for the team. Such players included major leaguers catcher Ryan Lavarnway, first baseman Ike Davis, second basemen Ian Kinsler and Josh Satin, third basemen Kevin Youkilis and Danny Valencia, outfielders Ryan Braun (whose father is Israeli), Sam Fuld, Ryan Kalish, and Gabe Kapler, and pitchers Jason Marquis, Scott Feldman, Craig Breslow, and John Grabow, as well as what were then recent major leaguers catcher Brad Ausmus and pitcher Scott Schoeneweis. Kinsler said: \"Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Yuk [Kevin Youkilis], Braun [Ryan Braun], and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Yuk – we always laugh about things like this.\" Outfielder Shawn Green, who retired in 2007, was also eligible because he is Jewish. In early June 2011 he said it \"would be an honor\" and he \"would love to\" play for Israel in the Classic.\nBecause they were held in September, while the Major League Baseball season was still in progress, Qualifiers 1 and 2 could not feature major league players. Kevin Youkilis announced that he would play for the team if they made it past the qualifying round.\nThe highest-level players involved in Qualifiers 1 and 2 were minor-league prospects ranked among the top 20 in their respective organizations. Team Israel, managed by former major league All Star Brad Ausmus, included minor league pitchers Eric Berger (1–0) and Brett Lorin, first baseman Nate Freiman (.417; 4 HR in 12 AB), second baseman Josh Satin (.273), shortstops Jake Lemmerman and Ben Orloff, and outfielders Adam Greenberg, Ben Guez, Joc Pederson (.308), and Robbie Widlansky. Retired major leaguer Shawn Green played for Israel (.333).\nSimilarly, Joey Votto and Justin Morneau were unable to play for Canada. They were led by minor league first baseman Jimmy Van Ostrand (.538; 10 RBIs in 13 at-bats). Although Canada advanced easily despite the unavailability of its Major Leaguers, Israel was eliminated after narrowly losing the final game to Spain.\nBy contrast, all four teams in Qualifier 3 boasted Major League players, as it took place in November and did not conflict with the MLB season. Established Major Leaguers included Carlos Ruiz, Rubén Tejada, Manny Acosta, Manny Corpas, and Carlos Lee of Panama; and Everth Cabrera and J. C. Ramírez of Nicaragua. Major League rookies and prospects included Erasmo Ramírez and Cheslor Cuthbert of Nicaragua; Yan Gomes of Brazil; and Luis Martinez and brothers Donavan and Jhonatan Solano of Colombia. Retired Major Leaguers included Ramiro Mendoza of Panama and Édgar Rentería of Colombia.\nAlthough Qualifier 4 also took place in November, it did not feature any current MLB players, as both Wei-Yin Chen and Chien-Ming Wang of Chinese Taipei elected to skip the qualifier. Chinese Taipei did feature Japanese major leaguer Yao-Hsun Yang as well as Taiwanese league players such as Peng Cheng-min and Lin Chih-sheng, and qualified easily. Both New Zealand and the Philippines included minor league players, while Thailand included former Major Leaguer Johnny Damon.\nVenues.\nFour stadiums were used during the qualifying round:\nAttendance.\n103,774 (avg. 4,324; pct. 30.7%)\nAdditional rules.\nA pitcher threw no more than 85 pitches per game in the qualifying round unless the pitcher needed more to complete a batter's plate appearance.\nA pitcher must:\nA mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings.\nAn alternative version of the IBAF's extra inning rule was also used. If after 12 innings the score was still tied, each half inning thereafter would have started with runners on second and first base. The runners would have been the eighth and ninth hitters due in that inning respectively. For example, if the number five hitter was due to lead off the inning, the number three hitter would have been on second base, and the number four hitter on first base. However, this rule was never actually employed in this year's qualifiers, as the two extra-inning games in the qualifying round ended prior to a 13th inning."

        "text": "Women's tennis has been played in the United States for over a century where several important and famous female tennis players originated.\nHistory.\nBy 1888, American women tennis players were agitating for their own championship competition. USLTA claimed that they lacked the authority to organise such a competition.\nIn 1923, the Wightman Cup was created as a national women's tennis competition between the United States and Great Britain. The trophy for the event was paid for by Hazel Wightman, an American tennis champion. The location of the cup was alternated between countries on a yearly basis. Great Britain won in 1924, 1925, 1928 and 1930. In all other years that the cup was contested, the Americans claimed victory.\nImportant players.\nHelen Wills Moody won 31 Grand Slam titles in the 1920s and 1930s. She helped to popularize the overhand serve for women during the 1940s. Alice Marble is another important influential American tennis player. In 1939, she was a triple champion at Wimbledon. Her style of play was characterized as masculine because of her aggressive pursuit of the ball during serves and volleys. Like Helen Wills Moody, others would go on to copy her style of play. Maureen Connolly won the four Grand Slam singles tournaments in 1953.\nAlthea Gibson was the first African American woman to win a Grand Slam tournament. She claimed the singles title at the French Championships in 1956, and at Wimbledon and the US Nationals in 1957 and 1958.\nIn the Open Era, the United States has produced some of the most influential and successful players including Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova (defected from Czechoslovakia), Monica Seles (defected from Serbia and Montenegro), Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. The arrival of the Williams sisters is credited as the ushering in of a new era of power and athleticism on the women's tour and 23 time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams is considered by many to be the greatest women's player of all time."

        "title": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2002",
        "text": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2002 in Jesolo was the sixteenth European championships to be held by the W.A.K.O. It was the second championship to be held in Jesolo and the seventh (including world championships) to be held in Italy. W.A.K.O. had originally hoped to have a joint event that year like they had with the last world championships, with an event in Greece in October and another in Hungary (and then Slovakia) in November, but due to the difficulties involved they scrapped the idea and resorted to Jesolo which had held a successful event two years previously.\nThe event was open to amateur men and women from across Europe (with Iran rather unusually participating at a Euro championships) and there were seven styles available; Full Contact, Low-Kick (men only), Thai-Boxing (men only), Light-Contact, Semi-Contact, Musical Forms and Aero-Kickboxing (making its W.A.K.O. debut). Each country was allowed one competitor per weight division in all styles expect Musical Forms and Aero-Kickboxing, although some contestants were allowed to participate in more than one style (mainly the case with Semi and Light-Contact). By the end of the championships Russia was the strongest nation overall, with the hosts Italy in second and Belarus in the third. The event was held over six days in the Palasport Cornaro in Jesolo Italy, beginning on Friday November 22 and ending on Wednesday, November 27th, 2002.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a style of kickboxing where punches and kicks are allowed to be thrown by the participants at full force, with strikes below the waist prohibited. Most fights result in a judge’s decision or stoppage victory and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and various body protection must be worn. More information on Full-Contact and the rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website. At Jesolo the men had twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. Notable winners included a young Muamer Hukić (more commonly known as the cruiserweight boxing champion Marco Huck) and there were a number of repeat winners from the last world championships in Belgrade with Ramadani Besnik, Fouad Habbani, Olesya Gladkova, Oxana Vassileva, Barbara Plazzoli and Marjut Lappalainen all picking up gold medals. By the end of the championships Russia were easily the top nation in Full-Contact winning eight gold, one silver and two bronze medals.\nLow-Kick.\nLow-Kick is a style of kickboxing wherein punches and kicks are allowed to be thrown by the participants at full force, only differing from Full-Contact in that kicks to the leg are also allowed. Most fights result in a point's decision or stoppage victory and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and various body protection must be worn. More information on Low-Kick rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. Available to men only there were twelve weight divisions in Jesolo, ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. While there were few notable winners Evgeniy Khil and Ivan Sočo were double winners having also won gold at the last world championships in Belgrade and future K-1 MAX and SuperLeague fighter Luis Reis won a silver medal. By the championships end Russia was the strongest nation in the style, amassing four golds, three silvers and one bronze.\nThai-Boxing.\nThai-boxing (more commonly known as Muay Thai is the most physical style of kickboxing in which the contestants use punches, kicks, elbows and knees to attempt to defeat their opponent, often by referee stoppage or via a point's decision. As with other forms of amateur kickboxing, participants must wear head and body protection. At Jesolo the category was open to men only with just nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs - three down from Belgrade where there were twelve. The lower than anticipated number of contestants can be explained due to the emergency moving of the W.A.K.O. event, originally a joint event, to Jesolo on a weekend which also included two other international amateur Muay Thai events – the I.A.M.T.F. European championships in Portugal and the I.F.M.A. World Championships in Paris. Despite missing some of Europe's top fighters the event had several notable winners in Dmitry Shakuta and Ivan Tolkachev who had won gold at the last world championships in Belgrade, as well as Vasily Shish who like the two mentioned before would win multiple world and European titles. By the end of the event Belarus were easily the top nation in Thai-Boxing winning five golds and one silver.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing where points are scored on speed and technique and strikes must be thrown with moderate (not full force). It is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi and is often seen as a transitional stage between the two and as with other forms of amateur kickboxing head and body protection must be worn. More detail on Light-Contact and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women participated in the style with the men having eight weight divisions (one less than at Maribor) ranging from 63 kg/138.6 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Although not full of recognisable names there were a number of repeat winners at Jesolo with Marcel Pekonja, Zoltan Dancso, Wojciech Szczerbinski, Szilvia Csicsely and Nadja Sibila all having won gold medals at the last world championships in Maribor. By the end of the event Poland was the strongest nation in the style winning five golds, three silvers and two bronze medals.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is the least physical of the contact kickboxing styles available at W.A.K.O. events. It involves the participants throwing controlled strikes at targets above the waist, with point's scored on the basis of speed and technique with power prohibited. Despite the less physical nature all contestants must wear head and various body protection - more detail on the Semi-Contact and the rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women participated in the style with the men having nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs and the women having six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Not full of noticeable names there were a number of repeat winners with Dezső Debreczeni, Samantha Aquilano, Luisa Lico and Nadja Sibila all having won gold at the last world championships in Maribor. By the championships end Great Britain were the strongest country in Semi-Contact winning four golds, one silver and one bronze medal.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. The men and women competed in four different styles explained below:\nNotable winners included Christian Brell, Andrei Roukavistnikov, Sandra Hess and Veronica Dombrovskaya who added to the winners medals they had collected at the last world championships in Maribor, with Dombrovskaya also being a double winner in Musical Forms at Jesolo. By the end of the championships Belarus were the strongest nation in the style, winning three gold medals, one silver and one bronze overall.\nAero-Kickboxing.\nAero-Kickboxing made its debut at a W.A.K.O. championships in Jesolo. Like Musical Forms it is a non physical competition involving aerobic and kickboxing techniques in time to specifically selected music – more information on Aero-Kickboxing and the rule set can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. There were three categories in Jesolo; male, female and a mixed sex team event. By the end of the championships France was the top nation making a clean sweep of all three gold medal positions."

        "title": "FIA World Endurance Championship",
        "text": "The FIA World Endurance Championship (abbreviated as WEC) is an auto racing world championship organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The series supersedes the ACO's former Intercontinental Le Mans Cup which began in 2010 and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship at the end of 1992. The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from 1981 to 1985.\nThe series features multiple classes of cars competing in endurance races, with sports prototypes competing in the Hypercar (LMH or LMDh) and LMP2 categories, and production-based grand tourers competing in the LM GTE Pro and Am categories. World champion titles are awarded to the top-scoring drivers and manufacturers over the season, while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and private teams.\nHistory.\nThe World Endurance Championship was first run in 2012 as a replacement for the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, following much of the same format and featuring eight endurance races across the world, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. There were four categories: LMP1 and LMP2 prototypes along with GTE grand tourers, divided into GTE Pro for teams with professional driver line-ups, and GTE Am for teams featuring a mixture of amateur drivers.\nFaced with declining manufacturer interest in the LMP1 class after the 2017 season, the FIA commissioned a study into the future regulations of the championship's top category. Known as the Le Mans Hypercar (LMH), the proposal called for a move away from Le Mans Prototype entries and less reliance on hybrid technologies. The proposal was designed to make the championship more appealing to car manufacturers, and cited flagship models such as the Aston Martin Vulcan and McLaren Senna GTR as examples of the cars the new regulations were hoping to attract. The Hypercar class first appeared in the 2021 season, with LMH entries from Alpine, Glickenhaus and Toyota. From 2023, LMDh entries will also be able to compete full-time in the Hypercar class alongside LMH.\nIn 2021, the ACO announced that the series would move away from its two LMGTE categories, following a rapid decline in manufacturer interest. The 2022 season will be the last for the LMGTE Pro class, and from 2024, LMGTE Am will be replaced by a GT3-based category, described as a \"GT3 Premium\" featuring a cost-capped body kit conversion from standard GT3 machinery. According to the president of the FIA Endurance Commission Richard Mille, the FIA are aiming at a customer-focused category where the manufacturers cannot enter officially.\nIn the year 2024, it will officially mark the first season in the category's history since the inaugural season in 2012 that the LMP2 class would not be on the grid in the FIA WEC due to increased demand in grid sizes in the Hypercar &amp; Incoming GT3-Spec based LMGT3 classes for full season entries. However it will still take part appearing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race.\nFormat.\nFive titles are to be decided and awarded in the current season (as of 2024) based on total point tally, with two being deemed world championships: Hypercar World Endurance Drivers' Championship and Hypercar World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship. The points system is similar to that used in the FIA's other world championships, awarding points to the top ten finishers on a sliding point margin scale from first to tenth. Cars finishing the race but classified eleventh or further are awarded a half point. For 8 and 10-hour races, points are worth roughly 1.5x as much (i.e. 25 points for a win is worth 38 points at these races). For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, points are worth roughly 2x as much."

European Championships 2000 in Jesolo were the joint fifteen European kickboxing championships (the other was held in Moscow the same year) hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization and the sixth championships (world and European) to be held in Italy. The event was open to amateur men and women from across Europe and there were three styles on offer; Low-Kick (men only), Light-Contact and Semi-Contact. By the end of the championships the most successful nation was the hosts Italy, followed by Hungary in second and Kyrgyzstan in third. The event was held over five days at the Palasport Cornaro in Jesolo, Italy starting on Wednesday, 18 October and ending on Sunday, 22 October 2000.\nLow-Kick.\nLow-Kick is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing except that it allows kicks below the knee. Matches are usually resolved by a point's decision or referee stoppage and as is common in amateur kickboxing, both fighters have to wear head and body protection – more detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. At Jesolo the style was open to men only, with there being twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. The most notable winner was Ivan Strugar who won his fifth gold medal at an amateur W.A.K.O. championships. Kyrgyzstan was the top nation in Low-Kick winning four golds, one silver and two bronze medals.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a stepping stone between the two. Fighters score points on the basis of speed and technique over brute force although stoppages can occur, and as with other amateur kickboxing styles head and body protection must be worn – more detail on Light-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had nine weight divisions in the style ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Notable winners at Jesolo included Dawid Kowalski, Martin Albers and Michal Wszelak who had all won gold medals at the last world championships in Caorle. By the end of the championships Hungary was the most successful nation in Light-Contact, winning four gold medals, two silver and four bronze.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing in which fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited and as with other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and body protection is worn – more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. As with Light-Contact the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. By the end of the championships Italy was by far the strongest nation in Semi-Contact picking up six golds, three silvers and two bronzes."

It was the fifth championships (world and European) to be held in Italy and was open to amateur men and women from fifty countries across the world.\nThere were five categories available at Caorle, much more than at the previous European championships. The categories on offer included; Full-Contact, Thai-Boxing (men only), Light-Contact, Semi-Contact and Musical Forms. By the end of the championships Belarus was the top nation, just about shading second place Russia due to her incredible record in Thai-boxing, while Italy came in third. The event was held in Caorle, Italy in November, 1999.\nParticipating nations.\nThere were fifty nations from five continents across the world participating at the 1999 W.A.K.O. World Championships in Caorle:\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where fights are won primarily by point's decision or referee stoppage, with kicks and punches allowed above the waist, although unlike professional kickboxing, head and body protection is compulsory - more detail on Full-Contact rules are available on the W.A.K.O. website. At Caorle the men had twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had seven (one more than at Leverkusen) ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs, with an extra weight class being added (+70 kg). Notable winners in this category included Mariusz Cieśliński who won his third W.A.K.O. world championship gold medal, Aleksandr Povetkin who would go to achieve greater renown as a pro boxer, and Natascha Ragosina who would later become a multiple world champion in women's boxing. By the end of the championships Russia were easily the dominant nation in Full-Contact, winning five gold medals, three silver and three bronze in total.\nThai-Boxing.\nThe most physical type of kickboxing available at W.A.K.O. championships, Thai-boxing (more commonly known as Muay Thai) allows the contestants to kick, punch, use elbows and knees in an attempt to win their matches – often by a point’s decision or via a referee stoppage. Unlike the professional version, W.A.K.O. amateur events enforce the wearing of head, body and leg protection by the competitors. In Caorle only men were allowed to participate in Thai-boxing, with twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. Notable winners in the style included future pro world champions Vasily Shish, Dmitry Shakuta and Vitali Akhramenko, with their nation Belarus being by far the strongest nation in Thai-boxing, winning eight gold and two bronze medals. Even more incredible was the fact that seven of these winners all trained together at the Kick Fighter Gym in Minsk.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a transition between the two. Contestants score points on the basis of speed and technique over brute force although stoppages can occur, although as with other amateur forms head and body protection must be worn - more detail on Light-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs, with several new weight divisions at the top end of the scale, while the women had five ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs. Not exactly full of recognizable names, the most notable winners in this category were Klaus Wilkinson and Boris Zalyotkin in the men's both having won gold at the last European championships, and in the women's, Rita Pesuth who won her second gold medal at Caorle, having also won in Semi-Contact. Poland were the top nation in Light-Contact winning three gold, three silver and four bronze medals.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing in which fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited and as with other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and body protection is worn - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. The men had eight weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had five ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs. The most notable winner was Rita Pesuth who also won gold at the same event in Light-Contact making her a double winner. Italy was the top country in the style, winning six golds and four bronzes.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. The men and women competed in four different styles explained below:\nThe most notable winners were Olga Valentinova who was a double winner in Musical Forms and Alexei Pekarchik who also won gold in Thai-boxing. By the end of the championships United States were the top nation with four golds, one silver and two bronze medals."

        "title": "John Gibson (ice hockey, born 1993)",
        "text": "John Gibson (born July 14, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nGibson was ranked first among North American goaltenders in both the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's preliminary and midterm rankings for the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nOn June 24, 2011, Gibson was drafted in the second round, 39th overall, at the 2011 NHL Entry Draft by the Anaheim Ducks. Prior to his selection, while still playing with USA Hockey's National Team Development Program, he committed himself to playing college ice hockey at the University of Michigan, which competes in NCAA's Division I in the Big Ten Conference, for the upcoming 2011–12 season. However, on July 27, he opted out of his agreement with Michigan to instead play major junior ice hockey for the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Gibson, who attended Baldwin High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was cut from their hockey team and still went on to make the NHL.\nDuring the following season, 2012–13, Gibson was selected to represent the United States at the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He was the team's primary goaltender throughout the championship, registering a .955 save percentage and a 1.36 goals against average (GAA) in seven games for the eventual gold medal winners. His save percentage led all goaltenders in the tournament and he was named as the tournament's best goaltender. He was also named to the tournament All-Star Team, as well as named the tournament's most valuable player.\nGibson also won a bronze medal at the 2013 IIHF World Championships with Team USA's senior squad, posting a 1.56 GAA and .951 save percentage in the tournament.\nProfessional.\nGibson made his professional debut with the Norfolk Admirals, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Anaheim Ducks, on April 19, 2013, playing 40 minutes in relief.\nOn April 7, 2014, aged 20 years and 297 days, Gibson made his first NHL start for the Ducks following an injury to goaltender Frederik Andersen. Making 18 saves for a shutout, Gibson earned his first NHL win, a 3–0 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. In doing so, Gibson became the youngest NHL goaltender to record a shutout in his NHL debut since the Buffalo Sabres' Daren Puppa (20 years, 223 days) performed the feat in the 1985–86 season. Gibson made his Stanley Cup playoff debut with the Ducks in Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinal against the Los Angeles Kings. He registered a shutout on 28 shots and was named first star of the game on May 10, 2014. Jonas Hiller, whom Gibson started over, was the last goaltender prior to Gibson to record a shutout in his Stanley Cup playoff debut. The Ducks would win Game 5 at home 4–3 but would lose Games 6 and 7 by scores of 2–1 and 6–2, respectively, with Gibson being pulled in Game 7 after allowing 4 goals on 18 shots.\nWith the departure of Jonas Hiller via free agency, the Ducks announced that both Frederik Andersen and John Gibson would compete for the number one starting job for the 2014–15 NHL season. Gibson seemed to have performed well enough in the preseason to start opening night against the Pittsburgh Penguins, his hometown team, in which Gibson stopped 33 of 39 shots en route to a 6–4 loss. With Andersen starting off the season strong, Gibson was sent to Norfolk for a weekend to gain some playing time. Afterwards, he was recalled by the Ducks. Upon his return Gibson won his next two starts and lost one, which included a shutout of the Chicago Blackhawks. Gibson then injured his groin while warming up before a game against the Colorado Avalanche. He was estimated to miss six to eight weeks, thus giving Andersen total control of the number one job and the Ducks signed Ilya Bryzgalov as a backup to Andersen in Gibson's absence. After coming off injured reserve, Gibson spent time off with Norfolk. When Andersen went down with an injury, Gibson was recalled. When Andersen returned, the two goalies would rotate in and out of the crease with Gibson at one point being considered as the starter down the stretch with Andersen struggling a bit. Overall, Gibson would post up a record of 13–8 with a 2.60 goals against average and a save percentage of .914%. He did not see a single minute of play during the Ducks postseason run, missing the entire first round due to an upper-body injury. The Ducks went all the way to the Western Conference Finals but fell to the eventual Stanley Cup Champions, Chicago Blackhawks in seven games.\nWith the off-season acquisition of Anton Khudobin, rumors sparked of Gibson being traded elsewhere, which was promptly put down by Ducks general manager Bob Murray. On September 21, the Ducks announced that they signed Gibson to a three-year contract extension, worth reportedly $6.9 million. He also began the 2015–16 season with the new AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls. When Andersen had the flu, Gibson was recalled on November 24 and started when the Calgary Flames met the Ducks in which the Ducks won 5–3. Gibson started for the next nine games posting a 4–4–1 record. He was named the NHL's Rookie of the Month in December 2016. On January 6, 2016, it was announced that Gibson was selected to his first All-Star Game. Gibson started the started the first round playoff series with the Nashville Predators, but lost the first two games. Andersen replaced him, but it was not enough and Anaheim was eliminated. Andersen and Gibson combined to win the 2016 William M. Jennings Trophy for the lowest goals scored against. Gibson was also named to the NHL's 2016 All-Rookie Team. However, that offseason, the Ducks traded Andersen to the Toronto Maple Leafs and made Gibson the undisputed starter. The Ducks made the playoffs at the end of the 2016–17 season, however, they were swept by the San Jose Sharks in the first round. \nOn August 4, 2018, the Ducks re-signed Gibson to an eight-year, $51.2 million contract extension worth $6.4 million annually. He made his second All-Star appearance at the 2019 NHL All-Star Game. Gibson appeared in 46 games (45 starts) going 17–19–8 before being injured in a collision with teammate Jaycob Megna during a 4–0 loss to the Ottawa Senators on February 7, 2019. On February 13, 2019, Gibson was placed on injured reserve by the Ducks, due to head, back, and neck injuries obtained from a collision Megna. He returned to the lineup on March 1 in a 3–0 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights, making 32 saves on 34 shots. The 2019–20 season marked Gibson's fifth straight 20-win season. During the 2020–21 season marked a downturn in Gibson's performance for the first time, with only a .904 save percentage and a 3.00 goals against average.\nGibson began the 2021–22 season as the team's starter, backed up by Anthony Stolarz and Lukáš Dostál. He began the season demanding a turnaround in the team's play. He was named to the 2022 NHL All-Star Game representing the Ducks for the third time. The Ducks were in the playoff race until the All-Star Game, which they followed up with a losing skid and never got back in. They ended up missing the playoffs. This was reflected in Gibson's play, which saw him struggle following the All-Star Game. During the 2022–23 season, Gibson again played on a struggling Ducks team, leading or among the leaders in saves during the majority of the season. On March 10, 2023, Gibson set a new franchise record for career saves with the team, surpassing Guy Hebert's mark of 11,813 in a 3–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. The Ducks failed to make the postseason for the fifth straight year.\nInternational play.\nGibson represented Team North America at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey."

        "title": "1946–47 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1946–47 Ashes series consisted of five cricket Test matches, each of six days with five hours play each day and eight ball overs. Unlike pre-war Tests in Australia, matches were not timeless and played to a finish. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1946–47 and England played its matches outside the Tests in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. The England team was led by the veteran Wally Hammond and his vice-captain Norman Yardley with the strong batting line up of Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton and Joe Hardstaff, but a weak bowling attack that relied on pre-war bowlers like the 37-year-old Bill Voce of Bodyline fame and the mercurial leg-spinner Doug Wright. The two successes of the tour were the newly capped Alec Bedser, who would carry the England bowling attack until 1955, and Godfrey Evans who would be England's first choice wicketkeeper until 1959. England had drawn the Victory Tests 2–2 in 1945 and were thought to be equal in strength, but Hammond lost 3–0 to Don Bradman's Australian team which had only two other pre-war players – Lindsay Hassett and Sid Barnes, who had played 5 Tests between them – and was packed with fresh talent in the shape of Arthur Morris, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ernie Toshack and Don Tallon. There were several controversial umpiring decisions which assumed greater significance as they favoured Australia and in particular Don Bradman.\n\"Few seasons have created so much advance interest as 1946–47\", a tour had been planned for 1940–41, but this was cancelled due to the Second World War. The Australian Board of Control asked for a rapid resumption of Test cricket to revive the sport in Australia, which had not hosted a Test match since 1937. Their case was made in person by the Attorney-General of Australia Dr. H.V. Evatt and the Marylebone Cricket Club reluctantly agreed as it wanted to re-establish cricketing relations and needed money to rebuild cricket in post-war Britain. The MCC asked Hammond to lead a \"Goodwill Tour\" and he was told that good sportsmanship was more important than winning the series, which could be seriously contested later in the 1948 Ashes series. As a result, he looked on the tour as an extended holiday, a view not shared by Don Bradman, who was determined to win, and this led to a strained relationship between the two captains. The tour itself was a great success as crowds flocked to see the matches – more than in any series in Australia since – and it made a record £50,000 profit for the MCC.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\nPreliminaries.\nCause of the dead Brisbane wicket when Australia batted was the drought which had been suffered in Queensland for such a long period...People who were praying for water were among those to give the tourists a tremendous Brisbane welcome. Rain had fallen in every match in which the Englishmen had played and the record was maintained until the end of the tour, and the Test storm at Brisbane, the second of the match, was the worst I have ever witnessed.\nDue to the war this was the first Test to be played in Australia since 3 March 1937 and there were eight Australian debutants; Ian Johnson, Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Keith Miller, Arthur Morris, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and George Tribe. However, Johnson, Lindwall, McCool, Miller, Tallon and Toshack had played in an Australia vs New Zealand match the previous season which was belatedly recognised as a Test, the only game between the two countries treated as such before 1973. As a result, only Morris and Tribe are now seen as debutants with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett having played only four Tests before the war and Sid Barnes one. Don Bradman made himself available for selection at the last moment against the advice of his doctor due to the severe attack of fibrositis during the war, an ailment from which the England captain Wally Hammond also suffered. There were no English debutants; Hammond, Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Paul Gibb, Bill Voce and Doug Wright were all pre-war players, vice-captain Norman Yardley had played one Test before the war and Alec Bedser and Jack Ikin had debuted against India in 1946. The vaunted England batting line up had done well so far on the tour, with Hutton making 522 runs (87.00), Washbrook 461 runs (51.22), Edrich 221 runs (44.20), Compton 423 runs (60.43) and Hammond 277 runs (55.40), but their bowling had been weakened by injuries. Gibbs was preferred as wicketkeeper over Godfrey Evans because of his batting form in South Africa in 1938–39. There had been a drought in Queensland since 1941 and the curator had tried boring for water without success. The Woolloongabba wicket, traditionally green and helpful to fast bowlers, was a dry, lifeless brown and good for runs. Bradman won the toss and had no difficulty in choosing to bat first.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nBradman had only made 28, when he played Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it high in the air in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting watching from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.\nThe innings began well for England as Wally Hammond caught Arthur Morris in the slips and Alec Bedser had Don Bradman struggling in his third over, the Australian captain twice edging the ball to the close fielders. He was protected by Sid Barnes who controlled the strike and hooked the England bowlers until \"Big Al\" jumped up like a goalkeeper, knocked up the ball and took the catch on the rebound. Barnes (31) was officially reprimanded for using the hook and eliminated this stroke from his repertoire for the rest of the series. At 72/2 Bradman was still struggling on 28 after an hour at the crease when he gave his famous catch to Jack Ikin off Bill Voce. The England players were so sure it was out (along with half the Australian team in the dressing room) that they did not immediately appeal and did so only after Bradman refused to walk. In a controversial umpiring decision Umpire Borwick gave him not out and Bradman later said he thought he had jammed the ball into the ground before it went to Ikin and that he was willing to let the umpire be the judge. Hammond was furious at what he saw as gamesmanship that only spoke to the Australian captain when calling the toss for the rest of the series. After this incident Bradman recovered his confidence and with Bedser off the field due to a stomach ailment (a legacy of his service in Italy) made 159 runs in 160 minutes. His vice-captain Lindsay Hassett dug himself in for 128 and they added 274 for the third wicket. Hassett's brother was getting married that day and agreed to wait until he was out before they began the service. They gave up when he was 97 and he was still on 98 when they finished. Bradman was bowled by Bill Edrich (3/107) early on the second day and Hassett added another 106 runs with his fellow-Victorian Keith Miller who hit 6 fours and a six in his 79. Hassett also hit a six, but was dropped three times before he was caught by Norman Yardley off Bedser (2/159). The English leg-spinner Doug Wright (5/167) had Miller lbw, but the wicketkeeper Paul Gibb dropped Colin McCool off Bedser for 1 and McCool (95) and Ian Johnson (47) took the score to 595/5 by the end of the second day. Most of the third day was lost to heavy rain and bad light. When play resumed it was thought that Australia would declare, but Bradman gave 'a crooked little smile...\"I remember when England made 900 against us and kept us in the field for three days\"' and 10 minutes before play he told Hammond that he was going to bat on. \"Bradman adopted his grim Napoleonic pose, as if the fate of his country rested on the retention of 'the Ashes'\" and as the batting captain told the ground staff not to cut the grass on the pitch and had a three-ton roller pulled over the wicket to draw up the moisture. Australia would not be batting for long and this increased the pace of the wicket for his fast bowlers, but a former Australian player called it \"kicking a beaten opponent when he is down\". The last 5 Australian wickets fell for 50 runs, mostly from Ray Lindwall who hit 3 fours and 2 sixes in his 31. Australia's 645 was their highest total at home, overtaking the 604 made in their previous home Test at Melbourne in 1936–37.\nEngland – First Innings.\n... hailstones fell the size of golf-balls, and the trim field was swiftly reduced to a lake whereon floated the stumps. What was equally extraordinary was the strength of the tropical Queensland sun which next morning sucked away the moisture, so against all prediction, and thanks also to the sandy soil perfect for drainage, play was possible sharp at time. I recall broadcasting home from the ground... describing the scene of desolation with part of the playing arena still under a foot of water... English listeners who had gone to bed with this comforting information had to be told when they woke up next morning that fifteen English wickets had fallen and the game was over.\nLen Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went out to bat with thunder in the air and Hutton never settled down to the short-pitched bowling of Lindwall and Miller and was bowled for 7 in \"a real shock attack...Miller's success was gained by one ball of perfection mixed with many of faulty direction which had England's record holder twisting and turning in a most unbatsmanlike fashion\". Soon after Bill Edrich came out play was stopped for bad light as a thunderstorm broke over the ground. Play resumed only 10 minutes late the next day, but \"England were twice caught on sticky wickets. They stood no chance. On a typical Brisbane sticky the good length ball and the half-volley became almost unplayable. Sometimes it rose chest high. At others it skidded along the ground.\" In their \"opening blitz\" Keith Miller dug the ball in short and \"nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high\". \"Edrich batted for 105 minutes. He suffered more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller\". He was out for 16, but Alan Kippax said it was \"one of the best knocks he had ever witnessed\" and worthy of a century. Wally Hammond had made his finest innings just such a wicket at Melbourne in 1936–37 while making 32 and here made the same number of runs, which Arthur Morris called it \"the most thorough batting lesson he had ever received\" Ray Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich \"were hit on the body repeatedly. Their concentration never faltered and their skill never waned...This was vintage batting of a kind that probably no Australian could produce\". Miller used a limited leg-trap and an English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Miller slowed his pace as the ball leapt so much that it could hit the batsman, but not get them out and dismissed all five batsman that day, his 7/60 in the innings remaining his best return for Australia for the rest of his career. Only three hours play were allowed that day and just after Hammond and Yardley walked off after appealing for light a second thunderstorm hit Brisbane. \"Those who huddled in the pavilion...will never forget (as will the residents of Brisbane, who lost thousands of planes of glass) the darkness that came over the ground and the roar of the storm coming in the distance. This was the day when jagged pieces of hail, as big as cricket balls, plummeted on the ground, and the covers and the stumps went swirling away in the flood\". In 30 minutes the ground was a lake with the water almost reaching the height of the picket fence on the boundary. At any other venue the game would have ended, but the drought-stricken ground soaked up most of the water overnight, the Queensland sun soon dried out the ground and play began on time at noon, much to the surprise to some pressmen and players who arrived late. Ernie Toshack's left-arm medium pace should have won him a hatful of wickets the previous day, but he could not bowl as Bradman suggested. So, before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him exactly where he wanted him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Resuming on 117/5 Hammond and Yardley were both out to Toshack (3/17), the Yorkshire vice-captain after a gritty innings of 29 over two hours, and Miller wrapped up the tail to have England out for 141.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nBradman made England follow on 504 runs behind, Hutton was caught by Sid Barnes off Miller's first ball, Washbrook was out the same way and Ernie Toshack had Edrich lbw to leave them 32/3. Only Denis Compton (15) stayed in for over an hour and eight batsmen got into double figures. Wally Hammond hit Toshack for two sixes and played so well on the sticky pitch that the Australians thought he was \"bound to make many runs in the series, but from that moment nothing went right for him\". Under Bradman's guidance Toshack took 6/82, Miller missed out on a 10 wicket haul with 2/17 and George Tribe took his best Test figures of 2/48. Ray Lindwall was taken to hospital with suspected malaria from his service in the Solomon Islands, but was found to be chickenpox which caused more concern as he may have infected the rest of the team. Lindwall was replaced by twelfth man Ken Meuleman, Colin McCool bowled only one over in the match and Ian Johnson was not used at all. The only real stand was that of 47 between Jack Ikin (32) and Paul Gibb (11) as England were out for 172 having lost 15 wickets in hours.\nResult.\nThe First Test at Brisbane taught the Englishmen many things and on the second day one English player summed up those thoughts. He said to me – \"We are the first Ambassadors ever embroiled in a war while on a goodwill mission.\" And war it was, even though it was waged on only one side.\nAustralia won the First Test by an innings and 332 runs to take a 1–0 lead in the series. It was their first victory over England at Brisbane and was their largest victory in Tests, overtaking their previous best of an innings and 200 runs in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1936–37, their last match against England in Australia. This remained a record until Australia beat South Africa by an innings and 360 runs at Johannesburg in 2001–02, but it remains their greatest victory in Australia and against England. Ironically in their previous Test against England in 1938 Australia lost by an innings and 579 runs, the largest margin of victory in Tests. It was the first time that two sides had won and lost by an innings in successive Tests. Australia's 645 was their highest total at home, beating the 604 they made in the Fifth Test of 1936–37. The win was regarded as a lottery as torrential rain ruined the wicket as England started to bat, but in Brisbane it was ever thus. On Bradman's Test debut in 1928–29 Australia was caught batting after a rainstorm and were out for 66. They lost by a record 675 runs and Bradman was dropped for the only time in his career. In 1936–37 Australia was caught again on a rain-affected wicket and were out for 58, Bradman made a duck and lost his first Test as captain by 322 runs. In the next Test between Australia and England at the Gabba in 1950–51 20 wickets fell in an afternoon after another rainstorm. 77,344 attended the match with receipts of £14,515.\nSecond Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nFrom the batsman's viewpoint it looked perfect. It was a rusty brown, but seemed to hold a thousand runs, and both Hammond and Bradman were enthusiastic in their keenness to win the toss. When the England skipper called correctly he smiled with confident pleasure... Imagine Hammond's surprise when before an hour had passed the wicket, which looked so docile, was in fact a dangerous spin-taking nightmare.\nArriving in Sydney England tried to put the disastrous Brisbane Test behind them. The wicketkeeper-batsman Paul Gibb was dropped in favour of Godfrey Evans, who was to hold the position for 13 years and who did not concede a bye in the Test. Bill Voce had pulled a muscle and the off-spinner Peter Smith was brought into the team for the traditional spinning wicket at the SCG, but already had a numb spinning finger from an injury on the ship that brought the team to Australia. Ray Lindwall was still ill with chickenpox and was replaced by the tidy fast-medium bowler Fred Freer of Victoria. The pitch looked perfect, Wally Hammond called correctly and chose to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\nThe game was all but decided in an evil hour Hutton, Compton and Hammond himself – the flower of England's batting – went one by one to the high, slow, teasing spin of Colin McCool and Ian Johnson, each giving the ball more and more air as though trying to discover whether there was any parabola they could not describe without impelling the forward step that would have allowed the ball to be met on the full-pitch or the half-volley.\nFred Freer (1/25) began his Test career by bowling Cyril Washbrook for 1, but though he kept his line and length Keith Miller was wild and they and Toshack only bowled 23 overs in the innings. The spinners bowled 73 overs as the pitch took spin on the first day, against all expectation. Len Hutton (30) and Bill Edrich (71) added 78 for the second wicket before Ian Johnson removed him with his third ball in Tests, caught behind down the leg side. Don Tallon promptly took two more catches off Colin McCool (3/73) to dismiss Hammond and Compton and England were 99/4. Bradman had pulled a thigh muscle in the First Test and was granted permission by Hammond to retire from play, Ken Meuleman taking his place and Hassett taking command. Johnson had not bowled in the First Test, but now had a spell of 11–8–3–1 as the England batsmen remained glued to the wicket. Hammond had previously told Compton to stop 'capering about' the wicket and \"The oracle was listened to with great respect, and his dictum was largely taken up by those who followed him in the England XIs\". Jack Ikin, whose usually played within the crease anyway made a gritty 60 and added 49 with the fighting Edrich. Thereafter wickets fell steadily to Johnson who ended with 6/42 as England was spun out for 255.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nWe could have played on, but it was a Test match and we just had to win. I realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, in an effort to get the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.\nThe situation was not yet lost, England had at least played on the spinning wicket first and it could only get worse for Australia. Doug Wright was the terror of the County Championship for running through side on just such wickets and Hammond also had Peter Smith and the part-time spin of Ikin, Compton and Hutton. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris only batted for 9 minutes when the rain came down and the teams left the field. On their return Bill Edrich (3/71) made the ball kick up with his fast bowling, and Morris was bowled while taking evasive action. Ian Johnson came in as a nightwatchman and he and Barnes angered the crowd by launching into a series of bad light appeals – up to 12 were counted – before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare. This gamesmanship ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket like England at Brisbane and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled \"biased, unsportsmanlike squealers\" and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never use such underhand tactics, but at the end of the series Barnes admitted on radio that he had bluffed the umpires into the decision. Sunday was a rest day and the sun dried out the wicket beautifully, it rolled to perfection and produced the flat wicket anticipated on the first day. Barnes had been reprimanded for hooking the ball in the First Test and as a result denied himself strokeplay and slowly ground his way through the day. Johnson was out for 7, and Barnes added 59 with Lindsay Hassett (34) and 63 with Keith Miller (40). Alec Bedser (1/153) bowled well and stopped the runs from getting away, but with defensive fields many catches went begging, but Peter Smith (2/172) failed to find his form (he was hospitalised with appendicitis on the tour). Don Bradman had lowered himself down the order and \"limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill\" Wright (1/169) \"bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck\", in one over \"On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw his hands in the air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket. When Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Jack Ikin at short leg, but \"this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way\". Bradman was given not out and by the end of the day Barnes was 109, Bradman 52 and Australia 252/4. On the Tuesday Bradman gave \"an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs – that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter\". Forced to play off the back foot due to his pulled leg muscle Bradman still looked like he had three strokes for every one of Barnes and by the end of the day had caught him up in runs. During this long partnership Len Hutton joked with the crowd on the boundary and ate 14 bananas given to him from the Hill. In desperation Hammond called on his vice-captain Norman Yardley to bowl his medium pacers, which he did not even do for Yorkshire, and to everyone's surprise he caught Bradman lbw for 234. It was only the second time Bradman had been lbw in a Test against England, the first being to Maurice Tate on his debut in 1928. He had added 405 for the fifth wicket with Barnes, and in 1946 this was the highest partnership for that wicket in Test or first-class cricket and the second highest Test partnership after the 451 Bradman-Ponsford partnership at the Oval in 1934. In the next over Barnes hit Bedser to Ikin also for 234, his maiden Test century and the highest score of his career. He said later that he had got himself out so as to have the same score as Bradman \"which could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament\". However, Alec Bedser wrote \"It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes\". Australia ended the fourth day on 571/6. The next morning the lower order struck out, with Fred Freer hitting 3 fours and a six in his 28 not out and George Tribe 5 fours in his 25 not out until Bradman declared on 659/8.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nThose who were lucky enough to see this remarkable display must have grieved with me that such a superlative innings was nipped off in its golden prime. He began by clipping the short stuff so hard that even if Australia had had 15 fieldsmen, the fours would still have come. Never have I seen a Test opening attack hit so hard.\nLen Hutton and Cyril Washbrook walked out 404 runs behind on the first innings and England needing to bat out five sessions and 24 minutes to save the game. Hutton survived an lbw appeal from Fred Freer on his first ball, then hit 12 runs off the rest of the over. In the absence of Ray Lindwall the fast bowler Keith Miller \"bumped the ball with more fury and recklessness than anyone in years\" and even appealed for lbw when Hutton ducked and the ball hit his back, but his first over went for 11 more runs. Freer's second over gave another 9 and Miller's second over 15, but on the last ball before lunch Hutton's glove strap was caught on his bat and he overbalanced and trod on the wicket. He had made 37 runs in 24 minutes of \"batting champagne\" which \"was the talk of Sydney for the rest of the match\" receiving \"four times as much publicity as the huge totals of 234\", Johnnie Moyes called it \"a glorious piece of batting, a choice miniature that I shall carry with me always\" Bill Edrich came in and another 69 runs were added before Washbrook was out for 40. Denis Compton found his form and the 'Middlesex Twins' put on 102 for the third wicket. Compton was caught by Bradman off Freer (2/49) for 54, but Hammond came in to see out the day with England 247/3, still 157 runs behind with five hours of play left. When Edrich \"reached his century he was accorded one of the most sustained ovations I have heard, and no one deserved it more...the roar when he reached it was it the Heavens had split\". Hammond made 37, his highest score of the series before he was caught by Don Tallon off Colin McCool (5/109) and Edrich continued resolutely until bowled by McCool for 119 in 5 hours, top-scoring in both innings and returning the best English bowling analysis of the match. Norman Yardley hit 4 fours in his 35 before he too was bowled by McCool and the last four wickets fell for 25 runs to have England out for 371 with more than two hours before stumps.\nResult.\nAustralia won the Second Test by an innings and 33 runs to go 2–0 up in the series. It was the first time they had defeated England in successive Tests by an innings since Andrew Stoddart's tour of 1897–98. It was the third Test in a row that Australia had made its highest home score; 604 in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1936–37, 645 in the First Test and 659/8 in the Second Test in the current series. The match had an attendance of 196,253 and £26,544 was made in receipts.\nThird Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nWith two defeats Wally Hammond would have to win the last three Tests to regain the Ashes, though Don Bradman had done this in the last series in Australia. The Melbourne wicket had a reputation for fast, pacey wickets, but after two shocks at Brisbane and Sydney few were surprised that it was not living up to its reputation; \"The 1947 wicket was not as tame as all that, but it was, for Melbourne, exceedingly meek\". Ray Lindwall was fit again and resigned his job when his employers refused him leave to play in the Test. Fred Freer was dropped and the slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler George Tribe was replaced by the leg-spinner Bruce Dooland. Arthur Morris had failed in the two Tests, but was given another chance instead of Ken Meuleman. Peter Smith was ill with appendicitis and James Langridge had strained a muscle in catching practice the day before the match, so Hammond had no spinner apart from Doug Wright and the 37-year-old fast bowler Bill Voce was recalled. Don Bradman won the toss and chose to bat on New Year's Day.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nNorman Yardley was bowling to me and, on a perfect pitch, he had been unable to make a single ball do anything. When Ian Johnson came in I told him the ball was not turning an inch. He plunged his left leg down the wicket, missed and was l.b.w. first ball. It had turned nearly a foot!\nArthur Morris was the first man out for 21, lbw to Alec Bedser (3/99), but Sid Barnes hooked a ball into Bill Edrich's knee at short leg and Hammond insisted that he leave the field for treatment. Barnes (45) added 76 with Bradman before he went the same way as Morris for and Hammond took Lindsay Hassett off Doug Wright for 12. Bill Voce left the field with a strained leg muscle after lunch and Bradman looked set for a big score until he chopped Norman Yardley (2/50) onto his stumps for 79. Yardley, scarcely a change bowler before the tour was only given a bowl because of the injuries, but bowled tidily and moved the ball. Ian Johnson was out lbw first ball and Australia were 188/5 on a good pitch, soon 192/6 when Godfrey Evans snapped up Keith Miller (33) off Wright. Australia's all-round strength came to their rescue as Colin McCool played the innings of his life, 104 not out, adding 63 with Don Tallon (35) and leaving Australia 253/6 at the end of the day. Edrich returned to the fray in the first over of the second day and had Tallon caught behind in the first over, but Bruce Dooland (19) \"defended steadily while McCool punished the bowling unmercifully. Hooking and driving with absolute confidence\". as they added 83. In the end Edrich (3/50) removed Dooland and Toshack to leave McCool 104 not out and Australia were out for 365\nEngland – First Innings.\nEdrich should have gather in another hundred in the following Test at Melbourne. He was 89, and batting with audacious unconcern, when Scott gave him out leg before to a ball from Lindwall which even some Australian fieldsmen believed had come from the bat. It was one of the hotly discussed decisions of the tour, and while Edrich was distressed and disappointed he was still able to grin as he walked from the field.\nRay Lindwall returned to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton with a beautiful swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick the edge of his bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 by the end of the second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he returned to the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a chance that they could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nI don't think Bradman appreciated being dismissed by a man who was not considered anywhere approaching county class. It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team-mate slapped him on the back and shouted \"Well, bowled, Spofforth\".\nBill Voce was still unable to bowl and Bill Edrich opened the bowling. Sid Barnes appealed against the light, which was rejected, and he and Arthur Morris were 32/0 at the end of the third day. They took their stand to 68 when Barnes was caught by Godfrey Evans off Norman Yardley (3/67). The Yorkshireman kept up his reputation as a wicket-taker by dismissing Don Bradman (49) for the third successive time and Keith Miller (34). Yardley usually obtained his wickets in partnership with Alec Bedser (3/176) or Doug Wright (3/131), who bowled so well that batsmen felt they had to hit out at the other end. However Morris batted through the day for his maiden Test century of 155 adding 91 with Bradman, 65 with Miller and 91 with McCool (43) before he was bowled by Bedser. Bedser also accounted for McCool and Ian Johnson was run out for a duck and Australia were 341/7. At this point the game ran away from England as Don Tallon (92) and Ray Lindwall (100) thumped the ball for 154 runs in 99 minutes. Wally Hammond kept the slips in place and Tallon hit 10 fours through the gaps, Lindwall 13 fours and a 6 as the England captain \"sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him, just 'letting the game go on'\". When Wright finally caught and bowled Tallon Australia were 495/8 and Lindwall just reached his maiden Test century off 90 balls – by hitting Bedser into the sightscreen – before Dooland and Toshack fell. Tallon's 92 remained the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh equalled it with 92 not out in the 1970-71 Ashes series and surpassed it with 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74. Australia made 536 and England needed 551 runs to win, or to bat out 7 hours for a draw.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n...it was in this match that the Englishmen publicly rebuked Barnes for his false, senseless but successful light appeals at Sydney. In the final thirty minutes at Melbourne, Yardley, first with Bedser and then Evans, batted on, making no objection, even though the light was atrocious and rain was falling heavily. As England had lost seven wickets and had every chance of losing and none of winning it was a risky policy, but one in keeping with the manner in which Hammond played all the Tests, which to him were only sporting contests of goodwill.\nLen Hutton survived another \"opening blitz\" from Lindwall and Miller and was the silent partner in a stand of 138 with Cyril Washbrook. They took England to 91/0 at the start of the sixth and last day and had added 137 when Hutton was caught by Bradman off Ernie Toshack after batting almost three hours for 40 runs. Washbrook held the innings together with his 112, bringing all \"his concentration to bear he revealed a variety of shots that were a delight to watch, combined with a defence which could as dour as if he had been playing in a blood match against Yorkshire and not merely a Test in Australia\". But wickets fell regularly at the other end and at 247/6 England were looking at defeat. With 53 runs in 89 minutes Norman Yardley dug himself in with Wally Hammond, 26 runs in 77 minutes, Alec Bedser, 25 runs in 49 minutes, and Godfrey Evans 0 runs in 15 minutes. The rain helped, but only 45 minutes were lost in the day due to the umpires as the English batsmen refused to appeal for light on the orders of Hammond even though Bradman twice suggested that they come off the field. Bill O'Reilly said \"I could not understand why the English batsman seemed loath to appeal against the weather, even when the rain was coming down solidly. There are no praises for gallant gestures in Tests matches\". In the end England survived the match on 310/7 with Yardley and Evans still at the crease.\nResult.\nA final memory of Melbourne 1947 is the generosity of the crowd towards Hammond's team. The English press had come under attack for certain loud assertions about umpiring mistakes...but this unpopularity had not rubbed off on the players.\nAustralia drew with England to maintain their 2–0 series lead and retain the Ashes. It was the third time that a Test match had been drawn in Australia, the previous two were the fifth and eight Tests ever to be played during Alfred Shaw's tour of 1881–82, the last Tests played before the Ashes were inaugurated. 1,562 runs were scored in the Test, only the seventh time in 146 Tests that 1,500 runs had been scored in Anglo-Australian Tests, the last being the 1,601 runs made in four days in the Lords Test of 1930. By taking 2/50 and 3/67 and making 61 and 53 not out Norman Yardley established himself as a Test all-rounder and by dismissing Bradman in each innings he prevented the Don from making a century against England at the MCG for the only time in his career. 343,675 attended the match – second only to the 350,534 at the Third Test at MCG in 1936–37 – with record receipts of £44,063.\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\nPreliminaries.\nAlec remembers one occasion in Adelaide in 1947 when he had to bowl for most of one day in 102-degree heat. After his last over, he was completely befuddled and had to be led from the ground by his team mates. Not knowing where he was, he stumbled up the steps through the Father and Son Enclosure, past the Press Box and into the England dressing room. There the team physiotherapist took him into the showers, sat him down on a wooden chair, clothed and still wearing his boots, and turned on the cold tap. It took almost three quarters of an hour for the big Surrey bowler to come round from his heat exhaustion!\nAfter the Third Test the MCC team toured Tasmania and Clif Cary of the \"Sunday Express\" wrote that \"Social successes are one of the causes of their cricket failure...There are tourists who do not give the impression that cricket is their main consideration\". This was thought to be aimed at Denis Compton and one Australian Test cricketer told Cary \"It will make Compton and others will pull up their socks, and we might never get them out at Adelaide.\" There were also calls for Wally Hammond to resign the captaincy in favour of Norman Yardley, but these were silenced when he made 188 against South Australia, his 167th – and last – first class century. He became the seventh man to make 50,000 first class runs after W.G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Phil Mead, Frank Woolley, Patsy Hendren and Herbert Sutcliffe and \"for some time afterwards he was kept busy answering congratulatory letters, telegrams, and cables from admirers in all parts of the world\". The Adelaide Oval had been \"Bradman's Front Lawn\" since he had moved to South Australia in 1935 and \"if ever a Test wicket was laid down to kill it was that 22 yards long graveyard of a spin bowler's hope. It was as dead and lifeless as Mussolini and at the end of the sixth, and final day, was playing as truly as when the match began\". Bill Voce was dropped in favour of the batsman Joe Hardstaff, so England went into the match with only two specialist bowlers – Alec Bedser and Doug Wright. Sid Barnes was ill and was replaced by the Victorian strokemaker Merv Harvey who was promoted into the opening slot. The Test was played in \"stifling, almost insufferable heat\" with temperatures rising up to 105 °F (40.5 °C) and a brief shower only served to help bind the wicket when it might have started to break. Hammond won the toss and chose to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\n...it was grand to see him in the afternoon and early evening gradually get atop of Australia's persevering and skilful attack, and finally dominate it completely with all manner of lovely strokes to the extent of a run a minute off his own bat...Compton's innings, judged from every angle, stands with Bradman's as Sydney as the best played in this series so far.\nThe fast bowling of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller was seen off by England's opening partnership as Len Hutton (94) and Cyril Washbrook (65) made another century stand; 137 runs in 178 minutes. Bradman declined to take the new ball when 200 runs were made (as was the custom in those days) and was rewarded when Bruce Dooland (3/133) removed Washbrook and Edrich and Colin McCool caught Hutton lbw. Wally Hammond was in so much pain from fibrositis that he took 12 aspirin before he went out to bat and was bowled by Ernie Toshack for 18 to leave England 202/4. Denis Compton (147) stroked his way to 147, adding 118 with Joe Hardstaff (67), 61 with Jack Ikin (21) and 74 with Norman Yardley (18 not out). It was his third first-class century in a row and \"It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a baseball bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get the benefit of the doubt on a stumping appeal\". Lindwall thought he should have been stumped before he reached his century, \"but I could well understand the umpire's explanation...that the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease\". In any case Lindwall quickly ended the innings with the new ball, he caught and bowled Compton to have England 455/7. In the next over he sent Alec Bedser's off-stump cart-wheeling back to the wicketkeeper, then bowled Godfrey Evans first ball, shaved Doug Wright's stumps before bowling him second ball – 3 wickets in 4 balls to end the innings for 460. This was the nearest that Lindwall ever got to a hat-trick.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nI was dining that Saturday evening chez Bradman, and with Jessie Bradman and her son John was escaping the rush by leaving an over before the close. We were underneath the stand when there was a tremendous uproar from above. 'That'll be Dad' said John, and he was right. It was. Bradman, b. Bedser 0.\nAustralia had 30 minutes to bat until stumps, but Merv Harvey was out for 12 runs off 15 balls and Bradman came to the wicket. In the Second Test at Sydney Alec Bedser had caught Sid Barnes with an in-swinging leg-break and had developed this delivery, soon known as Bedser's \"Special Ball\" and clean-bowled Bradman for a duck. Bradman wrote \"The ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps\". He returned to the Australian dressing room telling the waiting batsmen that it had been an unplayable ball. Keith Miller thought he was making excuses for being out for a duck and that \"He did no service to those who still had to face Alec\", but Bradman maintained that it had been good enough to bowl him if he had been on 300. Australia began the third day on 24/2, but soon made a complete recovery from their bad start. Doug Wright (3/152) had trouble with his no balls due to his odd run up \"He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps.\" As a result, Bedser (3/97) was called on to bowl virtually all day until he could barely stand from heat exhaustion. Bill Edrich (0/88) had opened the bowling, but could make no impression on the dull pitch and Norman Yardley (3/101) was called upon to bowl 31 overs. Morris made 122 with 12 fours and 2 sixes, adding 189 with Lindsay Hassett (78). Keith Miller hit his maiden Test century; 141 not out in hours with 9 fours and a six, adding 150 with Ian Johnson (52), 27 with Lindwall (20) and 63 with Dooland (29). Toshack was brilliantly run out by Edrich for a duck and Australia were out for 487, a lead of 27 on the first innings.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nHis unbroken partnership of 85 with Compton at Adelaide revealed admirable fighting qualities, and cricket intelligence. He made only five scoring shots, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, in his stay of 133 minutes, and he was at the wickets 95 minutes before he opened his account. Mainly he was watching his partner take charge of the game, but of the 276 balls sent down during their time together Evans took 97 of them, and not only helped to save the team from certain defeat, but also enabled Compton to join the select band who have compiled a century in each innings of a Test.\nThough delayed by 23 minutes by a short thunderstorm and bounced by Lindwall and Miller Len Hutton (76) and Cyril Washbrook (30) made their third century stand – exactly 100 – to match the record of Hobbs and Sutcliffe in 1924–25. They looked set to make more, but Washbrook was given out to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground off Lindwall (2/60). Washbrook \"stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement\". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing – \"he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision\", This caused another umpiring controversy, but Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote \"the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley\". Washbrook told Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground and the England captain tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC. Bill Edrich made a solid 46, but wickets fell regularly to Ernie Toshack (4/76). Hammond with his last stroke in Australia hit the ball for a certain four until it was superbly taken by Lindwall, \"Every time he missed or edged the ball he was out\". England were 255/8 when Godfrey Evans joined Denis Compton, only 228 runs ahead and it was essential that they stayed together. Evans, who usually tried to run cheeky singles off almost every ball, spent a record 95 minutes before making a run. Bradman was ready to accept a second draw to ensure that he won the series, set defensive fields, wasted time and \"set his side a frightful example by taking minutes almost, to walk lazily after the ball and field it\". Clif Cary thought this was his only mistake of the series, as he could have bought the last two wickets for 40–50 runs with a day and a half to make the runs on a perfect pitch. Compton made his second century of the match at the other end and they added 85 for the ninth wicket, but Tallon missed a stumping off Evans on 282/8 and Lindwall thought Compton should have been stumped before he reached three figures. His hundred was hit off the last ball before lunch, but Hammond waited until the first ball after lunch before declaring at 340/8. This decision was much discussed and was thought to be unique, but the West Indies captain Jackie Grant had done this against England at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad in 1934–35. It wasted 10 minutes as the teams changed sides.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nArthur Morris set himself up as a No. 1 for Australia for a while to come...Arthur at his best looked out of the top draw, a left-hander with all the strokes, and only one (much publicized) weakness against certain bowling and in particular against Bedser's... Yet his record speaks for itself, and what the figures do not say is that few more charming men have played for Australia, and I cannot name one who was more popular with his opponents.\nHammond had left the Australians 3 hours to make 314 runs to win, not impossible as they had some excellent strokemakers in their team. Merv Harvey made no attempt to get the runs and spent 100 minutes making 31, keeping Arthur Morris company in an opening stand of 116 until he was bowled by Yardley. Bradman could have sent Keith Miller in at number 3, both to make quick runs and so that he could avoid a pair of ducks, but he came out himself. He struggled for 20 minutes against Alec Bedser to get off the mark when Umpire Scott called the Surrey bowler for a no ball and the Don got off the mark. Bradman made 56 not out and added 99 with Morris who completed his third successive Test century of 124 not out. Australia finished the day on 214/1 and the game was a draw.\nResult.\nAustralia drew the Fourth Test with England to win the series. Denis Compton (147 and 103 not out) and Arthur Morris (122 and 124 not out) became the seventh and eight batsmen to make a pair of centuries in a Test after Warren Bardsley, Jack Russell, Herbert Sutcliffe (twice), Wally Hammond, George Headley (twice) and Eddie Paynter. It was the first time that two batsmen achieved this feat in the same Test, to be repeated by Ian and Greg Chappell against New Zealand in 1973–74. In honour of the event they were presented with silver watches by the South Australian Cricket Association, as was Ray Lindwall for his 3 wickets in 4 balls. 1,502 runs were scored in the Test, the eighth time 1,500 runs had been scored in an Anglo-Australian Test. The full attendance was 135,980 and receipts of £18,117.\nFifth Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nThe general positioning of the field and the blocking of the batsmen's known strokes was admirable, and his placing was responsible for at least three of the catches made. He certainly has the knack of keeping his men equable and happy. If there were just a little more punch or bite in his make-up one could regard Yardley as a thoroughly satisfactory England captain of the near future.\nThe MCC played New South Wales immediately before the Fifth Test and it rained, as in every other match on their tour. The ground staff ran on to cover the MCC-NSW wicket and left the Test wicket under the rain. As a result, it was over-watered and while not dangerous it favoured the bowlers and produced the best cricket of the series. Len Hutton was sent to hospital after being hit on the chin by a Ginty Lush bouncer in that match, but returned to make 40 and 74. Jack Fingleton called on Lindwall and Miller to not subject him to another fast bowling barrage, which could damage his weakened left arm and end his career. Wally Hammond had a crippling attack of fibrositis the day before the Test and was unable to turn without pain and reluctantly withdrew in favour of Norman Yardley. He remained in the dressing room and gave advice, but there was an improvement in the way England played on the field. Joe Hardstaff was also unfit and they were replaced by the popular Surrey opener Laurie Fishlock and the off-spinner Peter Smith, who had just taken a record 9/121 at the SCG. Sid Barnes returned to the Australian team after his illness and Merv Harvey was dropped, the batsman Ron Hamence replaced the injured Ian Johnson and George Tribe was preferred to Bruce Dooland. Yardley won the toss and chose to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\nI must say when I bowled at Len I felt a sense of personal grudge I have never known against any other batsman. Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world. We both put in that little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.\nAfter a good length ball from Ray Lindwall removed Cyril Washbrook's stumps Len Hutton and Bill Edrich weathered the fast bowling and added 150 for the second wicket. Edrich was caught off Lindwall for 60, Laurie Fishlock fell to Colin McCool, and Lindwall knocked Denis Compton's bat out of his hands and on the stumps. Norman Yardley came in and appealed for bad light, which was turned down even though it was so dim that the Australian cameramen were unable to take clear photographs. Lindwall removed Yardley and Jack Ikin and England ended the day on 237/6. Hutton had batted throughout the day with typical Yorkshire grit for 122 not out, but was struck down by acute tonsillitis the following day and was taken to hospital with a temperature of 103 °F (39.5 °C). He was ill for the rest of the Test – a severe blow to the England team – and was flown back to England for a throat operation immediately afterwards. His latest innings gave him 888 runs (111.00) against Australia. The Saturday Hutton took ill was lost to rain, but on the Sunday the field was dried by the sun and mushrooms grew in the outfield. Lindwall bowled Godfrey Evans and Peter Smith in the morning to give him 7/63, Miller had Doug Wright and England were out for 280. Lindwall thought that George Tribe had bowled just as well, but had no luck and returned 0/95.\nAustralia – first innings.\nCutting a leg-break is always dangerous, and cutting Wright is a form of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked tendency to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.\nSid Barnes (71) and Arthur Morris (57) added 126 for Australia's first wicket until both were removed by Alec Bedser (2/49) soon after tea. Despite the 102 °F (39 °C) heat, the English fielding improved on the previous Tests, with Godfrey Evans, Denis Compton and Laurie Fishlock to the fore. Compton chased a piece of paper across the ground and grabbing it with a rugby tackle to the laughter of the 40,000 crowd. McCool and Tribe had managed to turn the ball on the first day and at last Doug Wright found things turning his way. Hammond had set stereotyped fields in the first four Tests and was loath to change them, but the new captain Norman Yardley was keen to take advice from his professionals. He changed the field as each batsmen came in and gave Wright a field of close catchers instead of trying to save runs. At the start of each Test Wright would receive telegrams and letters from well-wishers who had lamented his bad luck \"Never a match went by in which he did not hopelessly defeat the defences of the leading run-getters. Times out of number he had Barnes, Bradman, Hassett and their like groping forward hypnotised by the magic of his spinning witchcraft\". Wright bowled unchanged for nearly two hours and took the wickets of Don Bradman, who came down the wicket, misjudged the spin and was bowled for 12, and Keith Miller taken by Jack Ikin at slip. Australia started the fourth day on 189/4 and Bedser and Wright bowled unchanged for 11 overs each. Bedser shut up his end and conceded only 15 runs while Wright span his way through the Australian batting with a spell of 5/42 with Hassett, McCool, Tallon, Lindwall and Tribe all falling to catches close to the wicket. Only Ron Hamence stood up and made 31 not out in 1 hours and when Ernie Toshack was run out against Australia were dismissed for 253, a deficit of 17 runs.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nIn return England failed to recover from Ray Lindwall (2/46) catching Laurie Fishlock lbw through sheer pace with the first ball of the innings. Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich and Peter Smith all made 24 and only Denis Compton made more with 76 before he was caught in Toshack's leg-trap. Colin McCool took 5/44 and \"the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated in the presence of a snake\". As Hutton was unable to bat England were out for 186 on the last day, leaving Australia 214 to win.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nOn a pitch taking spin Yardley depended on Bedser and Wright to win the match and the spinner came on after only one over from Edrich. The roller had pressed the wicket and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris decided to make runs while its effects lasted. They made 45 for the first wicket when Morris gambled on a third run when Compton misfielded and was run out. Bradman edged a ball from Wright to Edrich at slip, who dropped it, but Barnes was taken by Evans off Bedser. In the end it was Edrich's dropped catch that decided the day as Bradman and Hassett dropped anchor and took an hour to make 13 runs, tiring out the bowlers as they did so. When Bedser and Wright were rested they attacked their replacements Edrich and Smith, who were replaced by Yardley and Wright after two overs. Australia reached tea with 110/2 and in the last session they chased the runs. Bradman was out to Bedser (2/76) for 63 and Hassett to Wright (2/93) for 47, but Keith Miller was told to get runs quickly before time ran out. \"No message ever had a readier recipient\" and he struck 7 fours in his unbeaten 34 off 44 balls. A grateful Bradman spoke of \"the sheer artistry, the classical style and power of an innings by Miller\" when interviewed just after the Test. Hamance was out for 1, but Australia reached 214/5 and won by 5 wickets.\nResult.\nAustralia won the Fifth Test by 5 wickets to win the series 3–0 and retain the Ashes. It was the first time that they had played an Ashes series without a Test defeat since Warwick Armstrong's 5–0 win in Australia in 1920–21 and 3–0 win in England in 1921, just after the last war. The full attendance was 93,011 and receipts of £12,619. The total attendance for the Test series was 853,122 with receipts of £115,858. Bradman said that \"The quick resumption of Anglo-Australian Tests had justified itself in every way, psychologically, technically, financially\". Len Hutton was flown home for a throat operation, the injured Paul Gibb, James Langridge, Joe Hardstaff went home by sea with Bill Ferguson and the heavy baggage while the rest of the England team sailed east to play in New Zealand.\nThe Press Corps.\nThe series was covered on radio by Arthur Gilligan, Vic Richardson, Alan McGilvray, Alan Kippax, Bill O'Reilly, Clif Cary and E.W. Swanton. The English press corps formed the Empire Cricket-Writers Club XI, which played cricket with some famous old names; Arthur Mailey, George Duckworth, Richard Whitington, Bill Bowes, Jack Fingleton, Vivian Jenkins, E.W. Swanton, E.M. Wellings and J.M. Kilburn.\n1946–47 Test Series Averages.\nAs was the convention of the time, gentlemen (the amateurs) have their initials in front of their surname whilst players (the professionals) have their initials after their name, if used at all. Wally Hammond had been a professional until 1938 when his business interests allowed him to turn amateur, allowing him to captain England. Bill Edrich was a professional who became an amateur in 1947 and captain of Middlesex in 1950. The Australians were all amateurs until the Packer Revolution, even though they played like professionals. Of particular note is that Doug Wright was the biggest wicket-taker on either side with 23 wickets (43.04), but with a higher average than anyone else who has held this position. He was also the chief first–class wicket-taker of the 1946–47 season – 51 wickets (33.31) and bowled just over a third of England's overs; 246.3 compared to 240.2 by Alec Bedser and 246.5 by the rest. Norman Yardley topped England's bowling averages with 10 wickets (37.20) even though he had not bowled for Yorkshire in 1946, though he had taken 6/29 for the MCC against Cambridge University, coming on as the seventh bowler."

        "title": "West Coast Express (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The West Coast Express was an ice hockey line that played for the National Hockey League's (NHL) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006. Named after Vancouver's commuter rail service, the line consisted of captain Markus Näslund at left-wing, Brendan Morrison at centre, and Todd Bertuzzi playing right-wing. The West Coast Express was a high scoring line that was considered to be one of the best lines in hockey during its tenure.\nEach player was acquired by the Canucks through various trades. Once each member arrived in Vancouver it took two years before the line played together regularly. Once they did, they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002–03 season (later surpassed), a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line. Despite regular season success, the Canucks were never able to advance past the second round of the playoffs during the West Coast Express years. The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005–06 season. Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007–08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency.\nHistory.\nPlayer acquisitions.\nThe Vancouver Canucks made the Stanley Cup Finals in 1994, but proceeded to regress as a franchise progressively finishing worse each season. As such they began attempting to add skill players to the line-up through trades. The Canucks made various deals to \"move the program forward and in a different direction\". With the franchise moving in a new direction the first member of the West Coast Express line arrived in Vancouver on March 20, 1996, when left wing Markus Naslund was traded to the Canucks by the Pittsburgh Penguins for Alek Stojanov. Naslund struggled to start his Canucks career and during the 1997–98 season he requested to be traded. It was not until the 1998–99 season that Naslund emerged as an offensive leader with the Canucks, leading them in goals (36) and points (66). \nTodd Bertuzzi was the second member of the line to join the Canucks' franchise, when he was acquired by Vancouver via a trade during the 1997–98 season. The New York Islanders received former Canuck captain Trevor Linden in exchange for right winger Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu). Bertuzzi began the 1998–99 season playing on a line with Mark Messier at centre and Alexander Mogilny on right wing. Bertuzzi played with the two until he suffered a fractured tibia, an injury that resulted in Naslund gaining increased ice time.\nThe final piece came to the Canucks on March 14, 2000, with the acquisition of Brendan Morrison. In an attempt to improve their team to make a Stanley Cup run, the New Jersey Devils traded Morrison and centre Denis Pederson for Mogilny at the National Hockey League's (NHL) trade deadline. Upon his arrival Morrison did not begin playing with Naslund and Bertuzzi nor did he begin his Canucks' career at centre, instead he began on the wing.\nExpress years.\nAlthough the three did not begin playing together immediately, Bertuzzi and Naslund regularly played together on the top line with centres Mark Messier and Andrew Cassels. Starting with their arrival in 2000, head coach Marc Crawford often moved Bertuzzi to the second line to play with twin brothers Henrik and Daniel Sedin to complement their cycling game. Morrison spent time on the third line with agitator Matt Cooke. Morrison joined Naslund on the top line due to an injury to Cassels in early November of the 2001–02 season, the two were joined by Trent Klatt on right wing, with Bertuzzi playing on a line with the twins. During the game Bertuzzi joined Naslund and Morrison on a power play marking one of the first times the line was together. The Canucks won the game but the line did not remain together as Cassels returned from injury, Klatt was injured and Bertuzzi was returned to the second line. The first game the trio played together as a regular line was on January 9, 2002. In the game they registered two first period goals in a 5–4 loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Crawford liked the idea of having his two top scorers together, how Morrison worked with them on the power play, and felt Morrison could handle the demands of playing with two players who wanted the puck. In their second game together the line continued to its strong play as each member recorded two points in a 7–1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes. After being put together they were given the name West Coast Express, a reference to a commuter train of the same name that provides service along a route between Mission, British Columbia and Vancouver, British Columbia. By the end of the season each player set new career highs in points to that time in their careers. Naslund raised his point total by fifteen finishing the year as the league's second leading scorer up thirty-one spots from the previous season. Bertuzzi enjoyed the biggest point increase on the line adding thirty points and moving from eighty-first in league scoring to third. Vancouver finished the season as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. The West Coast Express totaled three goals and nine points in the playoffs before being eliminated in six games by the top seeded Detroit Red Wings. In the off-season, Naslund received NHL first team All-Star honours.\nThe 2002–03 season was the West Coast Express' best season, as each member of the line again increased their point total to career highs. Naslund finished the year with 48 goals and 104 points again ranking him second in the league in points and goals. The fourth highest point total in franchise history to that point in time. Bertuzzi recorded 46 goals and 97 points, his goal total ranked him third in the league in goal scoring. Morrison's 71 points remains a career high which he has not gotten within 11 points of since. During the year Naslund scored a career-high four goals in a 6–3 win over the Edmonton Oilers, tying a Canucks record for most goals in a single game. In the game Bertuzzi added a goal and two assist while Morrison notched two assists of his own giving the line nine points in the game. Later in the season the West Coast Express helped the Canucks go on a 14-game unbeaten streak highlighted by back to back blowout wins to close out the streak. In the 13 game of the streak, a 7–2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets, the line registered 5 goals and 12 points. The following game the trio increased their output to 5 goals and 14 points. In the contest both Bertuzzi and Morrison registered two goals and two assists. Naslund scored a goal and added five assists for a career-high six point night. The Canucks finished the season with 104 points, a franchise record at the time. The West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the Canucks' 264 goals during the season. Finishing fourth in the Western Conference, the Canucks faced the St. Louis Blues in the playoffs. They fell behind St. Louis 3–1 in the series, but rallied back to force a game seven. In the deciding game, Naslund scored for the fourth consecutive game in the series and Morrison added the eventual game winner as the Canucks advanced to the second round. Facing off against the Minnesota Wild in game one of round two, the Canucks trailed late in the game. With just 8.7 seconds remaining, Bertuzzi won a critical face-off before Naslund took a shot that resulted in Cooke scoring on the rebound to force overtime, where the Canucks eventually ran out 4–3 winners. Vancouver took a 3–1 series lead before the Wild rallied to tie the series and force a game seven. The Canucks took a 2–0 lead in the game after Bertuzzi scored twice in the second period. Following his second goal, Bertuzzi skated by the Wild bench and said \"Get your golf clubs out, boys, its over.\" The Canucks then surrendered four consecutive goals, losing the game 4–2 and eliminating them from the playoffs. It was the last playoff game the trio would play together. In the off season Bertuzzi and Naslund were named to the NHL first All-Star team. Additionally Naslund was awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award (since renamed the Ted Lindsay Award), given to the league's best player as voted by the NHL Players' Association.\nEnd of the Express.\nThe following season each member of the West Coast Express suffered a decline in performance. The trio were unable to complete the season as a unit due to injuries and suspension. On February 16, 2004, in a game against the Colorado Avalanche, Naslund received a \"questionable hit\" from the Avalanche's Steve Moore. Suffering a minor concussion from the hit and a hyper-extended elbow when he fell to the ice, he missed three games due to his injuries. While Moore was unpenalized for the hit, some Canucks players felt that it was a \"cheap shot\". In the second rematch of the two teams after Moore's hit on Naslund, Vancouver allegedly put a \"bounty\" on Moore and were out to make him \"pay a price\". Early in the game, Moore clashed with Cooke, but later refused to fight Bertuzzi, despite being taunted and followed around the ice. After being refused the fight, Bertuzzi punched Moore in the head from behind and slammed him into the ice. Bertuzzi was subsequently suspended indefinitely by the NHL, and the resulting injuries ended Moore's career and left him suffering from concussion symptoms over the following seven years. Despite the loss of Bertuzzi, the Canucks won the Northwest Division. In the opening round Vancouver faced their division rival Calgary Flames. In the series Vancouver fell behind three games to two. They took a 4–0 lead in game six before the Flames came back to tie the game and send it to overtime. The game remained tied into the third overtime when Morrison scored at the 2:28 mark to force game seven. In game seven the Canucks were again trailing late into the third period in the closing seconds Naslund went around Flames defenceman Jordan Leopold drove the net and put a shot on goal. Flames goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, made the save but Cooke scored on the rebound with just 5.7 seconds remain to force overtime. The Canucks failed to capitalize on the change in momentum as the Flames' Martin Gelinas scored 1:25 into overtime eliminating Vancouver. Naslund recorded nine points in the seven-game series while Morrison chipped in five. During the off-season Naslund received the last of his individual NHL honors being named a First Team NHL All-Star once again.\nFollowing the cancellation of the 2004–05 season due to a labor dispute, Bertuzzi was reinstated for the 2005–06 season. With the return of all three line mate and new rules designed to increase offensive chances the Canucks entered the year with high hopes. Despite this, Naslund and Morrison's point production again decreased from their last NHL season. Bertuzzi point total increased, however, he played in 13 more games than his previous season. The Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time in four years and the only time during the West Coast Express' tenure. During the off season, the line was officially dismantled when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). Both Naslund and Morrison played two more years with the Canucks, often together (but not always), before signing as free agents with the New York Rangers and the Anaheim Ducks respectively in the summer of 2008.\nLegacy.\nDuring its time, the West Coast Express was widely considered one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history."

Founded in 1888, the Amateur Athletic Union is one of the largest non-profit, volunteer, sports organizations in the United States. It is dedicated exclusively to the promotion and development of amateur sports and physical fitness programs.\nThe era between 1921 and 1968 is referred to as the \"Golden Era\" of AAU basketball while companies began vying for players to compete on their teams. There was a great allure to playing AAU basketball besides job security; by remaining in the AAU as opposed to the National Basketball League or American Basketball Association, players were able to retain their \"amateur\" status. Only amateurs were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games, and many AAU basketball alumni went on to compete for the United States during their careers.\nDuring this time period, thirty-three AAU All-Americans played on the United States men's national basketball team in seven different Olympic Games: Joe Fortenberry, Carl Knowles, Frank Lubin, Art Mollner, Bill Wheatley (1936); Don Barksdale, Bud Browning, Shorty Carpenter, Bob Kurland, R.

These players include Roger Brown, Ace Gruenig, Richie Guerin, Chuck Hyatt, K. C. Jones, Bob Kurland, Hank Luisetti, Jack McCracken, Andy Phillip, Jim Pollard, and George Yardley. Two other AAU All-Americans have been enshrined in other roles: Don Barksdale as a contributor and Larry Brown as a coach.\nMost selections.\nThis is a list for all of the All-Americans who received the honor at least three times."

        "text": "The 1994 FIFA World Cup CONCACAF–OFC qualification play-off was an association football match played over two-legs between Australia and Canada. The first leg was played at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Canada, on 31 July 1993; the second leg was played on 15 August 1993 at Sydney Football Stadium in Sydney, Australia.\nBoth teams had played in their regional qualifiers to qualify for the play-off. The Canadians played in twelve matches in North American qualifying across two rounds. After finishing second in their second-round group to El Salvador, they qualified to the final round where they finished second by three points to Mexico. Australia, played in six matches across two rounds in Oceania qualifying. After winning their group, they defeated New Zealand across two-legs to make it to the play-off.\nAfter Canada won the opening leg 2–1 at Edmonton, Australia took a 2–1 lead in the return leg at Sydney. With the resulting aggregate tie, the game headed into extra time which was scoreless. This meant that the match went to penalties with Australia advancing through to meet South American Group 1 runner-up, Argentina which they would go on to lose 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off.\nBackground.\nCanada and Australia were two of the 147 teams that competed for the 22 spots that was in the 1994 FIFA World Cup which was held in the United States. The national teams were separated into their regional confederations with spots being allocated for that confederation.\nCanada.\nCanada began their 1994 qualification in the second round after receiving a bye in Round 1 and was put in Group B with Bermuda, El Salvador and Jamaica. They opened their 1994 campaign with two draws away from home. In Kingston, Dale Mitchell scored the equalizer against Jamaica in the 85th minute after Hector Wright had scored a goal for Jamaica seven minutes earlier. The following week, Colin Miller scored the late equalizer in San Salvador to tie the match 1-all against El Salvador after conceding a goal in the 32nd minute from Jorge González. At their first home game in Toronto, Canada recorded their first win in their campaign with a 1–0 win over Jamaica off the back of a 53rd-minute goal from Mitchell which put Canada in first place in their group. A 3–2 loss at home to El Salvador, was followed by a hat-trick from Alex Bunbury in the first half, becoming the first Canadian to score one in a competitive international match. Geoff Aunger sealed the 4–2 result for Canada over Bermuda. The final match of the second round saw Canada earn a clean sheet with a nil all draw over Bermuda in Hamilton. For Canada they finished in second place with seven points and advanced to the third round.\nIn the third round, they were drawn to play El Salvador, Mexico and Honduras with only the winner to qualify through to the World Cup. Their opening match in the third round against Honduras saw John Catliff open the scoring after Honduran goalkeeper Belarmino Rivera brought down Paul Peschisolido. Rodolfo Richardson Smith scored the equaliser for Honduras from a penalty before Bunbury gave the Canadians the lead once again. A late converted penalty caused by a Mark Watson handball saw the Canadian coach Bob Lenarduzzi confront the Jamaican referee after the match. The following match in Burnaby saw goals from Bunbury and Catliff give Canada a 2–0 win over El Salvador as they moved to the top of the group after two games. Their second match in Burnaby got off to a shaky start with Alex Pineda scoring the game's opening goal for Honduras against the run of play. Domenic Mobilio scored the equaliser in the 51st minute before a misplayed ball from Honduran goalkeeper Dangelo Bautista gave Canada the lead in the 61st minute. John Catliff secured the 3–1 victory for Canada over Honduras, who ended the match with nine players.\nCanada suffered their first loss of the final round with a trip to Mexico City ending in a 4–0 defeat to Mexico after Ramón Ramírez scoring two goals in the first half. In the second half, Luis Flores and Alberto García each scored a goal to secure the victory. The following match in San Salvador, Catliff opened the scoring in the 27th minute to give Canada the lead. El Salvador tied the game in the 58th minute when González controlled a loose ball and scored. Two minutes later, Mobilio scored the winner to set up a must–win match against Mexico. Playing at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, Alex Bunbury opened the scoring for the Canadians in the 17th minute off a John Catliff assist. A mix-up in the Canadian backline gave Mexico the equalizer in the 34th minute with Hugo Sanchez lashing an unstoppable drive past Craig Forrest. Despite Canada's efforts to re-take the lead with an all-out offence in the second half, Mexico claimed the victory with six minutes left of the match with substitute Francisco Javier Cruz slotting the ball into an open net. Canada ended in second place with seven points, three points behind Mexico who qualified through to the 1994 World Cup.\nAustralia.\nAustralia began their qualifying campaign on 4 September 1992 with an away trip to Honiara, to play the Solomon Islands. In the tropical heat, Australia's Carl Veart scored the opening goal in the eighth minute of the game before the team struggled to keep possession of the ball. Solomon Islands' persistence tied the game with Hollies Vato heading a goal. Australia replied three minutes later with a Tom McCulloch goal that sealed the 2–1 victory. One week later, the team travelled to French Polynesia to take on Tahiti in what was their second game in a World Cup qualifier. After Alistair Edwards returned to the Australian team from Malaysia, he contributed two goals with Damian Mori and Carl Veart also scoring. Paul Wade sealed the victory for Australia with a goal in the 57th minute to win the match 3–0.\nThe final two games of the first round were played in Australia with the first match taking place on 20 September 1992 in Brisbane against Tahiti. Carl Veart scored his third goal of the qualifying campaign in the 11th minute after Ricky Fassian could not hold the ball. Mehmet Durakovic scored the winner in the 62nd minute from a 40-metre shot which was deflected off Layton and looped over Fassian's head to seal the 2–0 victory despite being a man down earlier in the game due to a red card to Mike Peterson. The final match of the first round saw six different Australia goalscorers in a 6–1 rout over the Solomon Islands at Newcastle. After Aytec Genc scored the opener in the fifth minute of play, the Solomon Islands hit straight back with Tony Franken being stranded as Charles Ashley shot past him. Initially unable to take back the lead after the first half, Australia scored five goals in the space of 28 minutes. Ian Gray, Wade, Veart, Greg Brown and Durakovic scored to give Australia eight points from eight.\nThis meant Australia had qualified to take on New Zealand for a spot in the play-offs. In the first leg at Auckland, the Australians secured a 1–0 victory with the goal coming in the 55th minute from Graham Arnold. The second leg in Melbourne saw Australia score two goals in the first three minutes of the game, with Veart and Robbie Slater giving Australia a three-goal lead in the tie. A Ned Zelic goal in the second half sealed the match 3–0 and the tie 4–0 to qualify through to the play-off.\nFirst leg.\nSummary.\nThe first leg of the play-off was played at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton on 31 July 1993 before a crowd of 27,775. Canada had the first shot of the game in the 5th minute with Bunbry volley hitting the crossbar. Ten minutes later, the Australians loss goalkeeper Robert Zabica's to a red card after colliding into Canadian midfielder Dale Mitchell. Mark Schwarzer, who was called up after first choice goalkeeper Mark Bosnich declined to leave Aston Villa, debuted for Australia as a substitute for Milan Blagojevic. Eddie Thomson later quoting after the press-conference stating, \"I would like to study the video before making my mind up on the foul, but what I am positive about is that it doesn't take two minutes to send off a goalkeeper off in a situation like that.\"\nThis red card also forced Robbie Slater to play right full-back. With a minute left in the first half, the Australians opened the scoring with an own goal from Canadian defender Nick Dasovic. A cross from Frank Yallop glanced off Dasovic's head into the net with barely any Australians around. The second half saw the Canada levelling the game in the 51st minute with Mark Watson scoring a goal as he took advantage of the one man advantage. Seven minutes later, Canada took the lead after Domenic Mobilio scored a goal in what he later described as \"a huge scramble. We had three or four shots in a row.\" The Socceroos dug in to not concede a third goal as they battled in the last 30 minutes to only keep the difference to one goal.\nSecond leg.\nSummary.\nThe second leg of the play-off was played at the Sydney Football Stadium on 15 August 1993 before a crowd of 25,982. Defender Randy Samuel was brought back into the Canadian squad from a one-game suspension which ruled him out of the first leg in Edmonton. Tony Vidmar and Milan Blagojevic were added to the starting lineup for Australia. The first half of the match was dominated by Australia with them outshooting Canada 10–1. Australia was later rewarded at the brink of half-time with Frank Farina scoring the opening goal from an overhead kick. Quoted after the match, Farina said, \"The first half was the best I've ever seen from an Australian team, and only superb play from Forrest kept us out.\"\nA half-time substitution from Canada brought in Carl Valentine for Mobilio and the tactical change worked with Lyndon Hooper scoring the goal in the 54th minute while on the run as the ball was deflected off Schwarzer's gloves and inside the far net to give Canada the lead on aggregate. In the 76th minute, Dave Mitchell was brought on to replace Robbie Slater and it only took a minute before winning an aerial play against Samuel with Slater passing the ball to Mehmet Duraković the ball and Australia the lead as he scored into an unguarded forest after the ball went over Forrest's head. Thirty minutes of extra time failed to break the 3–3 aggregate deadlock which saw Grant Needham stretchered off after colliding with Duraković, the match went into penalties. From there, Schwarzer saved two critical shots from Bunbury and Mike Sweeney as he aided in the Australian victory with Farina sealing it with his shot.\nAftermath.\nAfter the second leg, manager Bob Lenarduzzi was quoted saying, \"Although we are disappointed, I don't think we let anybody down.\" He later added, \"we're all pulling for them because the farther they go, the better it makes us look.\" The Australian coach, Eddie Thomson responded in his interview, \"this was a win full of character; the whole team played really well.\"\nAustralia went on to meet Argentina in the deciding play-off for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. After the first match ended in a 1–1 draw at Sydney, they would concede an own goal in the second leg with a deflection off Alex Tobin going over Robert Zabica's head and into the far side of the net to lose the tie 2–1 and have Australia eliminated from qualifying. It was not until 2005 that they won a World Cup play-off to qualify through to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, defeating Uruguay on penalties.\nAfter subsequent failed attempts to qualify for the FIFA World Cup through CONCACAF, Canada finally qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 27 March 2022 after having beaten Jamaica 4–0 in Toronto, ending a 36-year drought since its first qualification in 1986."

        "title": "World Series Sprintcars",
        "text": "World Series Sprintcars was a dirt track racing series held in Australia for Sprintcars. It was the richest and best known Speedway series in Australia. The series was last run in 2019/20 summer season. The COVID-19 pandemic was the originally cited reason for the series cancellation. Multiple attempts to restart the series have failed. The series has been replaced by multiple Sprintcar State Series.\nHistory.\nThe series was conceived by Adelaide based sedan driver and promoter John Hughes in 1986 as an Australian version of the famous World of Outlaws (WoO) series run in the United States since 1978. The WSS is separate from the single meeting Australian Sprintcar Championship and is currently run over 12 rounds during the Australian Speedway season. The championship is open to drivers of any nationality, and is usually held from December until February. As it is held during the North American off-season, many visiting stars from North America will make visits, some even racing the majority of races before the North American season begins.\nThe first ever World Series Sprintcars (WSS) meeting was held in Perth at the now defunct Claremont Speedway on 1 December 1987. Originally each meeting was held on a single night, though for the past number of years each meeting is run over two nights, with Time Trials, heat races and a Preliminary B then A main on the first night with more heats, three qualifying Top eight shootout races (a three-round knockout—first round 5th-8th take another round of time trials, with the top two advancing, second round elimination race features 3rd and 4th facing the two advancing from the first round, again with the top two advancing, and the run for the pole featuring the two fastest facing the two that advanced in the second round); the format is different from the Dash format used by the Outlaws where the 8-10 fastest participating in a short race to determine the pole), the C Main, B Main and then the A Main (final) in a format similar to most sprintcar races.\nSpeedway City in Adelaide has held the most WSS rounds with over 55. The Archerfield Speedway in Brisbane is second on the list with 50 rounds hosted.\nLike the Australian Sprintcar Championship, the WSS has been dominated by drivers from New South Wales. Of the 26 series held since 1987, 16 drivers from NSW have won. Victorian driver Max Dumesny with seven series titles, foreign driver Darryn Pitman (Oklahoma, United States) with one win, 2011–12 champion James McFadden from Queensland (born in the Northern Territory), and 2013–14 champion Steven Lines from South Australia are the only non-NSW drivers to win the title. Although Dumesny is originally from Victoria, he has been based in Sydney since the mid-1990s. Darryn Pitman's win in 2002/03 is the only title by a foreign driver and the only time anyone other than an Australian has won the series title (the North American World of Outlaws season-opening meet in Barberville, Florida, USA will sometimes conflict with the final race of this series).\nSydney driver Brooke Tatnell has won a record eight series since first contesting races in the inaugural series run in 1987. Brooke is also part of the only father and son combination to ever win the series with his father, former national Speedcar and Sprintcar champion George Tatnell, winning the first two series run in 1987/88 and 1988/89. George Tatnell also finished second in 1989/90, the year Dumesny won his first series.\nVisiting American drivers who have been or are regular competitors in World Series Sprintcars include Jack Hewitt, Danny Smith, Joey Saldana, Darryn Pitman, Donny Schatz, Jason Johnson and Shane Stewart. Others who have competed in select races while touring Australia include Sprintcar racings \"King\" Steve Kinser, his younger brother Randy Kinser and Tim Green.\nThe 2013–14 World Series Sprintcars is sponsored by New Zealand based hydraulic hose and lubricant company Enzed. The series started on 26 December 2013 at Speedway City in Adelaide, and finished with the Grand Final on 22 February 2014 at the Perth Motorplex. Steven Lines from Mount Gambier in South Australia won his first ever World Series Sprintcars championship.\nThe 2014-15 World Series Sprintcars is set to start at Speedway City on 24 December 2014, with the 13th and final round on 21 February 2015 at the Perth Motorplex.\nRules and regulations.\nThe Australian Speedway Rules and Regulations book is full of rules that Sprintcar drivers, teams, owners, vehicles and venues must abide by. There are eight sections of rules and regulations (not including the forms and guidelines) in the book, and they are listed below:\n- Part 1, Administrative and general requirements.\n- Part 2, Pre Race requirements.\n- Part 3, Technical.\n- Part 4, Race procedures.\n- Part 5, Officials and their duties.\n- Part 6, Drugs and alcohol.\n- Part 7, Behavior, fines, penalties and protests.\n- Part 8, Judicial procedures. \nFor the more specific details of the rules and regulations, the full book can be found and downloaded here"

It was the first ever W.A.K.O. championships to be held in Slovenia and involved amateur men and women from across the world. There were three styles on offer at Maribor; Light-Contact, Semi-Contact and Musical Forms – the more physical styles would be available later on in the year at the Belgrade event.

        "text": "Stephen Perry Fry (14 July 1924 – 29 June 2002) was a South African rugby union player, most often playing as a flanker. Fry played rugby for his home town of Somerset West and provincial rugby for Western Province. He won 13 caps for the South African national team (the Springboks), and captained the country in four matches against the British Lions.\nPersonal history.\nFry was born in Somerset West in South Africa in 1924. He was one of five brothers; one of whom was killed flying in the Battle of Britain. The others were, Dennis who also toured with the Springboks in 1951, Alec his twin, and Robert. Fry served South Africa during the Second World War, and on his return studied at the University of Cape Town, gaining a BSc in Engineering and qualified as an engineer. A keen sportsman, he is described as a first-class athlete and was a half-blue at the university.\nFry married Bettie, and they had two children, Juliet and Mark. He harboured ambitions to be a jazz pianist.\nRugby career.\nFry began playing rugby as a schoolboy, playing in an under-eleven side. As an adult he played for local club Somerset West RFC. Fry served in the South African 6th Armoured Division during the Second World War, and after the end of hostilities in 1945 he toured with the Armoured Division's rugby team. The team played in both Britain and France.\nOn his return to South Africa whilst at the University of Cape Town, he was chosen to represent the Western Province. After completing his studies, he qualified as an engineer, joining the Villagers rugby team.\n1951 Springbok's Tour.\nIn 1951 he was chosen to represent the South African national team, on their fourth tour of Great Britain. According to South African journalist R.K. Stent, who travelled with the team during the five months, Fry was the player who most improved during the tour. Stent wrote, that at the beginning, Fry was an unlikely choice for team selection, but by the tour's end he was difficult to leave out. Given the number 27 shirt, Fry played in all five Test matches of the tour and 15 of the matches against club and county teams. His first match of the tour was on 13 October 1951, as flanker against the South Western Counties. Fry was then chosen for every other match for the next six games, scoring his first points with a try in the win over the North West Counties. In the match against the North East Counties on 3 November, Fry was initially selected at number eight, with Basil Kenyon as flanker; though the two switched positions almost immediately after play started.\nFry won his first international cap on 24 November 1951, in the encounter with Scotland. Scotland were totally overwhelmed, and lost the game 44–0; with Fry being the only South African forward not to score during the match. Fry continued to represent South Africa in the Tests, and played in the wins over Ireland, Wales and England. After the Welsh game the entire team, apart from Fonnie du Toit and Fry, were rested for the encounter with the Combined Services team. Fry was given the captaincy for the match, becoming the fifth player to hold the role during the tour. After the final match of the British leg of the tour, the team travelled to France. Despite Fry being the only player on the tour to have experience of playing in France, he was left out of the first match, against a South East France team. Fry was reselected for the final three games, playing at number eight, and again holding the captaincy for the match against South West France. He was back in his role as flanker against the France 'B' team and on 16 February 1952 played in the last game of the tour in a convincing win over France.\n1953 Australia tour of South Africa.\nThe next year saw John Solomon's Australian team touring South Africa. Four Tests were arranged and Fry was to play in all of them. The first was a South Africa win at Johannesburg, but the Second Test, played at Cape Town, saw Fry on the losing side as an international for the first time. Australia won 14–18, with the defeat put down to a South Africans tactical change to try and run with the ball more, in a desire to play to the crowd. Fry kept his place for the remaining two games, wins at Durban and Port Elizabeth.\n1955 British Lions.\nFry played his final matches for the Springboks when he captained the team for all four Tests against 1955 touring British Lions. Despite being captain of the national team, Fry was not amongst the Western Province team who were beaten by the Lions in a pre-Test game on 14 July. The first Test of the tour, at Johannesburg, saw the Lions win narrowly, 22–23. This was followed by a South African win in the second Test at Cape Town, but a 6–9 loss in the third Test in Pretoria meant that the final game would decide the tour. South Africa won the final game 22–8, drawing the tour. Fry never played for South Africa again, finishing his career with 10 wins from 13 games."

He came to the Majors after a posting a sparkling 11–2 win–loss record with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs in 1963. He appeared in seven games, one as a starting pitcher, for the Tigers that season. In 1964, he pitched only four innings during the first three weeks of the season for the Tigers, and was purchased by the Senators on May 4. Washington used Koch in 32 games, 14 as a starter, although he pitched exclusively in relief after mid-August. He won only three of 13 decisions for the Senators that season. Rather than report to the Hawaii Islanders minor league team in 1965, Koch returned home to Alabama to continue his law studies. All told, Koch played in 42 Major League games, and gave up 137 hits and 55 bases on balls, with 73 strikeouts, in 128 innings pitched.\nAfter baseball, Koch became an attorney in Mobile, Alabama. He died on May 22, 2015, at 77 years of age, and was buried in B'nai Jeshurun Jewish Cemetery in Demopolis, Alabama."

        "text": "The 1998 Asian Games (officially known as the 13th Asian Games) was a multi-sport event held in Bangkok, Thailand from December 6 to December 20, 1998. A total of 6,544 athletes from 41 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 376 events in 36 sports.\nThis edition of the Games marked the addition of three sports—squash, rugby union and cue sports—to the list of Asian Games sports; squash was included after seven years of lobbying by the Asian Squash Federation.\nAthletes from 33 NOCs won at least one medal, and athletes from 23 of these NOCs secured at least one gold; contingents from eight NOCs did not win any medals. China won the most gold medals (129) and the most medals overall (274), topping the medal table. South Korean athletes claimed 164 medals in total (including 65 gold), earning second spot on the table. Japan finished third with a total of 181 medals, including 52 gold. Host nation Thailand improved its medal-table rank compared with the last Asian Games held in Hiroshima, where it finished twelfth. In this Games Thailand ranked fourth in the medal table, with 24 gold and 90 medals overall.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nA total of 1,225 medals (378 gold, 380 silver and 467 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in ten sports: badminton, boxing, judo, karate (except men's and women's individual kata), wushu (sanshou event only), sepak takraw (except men's and women's circle), squash, table tennis, taekwondo and tennis.\nIn swimming there was a three-way tie in the men's 100 m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for second place in the women's 100 m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nAfter failing a drug test, Fakhruddin Abdulmajid Taher of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was stripped of his silver medal in the men's kumite event (60 kg category) of karate. This disqualification left the UAE with only a single bronze medal, placing the country joint-last in the medal table with four other nations. The silver medal was not awarded to any other athlete."

Moving four wide, he advanced into fifth place at the mile pole and closed steadily to win by lengths. Nehro (19) finished a neck in front of a late-closing Mucho Macho Man (13), with Shackleford hanging on for fourth.\nThe winning jockey, John R.

        "title": "Aaron Jackson (basketball)",
        "text": "Aaron Lee Jackson (born May 6, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player. Standing at , He plays at both the point guard and shooting guard positions, with point guard being his main position.\nHe has played professionally in Europe and China, since finishing his collegiate career with Duquesne, earning plaudits for his play and achievements, most notably while with the Spanish club Bilbao Basket and the Russian club CSKA Moscow.\nHigh school.\nJackson attended and played high school basketball at Northwest Catholic High School, in West Hartford, Connecticut, and at Worcester Academy, in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nHe won two Connecticut state championships while at Northwest Catholic High School, and spent a year at Worcester Academy prep school, for his postgraduate year. While playing under head coach Mo Cassara at the second, he was recruited by NCAA Division I program Duquesne, of the Atlantic 10 Conference, in April 2005.\nCollege career.\nAt the time when Jackson started his college basketball career at Duquesne, the school's basketball program was in the midst of one of its worst stretches ever, reaching 10 wins just twice in 11 years, in repeating losing seasons. The 2005–06 season wouldn't reverse the trend, on the contrary as the 3–24 season was the worst in the school's 92 year history.\nDespite this, Jackson started 21 of 27 games, and had comparatively good stats for a freshman (second on the team in assists and steals, and third in assist-to-turnover ratio in the conference).\nThe team's head coach, Danny Nee, was fired and replaced by Ron Everhart, and he would make sweeping changes to the roster, bringing in 10 new players, whilst only keeping two from the previous team, including Jackson, after a face to face meeting between the two.\nIn a team shook by a campus shooting (see Duquesne shooting), Jackson was a leader for the team as a sophomore. Playing in all games – starting most – he was in the conference top-10 in assists (3.8 per game) and steals (1.4 per game), whilst adding 11 points and 5 rebounds on average, as part of a team with an improved collective 10–19 record.\nJackson's junior season followed that trend, though he earned less minutes of playing time, as per Everhart's rotation policy. He led his team in minutes and assists, while also scoring in double figures and, posting 5+ rebounds 13 games during the season. With averages of 9 points per game and 4 rebounds per game, for the season. The Dukes had their first winning season since 1994.\nFittingly, he reached the pinnacle of his collegiate career in his last college season. Being the only senior in a team with seven freshmen, he started in every single game, as he led the team in scoring and assists (with a school record of 194), and was second on the team in rebounding and steals. His stats also ranked in the top 5 for the whole conference, in seven different statistical categories (of which included scoring, assists, steals, and minutes), which led to him being selected to the All-A 10 first team, and the NABC All-District 4 first team, also being awarded A-10 Most Improved Player.\nOn a team level, it was also successful season, as the Dukes had a 21–13 record in the regular season, their best since 1971, which allowed them to enter the NIT tournament. Jackson played in his last Dukes game in the first round of the NIT, against Virginia Tech, which was a befitting farewell, as he scored 46 points in the game (tied for the fourth highest single-game point total for the school), in a double overtime loss.\nAt the end of his Duquesne college career, Jackson's name was inscribed into the university's record books, as his 194 assists in 2009, broke Norm Nixon's previous school record. Besides that, he was also tied for 1st place in games played (having played in all of his team's games, in every season), was in 3rd place in career assists (with 505), was in 6th place in steals (169), and in 7th place in field goal percentage.\nProfessional career.\nWith his collegiate career over, Jackson turned his sights to the professional game and the 2009 NBA draft, first by playing in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament then by attending workouts with a half-dozen NBA teams, despite this he was not predicted to be drafted though he did attract attention from the Indiana Pacers. \nHe would go undrafted in the end but did rejoin the Pacers for the NBA Summer League where, in a de facto competition with A. J. Price for the third point guard spot on the roster, Price was signed over him. Not financially interested in D-League contract offers, Jackson planned a move abroad.\nAntalya Büyükşehir Belediyesi (2009–2010).\nJackson moved to Antalya Büyükşehir Belediyesi of the Turkish Basketball Super League in July 2009, penning his first professional contract.\nFor his first experience abroad he suffered from culture shock but developed his game in what he described as a physical league with hard fought games and had a good season statistically with 15,2 points, 4,9 rebounds and 4 assists per game.\nVirtus Pallacanestro Bologna (2010).\nAntalya finished in mid-table, missing the playoffs, but Jackson's season wasn't over as he then signed for Italian LBA side Virtus Bologna in April 2010 as a replacement for the injured Petteri Koponen to play in the playoffs.\nHe was an instant fit for the team, starting in all games of their first round playoff run, his good performances and statistics prompting the team to offer him an extension.\nBilbao Basket (2010–2012).\nIt was to be in vain for Virtus as Jackson signed a contract with Spanish Liga ACB team Bilbao Basket, signing a two-year deal (the second year an option) with an NBA clause in June 2010, after a summer league appearance with the Cleveland Cavaliers yielded no contract he joined the team for good. He was brought in by coach Fotios Katsikaris to replace the club's legend, Javi Salgado, with a more athletic and dynamic play-maker, a decision that earned critics from fans and observers.\nA frosty reception awaited Jackson in Spain, having to adapt to the competition level, considered the best national domestic league in Europe, and his dual role as facilitator and crunch time scorer, he had ups and downs before becoming the focal point of his team, leading them to 6th in the league before having a decisive role in their run to the playoff final, beating powerhouse Real Madrid in the process.\nThough they would lose in the final to Barcelona, Jackson played the most minutes of any player in the playoffs, also breaking the top 10 for scoring, rebounding, assists and steals and the option on his second year was taken by the Basques, with the guard motivated by the prospect of playing in the EuroLeague, the continents' premier competition.\nHis second season in Spain was as successful, being named the fifth best point guard in the Liga ACB as he led his team to another playoff appearance though this time they lost in the first round, Jackson top scoring for Bilbao in both games. Above all he discovered the EuroLeague, among the European elite he had seesaw performances, none so evident in two back-to-back games against Real Madrid, the first a shocker with only 2 points in 20 minutes in a loss, the second a Top 16 Week 4 MVP performance, scoring 15 points with 10 assists and only 1 turnover in a 93–69 victory that allowed Bilbao to finish above Madrid in their group and reach the Quarterfinals.\nIn the playoffs, he upped his game against future finalist CSKA Moscow, leading Bilbao in points, assists and steals to rank fifth for the playoff phase in Performance Index Rating, despite this Bilbao was overpowered by the Russians and lost the series 3–1.\nJackson was out of contract at the end of the 2011–12 season and turned down a contract extension offer from Bilbao, ending his tenure there following \"two marvelous years\".\nCSKA Moscow (2012–2017).\nOn June 19, 2012, Jackson joined former opponents CSKA Moscow, penning a 3-year deal with perennial Russian champions, hours after they announced the return of former coach Ettore Messina who coached Real Madrid in 2010–11. He chose to sign with them instead of having another go at the NBA summer league.\nTransforming from a star player to a role player at the European giants, Jackson found it hard to adapt to the perfectionist Messina's coaching style and struggled with form and confidence, more so when the club brought Theo Papaloukas at his position. Little by little he improved, later playing a part in CSKA's championship victories in the Russian League and the more competitive VTB United League, earning his first silverware, though they lost to Olympiacos in the EuroLeague semifinals, as the preceding year in the final.\nDespite offers from other EuroLeague teams of a starting place on their roster he stayed put and was also confirmed by CSKA who had an option to terminate his contract.\nAt the beginning of the season Jackson found himself behind Miloš Teodosić and newly arrived Jeremy Pargo in the rotation, playing most of his minutes as a shooting guard, for instance in the October exhibition game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nWhen Teodosić got injured in March 2014, Jackson was chosen to replace him, playing nearly 31 minutes per game in the EuroLeague quarter-finals against Panathinaikos, though he finished with only 5.4 in PIR.\nTeodosić reclaimed his place after healing and Jackson barely featured in the semi-final meltdown loss to Maccabi Tel Aviv, he even picked up a knee injury late in the game, which kept him out of the Red Army club's consolation come from behind title in the VTB United League.\nHaving again seen the club fail in their EuroLeague title quest, the management decided to change the team roster, replacing Messina with Dimitrios Itoudis and Nando de Colo was signed to be the team's new shooting guard, with Teodosić's contract extended. This left one of Jackson or Pargo as surplus to requirements, amidst interest from Valencia and due to the cost of Pargo's contract, coach Itoudis voted for Jackson and it was Pargo that was released.\nJackson repaid that faith with a strong start to the 2014–15 season, including a stretch in December that saw him nominated for the VTB United League Monthly Award. He also had a decisive contribution in the EuroLeague victory against Anadolu Efes Istanbul in January, scoring 21 points without missing a single shot along with 4 rebounds and 4 assists to finish behind teammate De Colo in the Top 16 Round 3 MVP rankings.\nIn a rotation system with De Colo, Teodosić and Sonny Weems occupying either the point guard, shooting guard or small forward positions, Jackson was often a substitute, however he had important contributions when called upon, for example in another EuroLeague semi-final loss to Olympiacos, where his 7 steals broke the Final Four single game record, with 9 points, 3 assists for 1 turnover and 4 fouls drawn he was the third best rated player in that game.\nJackson was credited as \"one of CSKA's best players down the stretch\" in the VTB United League playoffs, posting 8.7 points, 6.1 assists and 1.8 steals per game whilst playing more minutes (24.5) and being seen as more effective than fellow guards De Colo and Teodosić.\nThe Moscow club finished unbeaten in the playoffs to win the 2014–15 VTB United League as Jackson contributed 12 points and 8 assists in the final series Game 3 against Khimki.\nOn June 19, 2015, he signed a two-year extension with CSKA Moscow.\nBeijing Ducks (2017–2018).\nOn July 6, 2017, Jackson signed a two-year contract with the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association.\nHouston Rockets (2018).\nNear the end of the 2017–18 NBA season, Jackson would sign a contract with the Houston Rockets, replacing the position previously held by Tim Quarterman. Jackson would make his NBA debut on April 11, 2018, scoring eight points with three rebounds and an assist in an 83–96 loss to the Sacramento Kings. However, in this debut game, his last name was missing on his team jersey. Later Jackson had his debut in NBA playoffs on April 18, 2018, in a 102–82 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 5, 2018, he was waived by the Rockets.\nBeijing Ducks (2018–2019).\nImmediately after his departure from the Houston Rockets on July 5, 2018, Jackson returned to the Beijing Ducks. On November 2, 2018, Jackson recorded a triple-double after racking up 32 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113–118 loss to the Shanghai Sharks. On December 16 Jackson terminated his contract with Beijing.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv (2019–2020).\nOn December 16, 2019, Jackson signed with Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli Premier League for the rest of the season, joining as an injury cover for John DiBartolomeo and Nate Wolters. He averaged 4.3 points and 1.7 assists per game. On June 14, 2020, Jackson parted ways with the team.\nPlayer profile.\nA big combo guard, Jackson is a high energy player with solid athleticism and an unselfish style.\nOn offense he's a creative slasher, who is at his best while pushing the ball at a fast pace in transition, and using his excellent body control in the lane.\nWith his great quickness and ball handling, he can create his own shot, and is adept at getting to the basket to finish around the rim, with either hand, and often in acrobatic fashion, even through contact.\nHe can also \"quarterback\" his team's offense when called upon, using his good passing and high basketball IQ to great effect.\nOn defense he's a dynamic perimeter defender, who isn't afraid to play aggressively.\nAt CSKA, he was used for lock-down individual defense, to try to force a turnover from the opponent. He is athletic, competitive, and not afraid of contact.\nIt was noted in 2009, that he could improve his decision making skills, ball-handling, mid-range jump shot, and defensive fundamentals, whilst highlighting his effort and potential.\nHis work ethic and motivation, along with expert coaching helped him correct some of those shortcomings, as evidenced by his defensive progress, which was formerly a weakness. It improved so much that he was named one of the top 10 defenders in the VTB United League, in 2015. Concurrently, observers noted a significant improvement in his offensive game, with him having a better reading of the game, complemented by better technical skills, that add more options to his offensive repertoire; be it through team plays, such as running the Triangle offense, or an improved three pointer, which was added to his still potent explosive first step.\nCareer statistics.\nDomestic league.\nSource: LBA, Liga ACB, VTB United League\nPersonal life.\nHe is nicknamed Ajax, and has sometimes been designated as such by fans and media. It is derived from the similarly named Greek hero that inspired Jackson in a history class. One of his tattoos, on his arm, depicts the warrior.\nDuquesne shooting.\nOn September 17, 2006, Jackson and four other Duquesne teammates Sam Ashaolu, Stuart Baldonado, Shawn James and Kojo Mensah were the victims of an unprovoked shooting on the university's Pittsburgh campus. Ashaolu was shot in the head and neck, Mensah in the shoulder and arm, Baldonado through his back into his elbow, James in his left foot whilst Jackson was only grazed on the wrist by a bullet. He later carried the injured Baldonado to his car and drove him to hospital.\nThe two shooters, William B. Holmes II and Derek Lee pleaded guilty and were sentenced to respectively up to 40 years and up to 14 years in prison, for having helped them enter a student dance whilst armed, former university student Brittany Jones was sentenced to two years of probation.\nAn altercation started during the dance after a female acquaintance of the shooters flirted with one of the Duquesne players, the players walked away but later re-encountered the two men, who started shooting at them.\nJackson was able to play the next season, the only one of the four to do so, he was a roommate and friend of Ashaolu and helped him through his rehabilitation, even having to carry him to his car and drive him to hospital after a seizure.\nThough Ashaolu was never able to play basketball again, he graduated in 2009 along with Jackson who earned a psychology degree."

        "title": "FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships",
        "text": "The Inline Hockey World Championship is an annual inline hockey tournament organized by World Skate. Prior to the creation of World Skate in September 2017, the championship was administrated by the Comité International Roller In-Line Hockey (CIRILH), an organization and discipline of Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS). It is the sport's highest-profile annual international tournament. \nThe first men's World Championship was held was in 1995 and comprised twelve national teams. The structure established at the inaugural tournament featured all teams participating in a round-robin stage, followed by single elimination games to determine the champion. This basic format would be used until 2006, though the number of teams changed.\nThe modern format for the World Championship features eight teams in Group 1, and if there are more than eight teams, the rest compete in Group 2. All teams play a preliminary round, then the top six teams in Group 1 and top two teams in Group 2 play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. The remaining teams (bottom two in Group 1 and remaining teams in Group 2) play in a playoff round for the National Team World Cup, and the winning team is crowned World Cup champions. The World Championships are open to all players, both professional and amateur. The FIRS requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a certain period of time.\nThe United States is the tournament's first dominant team, winning the tournament 14 of the 18 events held (as of 2012), as well as medaling in all but one tournament. The Czech Republic is the next most successful team, winning the tournament twice and winning 14 medals.\nDue to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Skate banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from its competitions, and will not stage any events in Russia or Belarus in 2022.\nHistory.\nThe first tournament was held in Chicago, United States in 1995. The United States won the tournament after defeating Canada in the final. The United States won the tournament a further three times before in 1999 they were beaten by Switzerland in the gold medal game. The following year the United States reclaimed the gold medal and again won it in 2001.\nIn 2002 FIRS expanded the inline program to include a women's tournament. Both the men's and women's tournaments were held in Rochester, New York, United States where Canada's men's and women's teams went on to win their respective tournaments. Through the next four years the United States continued their dominance in the men's tournament while in the women's both Canada and the United States competed in the final all four times by both winning two gold medals each.\nIn 2007 FIRS again expanded their inline program to include a men's junior tournament. The United States went on to win the first edition of the tournament after beating the Czech Republic in the final.\nDue to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Skate banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from its competitions, and will not stage any events in Russia or Belarus in 2022.\nTournament structure.\nHistory.\nThe first World Championship held was in 1995. Twelve different nations participated. The nations were separated into three pools of four and played a round robin to determine seeding for a single elimination round to determine which nations would play for the gold.\nIn 1996, the World Championships switched to a slightly different format in which teams would be separated into larger pools for round robin play, then based on standings teams would qualify for the single elimination tournament. Teams that were eliminated would then compete in consolation games for final standings.\nPre–2006 format.\nAll World Championships began with pool play in which all participating teams qualified for order and selection to participate in the championship medal games. Pool play consisted of one or more pools in which every team assigned to the pool plays all other teams in that pool. A predetermined number of teams finishing highest in the pool would go on to play in the championship medal games and the non-qualifying teams will compete for the final places remaining. The championship medal games were conducted as single elimination matches, with winners advancing and the losing teams playing placement games to determine their final championship positioning. No ties were permitted in medal competitions and were determined by sudden death overtime periods.\nRound robin pool play.\nWhen the total team entry made it necessary to use a modified \"round robin,\" teams would be seeded into two or more pools so that each pool would have \"equal\" strength which was based on their final placement at the previous year's World Championships. The teams were assigned to pools arranged according to serpentine positioning. When a team from the previous year's World Championship does not participate, their position is closed up and the serpentine continues with those teams that have competed in both championships. The national teams that did not compete in the previous World Championships would be arranged in alphabetical order according to the English spelling of the country's name and added to the serpentine, which continues until all teams are assigned to a pool.\nMedal round competition.\nThe pre-quarterfinals (if required), quarterfinals, semifinals and final games of medal round competition were conducted as single elimination matches. If a team lost in the pre-quarterfinals or quarterfinals, they were eliminated from any further advancement in medal play. The two semifinals losing teams played for the bronze medal; and the semifinal winners played for the gold medal, with the loser of that match receiving the silver medal.\nWhen championship play consisted of 16 or fewer teams, the top eight teams were placed in the quarterfinals bracket according to the seeding determined by round robin play. With single pool round robin play, the first-place finisher played the last qualifying place, and so on through the remaining qualifiers. When round robin play consisted of two pools, the top seed in Pool A will play the bottom qualifying seed in Pool B, and so on, matching first place in one pool with last place in the other.\nWhen championship round robin play consisted of 3 pools, 12 teams qualify and pre-quarterfinals were required. The winning team from each of the 3 pools would receive a bye into the quarterfinals. The fourth bye would be awarded to the team placing second in its pool with the best percentage of points earned divided by maximum points possible. If a tie exists between pools, the second place team with the lowest average goals-allowed per game in round robin play would draw the bye. If the tie still remained, a shootout would be held among all remaining second place round robin teams that are tied for receipt of the bye. The remaining eight qualifying teams would be seeded according to their respective placements into the pre-quarter final round, with the winners of each match advancing to face one of the four teams receiving the byes. Where possible, rematches of round robin pool opponents would be avoided in pre-quarterfinal and quarterfinal matches.\nWhen championship round robin play consisted of four pools, pre-quarterfinals are required. The three highest placements in each of the four pools would advance to medal play. The winning team from each of the four pools would receive a bye into the quarterfinals. The remaining eight qualifying teams would be seeded into the pre-quarterfinal round, with the winners of each match advancing to face one of the four teams receiving the byes.\nPlacement games.\nThose teams not advancing to compete in medal competition from the preliminary pool play would play additional matches to determine their overall championship positions. Those games would take place in increments of two, three or four team units based upon their equivalent round robin pool rankings. The placement games would determine their ultimate position within their selected pool strata. Where there were two pools in the round robin, a four team match is possible which pits the higher placement team against the lower of the open placements and the winners for the two higher positions. In a three team match, each team would play the other in a mini-round robin to fill these open positions. That procedure of layered competition would be repeated until all teams from the round robin that are no longer competing for championship medals had been placed.\nModern group 1 and group 2 format.\nRound robin pool play.\nStarting in 2006, when the number of teams entered into the World Championships makes it necessary to use modified round robin pool play, teams will be seeded into pools based on their final placement at the previous year's FIRS World Championships. These teams will be divided into two groups. The teams finishing one through eight placements will be named to be in \"Group 1\" and arranged therein by two pools of four each, according to serpentine positioning. The remaining team with placements from the previous year (ninth, tenth and so on) will be situated into \"Group 2\", also arranged into pools so that each pool, as nearly as possible, has equal strength, according to the serpentine positioning. Teams from the previous year's World Championship that do not enter will have their positions closed up and the serpentine will continue with those teams that have competed in both the last and current championships.\nNational teams that enter the World Championship that did not compete in the previous year will be arranged in alphabetical order according to the English spelling of the country's name and added to the serpentine of \"Group 2\", which continues until all teams are assigned to a pool. Should there be one or more vacancies in the eight teams assigned to \"Group 1\", created by the absence of teams that finished in the top eight from the previous World Championship, these open positions in \"Group 1\", will be filled by any national team reentering the World Championship which had finished in the top eight placements during any of the previous three World Championships. If there are more eligible teams than there are open pool positions in \"Group 1\", priority will be given to that team with the highest previous placement, and if more than one team is similarly positioned, then the most recent of these shall be selected. There will never be more than eight teams in \"Group 1\", but should there be a vacancy remaining, the CIRILH Executive Committee is authorized to seed an entirely new team into \"Group 1\", if in their opinion, such nation has the hockey tradition and player talent necessary to compete successfully at the \"Group 1\" level. Teams that finished ninth or higher last year shall not be forced by vacancies into \"Group 1\".\nMedal round competition.\nIn Group 1, the highest finishing three teams from each of the two Pools A and B will advance to the quarterfinals, a sum of six from Group 1. There will be an addition of one team from each of the two C and D Pools in Group 2, making the total quarterfinal entry eight teams. These teams will be placed in the quarterfinals bracket according to the seeding determined by round robin play, with the placement in Group 1 considered superior to Group 2. The first-place finisher plays the last qualifying place, and so on through the remaining qualifiers, matching first place in one pool with last place in the other.\nThe teams eliminated from Group 1 World Championship medal play, will join as top seeds with the highest finishing three teams remaining in each of Pools C and D in Group 2 for a total of eight teams, which will comprise the \"National Team World Cup\" quarterfinals in single elimination competition. These teams will be placed in the quarterfinals bracket according to the seeding determined by round robin play, with placements in Group 1 considered superior to Group 2. The highest place team will be paired with the last qualifying place, and so on through the remaining qualifiers, matching top place in one pool with last place in the other.\nPlacement games.\nPlacement games still take place in the same fashion as previous years."

The team is coached by Kevin Conry.\nHistory.\nThe Michigan men's lacrosse team is one of the oldest collegiate lacrosse programs in the Midwest, having been founded in 1940. The program competed a few years until being halted for World War II. It was restarted in 1965 and has been playing ever since.\nIn 2001, the Wolverines were elevated to club-varsity status, competing at the Division I level of the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) in the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association (CCLA). In 2008, the team became the first MCLA team to complete a season undefeated, finishing 20–0 and winning their first national championship at Texas Stadium. The feat was repeated in 2009 with another 20–0 season and earned their second national championship with a 12–11 victory over Chapman University at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Denver, Colorado. In 2010, they won their third MCLA national championship in a row, defeating Arizona State University 12–11 in Denver. In 2008, Michigan faceoff specialist Brekan Kohlitz became the first MCLA player ever selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft when he was taken in the 5th round by the Washington Bayhawks. Michigan attackman Kyle Jackson was drafted as the 7th overall pick in the National Lacrosse League by the Rochester Knighthawks in 2016.\nThe program was promoted to NCAA Division I status by the university for the 2012 season. The Wolverines played in the ECAC Lacrosse League as an affiliate member during the 2012 season and as a full member in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, the Big Ten added men's lacrosse as a conference sport and the Wolverines joined Ohio State, Maryland, Rutgers, Penn State, and affiliate Johns Hopkins for the conference's first season.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Michigan's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

Listed at , 170 lb, he batted and threw left-handed.\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Gilmore started his Minor leagues career in 1910 with the Denver Grizzlies, playing for them one year before joining the San Francisco Seals (1912), Buffalo Bisons (1912) and Fort Wayne Railroaders (1914). Then, in 1914 he joined the Kansas City Packers of the outlaw Federal League.\nGilmore became a regular outfielder for the Packers during the last two seasons of the league. He was solid in his season debut, batting a .287 average with 23 stolen bases, driving in 32 runs while scoring 91 more. His only negative was that he became the first rookie batter to log 100 strikeouts in a single season, whiffing 108 times. No rookie until Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Dick Allen in 1964 would up 100 strikeouts with a higher batting average, when he hit .318 and was striking out 138 times.\nThe next year Gilmore cut down his strikeouts to 44 and hit .285 in 119 games, while collecting 22 doubles, 15 triples and a career-high 47 RBI.\nIn a two-season career, Gilmore posted a .286 average (269-for-941) with two home runs and 79 RBI in 258 games, including 47 doubles, 20 triples, 42 stolen bases and a .341 on-base percentage. He also hit .216 and four homers in 64 minor league games.\nIn 1912, while playing in the minors, Gilmore was on his way to Buffalo after being released by the San Francisco Coast League team. His departure was saddened by the loss of his watch from a fob that he had received from President William Howard Taft. The theft was given publicity, and two days later a package was received which contained both watch and fob. They were sent to Gilmore.\nGilmore was a long-time resident of Sioux City, Iowa, where he died at the age of 31."

Harper played college football for the University of Florida, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Miami Dolphins of the AFL and NFL.\nEarly years.\nHarper was born in Lakeland, Florida in 1944. He attended Lakeland High School, and he played for the Lakeland Dreadnaughts high school football team.\nCollege career.\nHarper accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Ray Graves' Florida Gators football team from 1963 to 1965. Memorably, he had an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown versus the SMU Mustangs in 1964, and had 111 receiving yards against the Florida State Seminoles in 1965. Harper led the Gators in kick return yardage for three consecutive seasons, and as a senior halfback in 1965, he became one of quarterback Steve Spurrier's favorite passing targets out of the backfield. He had 1,127 total yards gained in 1965, including 286 rushing, 403 receiving and 438 kick return yards.\nProfessional career.\nIn July 1966, Harper was one of 83 rookies to show up at the original Miami Dolphins training camp held on St. Petersburg Beach. Harper suffered a slight back injury on the second day of practice, and he was cut on July 9, 1966, before the free agent veterans showed up, as the original group of 83 rookies had to be cut to 49 that day to make room for the incoming veterans. The next year, Harper signed with the AFL expansion franchise Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 1967, and he played for the Dolphins in fourteen games from 1967 to . He compiled 197 rushing yards and a touchdown on forty-one carries, and 212 receiving yards and three touchdowns on eleven catches in his two AFL seasons."

        "title": "Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt (New York City)",
        "text": "Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt is a 1939 bronze sculpture by James Earle Fraser. It was located on public park land at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The equestrian statue depicts Theodore Roosevelt on horseback. Walking on either side of him are two men, on one side a Native American and on the other, a sub-Saharan African.\nThe statue has provoked increasing criticism for its hierarchical implications, and there were calls to remove it beginning in 2017. On June 21, 2020, the museum announced that it was asking city officials to remove the statue. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio supported the removal, as did Roosevelt's great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, and great-great-grandson Kermit Roosevelt III. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on June 21, 2021, to relocate the statue. The statue was removed on January 20, 2022.\nHistory.\nIt was dedicated on October 27, 1940. Cast by Gorham Manufacturing Company, Providence, RI.\nThe inscription reads:&lt;br&gt;\n(On rear of sculpture:) &lt;br&gt;\nJ E FRASER SC 1939 &lt;br&gt;\n(On front of base:) &lt;br&gt;\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT&lt;br&gt;\n1858–1919&lt;br&gt; \n(On left side of base:)&lt;br&gt; \nGOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;br&gt;\n1899 1901 &lt;br&gt;\n(On right side of base:)&lt;br&gt; \nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;br&gt;\n1901 1909 signed\nCommission.\nThe sculpture was commissioned by the Roosevelt Memorial Association in the 1930s after Fraser had delivered his design for the \"Arts of Peace\" memorial in Washington D.C., which at the time was also in competition with this memorial as the chosen location. For \"Arts of Peace\", Fraser made a pair of statues of Pegasus depicting the themes \"Music and Harvest\", and \"Aspiration and Literature\".\nThe statue was placed at the entrance to the museum's hall of dioramas dedicated to Carl Akeley who had accompanied Roosevelt on a year-long expedition to Africa. The sculpture and its pedestal were designed for this setting, appropriate in scale and design for the neo-classical plans of Henry Bacon's architecture. An earlier monument by Fraser dedicated to Roosevelt in Cuba in 1924 was also designed with Henry Bacon, and they both attended its dedication in Cuba.\nThe two walking figures have been construed as representations of continents, not individuals in a narrative, and that was common practice in public sculpture, of which London's Albert Memorial is a prominent example. At the same time, the \"pyramidal composition\" with Roosevelt at its apex \"implies a hierarchy\". One analysis of the work, after examining the careers of both Roosevelt and Fraser, concludes that \"Both men evidently believed in white dominance as natural order. However, Roosevelt and Fraser also had sincere, if paternalistic, admiration for indigenous cultures and a desire to preserve images and artifacts in what was, \"for the time\", a relatively respectful manner.\" Many feel the statue depicts Roosevelt, an early champion of civil rights and equality for black and Native Americans during the early 20th century, as leading minority persons in the U.S. forward towards the promises made to all under the U.S. Constitution. Roosevelt's relationship with Booker T. Washington and his appointment of Minnie Cox as the first black regional postmaster in the United States (Indianola, Mississippi) is seen as further cementing this view. Roosevelt's own comments regarding race indicated that he believed all the races were equal, but some cultures were superior due to their greater technological advances over time. The sculptor of the statue, James Earle Fraser, stated the intent with these words: \"The two figures at [Roosevelt's] side are guides symbolizing the continents of Africa and America, and if you choose may stand for Roosevelt's friendliness to all races.\"\nControversy.\nIn 1999 James Loewen argued in \"Lies Across America\" that the statue was erected when the museum was openly racist, and that the arrangement of the figures is meant to advocate white supremacy.\nThis statue was not otherwise the subject of public controversy in the 20th century. It was mentioned in the April 2017 TED talk \"Can Art Amend History?\" by artist and activist Titus Kaphar, discussing the choice of pose showing that \"Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there ...and on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking and on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking\" as a representation of white social hierarchy in America. After the Unite the Right rally due to the controversial removal of an equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee, this and many other statues across America also became the focus of attempts to remove what were claimed to be glorifications of America's racist past. The base of the statue was covered with red paint on the morning of October 26, 2017. A few hours later, a group admitted guilt and claimed that the statue embodied \"patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler-colonialism.\"\nIn January 2018, a commission appointed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to review several statues on city property concluded that this statue was open to many interpretations and made no recommendation for action. The commission's members were divided evenly. Some citing research that the standing figures are allegorical representations of the continents and noting that these figures \"are in no way abject\". Others emphasized how the sculpture is experienced, \"that height is power in public art\", an expression of \"power and dominance\". \"The New York Times\" critic Holland Cotter found that decision disappointing: \"It doesn't require a sensitivity to subtexts to see that the composition, no matter how you gloss it, is quite literally an emblem of white-man-on-top.\"\nIn July 2019, the Museum of Natural History mounted an exhibit devoted to the statue and contemporary interpretations called \"Addressing the Statue\". The presentation included many contrasting viewpoints and invited comments from visitors. David Hurst Thomas, the curator of anthropology at the museum said: \"The museum is making a really explicit statement that we're big enough to stand up for our past. We're not going to cover it up. We're going to welcome dissent.\" The exhibit included an extensive website for further exploration of the sculpture and its interpretation. It presented comments by the sculptor and his collaborators alongside those of academics who contested what the two walking figures represent and whether Roosevelt could be described as a \"racial unifier\".\nTo provide context for those viewing the sculpture, the museum installed laminated placards at its base that said: \"This statue was unveiled to the public in 1940, as part of a larger New York State memorial to former N.Y. governor and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Today, some see the statue as a heroic group; others, as a symbol of racial hierarchy. You can learn more about this statue inside the Museum and [online].\" An article in the \"Columbia Journal of Law and the Arts\" was critical of the placards, noting they were not visible at a distance.\nRemoval.\nOn June 21, 2020, the museum announced that it would remove the statue. Museum president Ellen V. Futter said the decision did not reflect a judgment about Roosevelt but was driven by the sculpture's \"hierarchical composition\". Her statement to Museum staff said that \"many of us find its depictions of the Native American and African figures and their placement in the monument racist\". Roosevelt's great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, supported the decision, saying \"The world does not need statues, relics of another age, that reflect neither the values of the person they intend to honor nor the values of equality and justice.\" Mayor de Blasio said: \"The American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior. The City supports the Museum's request. It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.\"\nOn July 12, 2020, Roosevelt's great-grandson Mark Roosevelt backed efforts to remove the statue. He said: \"If we wish to live in harmony and equality with people of other races, we should not maintain paternalistic statues that depict Native Americans and African Americans in subordinate roles. The statue of Theodore Roosevelt, my great-grandfather, in front of New York's Museum of Natural History, does so, and it is good that it is being taken down.\"\nOn June 21, 2021, the New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously to remove the statue from in front of the museum and relocate it to an institution devoted to Roosevelt's life and legacy. On November 19, the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation announced it would accept the statue as a long-term loan from New York City for display at the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library, scheduled to open in Medora, North Dakota, in 2026. Theodore Roosevelt IV said: \"It is fitting that the statue is being relocated to a place where its composition can be recontextualized to facilitate difficult, complex and inclusive discussions.\"\nOn January 19, 2022, the statue was removed from its location on the plaza in front of the museum.\nThe plinth remained for some additional months, but was replaced by two plaques, one honoring Roosevelt, and one describing the reasons for the statue's removal.\nThe statue has been sent to North Dakota, and is in storage at the location where the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is under construction as of 2023. Future plans for the statue remain controversial. There are no current plans to display the statue at new library when it opens."

        "text": " is a 2011 crossover sports and party game developed by Sega Japan. It was published by Nintendo in Japan and Korea and by Sega elsewhere. As the third instalment in the \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" series, it was released on the Wii on 15 November 2011 in North America, 17 November 2011 in Australia, 18 November 2011 in Europe, and 8 December 2011 in Japan. It was also released for the Nintendo 3DS in February 2012. \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" is the official video game of the 2012 Summer Olympics and is licensed by the International Olympic Committee through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia. The game is the only Wii title to come in a yellow keep case.\nThe game on the Wii and 3DS comprises a collection of numerous events based on the Olympic Games. Players assume the role of a \"Mario\" or \"Sonic\" character while competing against the others in Olympic events. \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics upon release, with many criticising its gameplay as underwhelming. It proved to be commercially successful and was followed by a fourth game in the series, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\", which was released in November 2013 for the Wii U.\nGameplay.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\" comprises a collection of numerous events based on the modern Olympic Games. The game brings together the two titular characters and 18 more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Each character has unique attributes which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. As with the game's predecessor, all player-characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill.\nThe Wii version features a total of 30 Olympic events, including football, badminton, horse riding, canoeing, and volleyball. Re-imagined versions of previously existing events such as athletics, aquatics, and table tennis also appear. The game introduces new cooperative mechanics including \"Dream Events\", alternate versions of Olympic events that take place in locations from previous games of the \"Mario\" and \"Sonic\" series, and a challenge mode, which enables players to repeat complete challenges in various events. \"London Party\" mode takes place on a board game-like depiction of London in which four players may compete in various sporting events and minigames. The ultimate objective is to collect enough stickers to fill up a \"tourist book\" – the player who completes the book first wins. Upon the completion of any event, players earn scratch cards which can be redeemed in the game's \"Bonus Mode\" for rewards such as Mii costumes and additional music. Unlike \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\", the Wii version of \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\" does not support the Balance Board.\nThe 3DS version has over 50 Olympic-based events in single-player and multiplayer. Among these events which are not included in the Wii version include BMX racing and weight-lifting, with the latter involving the use of the 3DS's microphone. Like the Nintendo DS counterpart of \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\", it also contains an exclusive \"Story Mode\" which entails the characters from Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog's worlds working against their respective antagonists, Bowser and Doctor Eggman, who are trying to use fog machines to prevent the games from being held.\nDevelopment and release.\nThe first game in the series, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\", was the first official crossover title to feature characters from both the \"Super Mario\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" franchises. The Olympic Games were chosen as a setting since Sega and Nintendo felt its competitive sportsmanship was ideal for the once-rival mascots Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. The game proved to be a commercial success and encouraged Sega and Nintendo to develop a sequel, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\". Shortly after its release, the vice president of marketing at Sega of America, Sean Ratcliffe, commented that the company would likely commission a sequel for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London if the franchise continued to capture interest among consumers.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\" was officially announced with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on 21 April 2011, after its predecessors sold over 19 million units combined. As with its predecessor, Sega's Osamu Ohashi and Nintendo's Hiroshi Sato served as producers, Eigo Kasahara as director, and Teruhiko Nakagawa as lead composer. \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" is the only official video game of the 2012 Summer Olympics and is licensed by the International Olympic Committee through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia. A peripheral was considered to launch alongside the game early in its development, although its nature remains unknown.\nBoth the Wii and 3DS versions were developed by Sega Sports Japan and published by Nintendo for Japan and Korea and Sega for North America and Europe. Over 100 people developed the game. The Wii version carries the distinction of being the only title to come in a yellow keep case. Nintendo re-released the 3DS version of the game as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop on 1 November 2012 in Japan, on 30 May 2013 in the PAL regions, and on 20 June 2013 in North America. The Wii version sold 2.4 million copies in North America and Europe in its first two months of release. \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\" was followed by a sequel, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\", which was released worldwide for the Wii U in November 2013.\nReception.\nThe game received mixed to average reviews upon release. Both the Wii and 3DS versions hold an average score of 66 percent at Metacritic, with the Wii version based on an aggregate of 38 reviews and the 3DS version of 28 reviews.\nChris Scullion from the \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" asserted that the Wii version was a \"step sideways\" for the series, regarding the gameplay and lack of challenge as an overall underwhelming experience for an individual player. John Minkley of \"Eurogamer\" likewise thought the game failed to replicate the \"charming\" and inclusive formula of its predecessors, saying that many of its game modes remained too similar and \"undercooked\", despite new additions. While Mike Anderiesz from \"The Guardian\" opined that the game may not have done justice to either of the franchise's universes in light of their distinctive environment and visuals, he did commend \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" as a \"colourful diversion\" for its young target audience. \"GamesRadar+\"s Neilie Johnson lamented on the game's overall lack of new content and predictability, although he singled out the \"London Party\" mode as \"fun\" and the only part of the game which took full advantage of the UK setting. Likewise, both Mark Langshaw of \"Digital Spy\" and Lucas Thomas of \"IGN\" complained that the game rehashed many elements of its predecessors. Langshaw ultimately heralded the game's colourful cartoon-like aesthetic and wide array of characters as bolstering appeal for the younger generation, and felt that part of its appeal was the fact that none of Olympic events featured offer accurate representations of their real life counterparts. Thomas praised the game's presentation of London and said that its prominent depiction of world-famous landmarks alongside \"Mario\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" characters elevated the overall experience to which its predecessors did not emulate. He also felt that the game's non-support of the Wii MotionPlus, available shortly after its predecessor, was a missed opportunity for the series.\nOn the Nintendo 3DS, reviewers found the game to be largely similar to its Wii counterpart. Tom East from the \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" found that the 3DS version was a marginal improvement over the Wii version, praising its \"outstanding\" soundtrack and the novelty of seeing characters from both franchises interact with each other as factors which add a degree of longevity to the game. Shane Jury of \"Cubed3\" praised the crisp visuals of the 3DS version, remarking that the characters are animated \"incredibly well\" and felt that the game's overall vibrant and colourful atmosphere and 3D capabilities helped make it stand out from the Wii version, albeit lightly. While \"IGN\"'s Richard George thought that some of the minigames \"fared better\" than its Wii counterpart in terms of replay value, he expressed disappointment over the \"embarrassing design\" of certain minigames and criticised its \"shallow attempts\" of replicating some Olympic events."

In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nHonoured at Featherstone Rovers.\nFreddie Miller is a Featherstone Rovers Hall of Fame inductee."

        "title": "Star Company Basketball Cards",
        "text": "Star Company Basketball Cards were the only licensed NBA basketball cards being produced during the mid-1980s. Occupying a place vacated by sports card giant \"Topps\", which ended its contractual relationship with the NBA and its Player's Association in 1982, Star began producing its colorful cards in mid-1983 with a 32 card All-Star set featuring stars from around the league who participated in the 1983 All-Star Game.\nStar Company produced cards in limited quantities, with most production runs at or below 5,000 cards. Some card sets were made even more scarce by problems with quality control, particularly in the inaugural base set of 275 cards issued in 1983–84. Several of the teams in that set, most notably the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks, saw less than twenty-five percent of their printed product (&lt;1,000 cards) reach the market due to problems with ink saturation and miscutting of the cards.\n\"Star\" cards were unlike any cards previously produced covering the NBA. They were sold in hobby shops by team in sealed, transparent plastic bags, known to many as \"polybags.\" Cards were made available nationally through a small network of a half dozen so-called \"master distributors\" although some parts of the mid-west and various southern states received little attention among the distributor network. Many cards were initially purchased in response to ads in sports card magazines and even at various sporting events, including minor league baseball and hockey games. To this day, these cards are difficult to find due to the small print runs and non-standard distribution methods. These factors are also among the reasons the hobby does not view Star cards as traditional \"rookie\" cards, but instead considers them \"extended rookies\" or licensed cards published chronologically before a player's recognized rookie card. The 1986 Fleer set, published after most Star Company sets, remains the set viewed by most as listing the official rookie cards of many of the 1980s great players.\nAuthentication of these cards, a longtime problem for collectors as a result of issues with counterfeiting, has recently been bolstered by Beckett Grading Services (BGS), which began grading these cards in December, 2008. While some collectors still don't consider the Star Company cards as credible successors to the Topps sets of prior years, more so than at any time previously, hobbyists are accepting the legitimacy and historicity of these cards, due in part to the increase of information about the catalog of original cards and the efforts of grading companies like BGS and GAI (Global Authority, Inc.).\nThe Star Company catalog contains some of the most valuable basketball cards of the modern era.\nIn 2012, A BGS 9 1984-85 Star Michael Jordan XRC #101 sold on eBay for $9511.00 and a \nBGS 9 1984-85 Star Michael Jordan NBA Specials ROY #288 sold for $5,555.00.\nLatest auction sold price as of 2017 for 1984-85 Star Michael Jordan XRC #101 sold for $31,100.00 on Apr 23, 2017 by PWCC Auctions and there were 2 reported private deals of the Rare Bulls Set 1984-85 Star Chicago Bulls Team Bag Set one graded at GAI 9 went for $52,000.00 and a lower grade of GAI 8.5 went for $39,000.00."

McKenzie is currently the general manager of the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League.\nCollege hockey.\nSt. Lawrence Saints (2006-2010).\nMcKenzie joined the St. Lawrence Saints of the NCAA for the 2006-07 season, where as a freshman, he scored 12 goals and 25 points in 31 games, finishing fourth in team scoring. The Saints won the Cleary Cup as the top regular season team in the ECAC Hockey Conference.\nIn his sophomore season with the club during the 2007-08 season, McKenzie skated in 34 games, scoring seven goals and 20 points for the rebuilding Saints. McKenzie was named to the ECAC All-Academic Team during this season.\nIn 2008-09, during his junior season with the Saints, McKenzie saw his offensive production increase to new heights, as he scored 16 goals and 34 points in 38 games to lead the club in scoring. For the second consecutive season, McKenzie was named to the ECAC All-Academic Team.\nIn his final season with St. Lawrence in 2009-10, McKenzie was named an alternate captain. In 41 games, McKenzie scored 14 goals and 35 points, finishing second on the club in both goals and points.\nOverall, in four years with the Saints, McKenzie scored 49 goals and 114 points in 165 games.\nProfessional career.\nAlbany River Rats (2009-2010).\nOn March 24, 2010, McKenzie was signed to an Amateur Tryout with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League. The River Rats were the top minor league of the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League.\nMcKenzie made his professional hockey debut on April 3, 2010, as he recorded his first career AHL point, an assist on a goal scored by Brad Herauf, in a 4-2 victory over the Adirondack Phantoms. McKenzie would appear in three games with Albany during the 2009-10 season, earning one assist.\nCharlotte Checkers (2010-2012).\nOn August 3, 2010, McKenzie signed a one-year contract with the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League. The Checkers were the top affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes, as McKenzie had an amateur tryout with their previous AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats in the 2009-10 season.\nMcKenzie was assigned to the Florida Everblades of the ECHL after training camp. In 55 games with Florida, McKenzie scored 18 goals and 38 points, earning a promotion back to the AHL with Charlotte. On March 22, 2011, McKenzie scored his first career AHL goal against Michael Leighton of the Adirondack Phantoms in a 5-2 victory. McKenzie finished the 2010-11 season by playing 14 games with Charlotte and recording the one goal. In December 2010, McKenzie was named the ECHL Rookie of the Month after scoring nine goals and 17 points in 14 games with the Everblades.\nThe Checkers extended McKenzie's contract, however, McKenzie was once again assigned to the Everblades to begin the 2011-12 season. In 19 games with Florida, McKenzie scored five goals and 15 points.\nIn December 2011, McKenzie was traded to the Houston Aeros.\nHouston Aeros (2011-2012).\nMcKenzie joined the Houston Aeros after his trade to the club by the Charlotte Checkers midway through the 2011-12 season. The Aeros were the American Hockey League affiliate of the Minnesota Wild.\nHe made his Aeros debut on December 6, 2011, as McKenzie earned an assist on a goal by Joey Martin in a 6-1 win over the San Antonio Rampage. McKenzie would appear in 19 games with Houston during the season, scoring a goal and three points. Late in the season, McKenzie was assigned to the Ontario Reign of the ECHL. In five games with Ontario, McKenzie scored a goal.\nOn March 31, 2012, McKenzie announced his retirement.\nCoaching/Management career.\nKitchener Rangers (2012-present).\nOn June 7, 2012, McKenzie was hired by the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League as an assistant coach, working under head coach Steve Spott.\nIn his first season with the Rangers in 2012-13, Kitchener finished the year with a 39-20-9 record, earning 87 points and fourth place in the Western Conference. In the post-season, the Rangers lost to the London Knights in five games in the Western Conference semi-finals. Following the season, Spott stepped down from his position as head coach, and was replaced with Troy Smith. McKenzie remained on the staff as an assistant coach.\nThe Rangers struggled during the 2013-14 season, as the club began to rebuild. Kitchener missed the post-season, as the club finished in ninth place in the Western Conference with a 22-41-5 record, earning 49 points.\nKitchener saw some improvement in 2014-15, as the team earned a 32-26-10 record, finishing in sixth place in the Western Conference with 74 points, and returning to the post-season. The Rangers lost to the London Knights in the first round in six games. Following the season, the Rangers replaced head coach Troy Smith with Mike Van Ryn. McKenzie remained as an assistant coach, and was also named the assistant general manager.\nThe Rangers had a very successful season in 2015-16, as the club earned a 44-17-7 record, accumulating 95 points and a fourth place finish in the Western Conference. Kitchener made the second round of the playoffs, however, they were swept by the London Knights in four games. Following the season, Mike Van Ryn stepped down as head coach of the team, and was replaced by Jay McKee. McKenzie remained an assistant coach on the coaching staff.\nKitchener had another solid season in 2016-17, as the team had a record of 36-27-5, earning 77 points and sixth place in the Western Conference. The Rangers lost to the Owen Sound Attack in the first round of the post-season. Following this season, McKenzie was promoted to the position of general manager after Murray Hiebert stepped down.\nIn his first season as general manager in 2017-18, McKenzie made a number of trades, bringing in players such as Kole Sherwood, Logan Stanley, Logan Brown, Givani Smith, and Mario Culina, as Kitchener finished the regular season with a 43-21-4 record, earning 90 points and finishing first place in the Midwest Division for the first time since the 2007-08 season. In the post-season, the Rangers defeated the Guelph Storm and Sarnia Sting before matching up with the heavily favoured Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. The Rangers lost a memorable seven game series, as the Greyhounds scored in double overtime in game seven in the Western Conference finals to eliminate Kitchener from the post-season.\nIn 2018-19, the Rangers slid back in the standings, as the club finished the season with a 34-30-4 record, earning 72 points and fifth place in the Western Conference. In the post-season, the rebuilding club was swept by the Guelph Storm in the first round.\nPrior to the 2019-20 season, McKenzie acquired goaltender Jacob Ingham from the Mississauga Steelheads to solidify the position. Also, due to the uncertainty of overage forward Joseph Garreffa returning to Kitchener for the season, McKenzie acquired overage forward Liam Hawel from the Guelph Storm, as the Rangers boasted three of the top overage players in the league, with Greg Meireles and Jonathan Yantsis as the other overage players on the club. The Rangers eventually traded Garreffa to the Ottawa 67's for draft picks. Kitchener drafted import defenseman and Arizona Coyotes prospect Axel Bergkvist at the 2019 CHL Import Draft to help out the blue line. The club got off to a slow start, posting a 7-10-2-2 record and sitting in last place through their first 21 games. On November 25, 2019, McKenzie relieved head coach Jay McKee of his duties and named himself as the interim head coach. In his first game as head coach of the Rangers on November 28, Kitchener defeated the Erie Otters 5-4 in a shootout, as McKenzie earned his first career OHL victory. Under McKenzie, Kitchener had a very impressive 33-6-3-0 record, as the team climbed from last place in the Midwest Division to finish the season with a 40-16-5-2 record, earning 87 points, and second place in the division. Due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in North America, the post-season was cancelled. On June 10, 2020, McKenzie announced that he would remain the head coach of the Rangers for the next season.\nAt the 2020 OHL Priority Selection, the Rangers selected twin brothers Andrew Leblanc and Jacob Leblanc in the first and third rounds respectively. At the 2020 CHL Import Draft, Kitchener selected goaltender Pavel Cajan from the Czech Republic. Due to COVID-19, the 2020-21 season was cancelled.\nThe Rangers selected Carson Rehkopf with their first selection of the 2021 OHL Priority Selection. During the 2021-22 season with Kitchener struggling, the club traded away defenseman Arber Xhekaj to the Hamilton Bulldogs for Navrin Mutter and five draft picks. Kitchener managed to earn a spot in the post-season, as they finished the season in seventh place in the Western Conference with a 30-31-5-2 record, earning 67 points. In the post-season, the Rangers upset the London Knights in the Western Conference quarter-finals, winning in seven games. In the conference semi-finals, Kitchener lost to the Windsor Spitfires.\nOn June 27, 2022, McKenzie stepped down as head coach of the team, as he shifted his focus to general manager duties. The next day, the Rangers announced that Chris Dennis as head coach.\nThe Rangers opened the 2022-23 expecting to be one of the top teams in the league. During the season, McKenzie made some trades, acquiring overage goaltender Marco Costantini from the Hamilton Bulldogs, Lleyton Moore from the Oshawa Generals, Francesco Arcuri from the Kingston Frontenacs and Danny Zhilkin from the Guelph Storm. Despite the moves and expecting to be contenders, the Rangers struggled to a 21-24-2-0 record, sitting in eighth place in the Western Conference. On February 10, McKenzie fired head coach Chris Dennis and announced that he would take over head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. Under McKenzie, the Rangers put together a solid 12-5-4-0, finishing in eighth place in the Western Conference, qualifying for the post-season. In their first round matchup, Kitchener defeated the heavily favoured and top seeded Windsor Spitfires in a four game sweep. The Rangers lost in the conference semi-finals to the London Knights in five games."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2001 were the joint thirteenth world kickboxing championships (the other was held earlier that year in Maribor, Slovenia) hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization. It was the second championships to be held in Serbia and Montenegro (the Europeans had been held here back in 1996) and was open to amateur men and women across the world.\nThere were three styles on offer at Belgrade; Full-Contact, Low-Kick (men only) and Thai-Boxing (men only). The other typical styles, Semi Contact, Musical Forms etc., had taken place at the sister event in Maribor. By the end of the championships Russia was the strongest nation overall, followed by Belarus in second and hosts Serbia and Montenegro in third. The event was held over five days in Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro, starting on Wednesday, 21 November and finishing on Sunday, 25 November 2001.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where both punches and kicks are thrown with full force with strikes below the waist prohibited. Most matches are settled by either a point's decision or referee stoppage and like most other amateur contact sports, head and body protection is compulsory. More detail on Full-Contact rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. At Belgrade both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, and the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. Notable winners included was Roman Romanchuk who would also have some success in amateur boxing and Fouad Habbani who made the successful transition to Full-Contact having won gold in Light-Contact at Maribor. By the end of the championship Russia was by far the most successful country in the category winning seven golds and six bronzes in both male and female competition.\nLow-Kick.\nLow-kick is a style of kickboxing which is similar to Full-Contact, allowed strikes (punches and kicks) to be thrown at full force, with the only difference being that strikes are also allowed to the legs of the opponent. Fights are mainly won by a point's decision or by a referee stoppage, with head and body protection mandatory for all contestants. More details on the rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. At Belgrade the category was open to men only with twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. The most notable gold medallist was Ivan Strugar who won yet another gold medal (sixth overall) at a W.A.K.O. championships, while future K-1 MAX and Superleague fighters (and brothers) José Reis and Luis Reis won bronze. By the end of the championships the host nation Yugoslavia was the strongest country in Low-Kick winning five gold, one silver and one bronze.\nThai-Boxing.\nThai-boxing (more commonly known as Muay Thai is the most physical style of kickboxing in which the contestants use punches, kicks, elbows and knees to attempt to defeat their opponent, often by referee stoppage or via a point's decision. As with other forms of amateur kickboxing, participants must wear head and body protection. At Belgrade the category was open to men only with twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. Notable winners included Andrei Kulebin winning the first of what would later be many world titles and future It's Showtime 77 MAX world champion Dmitry Shakuta. As with the last world championships Belarus proved to be absolutely dominant once more in Thai-boxing, going one better this time by picking up an incredible nine gold medals."

        "title": "History of Yorkshire County Cricket Club (1883–1918)",
        "text": "The history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1883 to 1918 covers the period from the beginning of Lord Hawke's captaincy until the end of the First World War. The county club had been founded in 1863 by members of the Sheffield Cricket Club whose officials still retained overall control twenty years later, despite the club's stated purpose of representing the whole county of Yorkshire. Complaints from the membership brought about a gradual reorganisation of the committee and, in 1902, the club's offices were relocated from Sheffield to Leeds. While the greatest challenge facing Hawke on his appointment was to unite the club's geographical and social factions, he also had to unite and instil discipline into a team with a reputation for inconsistency and wayward behaviour. Hawke was ultimately successful and, during this period of their history, Yorkshire won the County Championship nine times, the first eight under Hawke's captaincy. These achievements were primarily due to the production of outstanding players who were moulded by Hawke into an efficient, professional unit: they included such great individuals as George Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes and Stanley Jackson.\nHawke's challenges.\nIn an obituary tribute, the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" said that Lord Hawke's \"strength of character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgement and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best and probably the most united county cricket team in England\".\nYorkshire to 1883 was popularly viewed as a team of gifted players with a drink problem and was sometimes described as \"ten drunks and a parson\", the odd man out being Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined the club in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for it.\nAlthough Hawke's primary task as captain was to eradicate the perceived drink problem and lead the team to fulfilment of its potential, his biggest challenge was to unite the club's geographical and social factions. Ever since the foundation in 1863, all fourteen members of the County Committee were elected by Sheffield districts; and all fourteen of these committee men plus the Secretary Joseph Wostinholm were loyal to the President and Treasurer, Michael Ellison. As a result, Ellison and Sheffield effectively controlled Yorkshire cricket. Edmund Carter was one of Ellison's main critics and opponents.\nReorganisation of the committee.\nAt the end of the 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself for the first time since the club's foundation. Admitting that it should represent the views of Yorkshire as a whole, the committee enlarged itself by inviting seven new members: one each from Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds and York to join the existing 14 from Sheffield. So, although the other districts now had a voice, the \"ruling Sheffield clique\" retained complete control.\nEdmund Carter was York's representative and he continued to pursue the issue of representation. Hawke at this time had minimal influence and cannot be seen as anything more than an instrument of change, though his appointment as captain did represent a watershed in the club's history. Whatever the extent of Hawke's involvement in the 1882 machinations, ten years would pass before Yorkshire was fully reorganised to end the Sheffield area's domination and, coincidentally, it was in 1893 that Hawke's team won its first County Championship.\nAmateurs and professionals.\nBefore the appointment of Hawke in 1883, there had been few amateur cricketers in the Yorkshire team, in contrast to the largely amateur county teams in southern England. Although eight amateurs played for Yorkshire in 1882, there were complaints that the committee preferred to play professionals, which was unusual and frowned on by the cricket establishment at the time. This arose partly from the unavailability of suitably talented amateurs and a clash between the county club and the Yorkshire Gentlemen team, based in York, for whom many amateurs appeared. Some amateurs had a reputation for unreliability and the committee believed that the team frequently lost matches when amateurs appeared.\nTransition: 1883 to 1892.\nHawke gradually took over from Emmett in 1883 and would remain as official captain for 27 years. He was careful to take his time and did not make too many changes at first. Although beaten to the Championship by Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire improved in 1883, achieving an unofficial second place, although some authorities named Yorkshire as champions. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Yorkshire \"continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance\". However, Hawke greatly admired Emmett, George Ulyett, Ted Peate and Billy Bates who all represented England. The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. The culmination came when the club, with a side weakened by sackings and retirements, finished in second-last position in the unofficial county table in 1889, with twelve defeats; the fielding was particularly poor. The poor form of the team was reflected in financial disappointment off the field.\nAt the end of the 1889 season, several players were cut from the team, probably at the instigation of Hawke. Ellison, the Yorkshire President, named drunkenness as a factor in comments to the committee. However, the poor results seem to have been anticipated and several players made their debuts in 1889 and 1890 who would go on to be successful for the club, including Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. However, these players took time to become established and stalwarts of the team in the previous decade, such as Louis Hall and George Ulyett, were coming to the end of their careers. The additional strain of the absence of players selected for representative games meant that a slight revival in 1890 to third in the first official County Championship table, was followed by another poor season in 1891 when the team finished eighth out of nine. Criticism of the management produced \"self-defence in the annual report\" and, in 1893, the club was reorganised to properly represent the whole county. Further reorganisation came when Ellison died in 1898 and Hawke assumed the club presidency as well as captaincy; when Wostinholm retired in 1902 after being club secretary for 38 years, the county offices were moved from Sheffield to the more central location of Leeds.\nYorkshire improved during 1892, making a good start to the season by being undefeated until mid-June but fading badly to finish sixth. More promise for the future came in the debut of John Tunnicliffe and David Denton and the success of some of the younger players.\nYorkshire's first titles: 1893 to 1896.\nIn 1893, the same year that the club was finally reorganised, Yorkshire won their first official County Championship after a season in which no individual stood out but the team performed successfully as a unit; Hodgson writes it was \"perhaps ... the first confirmation of Hawke's striving for teamwork and discipline\". This season was the only one of the first six in Championship history which Surrey did not win and the southern county added victories in 1894 and 1895 as Yorkshire achieved second and third places respectively. But the team continued to develop as Brown and Tunnicliffe established an effective opening partnership, Denton proved an effective, fast scoring batsman and Jackson showed himself to be a quality all-rounder and Peel, Ted Wainwright and the emerging George Hirst carried the bowling attack. The fielding also became far more specialised and efficient.\nYorkshire historian R.S. Holmes described Yorkshire as \"prodigious\" in 1896, when the batsmen scored 17 individual centuries and 12 men averaged more than 20 with the bat. In a good summer for batting, the team scored more than 400 runs in an innings five times, with scores of 543 against Sussex, 660 against Leicestershire and 887 against Warwickshire. The latter innings, containing four centuries and lasting more than two days, remains the highest total in the County Championship, as of February 2011. The debut of Schofield Haigh strengthened a bowling attack which already contained four front-line bowlers and Yorkshire won their second County Championship.\nWinter payments and increased membership.\nThat winter, Hawke began the practice of paying the professionals over the winter, initially £2 per week; the scheme was later modified to include bonuses. Yorkshire fell to fourth place in 1897. Peel was sacked after appearing drunk on the field at Chesterfield after being left out of the side. He was replaced in the team for the next season by Wilfred Rhodes, who took 141 wickets for Yorkshire in a wet season which produced a succession of pitches helpful to spinners. Rhodes would remain in the team until 1930, scoring 39,772 runs and taking 4,184 wickets in his first-class career. In the same season, Brown and Tunnicliffe established a record partnership for the first wicket when they scored 554 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield. Good performances in the season from Jackson, Haigh and Tunnicliffe brought Yorkshire their third Championship and, despite injuries and poor form hampering Yorkshire the following year, only a defeat late in the season by Kent prevented the retention of the title.\nThe increased appeal of the club following the reorganisation during the 1890s and its increasing success on the field resulted in the membership increasing from around 175 in 1893 to almost 1,000 in 1897 and over 3,000 in 1903.\nThree successive titles: 1900 to 1902.\nBetween 1900 and 1902, Yorkshire lost only twice in the County Championship, both times to Somerset. In 1900, the team won the Championship without losing to another county, and Rhodes and Haigh dominated the bowling; only two teams scored more than 300 against them. The following season, Rhodes and Hirst were the successful bowlers as injury curtailed Haigh's season. In effect, only 13 players appeared for Yorkshire as the Championship was retained. However, the match against Somerset at Headingley provided a surprise. The visitors had scored just 87 and Yorkshire established a big lead with a total of 325. But Somerset scored 630 in the second innings and dismissed the County Champions for 111, winning by 279 runs. In contrast, Nottinghamshire were bowled out for only 13 runs a month later. After this season, important batsman Frank Mitchell departed to live in South Africa, but Jackson, who had been fighting in the Boer War since 1900, returned. Yorkshire won their third successive Championship in 1902 as Haigh and Rhodes resumed their successful pairing; in May and June, no opposing batting line-up managed to score 130 for 13 successive innings. However, Somerset again defeated Yorkshire.\nJoseph Wolstinholm retired as club secretary after the 1902 season and was succeeded by Frederick Toone who had previously been the secretary at Leicestershire. Toone held the post until his death in June 1930 and formed a successful liaison with Hawke, who praised him for increasing the membership from 3,000 in 1903 to over 7,000 ten years later. Toone and Hawke worked together to improve the terms and conditions of professional players' contracts. To 1914, they were paid £5 for a home match and £6 for an away match with a £1 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers' Friendly Society and were paid a winter wage of £2 a week.\n1903 to 1914.\nYorkshire remained a strong championship contender through the 1903 to 1914 seasons and won a further three titles in this period, also finishing as runners-up three times. They won their seventh title in 1905 after being third and second in 1903 and 1904 respectively.\nIn 1906, George Hirst achieved a unique \"double-double\" by scoring 2,385 runs and taking 208 wickets, but the true mark of his greatness as a player was \"the capacity to succeed in the hours of greatest need\". Wilfred Rhodes, meanwhile, set himself the goal of improving his batting to be recognised as a genuine all-rounder in his own right and was so successful that he rose from no.11 in the order to become Jack Hobbs' regular opening partner in the England team. David Denton scored 2,000 runs in a season four times and, in the wet summer of 1912, only he and Hobbs achieved the target.\nThe 1906 championship was decided on the last day of the season. Yorkshire lost to Gloucestershire by a single run and were overtaken by Kent, who won their last match against Hampshire by an innings. Having finished third in 1907, Yorkshire went through the 1908 season unbeaten and bowled Northamptonshire out for 27 and 15, the aggregate score of 42 being the lowest in English first-class cricket. \"Old Ebor\" called 1908 the \"clean sheet championship\" and only twice in all matches did Yorkshire concede 300 in an innings.\nYorkshire finished third in 1909 but then dropped to eighth and seventh in the next two seasons before a recovery in 1912 brought their last title before the First World War. While Hirst, Rhodes and Denton continued to excel, Yorkshire gained much in the last four years before the war from two new all-rounders, Major Booth and Alonzo Drake, both of whom were an outstanding success. Another newcomer was Arthur Dolphin, who replaced the retired David Hunter as first-choice wicketkeeper. In 1913 and the unfinished 1914 season, Yorkshire finished second and fourth.\nLord Hawke played only a few matches in 1909 and formally resigned as captain in 1910. He was succeeded by Everard Radcliffe, who held the post until the end of the 1911 season; and then by Sir Archibald White, who led the team until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914."

        "title": "International Judge of Sailing",
        "text": "Judges are a type of race official used during the running of sailing races run under the Racing Rules of Sailing. Their role is primarily linked to being on a protest committee which is a panel of judges. In sailing, unlike many sports, due to the practical considerations involved (being on the water), umpiring (refereeing) is not very common. In the event of competitors not being able to resolve issues afloat, then a competitor or race committee may bring an issue in front of a protest committee for their consideration. The International Sailing Federation helps train its member national authorities many of whom have a national judges program. The most experienced become International Judges recognised by the International Sailing Federation."

        "title": "Aaron Sanchez (baseball)",
        "text": "Aaron Jacob Sanchez (born July 1, 1992) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants, Washington Nationals and Minnesota Twins. He was drafted by the Blue Jays in the first round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, and made his MLB debut in 2014. In 2015, Sanchez was ranked by MLB as the number 3 prospect in the Blue Jays' organization, and the 44th best prospect in baseball.\nEarly life.\nSanchez was born in Barstow, California, to Lynn Shipley (née Gesky). She left Aaron's biological father, Frank Sanchez, while pregnant with him. Lynn later married Mike Shipley, who was drafted in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft by the California Angels. Shipley's pitching career ended when he suffered a left shoulder injury; he then took a coaching position at Barstow Community College.\nSanchez attended Barstow High School, where he posted a 7–0 win–loss record, 0.73 earned run average (ERA), and 104 strikeouts in 57 innings pitched. He also batted .403 with five home runs.\nBaseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays selected Sanchez in the first round, with the 34th selection overall, of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He spent the 2010 season with the Gulf Coast League Blue Jays and the New York–Penn League Auburn Doubledays, posting a combined record of 0–3 with a 2.16 ERA and 37 strikeouts through 10 starts. In 2011, Sanchez split time with the Bluefield Blue Jays of the Appalachian League and the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League, compiling a record of 3–3 with an ERA of 5.30 and 56 strikeouts through 14 appearances, 9 of which were starts. Sanchez spent the 2012 season with the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, pitching to an 8–5 record, 2.49 ERA, and 97 strikeouts in 90 innings.\nOn January 29, 2013, Sanchez was named number 35 on MLB's Top 100 Prospects list. On July 26, 2013, Sanchez was ranked number 24 on MLB's revised Top 100 Prospects list, and the number 1 prospect in the Blue Jays organization. He spent the 2013 minor league season with the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays, posting a 4–5 win–loss record, 3.34 ERA, and 75 strikeouts in 86 innings. He played for the Salt River Rafters of the Arizona Fall League after the minor league season ended, and posted a 1.16 ERA in 6 starts for the team.\nIn February 2014, Sanchez was ranked as the 32nd best prospect in baseball by Baseball America. He attended 2014 spring training and was sent to the minor league camp on March 22. Sanchez went to Montreal with the Blue Jays for a two-game exhibition series on March 28 and 29 against the New York Mets and was the pitcher of record in the second game. In 2014 spring training, Sanchez pitched to a 2–0 record with a 0.00 ERA. He started the 2014 season with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and was promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on June 12. He struggled with control, issuing 17 walks in 32 Triple-A innings, and on July 17, it was announced that he would be moved to the bullpen. On July 22, he was called up to the Major League club.\nToronto Blue Jays.\n2014–2015.\nOn July 22, 2014, it was announced that Sanchez had been promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays to pitch out of the bullpen. He made his debut on July 23, pitching 2 innings and recording 2 strikeouts against the Boston Red Sox. On July 27, Sanchez earned his first Major League win, pitching 2 innings against the New York Yankees. On August 30, he recorded his first major league save, pitching 2 innings and preserving a 2–0 lead over the Yankees. Sanchez made 24 appearances for the Blue Jays in 2014, and posted a 2–2 record with a 1.09 ERA, 27 strikeouts, 3 saves, and a 0.70 WHIP in 33 innings pitched.\nHeading into the 2015 season, Sanchez was expected to pitch out of the bullpen, and to compete for the closer role. After Marcus Stroman suffered a torn left ACL on March 10, Sanchez pitched in the rotation for the rest of spring training and earned the fifth starter spot to open the season. He recorded his first win as a starter on April 22, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 4–2. Sanchez pitched 5 innings and yielded two runs on two hits and seven walks with four strikeouts. In winning, he became the first Toronto pitcher to win despite issuing seven walks since Jeff Ware in 1995. On May 8, Sanchez shutout the Boston Red Sox over seven innings, recording his first quality start. The Blue Jays would win the game 7–0. On June 5, he pitched into the ninth inning against the Houston Astros and took the win, 6–2. In addition to setting a career-high in innings pitched, Sanchez did not walk a batter for the first time as a starter. After missing his next scheduled start with upper body soreness, Sanchez was placed on the disabled list on June 14, retroactive to June 6, with a strained lat muscle. On July 19, manager John Gibbons announced that, upon his return from the disabled list, Sanchez would pitch out of the bullpen. He was activated on July 25 in Seattle. Sanchez was ejected from a game against the Kansas City Royals on August 2, for hitting Alcides Escobar with a pitch after home plate umpire Jim Wolf had issued a warning in the first inning. MLB deemed it intentional, and he was suspended for 3 games on August 4. Sanchez made 11 starts in the 2015 regular season and 30 relief appearances, earning a 7–6 record, 3.22 ERA, and 61 strikeouts in 92 innings. He appeared in all five games of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and did not allow a run in 5 innings pitched. In the Championship Series played against the Kansas City Royals, Sanchez made four scoreless relief appearances as the Blue Jays were eliminated from the postseason in six games.\n2016–2019.\nSanchez stated before the start of the 2016 season that he wanted to be in the starting rotation, and had taken part in an intensive off-season workout program with teammate Marcus Stroman. He entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Gavin Floyd, Drew Hutchison, and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, John Gibbons announced that Sanchez would begin the 2016 season in the starting rotation, but insinuated that he would be held to an innings-limit that may move him to the bullpen later in the season. To that point in the spring, Sanchez had thrown 20 innings, yielding only three runs and three walks while striking out 19. Sanchez carried a 9–1 record into the All-Star break, and on July 9, he was named to the 2016 All-Star Game as a replacement for Craig Kimbrel. On July 25, Sanchez won his 10th consecutive decision, defeating the San Diego Padres. In doing so, he became the first Blue Jay since Roy Halladay in 2003 to win at least 10 consecutive decisions. In his start on July 31, Sanchez threw seven innings and surpassed his career-high of 133 innings pitched, raising his 2016 total to 139.\nPrior to the trade deadline, the Blue Jays acquired Francisco Liriano from the Pittsburgh Pirates, and it was widely believed that Liriano would take Sanchez's place in the starting rotation and allow Sanchez to be moved to the bullpen, to better limit his workload in the 2016 season. Several members of the team and media, including Russell Martin and Hall-of-Famer John Smoltz, expressed their desire to see Sanchez remain in the rotation. Entering August, Sanchez had an American League leading 2.71 ERA. After meeting with Sanchez, John Gibbons, and pitching coach Pete Walker, general manager Ross Atkins announced on August 4 that Sanchez would remain a starter, and that the team would use a six-man rotation. Sanchez started against the Cleveland Indians on August 20, and was optioned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays the following day in order to skip his next start. Sanchez was recalled on August 31. He lasted just 3 innings in his start on September 11, leaving due to a blister on his pitching hand. Sanchez's next start was skipped to allow his blister to heal, and he returned to the rotation on September 21. Sanchez earned his 15th win of the season on October 2, lowering his earned run average to 3.00 and earning him the American League ERA title. The win also clinched the first AL Wild Card position. Sanchez closed the 2016 regular season with a 15–2 record, 3.00 ERA, and 161 strikeouts in 192 innings pitched. He started the third game of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and allowed six earned runs in 5 innings. Toronto would win the game in extra innings, 7–6, and eliminate the Rangers from the postseason for the second consecutive season. In the Championship Series, Sanchez started Game 4 and gave the Blue Jays their only win of the series, pitching six innings and allowing only two hits and one earned run to the Cleveland Indians.\nOn October 25, general manager Ross Atkins stated that the organization would not limit Sanchez's innings in the 2017 season. Sanchez finished seventh in voting for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, receiving a third place vote and three fifth place votes. On January 25, 2017, Sanchez was announced as the cover athlete for the Canadian version of MLB The Show 17.\nDuring 2017 spring training, the Blue Jays renewed Sanchez's contract at the MLB-minimum of $535,000. The team had reportedly attempted to negotiate a raise in payment with Sanchez and his agent, Scott Boras, however the offer was refused by Sanchez and Boras. On April 16, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a lingering blister on his right hand. He underwent minor surgery on April 18 to remove a portion of the fingernail on his right middle finger. Sanchez was activated from the disabled list on April 30 and started that day against the Tampa Bay Rays, but lasted only one inning before leaving with a split fingernail. The injury forced Sanchez back to the disabled list the following day. On May 20, 2017, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list for the third time of the season due to the same finger issue. Sanchez was placed on the disabled list for the fourth time in the season on July 22 with a recurrence of the same blister. Sanchez made only 8 starts for the Blue Jays in 2017 due to blister and finger issues, finishing with a 1–3 record and a 4.25 ERA.\nOn January 12, 2018, Sanchez avoided salary arbitration with the Blue Jays by signing a one-year, $2.7 million contract. He struggled to begin the season with inconsistency and control, walking 45 batters in innings. He was placed on the disabled list on June 23 with a contusion in his right hand. He finished the season 4–6 in 20 starts.\nHouston Astros.\nOn July 31, 2019, Sanchez was traded to the Houston Astros, along with Joe Biagini and Cal Stevenson, for outfielder Derek Fisher.\nIn his debut with the Astros on August 3, Sanchez pitched the first six innings of a combined no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners. On August 20, Sanchez left the game early with right pectoral discomfort. An MRI revealed a torn capsule in his right shoulder, and Jeff Luhnow announced on September 5 that Sanchez would miss the rest of the 2019 season and possibly the 2020 season as well.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn February 21, 2021, after sitting out the Covid-shortened 2020 season due to injury, Sanchez agreed to a one-year, $4M contract with the San Francisco Giants. On June 20, he was placed on the 60-day injured list with right bicep tightness. On August 8, Sanchez was designated for assignment. On August 13, he was placed on unconditional release waivers by the Giants. Through nine games with the Giants (seven starts, two relief outings), Sanchez pitched 35.1 innings with a 3.06 ERA and a WHIP of 1.33.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn March 13, 2022, Sanchez signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He opened the 2022 season with the Rochester Red Wings, until his contract was selected by Washington on April 23. That same day, he started for the Nationals against the San Francisco Giants. He was designated for assignment on May 24, 2022, he cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A on May 28. On May 31, 2022 Sanchez elected free agency.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn June 2, 2022, Sanchez signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins organization. He had his contract selected on August 1. He started that day against the Detroit Tigers, allowing 2 runs and striking out 8 in a no decision. Sanchez was designated for assignment by Minnesota the following day. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to the Triple-A St. Paul Saints on August 5.\nOn August 23, Sanchez was selected back to the major league roster to make a start against the Houston Astros. On September 23, Sanchez was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple–A St. Paul on September 25. On October 3, Sanchez was yet again selected to the major league roster. He elected free agency following the season on November 10.\nOn January 30, 2023, Sanchez re-signed with the Twins on a minor league contract. In 18 games (16 starts) for Triple—A St. Paul, he registered a 4–4 record and 57 strikeouts in 73.0 innings of work. On July 23, Sanchez was released by the Twins organization.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn August 9, 2023, Sanchez signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks organization.

        "text": "Benjamin Street (born February 13, 1987) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for EHC Red Bull München of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). An undrafted player, Street played five seasons of college hockey with the Wisconsin Badgers before turning professional in 2010. He joined the Calgary Flames organization in 2012 before signing with the Colorado Avalanche in 2014. He has also played with the Detroit Red Wings, Anaheim Ducks and New Jersey Devils.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Street played in the 2000 and 2001 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Burnaby.\nStreet played his junior hockey with the Salmon Arm Silverbacks of the British Columbia Hockey League. After two seasons there, he joined the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey program in 2005. He played 171 games for the Badgers between 2005 and 2010, scoring 47 goals and recording 94 points. Street was a member of the Badgers' 2006 national championship team, and shared the team's captaincy in his junior and senior seasons. He was named to numerous academic All-Conference teams. Street was named the recipient of Wisconsin's Ivan B. Williamson Scholastic Award in 2009–10, and to both the Academic All-Big Ten and Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) All-Academic teams for four consecutive years between 2007 and 2010.\nThe five-foot-eleven, 185-pound Street went unselected in an NHL Entry Draft, but his work ethic with the Badgers helped him earn a professional contract in the Pittsburgh Penguins organization in 2010. He was assigned to the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL to begin the 2010–11 season where he posted 24 goals and 51 points in just 38 games. His performance earned him a promotion to the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins mid-season after injuries in Pittsburgh led to roster openings for the AHL squad. Street finished the season in the AHL, scoring 23 points in 36 games and appearing in the Calder Cup playoffs with the team. Despite playing only half of the ECHL season, Street was voted that league's Rookie of the Year. He returned to the Wilkes-Barre-Scranton Penguins in 2011–12 on an AHL contract, where he had 57 points in 71 games.\nStreet's chances of reaching the NHL with the Penguins were limited, as Pittsburgh already had several top centres, so he chose to leave the organization as a free agent. He chose to sign with the Calgary Flames, a team with less depth at the position. The contract was his first NHL deal, a two-year, two-way contract that would pay him $575,000 if he played in the NHL, and $105,000 in the AHL. Street began the season in the AHL with the Abbotsford Heat, but sought to impress the Flames' coaching staff during the NHL's mini-training camp following the 2012–13 NHL lockout. Street was leading the Heat in scoring with 31 points in 44 games when an injury to Mikael Backlund led to his recall to the Calgary Flames on February 8, 2013. He made his NHL debut the following night in a 5–1 loss to the Vancouver Canucks.\nOn November 1, 2012, Street and Abbotsford Heat teammate, Steve McCarthy, set an AHL record for the fastest two successive goals scored. McCarthy beat Toronto Marlies goaltender, Ben Scrivens on a short handed opportunity four minutes and twenty-eight seconds into the third period.

        "text": "The triathlon events at the 2012 Summer Olympics were held in Hyde Park in London, United Kingdom, with the women's triathlon held on 4 August and the men's on 7 August. 110 triathletes from 39 countries competed with 55 men and 55 women competing. The races were held over the \"international distance\" (also called \"Olympic distance\") and consisted of swimming, road cycling, and road running.\nThe men's race was held on 7 August 2012. A group of six finished the swim leg in a lead group. A large lead group of athletes were together at the end of the cycling leg but Alistair Brownlee broke away on the run to win the gold medal with Javier Gómez in second and Jonathan Brownlee in third. The women's race was held on 4 August 2012. A group of seven women finished the swim leg in a lead group. A large lead group of 22 athletes were together at the end of the cycling leg with a gap of over a minute and a half over the rest of the field. A group of five athletes formed on the running leg; Nicola Spirig, Lisa Nordén, Erin Densham, Sarah Groff and Helen Jenkins and held together for most of the run. Jenkins was dropped with two kilometres to go before Groff was dropped, also on the last lap. In the ensuing sprint finish Spirig beat Nordén by 15 centimetres in a photo finish with both athletes recording the same time. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win the bronze medal.\nGreat Britain topped the medal tally with one gold medal and one bronze medal, both in the men's race. Switzerland became the first nation to win two gold medals in Olympic triathlon and Australia won its fifth medal, the most in Olympic triathlon history to that point.\nQualification.\nQualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes. Once eight NOCs had qualified three athletes; a NOC was limited to two entries. A NOC with an athlete who won one of the five continental championships (Africa, Asia, Pan America, Europe and Oceania) were given one place in the event. Additionally, three places were available for the NOC of the medallists at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Qualification Event. Another 38 places were available to the NOCs with the highest ranked athletes on the ITU Olympic Qualification List on 31 May 2012. If an athlete had already qualified through another method the NOC did not receive another quota with it instead going to the next NOC on the ITU Olympic Qualification List. Five more entries into the event were given to one NOC per continental region. This was based on the ITU Olympic Qualification List with the highest ranked athlete from a non-qualified NOC in their continental region qualifying a place for their NOC in the event. One was given to the Great Britain NOC as the hosts but as they had already gained a place, the host place was given to the highest eligible athlete on the ITU Olympic Qualification List's NOC. The final two places for the event was given to two NOCs chosen by the Tripartite Commission.\nFor all qualification places the qualified NOC had the right to select any athlete who, by 31 May 2012, were in the top 140 of the ITU Olympic Qualification List, in the top 140 of the 2012 ITU World Triathlon Series or in the top 140 of the ITU Points List.\nCourse.\nThe events were contested in Hyde Park in Central London, a park opened in 1637. The swim started on the north side of The Serpentine and the course was just one lap. After competing in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course Laura Bennett said that the swim was the hardest part of the course: \"The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.\" Erin Densham said that: \"The swim is going to play a big role. They have said before you can’t win the race in the swim but you can definitely lose it. Honestly there is no knowing how it's going to go but it's going to be hard and fast.\"\nAfter the swim there was then a transition zone in front of the main grandstand. The competitors then started a bike leg consisting of seven laps. The cyclists first rode down Serpentine Road towards West Carriage Drive before changing direction and cycling to Hyde Park Corner. The course then quickly turned left towards Hyde Park to go past Buckingham Palace on Constitution Hill. After passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclists turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossed through the transition area before starting the next lap.\nThe final discipline was the run, four-laps of a loop around The Serpentine on flat ground.\nThe course was designed to be as spectator-friendly as possible. The athletes passed through the main grandstand area 12 times. The triathlon events were two of the few events with free viewing points.\nEvent summary.\nThe men's triathlon took place on 7 August 2012, featuring 55 men from 32 countries. Richard Varga (Slovakia) led early in the swim leg and held the lead to come out of the water first. His swim leg split time was 16minutes and 56seconds, fourseconds faster than Javier Gómez (Spain) and those two; along with Alistair Brownlee (Great Britain), Jonathan Brownlee (Great Britain), Ivan Vasiliev (Russia) and Alessandro Fabian (Italy); formed a lead group of six that had an 11second gap over the rest of the field. At the transition between the running and cycling legs, Jonathan Brownlee was given a 15second penalty for riding his bike before the transition zone. On the ride leg the race reformed with a 22-man strong group together for the majority of the discipline. Alistair Brownlee started to run away from the rest of the field at the start of the running leg with only his brother and Gómez attempting to follow him. Jonathan Brownlee was dropped from the group at approximately halfway through the run and then Alistair Brownlee dropped Gómez with to go. Alistair Brownlee would go on to win the race in a time of onehour, 46minutes and 25seconds, beating Gómez by 11seconds. Despite having to serve his time penalty at the end of the second-last running lap, Jonathan Brownlee held on to the bronze medal position, 20seconds behind Gómez and 18seconds in front of fourth-placed David Hauss (France). Alistair Brownlee criticised the penalty that he thought cost his brother the silver medal: \"I've never been a fan of these penalties, I think they're ruining the sport.\" Alistair also called the rules \"disgusting\" and accused triathlon organisers of \"ruining\" the sport.\nThe women's triathlon took place on 4 August 2012, featuring 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first in a time of 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In the early stages of the bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after being dropped earlier on in the race. In the final kilometre Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.\nMedal table.\nGreat Britain was the only nation to win two medals in the triathlon events at the 2012 Summer Olympics with one gold medal and one bronze medal, both in the men's race. Switzerland became the first nation to win a second gold medal in Olympic triathlon after Spirig followed Brigitte McMahon (a gold medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics) in becoming an Olympic champion. Australia won its fifth Olympic medal with Densham's bronze which is more than any other nation to that point. Sweden, Spain and Great Britain all won their first Olympic triathlon medal."

        "text": "A climbing peak () may refer to a mountain or hill peak or a rock formation that has to be ascended by climbing. The term is common in Germany where it is specifically used of free-standing rock formations in the climbing regions of Saxon Switzerland, Zittau Mountains and other nearby ranges in the German Central Uplands that can only be summitted via climbing routes of at least grade I on the UIAA scale or by jumping from nearby rocks or massifs. As a general rule, they must have a topographic prominence of at least 10 metres to qualify. In Saxon Switzerland the Saxon Climbing Regulations do not require any minimum height, but define climbing peaks as \nAnother requirement is its recognition by the responsible sub-committee of the Saxon Climbers' Federation (SBB) and the responsible conservation authorities. For hikers these authorized summits may often be recognised by the presence of a summit register and abseiling anchor points.\nIn other climbing areas, such as those in Bohemian Switzerland, there are other exceptions. There, climbing peaks only need to have a significant rock face - the lowest side of which has to be less than 10 m high, but at least 6 m high."

Designated climbing rocks are listed in climbing guidebooks and are usually incorporated and marked within the climbing areas of the alpine clubs. The concept is mainly relevant to climbing outside or on the fringes of the Alps. Special climbing regulations normally apply to climbing rocks, such as those for Saxon Switzerland, and there are usually restrictions to take account of conservation laws and requirements.\nExamples of climbing rocks in Germany are the Alpawand (over 600 metres height difference), the Asselstein (58 m) and the Falkenstein in Saxon Switzerland. The German Alpine Club (DAV) maintains a website listing over 3,000 individual rocks in 28 climbing regions with around 250 climbing areas."

        "text": "Sam Barry (born 27 January 1992) is an Irish professional tennis player. He was born and raised in Limerick, Ireland.\nCareer.\nJuniors.\nIn 2008, Barry won the under-18 boy's title at the National Junior Tennis Championships and the ITF U-18 boys' singles title in Tallinn, Estonia. This was his first ITF under-18 title following defeats in the finals of similar events in Qatar and Turkmenistan the previous year. Barry had a strong finish to 2008, winning both the Semen Gresik Widjojo Soejono Junior Championships in Surabaya and the Solo Open International Junior Championships in Java in November. The following year, Barry was successful at the Torneig ITF Andorra La Vella, defeating Andrés Artuñedo in the final. Throughout 2010, he competed in the Boys Singles at the Australian Open, French Open and US Open. His 2nd round defeat to Damir Džumhur at the U.S. Open was to be his last match in the under-18 category. As a junior player, Barry reached a career-high ranking of 60th in the world U-18 boys' singles.\nProfessional.\nHe turned professional in October 2010 and immediately reached the quarter-final of his first tournament, the F29 Futures in Naples. Barry continued to show promise in 2010 with notable wins over Jiri Kosler in the Thalassa Cup, and followed this up in 2011 with the strongest performance on his senior career in the Thailand F2 Futures, reaching the semi-finals and defeating Joshua Milton along the way.\nBarry initially chose to focus on doubles. He has won 9 doubles tournaments on the Futures circuit and finished runner-up in 14 others, as well as reaching the final of the 2011 Aegon Pro-Series Loughborough tournament on the ATP Challenger Tour in November 2011 with Daniel Glancy, losing to the top 100 ranked British duo of Jamie Delgado and Jonathan Marray. Barry usually partners compatriots Glancy, James Cluskey and Colin O'Brien in tournaments.\nFrom 2012 onwards, Barry's energies were more focussed on the singles game, and he reached the singles main draw of a challenger for the first time in September 2013 at the ATP Roller Open, where he lost in the first round to former top-20 player Paul-Henri Mathieu. He completed the year with victory in his first Futures final in December, defeating Liam Broady to claim the Qatar F3 Futures title in Doha.\nIn March 2014, Barry reached the final of the Great Britain F8 Futures, however he finished runner-up to Marcus Willis. This propelled him to a career-high ranking of 392 on 23 March 2014. He followed this up on 11 May with victory over Adrien Bossel at the Israel F5 Futures in Ashkelon, reaching the final without dropping a set. Barry then went on an impressive run in doubles, winning three consecutive tournaments. He then picked up his second futures title of the year, winning another Israeli futures event, this time in Herzliya.\nHis subsequent rise up the rankings enabled him to gain direct acceptance to challenger level tournaments and he competed at the OEC Kaohsiung but was defeated in his first round match.\nBarry reached his highest ranking of 280th in the world and became Irish no.1 on 15 May 2015 after reaching the final of the Bangkok Challenger.\nDavis Cup.\nBarry has played ten rubbers for the Ireland Davis Cup team, winning five and losing five. He pulled off an impressive win over 2010 Wimbledon junior champion Márton Fucsovics in a tie against Hungary in February 2012. This win did come in a dead rubber, however, with Ireland 3–1 down at the time.\nDoubles titles.\nWins (14)\nRunner-up (15)"

        "text": "Juan Manuel \"Lobito\" Fernández (born July 22, 1990) is an Argentine-Italian professional basketball player for Pallacanestro Trieste of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). His father, Gustavo, was a point guard for a number of professional basketball teams in Argentina. Pepe Sánchez convinced Fernández to play basketball at his alma mater, Temple University, and Fernández joined the Temple Owls team in December 2008. As a sophomore, he was named Atlantic 10 Tournament Most Valuable Player. After struggling through a prolonged shooting slump as a junior, he hit an off-balance 18-foot shot with .4 seconds remaining to defeat Penn State in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and was named to the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team. In addition to his college exploits, he defended Argentina bringing home a gold medal at the 2008 Under-18 World Championship.\nEarly life.\nFernández was born on July 22, 1990, in Rio Tercero, Argentina to Gustavo Fernández and Nancy Fiandrino. His father was a point guard for a number of professional basketball teams in Argentina. He earned the nickname \"Lobito\" (Spanish for \"little wolf\") after starring on a basketball team with a wolf mascot. Juan Fernández's little brother, also named Gustavo, fell out of a chair when he was a toddler and used a wheelchair for life. He is one of the top wheelchair tennis players in the world under the age of 18. The family operates the Pinot Grigio restaurant in Río Tercero.\nAt the urging of his father, Juan Fernández began playing basketball when he was six years old. He described himself as a \"fat little kid\" who was more interested in being a soccer goalie at first. When Fernández showed star potential on junior club teams, he was given the \"Lobito\" nickname, while his father became known as \"Lobo\".\nAs a teenager, Fernández was offered deals to play in the Spanish B and C league when he graduated from Dr. Alexis Carrel High School. At the same time, he was considering playing college basketball in the United States. His mother went to Connecticut for six months to learn English, and she persuaded him that it would be a good place to be a student-athlete. Pepe Sánchez, an Argentine basketball player who played college basketball at Temple University, offered some advice in an e-mail:\nSánchez had recommended Fernández to the coach of his alma mater, Fran Dunphy. Dunphy dispatched assistant Matt Langel to recruit Fernández to Temple. On one recruiting trip, Langel drove for 10 hours on the backroads of Argentina searching for Fernández, who was practicing with the national team instead of home in Rio Tercero as Langel had thought. After his official visit to the Philadelphia campus in September 2008, Fernández signed his letter of intent. He graduated high school in December, and enrolled at Temple.\nCollege career.\nFreshman.\nFernández played college basketball with the Temple Owls men's basketball team. At Temple, Fernández drew immediate comparisons to Sánchez; he was dubbed \"Pepe Sánchez with a jump shot.\" He chose Sánchez's jersey, number 4, but Fernández said this was to honor his father. Unfamiliar with the practice of lifting weights, Fernández wore gloves to his first session, drawing the laughs of his teammates. Against Kent State, Fernández contributed eight points and four assists in his Temple debut, three days after arriving in the United States. He scored a season-high 19 points on February 15, 2009, to power Temple past Duquesne 78–73. The Owls reached the 2009 NCAA tournament after winning the Atlantic 10 tournament title. In 23 games, he averaged 5.5 points and 2.7 assists per game on the basketball court, and earned a 3.0 grade point average in the classroom.\nSophomore.\nIn his sophomore year, Fernández was moved to shooting guard in the Temple starting lineup, a change that felt strange for him as he was used to playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game. He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game, second on the team, and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage (45.3%). Fernández scored in double figures in 23 games. On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half. He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms.\nFernández became a fan favorite at Temple. Every time he made a three-pointer against Bowling Green, the Temple student section chanted \"Ole, ole, ole!\" Seton Hall fans were not so kind, mocking him with \"Messi, Messi.\" Little did they realize that Lionel Messi was one of his favorite soccer players, and their comments only served as inspiration. On his return flights to Argentina, strangers frequently went up to Fernández to congratulate him on his recent performances.\nFernández helped Temple to a 29–5 season, capture a share of the Atlantic 10 conference regular season championship with a 14–2 record, and earn a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Tournament Most Valuable Player after scoring 18 points in the final versus Richmond. In the NCAA Tournament, Temple was seeded fifth and matched up with 12 seed Cornell in the first round. Fernández had 14 points, but his Owls were upset by the Big Red 78–65. Following the season, Fernandez was an All-Atlantic 10 Honorable Mention selection.\nJunior.\nWith the graduation of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched back to his natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted the majority of the season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games in the middle of the season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved.\nFernández led Temple to a 26–8 record and a seven seed in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the Round of 64, he hit an off-balance 18-foot shot with .4 seconds to play to defeat Penn State, 66–64, and finished with a season-high 23 points. In the timeout that preceded the shot, teammate Khalif Wyatt convinced coach Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernández, despite his struggles during the season. Fernández finished with 14 points against San Diego State, but the Owls fell in double overtime. He was named to the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team and Academic Team at the conclusion of the regular season and was a Philadelphia Big Five Second Team honoree.\nSenior.\nFernández was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 First Team selection as a senior. He was named to the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team and Academic Team at the conclusion of the regular season.\nProfessional career.\nFernández began his professional career in 2012, after signing with the Italian League club Olimpia Milano. At the beginning of the 2012–13 season he was loaned to Centrale del Latte Brescia of the Italian Second Division. In 40 games played in the Italian 2nd Division, he averaged 28.2 minutes, 8.8 points and 4.8 assists per game.\nHe was then released by Olimpia Milano, and signed with the first division Italian League club Dinamo Sassari.\nFor the next season he returned to Centrale del Latte Brescia of the Italian Second Division. Posting 12.7 PPG and 5 APG in 23 games of the 2014-15 regular season.\nIn the 2015-16 season \"Lobito\" played in 28 games of the regular season, he averaged 23 minutes, 10.6 points and 4.3 assists per game. In the Second Division playoffs he started 16 games, averaged 8.1 points and 4.3 assist per game helping Basket Brescia Leonessa win the finals against Fortitudo Bologna in 5 games and returning to Italian League after 28 years.\nIn June 2017, Fernandez signed with Pallacanestro Trieste.

        "text": "George Christopher Jackson (January 2, 1882 – November 26, 1972), known also as \"Hickory\" Jackson, was a professional baseball player whose career spanned 27 seasons, three of which were spent in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Boston Rustlers/Braves (1911–13). Over his major league career, he compiled a .285 batting average with 85 runs scored, 158 hits, 24 doubles, seven triples, four home runs, 73 runs batted in, and 34 stolen bases in 152 games played. Jackson's professional career started in the minor leagues with the Jackson Senators.\nThe majority of Jackson's career was spent in the minor leagues. In 1911, he broke into the major leagues as a member of the Boston Rustlers. He spent parts of the next two seasons with the Boston National League club. In 1913, Jackson was sent-down the minor leagues. From there, he played with the Buffalo Bisons (1913–17), Fort Worth Panthers (1918), San Antonio Bronchos (1919), Shreveport Gassers (1920–23) Beaumont Exporters (1923), Tyler Trojans (1924–25, 1927–28), Greenville Hunters (1926), Laurel Cardinals (1929), El Dorado Lions (1930–32). Over his career in the minors, Jackson batted .297 with 2,453 hits, 443 doubles, 74 triples, and 157 home runs in 2,365 games played.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Christopher Jackson was born on January 2, 1882, in Springfield, Missouri, to George R., and Elmyra Jackson of England, and Pennsylvania, respectively. By 1900, the Jackson family was living in Hill County, Texas. George C. Jackson worked on his family farm in Blum, Texas, at a young age. In his youth, Jackson recalled loving athletics. He stated that whenever he had any down-time, he would throw a baseball against his barn and catch it, or play a pick-up game with the farm hands.\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", Jackson displayed a \"wonderful\" ability to catch the baseball in his youth. He would use a small branch as a baseball bat. Jackson played with the Blum amateur baseball team when he was young. He was given the carfare it took to get to the ballpark by his manager in exchange for playing. Jackson worked as an acrobat at the age of 18. He had five siblings; brothers William, Kennith, and Robert; and sisters Lula, and Elmyra.\nProfessional career.\nEarly minor league career (1906–1911).\nJackson's professional baseball career started in 1906 as a pitcher for the Jackson Senators of the Class-D Jackson Senators. As a member of the Senators, Jackson played with past, and future Major League Baseball players Harry Betts, Orth Collins, Bill Dammann, Tom Gettinger, Billy Kinloch, Jack Ryan, and Elmer Steele. Jackson compiled a record of 1–2 with 20 hits allowed, 16 runs allowed, and eight base on balls issued that season. In 1907, Jackson was discovered by the Dallas Giants of the Class-C Texas League whose management had heard of Jackson through the local newspapers, which described him as a \"wonderful ball player\". The Giants signed Jackson, and farmed him out to the Lake Charles Creoles of the Class-D Gulf Coast League, where he was used as a first baseman. Jackson was the only player on the Lake Charles club to ever go on to play in the MLB. On the season, Jackson batted .281 with 43 hits, six doubles, two triples, and one home run in 44 games played.\nIn 1908, the Dallas Giants, who had farmed Jackson out to the Lake Charles Creoles a year prior, asked him to report to the Dallas club. That season, he was used as an outfielder. Jackson batted .242 with 53 hits, 11 doubles, three triples, and one home run in 74 games played. Jackson re-signed with the Giants in 1909. On the season, he batted .271 with 65 runs scored, 117 hits, 21 doubles, three triples, six home runs, and 53 stolen bases in 129 games played. He was tied for third in the league in triples. Jackson again joined the Dallas club in 1910. He batted .280 with 80 runs scored, 144 hits, 17 doubles, seven triples, five home run, and 55 stolen bases in 155 games played.\nTowards the end of the 1910 season, Jackson was sold by the Dallas Giants to the Memphis Turtles of the Class-A Southern Association. In those games, he compiled three hits, two of which were doubles, in 18 at-bats. At the start of the 1911 season, Jackson re-signed with the Memphis Turtles. During the season, Billy Hamilton, who was working as a scout from the Boston Rustlers was dispatched to report back on Memphis' shortstop Karl Crandall, who was the brother on MLB player Doc Crandall. When Hamilton arrived in Memphis, he was not impressed by the shortstop. However, he noticed Jackson in the outfield. Hamilton followed the Memphis club for two weeks watching Jackson. Finally, Hamilton reported his finding back to Boston's front office. He was ordered to sign Jackson. With Memphis that season, Jackson batted .260 with 78 hits, 17 doubles, four triples, and two home runs in 85 games played.\nBoston Rustlers/Braves (1911–13).\nIn exchange for allowing the Boston Rustlers to sign Jackson, the Memphis Turtles was given cash considerations, and pitcher Cecil Ferguson. Jackson made his MLB debut on August 2, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. During his debut, he played center field, and collected three hits. \"The Washington Post\" reported that when Jackson \"broke in with a bang\" with Boston, and that his fielding was \"far above par\". They also stated that Jackson had an \"unassuming disposition\", \"has all the confidence in his ability\", \"is fast on his feet\", and is a \"good waiter\". Through late-August, he led the National League in batting average, and averaged a stolen base every game. On August 24, in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Jackson his a sacrifice fly in the eight inning to tie the score at 6–to–6, and hit a tenth inning with a run-scoring single, giving Boston the 8–to–7 win. The \"Reading Eagle\" described Jackson as a \"sensation\". With Boston that season, he batted .347 with 28 runs scored, 51 hits, 11 doubles, two triples, 25 runs batted in (RBIs), and 12 stolen bases in 39 games played. Jackson played in too few of games to qualify for the 1911 batting title.\nJackson joined the Boston club, now renamed the Braves, in March 1912 for spring training. On May 30, Jackson hit his first MLB home run, which was inside-the-park, against Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Nap Rucker. Jackson hit his second career MLB home run on June 17, against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Bert Humphries. Jackson's third home run was also against the Reds, this time off of pitcher George Suggs on August 6. On August 26, during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Jackson hit his fourth, and final home run of the season, which was inside-the-park off of King Cole. It was also the final home run of Jackson's MLB career. On the season, he batted .262 with 55 runs scored, 104 hits, 13 triple, five triples, four home runs, 48 RBIs, and 22 stolen bases in 110 games played. Jackson finished the season tied for third with John Titus in hit by pitches (10), and fifth in strikeouts (72). Jackson was also tied for third with Steve Evans, Josh Devore, Jay Kirke, and Mike Mitchell in errors by an outfielder (15). Jackson played with the Boston Braves again in 1913, but appeared in just three games. In those games, he compiled two runs scored, and three hits in 10 at-bats.\nBuffalo Bisons, and Texas League (1913–1923).\nOn May 14, 1913, the Boston Braves traded Jackson to the Buffalo Bisons of the Double-A International League in exchange for Leslie Mannie. In his first season with Buffalo, Jackson batted .260 with 110 hits, 15 doubles, seven triples, and three home runs in 116 games played. He re-signed with the Bisons in 1914; and batted .269 with 84 hits, 17 doubles, four triples, and four home runs in 97 games played. Jackson spent his third season with the Buffalo club in 1915. He batted .255 with 51 hits, 10 doubles, one triple, and one home run in 78 games played. In 1916, Jackson again played with Buffalo. In 116 games played, he batted .325 with 146 hits, 34 doubles, nine triples, and two home runs. Jackson led the league in doubles. His last season with the Bisons came in 1917. Jackson batted .275 with 111 hits, 20 doubles, three triples, and three home runs in 112 games played.\nJackson joined the Fort Worth Panthers of the Class-B Texas League before the start of the 1918 season. On the season, he batted .305 with 74 hits, 16 doubles, one triple, and three home runs in 69 games played. Jackson signed with the San Antonio Bronchos of the Texas League on June 22, 1919. In September, Jackson suffered a leg injury. On the season, he batted .264 with 75 hits, 10 doubles, one triples, and three home runs in 81 games played. In 1920, Jackson signed with Shreveport Gassers of the Texas League, and played right field. He batted .333 with 164 hits, 31 doubles, nine triples, and six home runs in 133 games played.\nJackson re-signed with the Shreveport club in 1921. On May 5, Jackson hit a single in the eight inning of a game against the Fort Worth Panthers to tie the game at 3–to–3, and later hit a triple in the tenth inning to dive in the winning run, giving the Gassers a 4–to–3 victory. After 38 games that season, Jackson led the Texas League with 14 stolen bases. On August 3, Jackson hit a walk-off home run, giving the Gassers a 12–to–9 victory over the Houston Buffaloes. He batted .310 with 194 hits, 31 doubles, 11 triples, and 10 home runs in 160 games played that season. Jackson was tied for fourth with Joe Connolly in hits that season. In 1922, Jackson batted .344 with 141 hits, 28 doubles, two triples, and 10 home runs in 111 games played with the Gassers that season. He was tied for fourth with Tom Connolly in batting average that season. In 1923, Jackson played with the Shreveport Gassers, and the Beaumont Exporters, both of the Texas League. Between the two clubs, he batted .250 with 64 hits, 11 doubles, three triples, and four home runs in 82 games played.\nLater career (1924–1932).\nIn 1924, Jackson joined the Tyler Trojans of the Class-D East Texas League. On the season, he batted .371 with 154 hits, 31 doubles, and 26 home runs in 110 games played. He finished the season third in the league in home runs, and fourth in batting average. He played with the Tyler club again during the 1925 season. In 92 games played, Jackson batted .362 with 127 hits, 28 doubles, and 16 home runs. In 1926, Jackson joined the Greenville Hunters, who were also in the East Texas League. He was also employed to manage the club. On the season, he batted .289 with 97 hits, 17 doubles, and 10 home runs in 90 games played. Jackson re-joined the Tyler Trojans, who were now members of the Lone Star League in 1927. He batted .294 with 126 hits, 21 doubles, and 21 home runs in 115 games that year. Jackson finished the season second in home runs. He returned as the player-manager for the Trojans in 1928. Jackson batted .331 with 105 hits, 17 doubles, one triples, and 13 triples in 87 games played.\nIn January 1929, Jackson attended a meeting consisting of managers of the Lone Star League. However, at the start of the 1929 season, he was hired as the player-manager of the Laurel Cardinals of the Class-D Cotton States League. On the season, he batted .288 with 69 hits, nine doubles, three triples, and one home run in 72 games played. In 1930, Jackson was signed as the player-manager of the El Dorado Lions.

        "text": "The men's épée was one of ten fencing events on the fencing at the 2000 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-third appearance of the event. The competition was held on 16 September 2000. 42 fencers from 22 nations competed. Each nation was limited to three fencers. The event was won by Pavel Kolobkov of Russia, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's individual épée (Aleksandr Beketov had won in 1996). Russia joined a five-way tie for third-most gold medals in the event at two (behind Italy at six and France at five). Kolobkov, who had a silver medal in 1992 representing the Unified Team, was the 11th man to win multiple medals in the event. France's Hugues Obry took silver in Sydney, returning France to the podium after a one-Games absence snapped a four-Games medal streak. Lee Sang-ki earned South Korea's first medal in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the eight quarterfinalists from 1996 returned: silver medalist Iván Trevejo of Cuba, fourth-place finisher Iván Kovács of Hungary, and seventh-place finisher Kaido Kaaberma of Estonia. Also returning were 1992 gold medalist Éric Srecki of France and silver medalist Pavel Kolobkov of the Unified Team (representing Russia since 1996), both of whom had been defeated in the Round of 16 in 1996, as well as 1988 gold medalist Arnd Schmitt of West Germany (now Germany). Schmitt was the reigning World Champion, having won in 1999. Srecki had won both World Championships before (1995) and after (1997) his Olympic victory. Hugues Obry (1998) and Kolobkov (1993 and 1994) joined them, with the Sydney field including the last four World Champions having won the last six World Championships.\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. France, Sweden, and the United States each appeared for the 21st time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition continued to use the entirely single-elimination (with bronze medal match) format introduced in 1996. All bouts were to 15 touches.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nAs there were more than 32 entrants in this event, ten first round matches were held to reduce the field to 32 fencers.\nMain tournament bracket.\nThe remaining field of 32 fencers competed in a single-elimination tournament to determine the medal winners. Semifinal losers proceeded to a bronze medal match."

        "text": "Easton Archery, formally Jas. D. Easton, Inc., is an American archery equipment company that has existed since 1953. The company was started by James Douglas \"Doug\" Easton (1907–1972), who had made bows and arrows since 1922, and who in 1932 opened Easton's Archery Shop in Los Angeles. After the creation of the manufacturing company in 1953, Easton grew to become the world's leading archery business and pioneered the use of aluminum in sporting goods.\nIn 1960, Doug's son James L. \"Jim\" Easton (1935–2023) joined the business. During the 1960s, the company branched out into ski poles and baseball bats, and in 1969 produced the thermal shroud for the seismometer used in the Apollo 11 moon landing. After Doug's death in 1972, Jim became president. In 1985, Easton formed a subsidiary company, Easton Sports, to engage in the team sports industry. Jas. D. Easton remained the owner of Easton Sports until 2006, when the latter was purchased by Fenway Partners for $400 million.\nThe independent, family owned archery division consists of two companies, Hoyt Archery, Inc. and Easton Technical Products, both located in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The two companies employ approximately 800 people in the manufacture of compound bows, recurve bows, and arrows. Easton arrows have been used to win every Olympic Games title in archery since the restoration of archery to the Olympic program in 1972. Easton Technical Products is also a supplier to the military, medical and outdoor sports industries for high-strength carbon fiber and aluminum alloy tubing. Hoyt and Easton are run as independent divisions of Jas. D. Easton, Inc. Greg Easton is the third generation President of Jas. D. Easton.\nHistory.\nIn 1985, Jas. D. Easton acquired the Curley-Bates Co. and renamed it Easton Sports. The new company manufactured team sports equipment and grew to become a major hockey and baseball company.\nEaston Sports merged with Fenway Partners-owned Riddell Bell in 2006 to form Easton-Bell, later known as BRG Sports. Jim Easton was named chair of the company, which included the Riddell, Bell, and Giro brands. The archery business remained separate. All other Easton brands were divested by BRG in 2014."

        "title": "Archery at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's individual",
        "text": "The women's individual archery event at the 2012 Olympic Games was held from 27 July to 2 August 2012 at Lord's Cricket Ground in London in the United Kingdom. The event was one of four which comprised the 2012 Olympic archery programme of sports and was the eleventh time the women's individual competition was contested as an Olympic event. Forty different nations qualified for the competition, sending a total of sixty-four archers to compete. The defending Olympic champion from 2008 was Zhang Juanjuan of China, who did not compete following her retirement in 2010.\nKi Bo-Bae of South Korea won the gold medal, defeating Mexico's Aída Román in a one-arrow shoot-off to become her nation's seventh female archer to become individual Olympic champion. Mariana Avitia of Mexico finished third, defeating Khatuna Lorig of the United States to win the bronze medal. Román and Avitia became the first Mexican archers to ever win an Olympic medal.\nBackground.\nThe women's individual event has been held as part of every Summer Olympics archery programme since the 1972 Games in Munich. Since the 1984 Summer Olympics, archers from South Korea had dominated the event, claiming six of the previous seven gold medals. Their winning streak was broken at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing when Zhang Juanjuan defeating defending Olympic champion Park Sung-hyun in the final, becoming the first non-South Korean archer to win the women's individual gold medal since Keto Losaberidze of the Soviet Union in 1980.\nIn October 2011 an official test event, the London Archery Classic, was held at the Lord's Cricket Ground to evaluate the venue's preparations and give archers and coaches the chance to familiarise themselves with the location and schedule ahead of the Games the following year. Jung Dasomi of South Korea, who held the top position in the World Archery rankings, won the women's individual event, defeating Poland's Justyna Mospinek in the final. Ki Bo-bae of South Korea won the bronze medal ahead of Japan's Ren Hayakama.\nQualification.\nSixty-four places were available for the event with each National Olympic Committee (NOC) being represented by a maximum of three archers. Qualification was primarily achieved through the World Archery Championships held in Turin in July 2011, with the remaining places allocated to the nations of most successful athletes at a series of continental championships held between October 2011 and May 2012. As host nation Great Britain qualified three places automatically; ten other nations (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, and Ukraine) additionally qualified the maximum berth of archers.\nGreat Britain's national selection trials saw Olympic debutante Amy Oliver and two-time Olympian Naomi Folkard succeed to partner 2004 Olympic bronze medalist Alison Williamson, who became the third British athlete to be selected for a sixth Olympic Games, having made her debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Chekrovolu Swuro and the highly rated 18-year old Deepika Kumari joined 2008 Olympian Bombayla Devi Laishram to spearhead the Indian contingent, the trio having together won silver medal in the women's team event at the 2011 World Archery Championships after defeating the reigning champions South Korea in the semi-finals.\nFormat.\nThe women's individual was an outdoor recurve target archery event. Held under the World Archery-approved rules, archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres with between one and ten points being awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition consisted of three stages: an initial ranking round, five elimination rounds, and two finals matches deciding the medal placings. In the ranking round, each of the 64 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following five-round single-elimination tournament according to their finishing position, the highest-scoring archer receiving the number one seed.\nThe elimination rounds introduced a new format, the Archery Olympic Round, to the Olympic Games. From 1992 until 2008, the elimination matches were decided by each archer shooting 12 arrows, the highest cumulative score determining who progressed to the next round. Approved in 2009 by the sport's governing body, the World Archery Federation, the new Archery Olympic Round was designed to sustain audience interest throughout the knockout matches and prevent encounters from being decided prematurely from a single poor shot. According to the new system, each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the best score from their three arrows won the set, earning two points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to six points was declared the winner. If the match was tied 5-5 after the maximum 5 sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nPre-event.\nIn a preview of the archery competitions published a couple of weeks before the beginning of the Games, the \"Korea Herald\" expressed some reservation about the chances of a South Korean victory in the women's individual event. Although they suggested the women's team should be \"supremely confident\" of a gold medal in their event, the failure to win the individual gold medal in 2008 and the rise of India's Deepika Kumari were highlighted as concerns going forward into the event. Kumari, who was cited by the \"Hindustan Times\" as India's best chance at winning an individual archery medal, in turn was confident that her experience against the Koreans in Archery World Cup matches would serve her well. Speaking at a ceremony marking the departure of athletes to London, she added that her recently acquired status of world number one would only be justified if she came away from the Games having earned an Olympic medal.\nRanking round.\nThe competition began with the ranking round in the afternoon of Friday 27 July, preceding the opening ceremony held later that evening. Ki Bo-bae, Lee Sung-jin, and Tan Ya-ting each tied on 671 points and were only separated by the number of arrows landing in the 10-ring, Ki claiming number one seed with thirty-one 10-scores ahead of Lee and Tan. South Korea's third archer Choi Hyeon-ju struggled with nerves on her Olympic debut and finished 21st overall after being ranked 38th at the round's halfway point. Despite claiming two of the highest seeds for the elimination rounds, Jang Young-sool, the head of the South Korean archery coaching team, was nevertheless disappointed that his archers did not post higher scores. The three British archers had a disappointing ranking round on home soil, Naomi Folkard finishing highest, claiming the 42nd seed.\nElimination rounds.\nWorld number one Deepika Kumari suffered a shock defeat in the opening elimination round which began on the morning of 30 July, losing to 57th seed Amy Oliver of Great Britain in four sets. Kumari blamed the strong winds for her performance and did not appear comfortable in the cool and overcast conditions, failing to shoot a single arrow in the 10-ring. Her defeat was described by the Press Trust of India as a big setback in India's pursuit of Olympic medals, while the BBC lauded Oliver's victory as her greatest career win. Oliver would later lose to Indonesia's Ika Yuliana Rochmawati in the following round. Oliver's teammates Alison Williamson and Folkard fared little better in front of the home crowd, Williamson losing in the first knockout round to Bishindee Urantungalag of Mongolia, while Folkard was eliminated by Mexico's Mariana Avitia in the 1/16 elimination round. The first elimination round also saw Bhutan's participation at the Olympic Games end with Serhab Zam's defeat to Lorig of the United States, the nation having sent just two athletes to London.\nThe final rounds took place on Thursday, 2 August. In the 1/8 elimination round Bérengère Schuh, the sole Frenchwoman in the field, defeated Choi in a one-arrow shoot-off after the South Korean came back from four set points down to tie the match in the fifth set.\nWith windy conditions developing in the afternoon in time for the quarter-finals, Lorig defeated Schuh after a poor third set by the Frenchwoman, who was unable to fully master the conditions, while Avitia emerged as the surprise victor against second-seed Lee. Lee's exit marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that South Korea failed to win at least two medals in the women's individual event.\nKi, the sole South Korean to advance to the semi-finals, dispatched Khatuna Lorig following an upgraded score of one of her arrows after a review in the fourth set. The second semi-final featured Avitia and Román, guaranteeing at least one medal for the Mexican archery contingent. Román advanced to the final against Ki, while Avitia went on to contest the bronze medal match with Lorig.\nMedal matches.\nAvitia appeared more comfortable with the shifting winds in the bronze medal match, which began just after 3:20pm on 2 August, scoring a perfect 30 in the first set and ultimately winning in four sets after Lorig shot a six with her final arrow. Lorig nevertheless managed a shot so precise to the centre of the target that the arrow bounced off the target after striking the camera hole. Three years later the American reflected that she did not have enough time to recover from her semi-final loss to Ki and was unable to properly focus against Avitia, beginning the bronze medal match just fifteen minutes after bowing out of the semi-finals. She commented \"I was so upset not making that gold medal match... [i]t happened so quick, I didn’t have time to talk to anyone. There was no one to tell me, 'Hey, snap out of it.'\" Avitia's victory gave Mexico its first ever Olympic archery medal.\nThe gold medal match between Ki and Román was a close affair. After winning one set apiece with a tie in the second set, Ki shot a perfect 30 in the fourth, only for Román to outscore Ki 27–26 in the fifth and final set, necessitating a shoot-off. Both Ki and Román landed their arrows into the 8-ring, but Ki's was judged to be marginally closer to the centre, giving her the victory.\nKi's win was the seventh time in eight Olympic women's individual events that South Korea had claimed the top honour, and the fourteenth archery gold medal from a possible fifteen for the country since the 1984 Summer Olympics. A tearful Ki later apologised during a press conference after she had been awarded her the gold medal, stating that \"Koreans do not shoot eights\". Román and Avitia meanwhile received a call from the President of Mexico congratulating them on achieving their nation's debut Olympic archery medals. Their double success was the first time since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles that Mexican athletes had won two medals in the same discipline at the same Games, and the first time that it had been achieved by Mexican women.\nRecords.\nBoth the Olympic record score of 673, set by Ukraine's Lina Herasymenko at the 1996 Summer Olympics and equalled by South Korea's Park Sung-hyun at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the existing world record score of 682, set by Park one day before the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, remained intact at the conclusion of the event."

Thirty-two players from 14 nations competed in the event.\nThe competition became embroiled in controversy during the group stage when eight players (two pairs from South Korea and one pair each from China and Indonesia) were ejected from the tournament by the Badminton World Federation after being found guilty of \"not using best efforts\" and \"conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport\" by playing to lose matches in order to manipulate the draw for the knockout stage. In one match, both teams made a series of basic errors, and in one match the maximum rally was just four shots.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament started with a group phase round-robin followed by a knockout stage.\nGroup stage disqualifications.\nA review into two matches in the badminton women's doubles competition played on 31 July was conducted after it appeared that, having already qualified for the knockout stages, players on both sides in each game had been attempting to lose their last group stage matches in order to gain a more favourable draw in the quarter finals.\nThe matches in question were between China's Wang Xiaoli / Yu Yang and South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun / Kim Ha-na in Group A, and South Korea's Ha Jung-eun / Kim Min-jung versus Indonesia's Meiliana Jauhari / Greysia Polii in Group C. After errors began occurring during routine shots in both matches, including shots going long and serves hitting the net, the crowd reacted angrily, and the first game in the match between Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli of China and Jung Kyung Eun and Kim Ha Na of South Korea featured no rallies of more than four shots.\nA South Korean coach claims to have emulated China so as to avoid playing against another Korean team in the knockout stages before the final, and South Korean head coach Sung Han-kook said \"Because they don't want to play the semi-final against each other, so we did the same. We didn't want to play the South Korean team again\".\nIn the second game, the tournament referee initially issued a black card to disqualify the players, but after their team's coaches and officials ran onto the court and remonstrated with him, this was rescinded. Play was allowed to continue while he monitored proceedings, and both the earlier match and this later match were ultimately played to a conclusion, completing the draw for the quarter finals (group B and D having concluded earlier in the day).\nTechnical delegate Paisan Rangsikitpho said after the Group A match, \"If it's true what I hear, this is a shame and I don't like it. And I'm not going to accept anything that I don't like at all. It's not in a good spirit...I apologise to the public, I apologise for everyone and I am not happy.\"\nOn 1 August 2012, following a Badminton World Federation review, all eight players were found guilty of \"not using best efforts\" and \"conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport\" and were ejected from the tournament. The quarter-finals then continued with the ejected teams being replaced by the other teams from their groups.\nThe decision was highly debated; some argued that while the teams have not been performing their best effort to win the game at hand, they had been in fact doing their best to win the \"tournament\", and that conserving resources in early matches is a common practice in every competitive sport.\nTo prevent any repeat of these events, the competition format for the next Olympics was changed: all pairs finishing second in their groups would be placed into another draw to determine who they faced in the quarterfinals, while the top pair in each group would have a fixed position matched to its designated seed in the knockout phase."

        "text": "John Becker (born April 17, 1968) is an American college basketball coach, currently the head coach of the Vermont Catamounts of the America East Conference. He replaced Mike Lonergan, who left to become the coach at George Washington University.\nOn January 5, 2023, Becker became the winningest coach in Vermont history, with a 74–64 win over Bryant, surpassing Tom Brennan.\nCoaching career.\nGallaudet/Catholic University.\nBecker's college coaching career began in 1994 when he became an assistant at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C. In 1997, Becker was elevated to head coach of the Bison, where he served from 1997 to 1999. Becker also served as the men's tennis coach, despite never playing the game, and also worked in the information technology field, as the coaching positions were part-time. He briefly left coaching to pursue a master's degree in information systems at George Washington University, however in 2004 Becker returned to coaching at his alma mater Catholic as an assistant coach under Steve Howes. While at Catholic, he helped guide the team to a 41–17 record, which included a 21–7 mark and NCAA Division III Tournament appearance in 2005–06. His first year with Catholic saw the Cardinals go 20–10 and advance to the Capital Athletic Conference Championship game.\nVermont.\nIn 2006–07, Becker joined the Vermont staff as director of basketball operations, serving in the role for two seasons before being promoted to assistant coach. As an assistant, UVM earned three postseason berths, including the 2010 NCAA Tournament. On May 10, 2011, Becker was named interim head coach of the Catamounts while search was conducted. On May 20, 2011, Vermont lifted the interim tag and named Becker the 16th coach in Vermont basketball history.\n2011–12.\nIn his first year in charge of the Catamounts, Becker led Vermont to a second-place finish in the America East Conference with a 24–12 overall record and 13–3 mark in conference, winning the America East Championship for Vermont's fifth NCAA Tournament bid in nine years, defeating Stony Brook 51–43. Becker became just the second first-year head coach since Northeastern's Karl Fogel to win the conference tournament. He also set a Vermont record for most wins by a first-year head coach, breaking a 90-year-old record set by Tom Keady in the 1921–22 season with a 73–63 win on the road over Maine. In its NCAA first round match up the Catamounts picked up their second-ever NCAA Tournament win, defeating Lamar 71–59 before falling to top-seeded North Carolina 77–58 in the second round.\n2012–13.\nThe 2012–13 season saw Vermont post another 20-win season, coupled with an appearance in the America East Championship game. Becker became just the second coach in league history to post back-to-back 20-win seasons in his first two seasons, along with two-straight appearances in the title game, joining Pat Chambers. The Catamounts were defeated at home by Albany 53–49, and elected to participate in the 2013 College Basketball Invitational, where it fell to Santa Clara 77–66 in the first round.\n2013–14.\nIn his third season with the Catamounts, Becker guided Vermont to a 15–1 mark and an America East regular season championship. The 20-win season made Becker the first coach in America East history to post three-straight 20-win seasons in his first three seasons, and it was the 11th time in the last 13 seasons UVM eclipsed the 20-win mark. Despite this, Vermont was defeated by fourth-seeded Albany, 67–58, in the America East Championship semifinals. By virtue of winning the regular season, the Catamounts earned an automatic berth in the 2014 NIT.\n2014–15.\nWith nine freshman and sophomores on the roster, Vermont earned its seventh-straight 20 win season, and the 12th out of the last 14 years.

Finishing second in the America East regular season, the Catamounts fell at home in the semifinals of the America East playoffs, and accepted a bid to the 2015 College Basketball Invitational. It was UVM's seventh-straight postseason appearance, and with wins over Hofstra in the opening round and Radford in the quarterfinals, the Catamounts earned their second and third CBI wins before falling to Louisiana-Monroe in the semifinals.\n2015–16.\nAfter a 6–5 start to America East play, Vermont went on an eight-game win streak to reach the finals of the 2016 America East Conference tournament championship game, where it fell 80–74 to Stony Brook. Becker guided the Catamounts to its fifth-straight 20-win season, and a bid to the 2016 College Basketball Invitational where the Catamounts made its second-straight semifinal appearance. It marked eight years in a row that UVM has participated in a postseason tournament. On January 27, 2016, Becker picked up his 100th overall victory at Vermont, with a 66–50 win over the New Hampshire. The feat was accomplished in 158 games, which ties Mike Lonergan for fastest to reach 100 wins by a UVM coach.\n2016–17.\nBecker guided the Catamounts to a historic season, setting a program record for wins, and a perfect 16–0 mark in America East play, marking only the third time in league history that a team completed the regular season undefeated. For his coaching efforts, Becker earned his second America East Coach of the Year award, while Catamount players swept all major conference awards. Becker also moved into third all-time in wins at UVM. Vermont continued its run in the 2017 America East men's basketball tournament, capturing its sixth conference tournament title to earn a berth in the 2017 NCAA tournament. As a 13-seed with the longest win streak in the country at 21-straight heading into the tournament, the Catamounts faced fourth-seeded Purdue in the first round, falling 80–70 and finishing with an overall record of 29–6.\n2017–18.\nWith reigning America East Player of the Year Trae Bell-Haynes and nine other returnees, the Catamounts continued its run of form in America East play earning its ninth conference regular season championship and second-straight America East regular season crown, going 15–1 in conference, with its only loss coming to Hartford on February 18, 2018, snapping a run of 31 straight wins against America East opponents, and a 15-game win streak. Becker once again was awarded America East Coach of the Year honors, sharing the award with Hartford's John Gallagher. Vermont reached the America East Championship game for the third time in as many years, falling at home to future NCAA Tournament darling UMBC 65–62. As the conference's regular season champion, the Catamounts participated in the 2018 NIT where as a six seed, Vermont faced Middle Tennessee, and was defeated 91–64 to finish the season 27–8. The 27 wins is tied for second-most in school history, behind the 2016–17 campaign's 29 wins.\n2018–19.\nDuring the 2018–19 season, Becker guided the Catamounts to its third-straight America East regular season championship and its seventh overall America East tournament championship. For the fourth time, Becker was also named America East Coach of the Year. The Catamounts drew a 13-seed in the first round of the 2019 NCAA tournament and were defeated by Florida State 76–69 to finish the season 27–7.\nOn February 2, 2019, the Catamounts' 74–65 win over UMass Lowell marked Becker's 100th win in conference play. He set a new America East record as the fastest head coach to reach 100 conference wins, doing so in his 120th conference game, tying Kansas' Bill Self for fourth on the all-time list for NCAA Division I men's basketball. The only other men's coaches in Division I (and its predecessors) to reach the milestone in fewer conference games are Mark Few (112 games with Gonzaga), Adolph Rupp (116 with Kentucky), and John Chaney (118 with Temple). At the close of the season, Becker was named the USBWA district I coach of the year for the third consecutive season.\n2019–20.\nWith the return of reigning America East Player of the year Anthony Lamb, Becker guided the Catamounts to its fourth-straight outright regular season title, which set a league record while also earning his record fifth America East Coach of the Year award. He would lead Vermont to a 26–7 overall record, including a win over St. John's for the team's first win over a Big East opponent in its current formation. He also earned his 200th career win at Vermont with a 55–38 win over Towson on December 7, 2019. The Catamounts would reach the America East tournament final for fifth-straight season, but the title game was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. UVM was awarded the tournament championship as the highest seed remaining. \n2020–21.\nThe Catamounts only played a conference schedule due to COVID-19, finishing with at 10–4 regular season record and a share of the America East regular season title for the filth year in a row. Becker also coached the America East Player of the Year for the fifth season in a row as Ryan Davis was named the conference's top performer. As the two seed in the 2021 America East tournament, the Catamounts secured a bye to the semifinals, where they were upset by fourth-seeded Hartford 71–65.\n2021–22.\nBecker guided the Catamounts to a 28–6 overall mark, the second-most wins in school history, which included a 17–1 America East record as Vermont won both the regular season and tournament titles. Once again, Becker coached America East Player of the Year Ryan Davis while earning his record sixth America East Coach of the Year honor. In the first round of the 2022 NCAA tournament, Vermont lost to Arkansas 75–71.\n2022–23.\nWith a 23–11 overall record, which included a 74–64 win versus Bryant on January 5, 2023 to become Vermont's all-time leader in career wins, passing Tom Brennan. Vermont earned both conference regular season title and tournament titles for the fourth time under Becker, en route to its second-straight appearance in the NCAA tournament. Becker also coached the conference's Player of the Year, Finn Sullivan, making it seven-straight years a Catamount earned the league's top honor. As a 15-seed, Vermont faced off against Marquette, falling 78–61.\n2023–24.\nNotching a 28–7 mark, the Catamounts earned their third-straight conference tournament crown, defeating UMass Lowell, marking the second three-peat in program history. Becker earned his 300th career win at Vermont in a 70–54 win over New Hampshire. As a 13-seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, the Catamounts faced off against Duke, losing 64–47.\nControversies.\nIn October 2020, a former University of Vermont swimmer came forward and revealed she was raped by a member of the Vermont men's basketball team, alleging the school had mishandled the Title IX investigation and dissuaded her from making a 'formal' complaint, which would have meant the player would have to sit out games. As a result of widespread protests on campus against the university's handling of sexual assault cases, students called for the firing of Becker and other athletic department officials for their role in mishandling the case.\nIn 2022, a civil lawsuit was filed against the University of Vermont over the alleged cover-up of the rape case, revealing that former player Anthony Lamb was named as the alleged assailant."

This makes Munich the leader in bicycle modal share amongst the large German cities; as a result, Munich named itself Germany's (bicycle capital) in the summer of 2010. Around 80% of the population of Munich own a bicycle.\nBetween 1992 and 2010 a total of €32 million was spent on new infrastructure to expand Munich's cycling network including bicycle parking. For reasons including environmental sustainability, the city aims to increase cycling's modal share to 20% of all trips by bicycle by the year 2015: for this additional financial resources for infrastructure, public relations exercises and public events has been allocated and, from 2010, annual expenditure to promote cycling will triple to €4.5 million.\nBicycle network.\nMunich's cycling network totals more than in length, a figure more than 50% of the total length of Munich's road network. The city has 212 one-way streets which are open in both directions to cyclists (i.e. contraflow). There are also dedicated (bicycle streets) where motor vehicles are limited to and where cyclists are allowed to use the full width of the road.\nSince 2007, the street signage for Munich's bicycle network has slowly been replaced by new green and white signs, whose font size is twice as large as previous, and the destinations and distances are marked. Signed bicycle routes connect points in the city in ways that are suitable for cyclists and there is minimisation in obstruction on roads by pedestrians and better flow through traffic lights. The latter, of course, applies only to a small number of cyclists as bicycle speeds vary widely, being completely dependent on the ability of the rider. The reduced obstruction by pedestrians is still much higher than that on the road, meaning that the concentration requirements are much high for cyclists than drivers, lowering convenience.\n there are about 32,000 bicycle racks in the urban area not including the 50,000 bicycle parking spaces at bus stops and public transport hubs. However, the space dedicated to them is very low.\nPublic bicycle hire system.\nMunich's bicycle hire system, the Deutsche Bahn run Call a Bike, is available in the central area of the city, that part of Munich surrounded by the ring-road known as the \"Mittlerer Ring\". There is a new system as of Summer 2015, called MVG-Rad, run by Nextbike, with special tariffs for users of public transport."

        "title": "Ammanford Cricket Club",
        "text": "Ammanford Cricket Club is a cricket club from Ammanford in Wales. They are members of the Welsh Cricket Association and currently play in the South Wales Premier Cricket League. The club play at The Park in Ammanford. Their current coach and captain is former Glamorgan player Alun Evans (cricketer).\nHistory.\nAmmanford Cricket Club.\nThe club has enjoyed an unprecedented run of sixteen consecutive seasons in the top flight of the South Wales League—recognised as one of the most competitive Leagues in Britain—but it took a long time to get there.\nThe first reported game of cricket played at Ammanford was when the place was then known as Cross Inn in the parish of Llandybie. The match that took place in July 1853 was played over two innings between Cross Inn and Cwmaman:\n\"\"A Cricket Match was played at Cross Inn, on Tuesday last, between the Cross Inn and Cwmamman Clubs. The Cross Inn Club took the bat first, and scored 34 runs. The Cwmamman Club went in and played a tie. The Cross Inn followed and scored 38. The Cwmamman Club went for their last innings, and scored 34 again. After the game had terminated, most of the gentlemen proceeded to Mr Wm Howells, of the Cross Inn, where every accommodation and good refreshment was found.\"\nThe inauguration of the club took place in 1886, though the centenary was celebrated in 1975. The belief that the club was formed in 1875 probably stemmed from a July entry in the log book of the local primary school which recorded that pupils were given an afternoon off school in order to watch an Ammanford team play a visiting side.\nThe Club's first secretary was a Councillor David Jones of High Street, which is where another treasurer, Hywel Rees, lived until recently. It is an interesting irony that the first recorded match should be against Cwmaman since the present Chairman, Wyn Jones, and Secretary, Neil Hobbs, hail from the Cwmaman.\nThe impetus which established Ammanford as a cricketing locality was the coming of the coal industry which naturally attracted work-seekers from all over Wales and beyond. Several Lancashire folk came to the area, bringing with them a missionary zeal to spread the cricket gospel among the locals. Names from that era have a distinctly un-Welsh cadence: like Ernie Hewlett, Jim Darbyshire and the Cooke brothers.\nThe home of Ammanford cricket is the Park, then called the Cross Inn Field, where it has played since about 1900. It started play back in 1882 when Cross Inn played their matches in Tirydail on a field adjacent to Afon Llwchwr – where the CCTA now stands. Arthur Morris was responsible for the founding of Ammanford Rugby Football Club in 1887. He was the captain at that time, and one of the principals of the Pontaman Chemical Works. In his team was C. P. Lewis who captained Wales in their second rugby international match against Ireland.\nAt the time of the move to the Park was made, it had a bowler, Huw Morris, who would bowl underhand with considerable success. On the fixture list was Llandovery, against whom was played for high stakes—dinner hosted by the losers.\nTom Handel Richards became president of the club in 1979 and was feted for his long service to the club when he retired. Amongst the earliest presidents was one Lt. Col. W. N. Jones of Duffryn whose son Harold captained the side in the 1920s. During the Depression of the 1930s, J Owen Parry OBE, was president which may have benefited the club keeping it solvent during this decade of severe privation, and potential use of his two cars available as team transport.\nThe payment of professionals in an essentially amateur club is a perennially thorny issue, but the engagement of professionals at Ammanford Cricket Club has a long history. Maintaining the square and setting up the wicket was a responsibility of the professional players. For years the square was rolled by a horse-drawn roller: the horse wore foot-pads when working on the square and was the property of the club.\nThe Club's first pavilion was a temporary tent situated where are now the bowling green and tennis courts. It has always been painted green and white – the club's colours. In the early 1950s a pavilion was championed by Roy John. He came from Llangennech to Ammanford and, after being demobbed from the army, devoted much time and energy to the Cricket Club. The 1950s pavilion cost £140-8-8 to construct. In 1972 it was burned to the ground, set alight by the sparks from a nearby garden waste fire. All the Club's records (photographs, scorebooks and committee meeting minutes) were lost. John was often seen rolling the square at 5 a.m. to catch the dew, an endearing eccentricity recently adopted by a later groundsman.\nSome famous names have been professionals for Ammanford. In 1955, the West Indian test player Frank Worrall nearly came to the club. Local tradespeople were prepared to guarantee his match fees, but he decided instead to go to the Lancashire League. Nissar Ahmed was engaged in his stead. He was followed by David Evans, Alan Rees and Len Hill of Glamorgan, but without doubt the best known Ammanford professional was, before his arrival, an unknown.\nLinton Lewis.\nLinton Aaron Lewis in his playing days for Ammanford and Glamorgan Second Eleven in 1983. Later he would become Dr. Linton Lewis and is now a lawyer and businessman in his native St Vincent. He was a parliamentary candidate for the island's opposition New Democratic Party in the December 2005 general election. \nLinton Lewis came to Ammanford as the result of an inspired committee decision under the guidance of dedicated secretary Don Phillips to gamble on a young West Indian hopeful. He arrived in 1981, when Ammanford were languishing in the depths of the third division. Within three years, Ammanford were champions of Division 1 and had won the Welsh Cup twice. In 1986, the Club achieved the double of becoming Division 1 Champions and Welsh Cup Winners. Ammanford Cricket Club—and Linton Lewis—had arrived. Club and professional grew together in reputation. Ammanford Park became a focal point for hundreds of cricket fans from all over South Wales, and often beyond. Only last summer I remember talking to an archaeologist from Durham University who could remember making a trip to Ammanford Park to watch Linton play. And who could blame him? Records were set in the 1980s which will probably never be broken. Up until that time, nobody had ever scored 1,000 runs in the League. In 1983, Linton amassed 1,543 runs including seven centuries. Several immensely talented batsmen—amongst them Gordon Greenidge and Richie Richardson—have graced the Park with magnificent power and elegance, but never was there such a complete destroyer of bowling attacks as Linton.\nLinton left in 1989, much to the relief of the Park's bowling green regulars who had taken to wearing crash helmets during the first XI's home matches. But Ammanford had set a trend which was taken up by other clubs in the South Wales League. Overseas professionals were appearing everywhere. Standards were high, but home-grown talent was being stifled, and the League called a halt. Overseas players were initially banned, but this Draconian measure was later modified to one and which required them to have lived in the locality for 18 months prior to registration.\nLinton's legacy was double-edged. On the downside, less magnanimous rivals labelled Ammanford a one-man team, an allegation which our continued presence in the top flight a decade later has shown to be unfounded. One of the many benefits was a second storey to our pavilion.\nNissan Ahmed.\nBut other cricket leagues throughout Britain employed overseas professionals and the South Wales leagues were no exception. Nissan Ahmed joined Ammanford Cricket Club in 1955 as club professional and is another player of genuine first class ability to have played for the club. He was a product of the cricket leagues in Pakistan which in 1955 was still a new country, having been created from the partition of India on independence in 1947. Nissan was a former member of the Pakistan State Railway Cricket Club who played in Inter-Zone Cricket in Pakistan, and was awarded his Inter-Zone cap. He first played at Ammanford with the Pakistan Eaglets in 1954. He was then a wicket-keeper, reckoned in Pakistan to be near-Test class. He was engaged as the club's professional in the 1955 season as player-coach, and did excellent work in both capacities until illness overtook him about mid-season 1955.\nHe headed the bowling averages in the First Division of the South Wales and Monmouthshire League for the 1955 season by taking 24 wickets for an average of 7.79, and was highly placed in the batting averages as well. He returned to Pakistan in the winter of 1955.\nOpposition to the site of the Cricket Pavilion.\n\"Mr. Frank Davies said that as he was coming along to the Council meeting that evening he noticed that they had started building the pavilion on a portion of the field which was unsuitable and which would make the field unsightly.\"\n\"...Mr. Davies went on to say that if the pavilion was allowed to be erected at that spot, it would be most unfair to the residents of Tirydail Lane, and he asked that it be erected on another site where it would not be an obstacle to anyone.\" \n\"...If they allowed it to be erected on the site now proposed, he assured them that there would be a rumpus in the town, and the residents of Tirydail Lane would protest. He understood that the Cricket Club did not object to a site he had in mind, that was, at the rear of the Welfare Hall.\"\n\"...He moved that no further work be done there, and that they agree to the alternative site he had mentioned.\"\n\"...Mr. John Thomas supported Mr. Davies.\"\n\"...Mr. John Owen Parry said that when the Council were good enough to allow the Cricket Club to put up a pavilion, he had himself a site in mind that was, under the old tree. When he discussed the matter with the groundsman, he suggested this to the groundsman as the best place.\"\n\"...He (Mr. Parry) quite understood the objection raised, but they had started to erect the pavilion on the site allocated them by the Committee, who had been given plenary powers in the matter.\"\n\"...The Cricket Club were in no way to blame and he assured them that they were agreeable to the suggestion of Mr. Frank Davies.\"\n\"...The motion of Mr. Frank Davies was carried.\"\"\nIt would seem from all this that the residents of Tirydail Lane, then a street where Ammanford's better-off residents lived, were influential enough to prevent what they saw as an unsightly cricket pavilion being built in their view. Ever since then the cricket club's three pavilions have all been situated conveniently out of sight behind the local Miners' Welfare Hall.\nSouth Wales Premier Cricket League.\nIn 2010 the Welsh Cricket Board decided to create a new elite league of cricket in South Wales, known as the South Wales Premier Cricket League. Having won the South Wales Cricket League in 2009 Ammanford Cricket Club qualified as Champions to the new league. Although the club shared many ups and downs it finished in 7th place in the league having lost the last 3 games. However the club had a successful Welsh Cup run losing narrowly to Sully in the final played at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff.\nIn 2011 the club have had a disappointed start losing their first 3 games. However, the fortunes of the club have now changed and they have made the Twenty20 Finals day held in the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff and won this tournament with relative ease. In the League Ammanford finished a disappointing 9th and were fortunate to stay in the division.\nIn 2012 Ammanford recorded 256 points to win the league for the first time in its short history. They finished 28 points clear of rivals Mumbles CC to clinch the title away v. Swansea CC on 31 August 2012.\nIn 2013...\nSWALEC Twenty20 Competition.\n2010\nIn 2010 the Welsh Cricket Board created the Swalec Twenty20 Competition. This included 2 groups of 3 teams and 1 group of 4 (each representative of the Swalec Premier Cricket League). Teams play the others in their group once with the group winner representing their 'Festival' in a Finals Day in the Swalec Stadium in Cardiff. Ammanford CC lost their group in 2010.\n2011\nIn 2011 they had a much more successful run. After winning their region they played against and defeated Mumbles C.C in the Semi Final before defeating Sully C.C in the Final, a great victory for the club.\nThey then represented Wales in the South West of England &amp; Wales Championship Finals Day, however they lost their first game to St. Just Cricket Club.\n2012\nIn 2012 Ammanford CC did not need to qualify for the Swalec Twenty20 Finals Day as they qualified as Champions. On a rain affected day they lost to Cardiff C.C in the first semi-final. Sully C.C went on to win this competition.\n2013\nIn 2013 Ammanford hosted the Swalec Twenty20 Festival for the first time in their history. In the first game of the day Ammanford CC chased down 169 set by Ynysygerwn CC. The second game saw Newport CC defeat Ynystawe CC meaning the third game was a winner takes all. Ammanford CC set 226-2 in the first innings with Alun Evans scoring 127 not out. Ynysygerwn CC were bowled out for 62. This means they will play Ponturddulais in the second semi-final on T20 Finals Day on Sun 14 July at the Swalec Stadium, the other semi being Sudbrook CC v Sully CC.\nBalconiers.\nThe Ammanford 'Balconiers' are a group of supporters that watch and support Ammanford Cricket Club on a weekly basis home and away. The core are made up of the young footballers in the area who during the off season support the local cricket club. They often wear their own 'Balconiers' tops which are available to buy from the club."

        "text": "The Western Australian Ice Hockey Association, currently trading as Ice Hockey Western Australia is the governing body of ice hockey in Western Australia. Ice Hockey WA is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nIce Hockey Western Australia (IHWA) was formed as the Western Australian state branch for Ice Hockey Australia. It is responsible for organising the four state leagues. It is also responsible for selecting the state teams to compete in the national tournaments.\nIHWA operates its leagues across two venues – Cockburn Ice Arena and Perth Ice Arena. Teams are fielded in the leagues by four clubs. Two clubs are based at Cockburn Ice Arena - Hawks Ice Hockey Club and Bravehearts Ice Hockey Club. The other two clubs are based at Perth Ice Arena - West Coast Ice Hockey Association and Northern Ice Hockey Association. The IHWA current president is Sydney Fricker.\nHistory.\n1949: The First Ice Rink in Western Australia.\nOn 22 September 1949, a prospectus was written to introduce the first ice rink to Western Australia.\nThe first ice skating rink built in Western Australia was the Perth Ice Palais. It was located on Beaufort Street, Northbridge inside the remodeled Tivoli Theatre. The rink was being built by Ice Palais Ltd. and Bruce Carrol was the chairman of directors, who stated that even with the completion date of the rink being weeks away there were already plans by Perth sporting clubs to make ice hockey teams. The rink surface was much smaller than other rinks in Australia at only 29m (95 feet) long and 26m (85 feet)wide. Though private skating lessons first began at 9:00am 12 December 1949, the rink was officially opened at 8:00pm 14 December 1949 by, then, Perth mayor Mr. J. Totterdell. The first manager of the rink was Edson R. Banks.\nThe first competitive ice sport conducted by the Ice Palais Pty LTD was ice basketball and approximately 60 members of the Collegians High Sports Club began training for ice sports, assisted by Mr. H. W. White. The Collegians were the first Perth based ice sports team formed 30 January 1950, and were quickly followed by the formation of a second team called the Western Dodgers the following month. The intention was to train to play ice basketball as the rink surface was too small to play ice hockey on, being less than half of the required length of a standard ice rink. The teams would train every Sunday at the Perth Ice Palais and the Western Dodgers had the help of 2 premiership winning Victorian players, Ray Abbot and Bob Cody, for coaching the first team.\nThe first game of ice basketball in Perth was between two women's teams, the Wildcats and the Bulldogs on 22 May 1950. The men played ice basketball for the first time in the Perth Ice Palais on 13 June 1950 in a game between the Western Dodgers and the Collegians. There was the intention to play ice hockey as well a month later with the Collegians and Western Dogers having already invested a total of £500 in ice hockey equipment combined.\nFormation of The West Australian Ice Hockey Association.\nThe formation of the first ice hockey association in Western Australia began at the time when a second club joined the Collegians in forming an ice hockey team in February 1950. The original 2 teams that formed the West Australian Ice Hockey Association were:\nThe first game of ice hockey in Western Australia was between the Western Dodgers and the Colligians on the evening of 3 July 1950 at 8:30pm. The Western Dodgers won the game by a score of 4 -2.\nSome of members of the first 2 teams were:\nCollegians – W. Rossiter, Peter Logan, Brian Strack, D. Whitehead\nWestern Dodgers – Laurie Anderson, R. Cody\nShortly after the first game of ice hockey played in Perth a 22 year old recent migrant, Bob Pals, began planning to form a team composed entirely of Dutch migrants. Bob Pals had represented the Netherlands in the 1948 World Amateur Championships held in Montreux, Switzerland. Bob's younger brother was the goaltender for the Netherlands in 11 internationals. Other members of the proposed Dutch team were a 7 time medalist for long distance skating in the Netherlands, Lue Markies; a leading figure and dance skater Louis Kramer; and another member of the national ice hockey team for the Netherlands, Rudi Williams, who also played ice hockey for the Amsterdam Icebergs. There were 3 potential names that were going to be used for this new ice hockey club; the Lions, the Penguins and the Icebergs.\nThe name for the new Dutch migrant ice hockey team was the Penguins, who formed on 28 September 1950 to expand the Association to three teams.\nWhen the 1951 ice hockey season began, the West Australian Ice Hockey Association expanded to 4 teams with the addition of a new team called the Magpies.\nAustralian Leagues.\nIHWA fields teams in the following national Australian leagues run by Ice Hockey Australia: \n2012 teams.\nTeams playing in the 2012 season:\n2013 teams.\nTeams playing in the 2013 season:\n2014 teams.\nTeams playing in the 2014 season:"

        "text": "Stanley John Matthews (born 20 November 1945) is an English former professional tennis player. He became Wimbledon Boys' Champion in 1962 and reached the second round of the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. He is the son of former professional footballer Sir Stanley Matthews.\nFootball career.\nMatthews' first foray in sport was via football, and, like his father, he played on the wing. \"But I stopped playing soccer, as we call it in America, when I was 12,\" he explained in 2007. \"I was fairly good, but whoever I played, they kicked the shit out of me. I came with a name, and the mentality was, 'We're going to get Stanley Matthews' son.' \"\nTennis career.\nIn 1958, Matthews' father arranged for him to attend the Lawn Tennis Association in London. He lived with the family of Charlie Chester, a friend of his father, in North Finchley. In the morning he would work with a private tutor; in the afternoon he would practise at Queen's Club.\nMatthews was British Junior Champion between 1960 and 1962, the only three-times winner of the title.\nIn 1962, Matthews won the Wimbledon Boys' Championship. He can remember the final point by point. \"It was against Alexander Metreveli, who went on to be the top Russian and lost in the final of a Wimbledon senior.\" The match went the distance, and Matthews won 7–5 in the final set. He was the last British winner of the Wimbledon boys' tournament until Henry Searle in 2023.\nIn Grand Slam tournaments, he reached the second round of Wimbledon in 1963 and 1969. He attained the second round of the 1967 French Open and in the 1969 French Opens he won his most notable singles victory in a Grand Slam event, beating Ilie Năstase in the first round in a close five set match. He reached the second round of the 1971 US Open. He qualified for the first round of Wimbledon for 11 consecutive years, from 1963 to 1973. He also partook in 17 doubles matches, winning four times.\nIn his short career, Matthews won 12 singles titles. \nIn 1965 he won the Northumberland Championships defeating David Lloyd in the semifinal and Gerald Battrick in the final.\nIn 1966, Matthews won the London Hard Court Championships with wins over Battrick, John Barrett, Clay Iles, and Allan Stone in the final.\nIn 1967, Matthews won the Surrey Hard Court Championships, defeating Keith Wooldridge in the final. He beat his coach, John Barrett, in the semifinals. The following year, he defeated Wooldridge again in the final of the East of England Championships.\nIn 1971, Matthews represented Britain in the Davis Cup, losing to Yugoslav Boro Jovanović in five sets.\nAssessment.\nDespite Matthews' success in the junior ranks, his coach, John Barrett, stated that \"ultimately, he just wasn't good enough\". However, Matthews would win more tournaments in his playing career than Barrett achieved. Matthews' father said \"There is no doubt my reputation did put some pressure on him. I know it worried him a bit, being in my shadow. I hoped he might overcome it.\" \nMatthews junior partially concurs: \"Even though it wasn't football, it was a lot of pressure to live up to the name of Matthews. There would be pictures of my father and me in the papers, and they started to call me the next Fred Perry. Sure, being Dad's son opened some doors, but it also made things harder. Instead of being congratulated if I did well, I was expected to. And if I didn't do well, they'd say 'He's not as good as his father.' Unfortunately, that's how it is. It goes with the territory.\"\n\"Obviously, I would have liked to have done better, though I didn't have a bad career. But it was becoming more and more difficult to make a living out of tennis. Looking back, certain aspects were not as good as they should have been. I was a serve and volleyer with a weak serve. If I'd had a serve like Andy Roddick's, I would have done much better. I wasn't quite good enough to be one of the best.\"\nPost-retirement.\nIn 1973 Matthews quit playing tennis and tried his hand in the business world, selling air bubbles to cover tennis courts; however, the growing popularity of squash meant that there were fewer and fewer outdoor courts.\nAged 29, Matthews moved to the United States, and became a coach at Harry Hopman's Port Washington Tennis Academy and also in Norwalk, Connecticut. At the former, he worked with a promising 15-year-old John McEnroe. \"I was still fresh off the tour at the time, so could give him a decent game.\"\nIn 1976 he became manager at the Four Seasons Racquet Club in Wilton, Connecticut, and has been there ever since. Nine years later, he bought out the original owner. \"You can always say, 'Gee whizz, I could have done better' but in terms of how my life turned out, I'm very happy. I'm [at the time of interview] still the last British male to win a singles tournament at Wimbledon, and I'm proud of that. For the past 30 years I have considered myself an entrepreneur, and I've managed that in the States with no name recognition.\"\nIn 1981, Matthews briefly picked up his racquet again after eight years to take part in the United States Tennis Association's National Men's 35 Clay Court Championships at the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club in Palm Beach, Florida.\nPersonal life.\nMatthews was born to Betty and Stanley Matthews on 20 November 1945. He was the couple's second child after Jean, who was born six years earlier. He is married to Joy, with two stepchildren, Greg and Kristy Moran.\nGrand Slam singles performance timeline.\nNote: The 1972 US Open had a special preliminary round before the main 128 player draw began."

        "text": "Charles Walter Kuhn (February 2, 1887 – June 14, 1935), known also as \"Red\" Kuhn, was a professional baseball player. During his playing career, Kuhn, a catcher, played three seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Chicago White Sox (1912–1914). Over those three years, he compiled a batting average of .205 with 25 runs scored, 55 hits, nine doubles, and 15 runs batted in (RBIs) in 119 games played. The majority of Kuhn's career was spent in the minor leagues. He played seven seasons in the minors with the Fresno California State League club (1905), San Francisco Orphans (1908), Fresno Tigers/Raisin Growers (1908–1910), Portland Beavers (1911), Oakland Oaks (1915), Salt Lake City Bees (1916), Waco Navigators (1916), and Dallas Giants (1917).\nKuhn was born in Fresno, California, and educated in Louisville, Kentucky. He started is professional career in 1908 at the age of 18. During his playing career, Kuhn stood at and weighed . He broke into the major leagues in 1912. His last MLB season would be 1914. After playing for various minor league clubs, Kuhn was drafted into the United States Armed Forces during World War I. However, Kuhn never saw combat due to the loss of his right eye, which was caused by a prank pulled on him by his roommate during combat training. The injury also meant the end of his professional baseball career. Kuhn died in 1935 in his home-town of Fresno.\nEarly life.\nKuhn was born on February 2, 1887, in Fresno, California to Charles, and Irene of Kentucky, and Iowa, respectively. Charles Kuhn worked as a day laborer in Fresno. Walt Kuhn had a sibling, Roy, who also played professional baseball. Walt Kuhn attended high school in Louisville, Kentucky.\nProfessional career.\nEarly minor league career (1905, 1908–1911).\nIn 1905, Kuhn joined the minor league Fresno California League club. On that team, he played with former, and future major league players Frank Chance, Roy Hitt, Pete Lohman, Judge Nagle, and Jud Smith. Kuhn's statistics for that season were not kept. For the next two seasons (1907–08), Kuhn would not appear in professional baseball. He returned in 1908 with the minor league San Francisco Orphans, and Fresno Tigers of the independent California League. Combined between the two teams, he batted .264 with 23 hits in 29 games played.\nIn 1909, Kuhn re-signed with the Fresno club, who changed their name to the Raisin Growers. During the season, his contract was sold to the Minneapolis Millers of the Class-A American Association. However, he was farmed out to the Fresno club for the remainder of the season. Kuhn batted .258 with 119 hits, 23 hits, 23 doubles, and seven home runs in 134 games played. He finished the season tied for fourth in doubles, and tied for fifth in home runs. After the season, it was reported that the Major League Baseball (MLB) New York Highlanders were interested in purchasing Kuhn for the price of US$2,000. However, New York failed to reach an agreement with Fresno.\nKuhn again played with the Fresno California League team in 1910, who changed their name back to the Tigers. In February 1911, Kuhn signed with the Portland Beavers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League. During the final game of the Pacific Coast League Pennant Series, Kuhn hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Beavers the win. On the season with Portland, he batted .228 with 79 hits, 11 doubles, four triples, and two home runs in 120 games played.\nChicago White Sox (1912–1914).\nIn February 1912, Kuhn signed with the MLB Chicago White Sox. He attended spring training with the White Sox that season. Billy Sullivan, Chicago's starting catcher at the time, stated that Kuhn would be a successful major league player. Kuhn made his MLB debut on April 18, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. In August, Kuhn was given the job of starting catcher for the White Sox. In his first major league season, he batted .202 with 16 runs scored, 36 hits, seven doubles, 10 runs batted in (RBIs), and four stolen bases in 76 games played. He finished the season fifth in the American League in defensive games as a catcher (75); and tied for fifth with Eddie Ainsmith, Oscar Stanage, and Ed Sweeney in passed balls (9).\nAt the start of the 1913 season, Kuhn was given the Chicago White Sox's starting catcher job. In August, he lost his starting job to the White Sox new catcher, Ray Schalk. Towards the end of the season, Kuhn injured his arm, which caused him to miss playing time. With Chicago that season, Kuhn batted .160 with five runs scored, eight hits, one doubles, and five RBIs in 26 games played. After the season, he stated that he wanted to return to the Pacific Coast League and play with the San Francisco Seals.\nKuhn re-signed with the Chicago White Sox in February 1914, despite his previous statement in which he said he would like to return to the Pacific Coast League. In March, during a spring training game, Kuhn seriously injured his right hand. It was reported that he would not be able to resume playing with the White Sox until the start of the season. The hand injury was later described as a cracked right index finger. In July, it was reported that Kuhn was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Larry Chappell. However, Kuhn played with the White Sox for the entire season. His last MLB appearance would come on September 28, 1914. On the season, he batted .275 with four runs scored, 11 hits, one double, and two RBIs in 17 games played. Over his major league career, Kuhn is currently 81st in the all-time caught stealing percentage ranking (45.54%).\nLater minor league career (1915–1917).\nOn March 29, 1915, Kuhn was sold to the Oakland Oaks of the Double-A Pacific Coast League. Kuhn arrived in Oakland the day after being sold and immediately entered a practice with the Oaks. During the season, he was the Oaks back-up catcher, and first baseman. In August, Kuhn took over for the Oaks every-day catcher, Rowdy Elliott, who was also serving as Oakland's manager. Elliot commented that Kuhn was \"a first-class marksman\". However, earlier in the season there were reports that the two catchers were feuding in the clubhouse. With the Oaks that season, Kuhn batted .236 with 86 hits, 17 doubles, and one triple in 126 games played.\nKuhn signed with the independent Modesto Reds in 1916. Later that season, Kuhn signed with the Double-A Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. In just two games, he got one hit in three at-bats. He then signed with the Class-B Waco Navigators of the Texas League. With Waco, he batted .274 with 49 hits, and four doubles in 72 games played. At the start of the 1917 season, Kuhn joined the Dallas Giants of the Class-B Texas League. With Dallas, he batted .252 with 85 hits, 10 doubles, two triples, and two home runs in 118 games played. Later in the 1917 season, Kuhn signed with the independent Modesto Reds.\nLater life.\nIn 1918, Kuhn re-signed with the Class-B Dallas Giants of the Texas League. That year, as World War I was underway, he was drafted into the United States Army. Kuhn's rank was Sergeant. During combat training in San Antonio, Texas, Kuhn's roommate snapped a towel at Kuhn in an attempt at a practical joke. The towel hit his eye, causing him to lose his sight entirely. One other account of the incident story stated that it was a fight that caused Kuhn's roommate to snap the towel, which caused him to lose his sight. After the incident Kuhn was honorably discharged.\nKuhn returned to Dallas where he joined the Dallas Police Department in July 1919. In 1920, Kuhn was named player-manager of the Modesto Reds, a local amateur team who represented Modesto, California. In 1930, he was living with his brother, Roy Kuhn, and together worked in a fruit cannery. On June 14, 1935, at the age of 48, Kuhn died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. An investigation by the Fresno Police Department determined that Kuhn committed suicide because of his failing health over the years. He was buried at Belmont Memorial Park in Fresno."

        "text": "The Queen's Cup is a trophy awarded annually to the champion in men's ice hockey of the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports. It has been awarded since 1903 to the champion between Ontario and Quebec universities. It is the second-oldest ice hockey trophy still being awarded, after the Stanley Cup.\nThe QUAA (now named the RSEQ) ceased to operate a university hockey league after the 1986–87 season. The conference's three remaining teams at that point (McGill Redmen, UQTR Patriotes, and Concordia Stingers) joined, and remain, in the OUA conference. One of the conditions of the merger was the Queen's Cup, representing the OUA champion, must be challenged for at an OUA institution - as such, when the OUA-East champion should host such a game and that school is based in Quebec, the game shall be hosted by the OUA-West team, while the OUA-East team shall have 'home' standing (last change).\nHistory.\nFor the 1902–03 season, McGill University, Queen's University and the University of Toronto founded the Canadian Intercollegiate Hockey Union. The Queen's Cup, emblematic of the CIHU championship was donated by Queen's University of Kingston, Ontario. The Queen's Cup was not presented during the war years of 1915–16, 1916–17, 1917–18, 1918–19, 1940–41, 1941–42, 1942–43, 1943–44, nor 1944–45. The first winner other than the founders was the Université de Montréal in 1949. By the 1960s, other universities, including Ontario Agricultural College (Guelph), McMaster, Waterloo and Western were granted membership and became eligible to win the Cup. Other universities have since joined the CIHU, now known as the OUA conference. The original Cup was retired in 2000 to the Hockey Hall of Fame. The 2021 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.\nThree Division format.\nBolded are Queen's Cup champions, \"italicized\" are runner-up, score is championship game only.\nEast vs. West format.\nBolded are Queen's Cup champions.\nSource: McGill University, OUA\nChampionships by team.\nThe Toronto Varsity Blues have won the most OUA championships with 41, including a record 11 consecutively between the 1914-15 to 1928-29 seasons."

Standing and weighing 190 lb (86 kg), Cunningham played the shooting guard position. In just three varsity seasons he scored a then-school record 1,744 points. In his senior season of 1957–58, Cunningham led the Rams to a berth in the National Invitation Tournament, where they advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Dayton. Upon the conclusion of the season he was named an All-American as well as the recipient of the Haggerty Award. The Haggerty Award is presented to the best male collegiate basketball player in the greater New York city area every year since 1935–36, and Cunningham was only Fordham's second-ever recipient. For his career at Fordham, he averaged 22.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game in 76 games played.\nThe NBA's Boston Celtics selected Cunningham in the 1958 NBA draft. He was taken in the third round (23rd overall) but ultimately never played in the league."

After assessing a number of options available in the local area the decision was made to approach their nearest neighbours in Donacloney who accepted the merger option."

Finland won the match 6–1 and became world champions for the first time since the 1995 tournament, and for the second time in history. This match was Finland's first final since 2007 and Sweden's first final since 2006.\nBackground.\nFinland and Sweden met in the IIHF World Championships final last time in the 1998 tournament in Switzerland. The two-game format final resulted in Sweden's victory 0–1, 0–0.\nAs two highly ranked neighboring countries, Sweden and Finland have a long-running competitive tradition in ice hockey. Before the game, mainstream media in both countries titled the match \"a dream final\".\nThe match.\nSummary.\nThe first period was goal-less, with good scoring chances at both ends. Sweden's Oliver Ekman-Larsson took a penalty at 17:52 for interference, but Finland did not manage to score in Viktor Fasth's goal. In the second period at 4:41, Sweden's Marcus Krüger took a penalty for slashing, but the Swedes were again successful in killing the penalty. After only a minute of five-on-five play, Sweden's Magnus Pääjärvi fired a fierce shot towards Petri Vehanen's net and scored the match's first goal at 27:40 for a 1–0 lead to Sweden.\nTwo Finnish penalties followed, at 29:15 to Niko Kapanen for hooking, and at 34:25 to Petteri Nokelainen for boarding, but the Swedes did not manage to increase their lead despite a close call.\nTowards the second period's end, at 39:30, Sweden's David Petrasek took a penalty for hooking Finland's Mikael Granlund near the Swedish goal. With only 7 seconds remaining of the second period, Finland's Jarkko Immonen did not miss a pass from Janne Pesonen to score a power play goal to Fasth's net, tying the game to 1–1.\nThe opening goal for Finland seemed to unleash the team's momentum, as the third period had not reached its third minute before Petteri Nokelainen scored for Finland to give them a 1–2 lead from Antti Pihlström's pass at 42:35. Less than a minute later, at 43:21, Niko Kapanen widened the Finns' lead to 1–3 from a pass by Juhamatti Aaltonen.\nBefore the period's half, the Swedes tried to regroup through a time-out, but the puck dominance remained with the Finns. Janne Pesonen's 1–4 goal at 56:41 and Mika Pyörälä's 1–5 at 57:16 sealed the game for Finland. With 55 seconds remaining in the game clock, Antti Pihlström scored the match's last goal from a pass by Jani Lajunen, ending the final in a decisive 1–6 victory for the Finnish team.\nReactions.\nIn Finland, the victory was celebrated at the Market Square in Helsinki on 16 May. The police estimated that 90,000–100,000 people were present as the Finnish team took the stage. President Tarja Halonen was among the guests."

        "title": "National Basketball League of Canada",
        "text": "The National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada; ) was a Canadian professional men's minor league basketball organization. The NBL Canada was founded in 2011, when three existing Premier Basketball League teams joined with four new franchises for the league's inaugural season. The league changed in size multiple times and had four active teams in its final season, all in Ontario, but historically the NBLC had several located in the Atlantic provinces. The league's season typically ran from November to April of the following year. The final league champions were the London Lightning, who defeated the Windsor Express 3–2 in the 2023 NBL Finals.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2023 NBLC season the four remaining NBLC teams, the KW Titans, London Lightning, Sudbury Five and Windsor Express, broke away from the NBLC and helped found the Basketball Super League along with president of The Basketball League, David Magley\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nIn mid-2011, discussion began of a domestic basketball minor league in Canada. Three franchises from the Premier Basketball League (PBL), the Halifax Rainmen, Quebec Kebs, and Saint John Mill Rats were the first to join the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). The teams had been unhappy with the officiating in the PBL. On May 12 of that year in Halifax, Nova Scotia, league CEO Andre Levingston held a press conference regarding the creation of the NBL Canada. By the end of the summer, the London Lightning, Moncton Miracles, Oshawa Power, and Summerside Storm were established and had announced that they would join the league. There had also been unsuccessful attempts to start up teams in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Kingston, Ontario. \nJohn Kennedy, a native of Windsor and a sports executive based in Los Angeles, was named the first commissioner of the NBL. He previously had experience working with the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). League president Andre Levingston spoke on his expectations of the commissioner, saying, \"We wanted to make sure we had a person who was going to be committed and was willing to roll up his sleeves and work very hard, someone who understood business, had business relationship and a person who was going to govern the league the right way.\"\nIn June 2011, the league finalized rules for its first season. There would be seven teams, four of which qualified for the playoffs, and no divisions. It would follow FIBA rules and each team would play 36 games in the regular season. Team rosters could contain 10–12 players, at least two of them Canadian, and they had a salary cap of $150,000 Canadian. Players could earn potentially $70,000 in one season, and each game would draw an average of 3,000 fans, varying by location. Levingston envisioned the NBL Canada as a more stable alternative to other North American minor basketball leagues with players living close to home while playing professionally.\nFirst seasons (2011–2013).\nThe NBL Canada held its first draft on August 21, 2011, at Rogers Centre. The Power selected Morgan Lewis of the University of Findlay with the first overall pick. Jerome Brown, who was picked fifth overall by the Mill Rats, was the first Canadian to be taken in the draft. The event was viewed by more than 6,000 people online from 93 countries. 180 players from across the world attended the preceding NBL Canada combine.\nThe first player to be signed into the NBL Canada was Canadian Yannick Anzuluni, who joined the Kebs on a three-year contract on August 17, 2011. On October 29, in the first game of the NBL Canada's inaugural 2011–12 NBL Canada season, the Kebs defeated the Miracles at the Colisée de Laval. Within a week, every team in the league had played at least one game. The NBL Canada's opening season brought in marquee players such as Gabe Freeman, Anthony Anderson, and Lawrence Wright. Amid the 2011 NBA lockout, six players with past experience in the National Basketball Association (NBA), including Eddie Robinson and Rodney Buford, joined the NBL Canada.\nThe London Lightning, coached by Micheal Ray Richardson, soon emerged as the top team in the league, going 28–8 by end of the regular season, which lasted until March 4, 2012. The team defeated the Halifax Rainmen, 3–2, in the best-of-five NBL Canada Finals series to claim the championship. They drew a league-high 5,106 fans to the John Labatt Centre for the game. Following the NBL Canada's inaugural year, Canadian sports analyst Alex Walling claimed it was a success, commenting, \"The NBL could hold its head up high. It has been a great season and they've gained a great deal of creditability. They've earned the kudos.\" Levingston touted the league because it \"played a full schedule on every set date and never had a problem.\" Shortly after the season, in April, the NBL Canada held its first All-Star Game at Halifax Metro Centre.\nFor its second season, the team salary cap remained at $150,000, with the possibility of an increase in the future. The NBL Canada also considered several cities in the Maritimes, Ontario, and Quebec, including Sydney, Nova Scotia. The league soon welcomed the Windsor Express after an ownership group from Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, led by Dartis Willis Sr., began investing in the expansion team in June 2012. The team, which was approved into the league in late July, would play out of WFCU Centre. On the other hand, the Quebec Kebs, who had relocated to Laval, Quebec, in the offseason, left the league after experiencing challenges in their first year. By November, the Kebs were replaced with the Montreal Jazz, who would compete at Centre Pierre Charbonneau. In the 2012–13 season, the league consisted of eight teams separated into divisions: four teams competed in the Atlantic Division, while the remaining four competed in the Central Division.\nLeague changes (2013–2019).\nThe league grew to nine teams in the 2013–14 season by adding the Brampton A's and Ottawa Skyhawks, while the Montreal Jazz folded. Two teams relocated within their same regions with Oshawa Power moving to Mississauga and Summerside to Charlottetown as the Island Storm. The league returned to eight teams the following season due to Ottawa falling below league standards and failing to repay a loan to the league.\nPrior to the 2014–15 season, the league announced its first national broadcast deal with beIN Sports. Starting with the 2014–15 season, two regular season games were scheduled to be aired each week with special coverage for playoffs and special events such as the All Star Weekend. The deal ran through the 2016–17 season.\nThe 2014–15 season ended in controversy as the Windsor Express were declared winners of the championship series after the Halifax Rainmen failed to show for the seventh and deciding game. The Rainmen organization claimed the reason for not appearing in the game that night because their players feared for their safety following a physical altercation earlier in the day with the Express. The Rainmen and its players were fined by the league and the team ultimately filed for bankruptcy and folded. The following 2015–16 season, the league replaced the Rainmen with the Halifax Hurricanes. The new Halifax team returned to the championship game, defeating the London Lightning to win the title in their first season.\nThe league expanded to ten teams in the 2016–17 season by adding the Cape Breton Highlanders and KW Titans. In the 2017–18 season, the league stayed at ten teams following the Miracles and A's folding and the addition of the Moncton Magic and St. John's Edge in the Maritimes. The initially announced a team in Greater Sudbury, but was forced to delay their launch leaving the league with four teams in Ontario and six in the Maritimes, leading the Edge to play as a member of the Central Division. The Lightning won the championship in both seasons, having won four of the first seven titles up to that point.\nFollowing their delayed start, NBL Canada expanded into Northern Ontario with the addition of the Sudbury Five for the 2018–19 season. However, the league lost another Ontario team when the Niagara River Lions left to help found the rival Canadian Elite Basketball League. St. John's was again a member of the Central Division, but mostly played against Atlantic Division teams.\nPandemic and contraction (2019–2023).\nBefore the 2019–20 season, the league folded the Cape Breton Highlanders and Saint John Riptide as their respective owners tried to sell the teams and the league shrank to eight teams. During the season, the COVID-19 pandemic caused games to be suspended on March 12, 2020. The season was then entirely cancelled as the pandemic closed arenas and travel was restricted. The league initially delayed the start to the 2020–21 season as the pandemic continued into 2021. On March 4, 2021, NBL Canada announced there would be no 2020–21 season.\nDuring the hiatus, the Halifax Hurricanes and Moncton Magic both withdrew from the league while the St. John's Edge were not granted a new lease for their arena. Subsequently, the Island Storm withdrew from the season as it was the only remaining member in the Maritimes ready to play in the 2021–22 season, leaving the league with only the four active teams in Ontario. In order to fill the schedule, the league agreed to inter-league series play with the US-based The Basketball League (TBL), run by former NBLC commissioner David Magley and his wife Evelyn.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2022–23 NBLC season, the remaining NBLC teams were merged along with teams from the TBL into the new Basketball Super League.\nTeams.\nChampions.\nThe London Lightning have the most championships with six wins, the Windsor Express are second with two wins. The Halifax Rainmen and the Island Storm have appeared in two league finals failing to win the trophy. The Sudbury Five are currently the only active team to have never reached the finals.\nPlayer records.\nStatistics below are for all-time leaders at the end of the 2022 regular season.\nAwards.\nThe NBL Canada annually announces the winners of eight awards. Players can be named Most Valuable Player, Canadian of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, Newcomer of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year. The league also awards the Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year. In addition, the top player in the NBL Canada Finals wins Finals Most Valuable Player. After the 2015–16 season, the league started announcing Commissioner's Awards to groups that helped support it, including ownership groups, teams, and referees. These awards were first handed out by Dave Magley.\nUntil the 2013–14 season, the NBL Canada held All-Star Weekend every year. In the 2012 game, players Joey Haywood and Eddie Smith chose each team through a fantasy draft. The best performer in the game was named All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. Starting with the next All-Star game, the league began matching top players from the Central Division with those from the Atlantic Division. At least three Canadian players were required on each team. The NBL Canada discontinued the event after the 2014 game.\nList of commissioners.\nThe commissioner of the NBL Canada is the league's chief executive and is elected by the board of directors and a group of representatives from each team. Since Magley's resignation in 2017, Audley Stephenson has been acting as deputy commissioner."

World Championships 1993 in Budapest were the joint ninth world kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by Hungarian kickboxing president Richard Leyrer. As with the 1985 world championships the organization had suffered a temporary split due to political differences, and a previous event had been held in Atlantic City earlier in the month. These political differences would be resolved in the near future and the organization would be re-united. \nThe Budapest event was open to amateur men and women from across the world - with 500 participants taking part from 47 countries. The styles on offer were Full-Contact, and for the first time ever at a W.A.K.O. championships, Low-Kick (more information on the styles can be found in the relevant sections below). Another first was that women could now take part in Full-Contact kickboxing, whereas before they could only take part in less physical styles. At the end of a very competitive championships, Poland were the top nation in terms of medals won, with Morocco a very close second and France just behind in third. The event was held in Budapest, Hungary over four days, starting on Thursday, 25 November and finishing on Sunday, 28 November. An estimated 3,500 spectators attended the championships. \nFull-Contact.\nMaking a re-appearance to a W.A.K.O. world championships after being absent at London 1991, Full-Contact involved the participants trying to win the contest either by points or by stoppage – more detail on the rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that they may have changed slightly since 1993. The men had twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, with several new divisions being added, while, for the first time ever, women were allowed to participate in Full-Contact at a W.A.K.O. event, with six weight divisions ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 65 kg/+143 lbs. Poland was the strongest country in Full-Contact with four gold, one silver and one bronze medal by the end of the championships. \nLow-Kick.\nMaking its debut at a W.A.K.O. championships, Low-Kick is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only differing in that it allowed kicks below the knee - more detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that there may have been some rule changes since 1993. Only men were allowed to participate in Low-Kick with twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. A notable winner was Andrei Dudko (who would later win the K-1 USA Championships 2000) taking gold in the +91 kg division. Morocco were the strongest nation in Low-Kick winning four gold medals. "

        "text": "Archie N. Bradley (born August 10, 1992) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Angels, and Miami Marlins.\nBorn and raised in Muskogee, Oklahoma, Bradley played baseball and football at Muskogee High School and Broken Arrow Senior High School. In his senior season, he pitched Broken Arrow to a state championship, and was named All-State Player of the Year by \"The Oklahoman\". The Diamondbacks selected Bradley out of high school seventh overall in the 2011 MLB Draft, and he began his first full professional season with the Class A South Bend Silver Hawks. Bradley continued to rise through the Diamondbacks' farm system in 2013 and 2014, but general manager Kevin Towers resisted a push from Bradley's agent to send the pitcher to MLB early, arguing that it would be too much pressure on the young pitcher to ask him to help the Diamondbacks' starting rotation.\nAfter a 2015 debut in which he outpitched reigning Cy Young Award champion Clayton Kershaw, Bradley's first major league season was derailed by injuries: first a sinus fracture from being hit with a line drive, followed by shoulder tendinitis. He worked back through the minors on rehab assignments and returned to the starting rotation in 2016. The following season, amidst a strong group of starting pitchers, the Diamondbacks moved Bradley to the bullpen. He served as the setup man until mid-2019, when he became the team's closer.\nAt the 2020 trade deadline, Bradley was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Josh VanMeter and Stuart Fairchild. He was one of four Reds players released into free agency at the conclusion of the season, and signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Phillies in 2021. Despite rumors that he would take over from Héctor Neris as the Phillies' closer, Bradley was assigned to the setup position to start the season.\nIn 2022 Bradley pitched for the Los Angeles Angels. In 2023 he pitched mostly for the Miami Marlins AAA franchise in Jacksonville, Florida and opted for free agency in October.\nEarly life.\nBradley was born on August 10, 1992, in Muskogee, Oklahoma. One of five children born to Charles and Pam Bradley, he began playing baseball at the age of four, and started playing gridiron football in elementary school. He was a hyperactive child, and his mother, the local school principal, would place him in classes with teachers that she believed could handle his excess energy.\nAfter spending two years at Muskogee High School, Bradley transferred to Broken Arrow Senior High School for his junior and senior year. In his senior season, Bradley had a 12–1 win–loss record, an earned run average (ERA) of 0.29, a strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9) ratio of 17.29, and 137 strikeouts. He also led Broken Arrow in home runs, and had a .395 batting average. Bradley helped lead Broken Arrow to a 36–1 record in 2011, and struck out 14 batters in Broken Arrow's 4–0 shutout state championship victory over Owasso High School. At the end of the year, Bradley was named \"The Oklahoman\"'s All-State Player of the Year. Along with baseball, Bradley excelled in football, participating in the 2010 Elite 11 quarterback competition. At this competition, Bradley was voted \"Most Likely to be a Pro Athlete\" by CFB counselors.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Diamondbacks (2015–2020).\nMinor leagues.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Bradley seventh overall in the 2011 MLB Draft. His friend and Owasso pitching rival Dylan Bundy was selected by the Baltimore Orioles fourth overall, making 2011 the first year that two Oklahoma high school students were drafted in the first round since 1973. At the time, Bradley had already committed to play baseball and football at the University of Oklahoma, and waited until the August 16 deadline to officially sign a $5 million, five-year contract with the Diamondbacks. Bradley spent the remainder of the 2011 season with the Missoula PaddleHeads of the Pioneer League, at that time the Rookie Advanced minor-league affiliate of the Diamondbacks. He appeared in two games for Missoula, including one start, and pitched four strikeouts against seven batters. Additionally, he pitched \"about 15 innings\" in the Arizona Instructional League.\nBradley started the 2012 season with the Single–A South Bend Silver Hawks, taking the loss in his professional debut on April 6 after giving up one run in five innings of work to the Bowling Green Hot Rods. His first win came on April 12, giving up one run in six innings of a 3–1 victory over the Fort Wayne TinCaps. Bradley spent the entire season at South Bend, accumulating a 12–6 record and a 3.84 ERA in 27 starts and 136 innings of work. His 152-season strikeouts were second in the Midwest League, but he led the league in walks with 82.\nStarting 2013 with the High–A Visalia Rawhide, Bradley was named the California League Player of the Week for the week ending April 14, after striking out nine in shutout innings against the San Jose Giants. He was promoted to the Double-A Mobile BayBears on May 1, after only five starts with Visalia, and took the win the following day in a 3–1 victory over the Huntsville Stars. Bradley pitched in all six innings of the game, which ended early due to inclement weather. He was named the Southern League Pitcher of the Week for the week ending August 4 after pitching the first nine-inning complete game of his career in a 5–1 rout of the Jackson Generals. The following week, he pitched the final inning in a combined no-hitter against Huntsville. Between Visalia and Mobile, Bradley finished the 2013 season with a 14–5 record, a 1.84 ERA, and 162 strikeouts in 152 innings.\nAfter attending spring training with the Diamondbacks, Bradley was assigned to the Triple-A Reno Aces at the beginning of the 2014 season. His agent pushed for Bradley to be called up to the majors, arguing that Bradley was only being kept in the minor leagues to allow the Diamondbacks to retain his original contract for a longer period of time. Diamondbacks general manager Kevin Towers said that promoting Bradley would put unnecessary pressure on the pitcher, as the team had the worst ERA in MLB, and Towers told Fox Sports that, \"I know how it would be perceived if he came up: 'Archie is going to save us.'\" Bradley missed nearly two months of the 2014 season after sustaining an elbow injury in late April. He began making rehab assignments at the end of June, with a 75-pitch limit. In only 18 season appearances and 83 innings, Bradley posted a 3–7 record, a 4.45 ERA, and 75 strikeouts in 2014.\n2015–2016.\nAfter Trevor Cahill was traded to the Atlanta Braves, Diamondbacks chief baseball officer Tony La Russa announced that Bradley would be in the team's 2015 starting rotation. He made his MLB debut on April 11, 2015, allowing only one hit in the Diamondbacks' 6–0 shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He outpitched Clayton Kershaw, becoming only the fourth rookie starter since 2003 to win against a reigning Cy Young Award winner in his major league debut. On April 28, Bradley suffered a sinus fracture when he was hit in the face by a line drive off the bat of Colorado Rockies outfielder Carlos González, and he was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day. Bradley struggled in his return to the mound, allowing four runs in less than three innings in his first start after the injury. He was placed on the disabled list again on June 4 with tendinitis in his shoulder, and began rehab assignments in mid-August. Bradley pitched innings in eight games for the Diamondbacks in 2015, and posted a 2–3 record with a 5.80 ERA.\nAmidst heavy competition for the fifth spot in the starting rotation, Bradley began the 2016 season in Reno. After recording a 1.99 ERA and 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings there, he was called back up on May 29 to replace an injured Shelby Miller, and set a career-high with nine strikeouts in innings in a 6–3 win against the San Diego Padres. His performance that season was inconsistent, posting a 5.02 ERA and retaining the high walk rate that troubled him the previous season. His largest issues were in finding a usable third pitch to round out his fastball and curveball, and a high batting average against left-handed hitters. In 26 starts for Arizona that season, Bradley posted an 8–9 record, with 143 strikeouts but 79 earned runs allowed.\n2017–2018.\nIn 2017, the Diamondbacks had an unusually strong starting rotation, including Zack Greinke, Patrick Corbin, and Robbie Ray, and, rather than sending Bradley back down to the minor leagues, the team moved him to the bullpen. In his first appearance in his new role, Bradley relieved Randall Delgado in the fifth inning of a game against the San Francisco Giants, striking out seven batters in shutout innings. He chose to remain in the bullpen even after Shelby Miller was optioned to the minor leagues, and began serving as the Diamondbacks' setup man. In the 2017 National League Wild Card Game, Bradley hit a two-RBI triple against Pat Neshek of the Colorado Rockies, helping Arizona advance to the 2017 National League Division Series. It was Bradley's first extra-base hit in his major league career and the first postseason triple by a reliever in MLB history. In his first season as a reliever, Bradley posted a 3–3 record and a 1.73 ERA in 73 innings.\nGoing into the 2018 season, Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said that, while Bradley's role in the pitching lineup had not been formally addressed, it was likely that he would remain a reliever. Nearer to the start of the season, Bradley was considered for the role of closer, in contention with Brad Boxberger and Yoshihisa Hirano. Manager Torey Lovullo said that, while Bradley \"was exceptional last year in the role he was in ... the other thought is he's ready to take the next step\". His season took a turn on July 20, when he gave up six runs to the Colorado Rockies, including a grand slam off the bat of Raimel Tapia. Entering the game, Bradley had given up only 10 earned runs in innings of work. His difficulties throughout the remainder of the season were later attributed to a cracked fingernail on his right index finger, which made it difficult for him to grip his signature curveball and forced him to rely more on his fastball. The Diamondbacks' bullpen collapsed in September, with Bradley, Jake Diekman, Matt Andriese, and Andrew Chafin all allowing at least as many runs as innings pitched. Bradley ended up going 4–5 for the season, with a 3.64 ERA, three saves, and 75 strikeouts in innings.\n2019–2020.\nBradley’s troubles continued into the beginning of the 2019 season, in which it took ten appearances before he recorded a clean eighth inning for the Diamondbacks. His poor performance began to lead to speculation that he would be removed from his role as setup man. The following year, Bradley revealed to Arizona Sports 98.7 FM that, after giving up 32 hits, 16 walks, and 20 earned runs in May and June, Lovullo and Hazen called him in for a meeting and discussed how to return him to form without demoting him to the minors. His performance improved after the meeting, and after Greg Holland was designated for assignment that August, Bradley stepped up to close for the Diamondbacks. He posted a 4–5 record and 18 saves in 2019, with a 3.52 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 66 appearances, including 32 games finished.\nDuring the 2020 offseason, Bradley underwent contract arbitration, arguing for a $4.1 million salary rather than the $3.625 million that the Diamondbacks had offered him. The arbitration committee ruled in favor of Bradley on February 21, making him the first largely non-closing reliever to make more than $4 million with fewer than 30 career saves. On July 18, after a delay in the MLB season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bradley was named the Diamondbacks' closer for the 2020 season. He made only 16 appearances for the club that season, going 2–0 with a 2.95 ERA.\nCincinnati Reds (2020).\nOn August 31, 2020, at the MLB trade deadline, the Diamondbacks traded Bradley to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for utility player Josh VanMeter and outfielder Stuart Fairchild. He made his team debut on September 1, pitching shutout innings in a 16–2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals less than three hours after his plane arrived in Cincinnati. In the postseason, Bradley took the loss in the first game of the 2020 National League Wild Card Series, giving up two hits in the 13th inning against the Atlanta Braves. On December 2, Bradley was released from his contract alongside catcher Curt Casali, outfielder Brian Goodwin, and pitcher R. J. Alaniz. He recorded a 1.17 ERA in innings with the Reds.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2021).\nOn January 18, 2021, the Philadelphia Phillies announced that they had signed Bradley to a one-year, $6 million contract in an attempt to bolster their bullpen. That same day, he tweeted \"#SignJT\", a reference to the ongoing calls to the Phillies administration to re-sign free agent catcher J. T. Realmuto. It was projected, during the Phillies' 2021 \"bullpen battle\", that Bradley might take over the closer role from veteran Héctor Neris. On March 31, however, manager Joe Girardi said that Neris would maintain the ninth-inning position, with Bradley and José Alvarado serving as setup men.\nBradley was placed on the injured list on April 11 with an oblique strain, and was expected to miss three to four weeks. In his absence, Connor Brogdon was asked to take over Bradley's role, while JoJo Romero was called up to the majors. Bradley returned on May 18 for a game against the Miami Marlins, striking out the only batter he faced and taking the win. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\nLos Angeles Angels (2022).\nOn March 18, 2022, Bradley signed a one-year, $3.75 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels. On June 26, Bradley broke his elbow while climbing over the dugout railing during a brawl in a game against the Seattle Mariners, sidelining him for at least one month. He was activated from the injured list on September 27.\nMiami Marlins (2023–present).\nOn April 12, 2023, Bradley signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. In 9 games (including 1 start) for the Triple–A Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, he registered a 2.95 ERA with 16 strikeouts in innings of work. On June 13, Bradley was selected to the major league roster. In 4 games for Miami, he struggled to a 12.27 ERA with 7 strikeouts across innings pitched. He was designated for assignment by the team on July 1. On July 3, he cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple–A Jacksonville. On October 2, Bradley elected free agency.\nPitcher profile.\nBradley is a power pitcher who was praised for a successful transition from the starting rotation to the bullpen, working in both the eighth and ninth inning since 2017. The primary concern around his pitching in his first two MLB seasons was a high walk rate, something that he managed to cut in half in 2017, during his first season as a reliever. Bradley told \"The Ringer\" in 2018 that the biggest change he made since becoming a reliever was \"just being aggressive—I'm trying to get ahead of guys and not walk guys.\"\nFor the early part of his career, Bradley largely possessed a two-pitch repertoire consisting of a fastball and a curveball. He pitched a cutter in the minor leagues, and began reintegrating it into his repertoire in 2017 after an unexplained pause. The following year, Bradley also began experimenting with a slider and a changeup to aid him in the bullpen. During the 2020 season, Bradley primarily threw three pitches. His fastball made up 67 percent of his total pitches, while a curveball was thrown 22 percent of the time, and a changeup was thrown the other 11 percent.\nPersonal life.\nAfter being reassigned to the bullpen in 2017, Bradley began to grow a distinct beard, leading to jokes about the necessity of facial hair on a reliever. That season, the Diamondbacks began selling T-shirts with Bradley's face and the phrase \"Bring in the Beard\". Bradley told reporters that, growing up, he preferred to remain clean-shaven because he did not like how bright his beard appeared, but that he let it grow out after Movember and through spring training. After noticing an improvement in his pitching, Bradley decided to keep the beard, saying, \"I don't believe in special powers but it's kind of funny that as soon as I grew a beard I seemed to pitch better\". He clarified that he believed most of the improvement was due to the shorter inning workload placed on a reliever, but that, \"Just in case the palm reader was correct, I won't shave my beard until I retire\".\nBradley took up waterfowl hunting early in his baseball career, and continues to hunt in his free time. In 2017, Bradley purchased a ranch in Pawnee, Oklahoma, about away from the Spring Valley Rod and Gun Club. Bradley and his high school baseball teammate, Mak Monckton, connected with the gun club owner and started Crash Landing Outdoors, a hunting guide company. The name derives from Bradley's Labrador retriever, Crash."

In their opening game, the team broke its record for margin of victory in a 113–46 victory against Western Carolina (a record that would be broken six weeks later with a 75-point victory over North Texas ). The Terrapins also went 6–0 against nonconference opponents at home, increasing their nonconference home winning streak to 64, the longest in the country at the time.\nThe team participated in two preseason tournaments, winning both.

Nevertheless, the history of Malaysian badminton starts much earlier. Already in 1934 an association was founded by the provinces Perak, Penang, Selangor, Johore and Singapore.\nBAM is registered with the sports commissioner's office under the Sports Development Act 1997 of the laws of Malaysia. The association was founded in 1964 and has 15 states as their members.\nControversy.\nUse of tournament bans on players who resigned from BAM.\nBadminton Association of Malaysia, as the national association, is the sole authority to register Malaysian players into Badminton World Federation-sanctioned tournaments, of which made up majority of the international badminton tournaments. On several occasions, BAM had refused to register players who have had left their fold.\nIn 2011, Tan Chun Seang was banned from Asian tournaments for two years after walking out from the national team. In 2019, Toh Ee Wei left BAM after a fallout with the association, and was barred from international tournaments as an independent player. Toh had since returned to BAM in 2020.\nIn September 2021, Goh Jin Wei resigned from the national team, citing health issues and explained that she \"could never be able to fulfil the requirements and conditions of the national team\". Goh instead signed as an independent player with Kuala Lumpur Racquet Club on 6 January 2022. On 19 January 2022, Lee Zii Jia decided to quit the team as he felt that he couldn't withstand the pressure to be on the national team. In response, BAM sanctioned both Lee and Goh by banning both players for participating in any international events for 2 years. BAM deputy president Jahaberdeen Mohamed Yunoos said that the decision was made \"to safeguard BAM's integrity as a national institution and custodian of the sport's national interest\". The decision has caused anger among national and international fans, denouncing BAM decision. Danish badminton player and Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen condemn the sanctions as \"crazy\" and expressed solidarity with Lee and Goh. The same condemnation also expressed by other international badminton players like Anders Antonsen, Hans-Kristian Vittinghus, and Gronya Somerville. Supporters of the decision argued that Lee's premature exit from the national team may trigger other players to do same, and potentially losing sponsorship income for BAM. After a meeting between BAM and Lee on 25 January 2022, an agreement was reached with the ban to be lifted with terms yet to be disclosed."

For the third successive year a Queensland victory set a new record for consecutive State of Origin titles, reaching six. Game I was played in Brisbane, Game II in Sydney and Game III was again played in Brisbane. Game III was also Australia's most watched sports TV programme for the year 2011.\nMal Meninga continued on as coach of Queensland whilst New South Wales had chosen to follow the successful Maroons approach by appointing Ricky Stuart as a full-time Origin coach (with no other club commitments) in an attempt to rebuild a winning mentality for the team and the State, after being beaten in the 2010 series 3–0 for the first time since 1995. Despite a much improved New South Wales outfit, Queensland stretched their series-winning streak to six titles, securing it with a 34–24 victory in the third and deciding game of the series in front of a record equalling 52,498 fans at Suncorp Stadium. The series also marked Queensland skipper Darren Lockyer's final series, winning in his 36th and final State of Origin game. Queensland hooker Cameron Smith was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Player of the Series.\nGame I.\nLike his predecessor as New South Wales coach Craig Bellamy, Ricky Stuart was brought in to coach against Meninga, who was captaining Canberra in the 1990 NSWRL season's Grand final victory when Stuart and Bellamy both played under him. Stuart was reported to have been given by selectors the team of his choosing and in doing so, picked five Origin debutantes in Akuila Uate, Josh Dugan, Jamie Soward, Trent Merrin and Dean Young. The strong form of the St George Illawarra Dragons was acknowledged with the selection of seven from that club side in Soward, Young, Merrin, Ben Creagh, Brett Morris, Mark Gasnier and Beau Scott. Queensland stuck with their successful line-up from 2010 although injuries to centres Greg Inglis and Justin Hodges saw call-ups for Brisbane's Jharal Yow Yeh and Melbourne's Dane Nielsen to don the Maroon jersey for their first time.\nPre-match entertainment was provided by James Blunt before the Australian national anthem was performed by The Ten Tenors.\nThe Queensland forwards led by Petero Civoniceva and Matthew Scott bustled the New South Wales pack from the kick off and appeared to have the upper hand in the early stage of the game enabling the Maroons to run off each other and take ground. When Johnathan Thurston scored in the fifth minute off a Cameron Smith grubber it looked as though the Blues could be in for a long night. But the New South Wales team galvanised its defence and managed to hold Queensland out for the entire remainder of the first half in spite of Queensland forcing repeated sets close to the Blues tryline through the excellent kicking performances of Thurston and Darren Lockyer. New South Wales gained composure as the half went on and put pressure on the Queensland defence at times, although scoring opportunities were few and the kicking games of Soward and Mitchell Pearce were covered well by the classy Queensland backs. New South Wales would have taken heart from the 0–6 scoreline at the break.\nSix minutes into the second half a grubber kick for the corner from Cooper Cronk for the Maroons looked to be covered by Brett Morris but when Morris opted to shield instead of taking the ball, Queensland debutante winger Jharal Yow Yeh pounced and took the scoreline to 10–0 to Queensland. From the 50th to the 60th minute Queensland threw everything at the Blues and pinpoint kick finishes ensured repeat sets. New South Wales at one point defended six consecutive sets, tackling heroically and solidly showing the kind of understanding and team communication that would be expected of well seasoned club combinations. Thurston missed a penalty goal from close range and as if buoyed by the reprieve New South Wales came to life turning defence into attack and scoring two tries quickly in the 65th then 69th minutes of the match. Firstly a missed tackle from Civoniceva on Greg Bird created an opportunity for Pearce to collect a pass from Bird and score under the posts. Then four minutes later Blues speedster Michael Jennings scored and New South Wales took a 12–10 lead with ten minutes to play.\nAfter an immediate response from the Queensland forwards who took the play into Blues territory the senior Queensland playmakers took control and surprised New South Wales with a simple Smith to Thurston to Lockyer play who in turn put an inside ball to Slater to score in the 73rd minute. Thurston converted and after a final period when the Maroons showed their experience in defence, the match finished with a 16–12 scoreline to Queensland and a 1–0 start to the series.\nGame II.\nThe New South Wales' selected squad for Game Two saw numerous changes, mainly due to injury concerns and position transfers. Backs Brett Morris, Michael Jennings and prop Kade Snowden all missed selection due to injuries suffered in their previous club games. Blues Fullback Josh Dugan later joined the injury list shortly following selection, injuring his ankle only hours before the squad was announced. He was replaced by experienced Sydney Roosters fullback Anthony Minichiello (the only remaining survivor from New South Wales' last series victory in 2005), playing his first Origin game since 2007. Jarryd Hayne and William Hopoate joined the squad to replace the injured Morris and Jennings respectively, with Hopoate becoming New South Wales' third youngest player to debut into the squad, behind Brad Fittler and Jarryd Hayne who also both debuted at 19.\nOther notable inclusions included utility Kurt Gidley and backrowers Anthony Watmough and Luke Lewis on the interchange. Blues Captain Paul Gallen was chosen to play at prop at game II despite being a recognized back rower, at the expense of Jason King. Gallen's reassignment saw a reshuffle in the back row with Ben Creagh filling in at second row and Greg Bird covering in at lock.\nQueensland's Johnathan Thurston landed a penalty goal 2 minutes in to make it 0-2 before the game had clicked into gear. Cameron Smith's try and 'JT' scoring the conversion made it 0-8 and the Blues were looking doomed. Luke Lewis caught a Mitchell Pearce bomb and Jamie Soward curled a terrific sideline conversion to make it 8–6.\nDesperate to avoid losing a sixth consecutive series, the Blues, trailing 8–6 at halftime managed to keep Queensland scoreless in the second half whilst at the same time scoring tries through debutant William Hopoate and Anthony Minichiello to score a series-levelling 18–8 victory. Minichiello was one of only two NSW players who played in the last victorious NSW side, the other being Mark Gasnier. The Maroons' loss was their first in Sydney since Game I, 2008, their equal lowest score at the venue since Game I, 2004 and their lowest score in any Origin game since Game III, 2007.\nThe Australian National Anthem was performed by the Sydney Children's Choir and the Gondwana National Indigenous Children's Choir.\nGame III.\nQueensland, in its bid to win a sixth straight series, recalled Justin Hodges from injury, thus relegating Dane Nielsen to 18th man. Suspension to David Taylor also led to the re-selection of Jacob Lillyman back onto the Maroons' bench. New South Wales chose to pick an initial squad of 20 due to injury concerns to several players. Keith Galloway made his Origin debut from the bench at the expense of Trent Merrin, with Merrin called back into the squad as 18th man as cover for Beau Scott and Glenn Stewart. Only hours before the match it was confirmed that both Michael Jennings and Beau Scott both succumbed to their injuries and made late withdrawals, forcing Jarryd Hayne to move from wing to centre with Brett Morris starting on the wing and Glenn Stewart replacing Scott.\nQueensland scored four quick tries within 20 minutes to shoot out to a 24–0 lead with five minutes to play to half-time, before two late NSW tries got the margin back to 24–10 by half-time. But then the Maroons turned on the after-burners with two more tries, and another two late tries to the Blues (including an eight-point try to Jarryd Hayne) reduced the final margin to 34–24, ensuring yet another Queensland series victory, their sixth in succession, and sentencing New South Wales to yet another year in the Origin doldrums. There is set to be another review of the New South Wales operations after yet another series loss.\nOne sour note for the Maroons was a potentially season-ending injury to halfback Johnathan Thurston, who is the most likely to inherit Darren Lockyer's No. 6 jersey for the 2012 series. It was later revealed that Thurston suffered a less serious knee injury, ruling him out for up to a month and triggering a form slump for his club the North Queensland Cowboys (which fell from the top four at the time of Thurston's injury to a final position of 7th at season's end). Also, captain-in-waiting and Wally Lewis Medallist Cameron Smith was cleared of a charge of kneeing New South Wales centre Jarryd Hayne which resulted in an eight-point try awarded to the Blues.\nTeams.\nThe 18th man is a reserve to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, does not actually play.\nNew South Wales Blues.\n1 - Josh Dugan was originally selected to play but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Anthony Minichiello.\n2 - Dean Young switched places with Michael Ennis to play in the starting side after being initially selected for the bench."

TV4 and MTV3 served as host broadcasters of the event.\nThe host team Sweden won the team's ninth title in history by defeating Switzerland in the final 5–1, and became the first host team to win the tournament since the Soviet Union team won the 1986 World Championship in Moscow, Soviet Union. The Swedish team started the tournament with an unconvincing performance but managed to get a collective boost when the Sedin brothers joined the team after the Vancouver Canucks had been eliminated in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Switzerland sent a clear message about their recently improved hockey program by going undefeated through the tournament before the final; finishing first in their group (ahead of Canada and Sweden); and earning their second silver medal in history, as well as the team's first medal since 1953.\nBidding.\nAt the semi-annual congress in Vancouver on 21 September 2007, Sweden was voted the host of the 2013 tournament, defeating the runner-up Belarus by 55 votes. Other countries in the running were Hungary, Czech Republic and Latvia (which withdrew from the race and endorsed the Swedish bid). At the congress in Bern in 2009, it was announced that Finland (the host for the 2012 World Championship) and Sweden would co-host both the 2012 and 2013 tournaments.\nKimmo Leinonen served as the general secretary of the jointly-hosted events.\nLocations.\nThe host arenas were the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm (12,500 permitted seats) and Hartwall Areena in Helsinki (13,506 permitted seats). Capacity has been limited to these numbers because of modern health and safety rules. Malmö Arena was originally planned to be the second arena, but because of a proposal made by the Finnish federation, the games were transferred to Helsinki, which gave the arena the opportunity to host the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. Tampere was also a candidate to be the Finnish venue, but due to a delay in construction of the new Tampereen Keskusareena, Helsinki was named as co-host. Also in Stockholm, the Tele2 Arena, a new retractable-roof multi-purpose stadium seating 30,000 spectators on the side of the Globen, was planned to host at least one game, but due to construction delays it would not be finished until July 2013, two months after the World Championship.\nFormat.\nThe format of the tournament was the same as in 2012, which was also co-hosted by Helsinki and Stockholm. Sixteen teams were divided into two groups of eight, who played a seven-game round-robin within their groups.

Canada went undefeated at the tournament to win its first IIHF championship since 2007. With the win, Canadian captain Sidney Crosby became a member of the Triple Gold Club and the first to be the team captain for all three events. For winning all of its tournament games in regulation, the Canadian team earned the new Infront Team Jackpot award of one million Swiss francs. The Russians on the other hand were fined 80,000 CHF for most Russian players walking out from the medal ceremony before the Canadian anthem was played after the final game.\nThe United States won the bronze medal, defeating Czech Republic 3–0 in the bronze medal final game. Czech player Jaromír Jágr (at 43 years of age) was the MVP of the tournament, and announced his retirement from international competition afterwards.\nBids.\nOn 21 May 2010, the Czech bid was successful and got 84 votes in the race for hosting the 2015 IIHF World Championship.

        "title": "World Snooker Tour",
        "text": "The World Snooker Tour (WST) is the main professional snooker tour, consisting of approximately 128 players competing on a circuit of up to 28 tournaments each season. The World Snooker Tour is administered by World Snooker Ltd, the commercial arm of professional snooker, which introduced the World Snooker Tour name, logo, and revised website as part of a 2020 rebranding. The principal stakeholder in World Snooker Ltd is Matchroom Sport, which owns 51 percent of the company; the sport's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), owns 26 percent. To compete on the World Snooker Tour, players must be WPBSA members.\nBackground.\nThe current incarnation of the World Snooker Tour was created in the early 1970s when the WPBSA took over the running of the professional game. At the time of the takeover, in 1971, there were only a handful of professional events to play in, but further events were gradually added throughout the 1970s, and by the end of the decade there were over twenty events on the calendar and snooker was a regular televised fixture. This period in the professional game has come to be known as the \"modern era\"; it is generally accepted to date from 1969 (when the BBC commissioned Pot Black and the knock-out format that is used by the modern-day World Snooker Championship was introduced) to the present day. \nHistorically a player just needed to become a professional member of the governing body to participate in events, which was attained by formal invitation by an existing current member, and this system was eventually replaced by the Pro-Ticket series. The game went open for the 1991–92 season, whereby anyone could apply for professional membership and enter the tournaments. Due to over-subscription, a two-tiered tour structure was adopted for the 1997–98 season: the primary tour—officially now known as the World Snooker Tour but previously known (and still commonly referred to) as the Main Tour—with a limited membership, and a secondary professional tour was established for the rest of the professional membership.\nStructure.\nThe World Snooker Tour consists of ranking tournaments which contribute to a player's ranking, and invitational events which do not. All players on the tour can enter a ranking event, whereas the entry criteria for an invitational event is often set by the sponsor or broadcaster, and usually excludes many players on the tour. Ranking tournaments are often played in two stages—a qualification stage and the main draw, usually at different locations. The main draw is most likely to be held at a prestigious venue where audiences can purchase a ticket and watch the players compete. Typically only the main draw is televised, and therefore often carries considerably higher prize money than the qualifiers. Players traditionally come into ranking events in different rounds based on their world ranking, and the top players in the sport—often the top 16 ranked players—are usually seeded through to the venue stage and do not have to play a qualification match; however, from the 2013–14 season the circuit began to transition to a flat format structure, with all the players starting in the first round. Some tournaments also have an amateur leg that makes it possible for non-members to enter WPBSA events.\nStarting from the 2021-22 snooker season, the tour began to transition some of its events back to a seeded format using qualifying rounds. The Home Nations Series was the first set of events to follow this change, where the first round was played as a qualifying round for all non-Top 16 players, with those in the Top 16 — plus local nation wildcards — having their matches held over to the final venue. The UK Championship followed suit from the 2022 edition, which effectively turned the tournament into a near-identical copy of the World Snooker Championship, with the exception being frame length. While some of these changes have been criticised by lower ranked players [due to qualifiers often being played without crowds and in cubicles, a reminder to some of the pre-Barry Hearn era], others have praised them, especially the format change for the UK Championship which reverted the tournament to the prestige that it had before the flat-128 draw was imposed upon it.\nQualification.\nTo compete on the World Snooker Tour as a professional player, a player must qualify for it. At the end of each season, a pre-determined number of players are relegated from the tour based on their performance in ranking tournaments and on the secondary tour, making way for new professionals to join the tour. There are several qualification routes for the tour: a player can gain qualification via the various events organised by the WPBSA itself or affiliate organisations, and a limited number of places are usually made available to players at the discretion of the governing body.\nHistory.\nFollowing the creation of the World Snooker Tour in the 1997–98 season, the top ranked professionals qualified automatically for places while the rest of the membership had to qualify for places through a series of qualifying schools. The qualifying schools were only held the once, and thereafter the main qualification route was via the secondary professional tour. Following the scrapping of the secondary tour, the promotion places were then allocated to the International Open Series (PIOS)—an amateur open tour organised by Pontins—for the 2005–06 season. The amateur status of the event meant that players who had been relegated from the Main Tour and wished to compete on PIOS had to relinquish their professional membership. This had an unpopular side effect, since if players relinquished professional membership they would be unable to enter the World Snooker Championship, which was previously open to all professional members including those who do not compete on the Main Tour. Another issue was that players could not compete on PIOS while competing on the Main Tour, meaning that they were unable to safeguard their membership on the Main Tour by immediately re-qualifying via PIOS, effectively keeping them out of professional competition for a whole season should they drop off the tour. Even though PIOS was a competition in its own right, it primarily served as a Main Tour qualification route, and anticipating the streamlining of tour qualification for the 2011–12 season this unpopular contest was discontinued after the 2009–10 season.\nQ School.\nThe Q School was established in an attempt to streamline the qualification process for the World Snooker Tour, and is more or less a replacement for PIOS. A series of play-offs are run through to the quarter-final stages only. Players pay a fixed entry fee to enter all the play-off events, and there is no prize money. Each player who wins a quarter-final game qualifies for a two-year tour card on the World Snooker Tour. All the players that have entered the event compete in the first play-off, and those that are not successful are automatically entered into the next play-off and so on.\nThere are some important differences between the Q School and PIOS. Q School is purely a qualification process whereas PIOS was a tournament series in its own right. Q School is conducted in a limited time period of two to three weeks in May, during the interlude between seasons, while PIOS events were played over the course of the season. Another important distinction from PIOS is that Q-School is open to everyone, and players who have just been relegated from the World Snooker Tour are eligible to enter and if successful immediately regain their places on the tour.\nThose who do not manage to qualify for the World Snooker Tour may still be entered into professional tournaments using a Q School top-up list, known as the Order of Merit. This list ranks the amateur players by their performance during the play-offs: should a tournament not consist of 128 World Snooker Tour players for any reason (such as the tournaments that ran through the 2020–21 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic), the highest ranked players on the top-up list will be invited to play in professional tournaments as amateurs. In this vein, players are encouraged to perform well, because they may still feature in World Snooker Tour events and thus have television exposure if they manage to reach the televised stages of an event that they have entered.\nOther qualification routes.\nSince the 2014–15 snooker season, the World Snooker board has discretion to award invitational tour cards (ITCs) to players who have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. ITCs are typically issued to prominent late-career players who have been relegated from the main tour; players who hold or have held ITCs include Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, James Wattana, Jimmy White, and Ken Doherty. A maximum of four players can hold ITCs at any one time. An ITC holder who finishes the season inside the top 64 of the world rankings, or inside the top eight on the one-year list, will earn a full tour card for the following season.\nThere are several routes available to amateurs and they involve competitions provided through various amateur governing bodies. The two main ones beyond Q School are the European Billiards and Snooker Association (EBSA) Qualifying Tour and the Chinese Billiards and Snooker Association (CBSA) China Tour. The EBSA also nominates their amateur and junior champions.&lt;ref name=\"tour 2018/19\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe World Women’s Snooker (WWS) Tour became a tour qualification route in 2021. At the end of each season, two-year tour cards are issued to the winner of the World Women’s Snooker Championship and to the highest-ranked player from the women's ranking list who is not already on the tour. If the women's World Champion is already on the tour, that card will be issued to the next highest ranked female player who is not on the tour.\nCurrent criteria.\nThe players who retain their place on the tour are only guaranteed a place for one further season, while all other players—including those that requalify—are awarded a two-year tour card.\nSecondary professional tour.\nA secondary tour was first established in the 1994–95 season; comprising six tournaments, the WPBSA Minor Tour was open to all professionals, but only ran for one season. The concept was revived in the 1997–98 season in the form of the UK Tour, following the adoption of a two-tier tour structure. Unlike the Main Tour which had restricted membership, the UK Tour was initially open to all professional members, even those competing on the Main Tour—although members of the Main Tour were prohibited from entering from the 1999–2000 season. It was rebranded the Challenge Tour from the 2000–01 season, and open to all players not on the Main Tour and amateurs. From the 2001–02 season, the Challenge Tour had a restricted membership and offered exclusive professional competition to a limited number of professionals that were not members of the Main Tour, and the Open Tour was established which was open to all players—including players on the Main and Challenge tours. The WPBSA operated the three level circuit until the end of the 2002–03 season when it split with the English Association of Snooker and Billiards (EASB). Since the Open Tour fell under the control of the EASB, which is an amateur governing body, the Open Tour took on amateur status and professional players were no longer eligible to enter. The Challenge Tour was axed upon completion of the 2004–05 season, leaving the restricted Main Tour as the only professional competition provided by the WPBSA. There was another attempt to establish a secondary tour in the 2009–10 season, with the introduction of the Pro Challenge Series. Only four of the planned seven events were played before the series was axed due to low player participation; one of the criticisms of the event was that it offered no ranking points which discouraged participation.\nThe 2010–11 season saw the introduction of the Players Tour Championship (PTC), a series of minor-ranking tournaments that were open to the entire professional membership. The PTC events also included an amateur leg, effectively making it an open tour. They also counted towards the rankings for professionals on the Main Tour, and any player who finished in the top 8 of the PTC Order of Merit was guaranteed a tour card for the following season. The PTC was discontinued at the end of the 2015–16 season, just leaving the Main Tour as the only professional tour.\nThe Challenge Tour was revived for the 2018–19 season. The tour consists of ten events with a 72-player field, drawing the top 64 players from the Q School Order of Merit who did not qualify for the Main Tour, in addition to a maximum of eight wildcards. It also ran during the 2019–20 season, but was axed during the 2020–21 season during a truncated season played largely behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was revived again for the 2021–22 season under the new name of the Q Tour."

        "title": "Paul Cummins (basketball)",
        "text": "Paul Cummins (born 1984 in County Kildare, Ireland) is an Irish basketball player who plays for the Ireland national basketball team.\nBiography.\nCummins was born in County Kildare, Ireland in 1984. After he was named 'junior Irish player of the year' in 2001, he went to play basketball and study at the Ravenscroft School in North Carolina. Cummins then attended top ranked national powerhouse South Kent School on an athletic scholarship for one year (2003) and graduated as one of 6 basketball players to earn a further NCAA Division I scholarship from South Kent.\nCareer.\nCummins is an Irish senior men's international basketball player and has represented Ireland since he was 15 years old. While attending high-school in America, Cummins was named to the North Carolina All-State basketball and track teams. He led the Ravenscroft Ravens to state finals in both basketball and soccer, and was the NC state long-jump champion in 2003. At the South Kent School, Cummins joined a nationally ranked basketball team that had six players sign with NCAA Division-1 basketball programs, and one player, Dorell Wright, who made the jump directly to the NBA. Throughout the history of Irish basketball thus far, Cummins was one a very small number of Irish-born male players to ever earn a basketball scholarship to an American NCAA Division I college (Lafayette College) under head Coach Fran O'Hanlon. By the end of his college career he was ranked 5th in most three-pointers made in Lafayette basketball history and was named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Honor Court. Cummins scored 20 plus points on three occasions, including a big home win over Army. Cummins started for Lafayette throughout each of his four years there and as a freshman, Cummins high-scored with 17 points against final-four team Louisville (2004).\nAfter graduating in 2008, Cummins played professionally in Europe. In 2019 Cummins signed for the City of Edinburgh Kings basketball club where he won the Scottish National Cup, was the Scottish cup final MVP (24 points), was named 'National-League Import Player of the Year' and finished as the Scottish league's top scorer at 26 ppg. In the Scottish Universities league final, Cummins scored 54 points as Edinburgh defeated rivals Glasgow to win the title. In 2010 Cummins signed with the Ulster Elks and averaged 18 ppg in the Irish Superleague. In 2011/2012 Cummins signed with Belfast Star where he averaged 20 ppg and finished as the top scoring Irish player in the Superleague. After numerous recurring knee injuries since 2009, he decided to retire from playing basketball competitively in 2012. After three years Cummins then returned to the court and signed wit Templeogue Basketball Club (TBC) who compete in the Irish Superleague from 2015-2017. In those two years with TBC Cummins won the Irish Superleage Cup (2015/2016) and then the Irish Superleague in the 2016/2017 season. Cummins retired after the 2017 Irish Superleague victory.\nIn 2005 Cummins set up a basketball clinic for Irish youth players named 'Hoopsclinic' which has grown each year and promoted the game of basketball to a wide network of youth players keen on developing their fundamental basketball skills. In 2011, Cummins also established Sport-Dream-Academy (SDA); an elite sports development academy that is based on 3 missions: 1) Providing Top-Quality Coaching on all aspects of the game in order to develop individual and team skills leading to personal player improvement 2) Creating an ‘Elite-Level’ performance environment where athletes can be challenged and can compete and develop their skills according to their talent and potential 3) Exposing top Irish talent to potential opportunities in sport both at home and abroad. Since SDA was started in 2013, it has supported numerous athletes in pursuing their student-athlete careers abroad including five athletes who went on to play NCAA Division-1 basketball.\nCummins graduated Lafayette College (USA) in 2008 with a BA double-degree in psychology and music. Cummins is a qualified performance psychologist, having received his MSc degree in 2009 from the University of Edinburgh. He then completed an MBA at the University of Ulster in 2010. In 2014 Cummins completed his Ph.D. in Psychology where he researched Leadership in Sport and Business and has worked in and with numerous organisations over the past 5 years on personal and team leadership and sustainable culture change. Cummins has also worked, and continues to work with a range of top athletes (including Olympic athletes) and business leaders in improving performance and their capacity to lead effectively. Cummins has numerous published articles on Leadership in Sport, and in 2015 co-authored a book entitled 'Leadership in Sport' followed by a 2018 book named Leadership in Sports Coaching. Cummins is currently Managing Director at SeaChange Ltd; an Irish organisational development and risk management company, and he directs Basketball Ireland's Junior Leinster Academy."

        "title": "Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League",
        "text": "The Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL) is a 16-team collegiate summer baseball league founded in 2010. As of 2022, all teams are within New York (state). All players in the league must have NCAA eligibility remaining in order to participate. Players are not paid so as to maintain their college eligibility. Each team plays an eight-week, 48 game schedule from June to August with playoffs in early August.\nHistory.\nThe Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League was founded in the fall of 2010 by eight summer baseball teams located across upstate New York in conjunction with Perfect Game USA, baseball's largest scouting service. The eight founding members of the PGCBL were the Albany Dutchmen, Amsterdam Mohawks, Cooperstown Hawkeyes, Elmira Pioneers, Glens Falls Golden Eagles, Mohawk Valley DiamondDawgs, Newark Pilots and Watertown Wizards. The league's first season was completed in the summer of 2011.\nThe eight teams were broken down into two divisions, PGCBL East and PGCBL West. The East comprised Albany, Amsterdam, Glens Falls and Mohawk Valley. The West was made up of Cooperstown, Elmira, Newark and Watertown. Glens Falls and Cooperstown were the regular season division champions in the PGCBL East and West respectively. Glens Falls, Cooperstown, Amsterdam and Newark qualified for the league playoffs. Newark defeated Amsterdam, two games to one, to win the very first PGCBL championship.\nIn 2012, the league expanded to nine teams with the addition of the Oneonta Outlaws. The two-division format was replaced by a single nine-team division with the top four teams in the league regular season standings qualifying for the playoffs. Amsterdam won 35 of 47 regular season games and captured the regular season championship. Amsterdam, Glens Falls, Newark and Mohawk Valley qualified for the postseason. Amsterdam swept Glens Falls to win its first league title. The Mohawks finished the summer ranked third nationally in Perfect Game's Summer Top 30 poll.\nThe Adirondack Trail Blazers and the Utica Brewers joined the PGCBL in the fall of 2012 while the Oneonta Outlaws were granted a one year Voluntary Suspension of operations. The 2013 season saw a return of the two-division format as 10 teams were broken into East and West divisions. Albany, Cooperstown, Glens Falls, Mohawk Valley and defending champion Amsterdam formed the East while newcomers Adirondack and Utica joined Elmira, Newark and Watertown in the West. A new playoff format featuring six teams was instituted as the first and second-place finishers in each division were joined for the first time by the third-place finishing team - this led to a down-to-wire playoff chase where the sixth and final playoff spot was not decided until the final night of the regular season. Amsterdam and Watertown overcame slow starts to win division titles; each team captured its first division title in the PGCBL. Albany, Mohawk Valley, Elmira and Newark rounded out the playoff field. Three seeds Albany and Elmira each won opening round playoff games over second-seeded Mohawk Valley and Newark respectively to advance to the divisional finals against Amsterdam and Watertown. Amsterdam edged out Albany and Elmira in back-to-back Game 3's to become the first repeat champion in league history.\nThe Cooperstown Hawkeyes were placed on Voluntary Suspension for the 2014 season, leaving four teams in the East Division. The Amsterdam Mohawks again finished with the best record in the league at 36-11- winning the East by nine games over the Mohawk Valley DiamondDawgs. The West Division was a little tighter with the division coming down to the final days of the regular season. Newark came out on top, winning the division by a game and a half over Elmira with a 27-19 record. In the postseason, Mohawk Valley defeated the Albany Dutchmen in the one-game playoff in the East while Elmira beat the Watertown Rams in Elmira in the West. In the East Division Championship Series, Amsterdam swept Mohawk Valley en route to a fourth consecutive PGCBL Championship Series appearance. In the West, Newark escaped against Elmira to set up a rematch of the 2011 Championship Series. Amsterdam came back from an early deficit to win Game One in Amsterdam and traveled to Newark the following night, where the Mohawks capped off a record-breaking season with the franchise's third straight PGCBL championship.\nIn July 2014, the league announced a franchise will be placed in Saugerties, New York and play in the East Division-effective for the 2015 season. In January 2015, the league announced the addition of a franchise in Victor for the 2015 season. The league also decided to play a 50-game schedule, compared to the previous length of a 48-game schedule. The Cooperstown Hawkeyes remained on voluntary suspension and were joined by the Watertown Rams.\nIn 2015, the Amsterdam Mohawks won the East Division with a record 40 wins in the regular season. The Elmira Pioneers won the West Division, with a team record 33 wins. Both teams were upset in the divisional round of playoffs as Mohawk Valley upended the defending champions in three games, while the first year Victor RailRiders swept the Pioneers. The Mohawk Valley DiamondDawgs then swept the RailRiders to capture the 2015 PGCBL Championship, the first in team history.\nAt the PGCBL owners meeting in October 2015, the league announced the addition of three teams to the league roster. Former NYCBL members Geneva and Oneonta jumped to the PGCBL for 2016. The Jamestown Jammers also decided to move to the PGCBL after having played in the Prospect League in 2015. In April 2016, the Utica Brewers changed their name to the Utica Blue Sox.\nThe 2016 season featured a 50-game regular season for the second straight year. A year after setting a PGCBL record with 40 wins in the regular season, the Amsterdam Mohawks again finished with the best regular season record at 34-15, winning the East Division. In the West, the Elmira Pioneers won their second straight division title with a 33-15 record.\nA new eight-team playoff format saw the top two seeds in both divisions advance to the division finals, with Amsterdam meeting Albany and Elmira facing Utica. Amsterdam went back to the PGCBL Finals to meet Utica, who was making their first trip in franchise history. Both series went the full three games. Amsterdam then swept the PGCBL finals with two decisive victories to earn their fourth title in five years.\nBefore the 2017 season, the PGCBL announced the addition of the Onondaga Flames for the coming season, and awarded a franchise to Watertown, which would begin play in 2018.\nThree teams earned playoff berths for the first time during the 2017 season. Saugerties earned the number four seed in the East, while Geneva bounced back from a 9-40 season to get a home playoff game in the West. Onondaga also qualified for the first time, picking up the number four seed in the West.\nIn the playoffs, Amsterdam and Mohawk Valley got through in the West, while Elmira and Jamestown matched up in the West Finals. Mohawk Valley then dethroned Amsterdam for the second time in three seasons to set up a PGCBL Finals with the Jamestown Jammers. The DiamondDawgs swept the PGCBL Finals to earn their second title.\nWith the addition of Watertown and the voluntary suspension of Onondaga, the PGCBL moved to a three division format, creating a West, Central, and an East Division before the 2018 season.\nIn March 2018, the PGCBL announced a new President and Vice President to guide the league into the future. Former New York–Penn League (NYPL) President Robert Julian was named President, and longtime right-hand man and Utica College baseball coach Joe Milazzo was named Vice President.\nIn October 2018, the defending champion Jamestown Jammers abruptly announced they were ceasing operations after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based ownership group pulled out of the league in favor of setting up an American Association of Independent Professional Baseball team in its home city. The city's PGCBL rights were suspended for 2019 with the intent to return in 2020; originally announced to be retaining the Jammers name and brand, the team unexpectedly announced in October 2019 that the new team would \"not\" use the Jammers name. The new name, Jamestown Tarp Skunks, was revealed in January 2020.\nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic on May 6, 2020.\nIn 2021, the league welcomed the Auburn Doubledays and the Batavia Muckdogs from the NYPL and the Niagara Power from the New York Collegiate Baseball League, bringing the league to a record 16 teams. The 16 teams were organized into three divisions: East, Central, and West. No 2021 All-Star game was held.\nFor the 2022 season, the PGCBL switched from the three-division format back to two divisions, East and West, and the Adirondack Trail Blazers were renamed the Boonville Baseball Club. All-Star games were not held in 2022 and 2023, but players were named for All-Star teams in both divisions.\nIn December 2022, industry veteran Butch Russo became the new proprietor of the Boonville Baseball Club. The team was renamed to the Boonville Lumberjacks.\nBroadcasting.\nThe PGCBL requires all of its member teams to produce television (usually Internet television) feeds with play-by-play for every home game. The play-by-play may be simulcast over radio."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 1996 were the thirteenth European kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by the Serbia and Montenegro kickboxing president Borislav Pelević. The event was the first ever to be held in Serbia and Montenegro and welcomed the country back into the international community after the devastation of the Bosnian War. It was open to amateur men and women representing thirty-seven countries in Europe - more detail on the participating nations is provided in the relevant section below. \nThere were four styles on offer in Belgrade; Full-Contact, Low-Kick (men only), Semi-Contact and Light-Contact, with no room for Musical Forms. By the end of the championships, Poland just about shaded Italy into first place by virtue of more silver medals, while Hungary came in third. The event was held in Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro in October, 1996. \nParticipating nations.\nThere were thirty-seven nations from across Europe in attendance at the 1996 W.A.K.O. European Championships in Belgrade:\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact was available for both men and women at Belgrade and involved the participants trying to win the contest either by a point decision or via stoppage using both kicks and punches – more detail on the rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that they may have changed slightly since 1993. The men had twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had six weight divisions ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 65 kg/+143 lbs. Notable gold medalists included Gary \"Smiler\" Turner who would go on to win several regional tournaments in K-1, Roman Bugaj who would later turn to pro boxing (and also won silver at the same event in Light-Contact) and Natascha Ragosina who would become a legend in women's boxing. Another notable medalists was Barrington Patterson who would have some success on the European MMA circuit, as well as becoming a pro-kickboxing world champion. By the end of the championships, Poland were the strongest nation in Full-Contact, winning five golds and four bronzes across both the male and female competitions. \nLow-Kick.\nLow-Kick differs from Full-Contact kickboxing in that it allows kicks below the knee - more detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that there may have been some rule changes since 1996. The style was available to men only and there was twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. Notable winners in this category included Ivan Strugar who would go on to win multiple European and world kickboxing titles and Cengiz Koç who would also have some success as an amateur boxer. By the championships end the host nation Serbia and Montenegro were the strongest country in Low-Kick, winning two golds, one silver and four bronze medals. \nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing in which fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1996. Men and women both took part with the men having eight weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 89 kg/+195.8 lbs and the women having five ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs. By the end of the championships Italy was the most successful nation overall in Semi-Contact, winning four golds, one silver and four bronze medals. \nLight-Contact.\nMore physical than Semi-Contact but less so than Full-Contact with points awarded and fights won on the basis of speed and technique over power, Light-Contact is seen as a transition stage for fighters who were considering a move from Semi to Full-Contact. More information on Light-Contact rules can be found of the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1996. Similar to Semi-Contact the men had eight weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 89 kg/+195.8 lbs while the women had five ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs. There were a couple of notable medalists with kickboxing and taekwon-do champion Tomaž Barada winning gold, and future E.B.U. boxing champion Rafał Jackiewicz gaining a bronze. Poland were the strongest country in Light-Contact at the end of the championships, winning three golds, six silvers and two bronzes across the male and female events. "

        "title": "Polara Golf",
        "text": "Polara Golf is a brand of golf equipment, focused on balls and clubs, released to market in 1977. Polara-branded products, such as intentionally-asymmetrical balls not approved for official tournaments, have been manufactured by several companies. The last such company was Aero X-Golf Inc., which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017.\nOverview.\nPolara's inventors patented their first ball in 1974, starting operations three years later. Nevertheless, the United States Golf Association (USGA) did not approve the ball for use in official tournaments, which caused the company to sue the association. After a 7-year dispute, the USGA agreed to pay US$1.4 million to Polara under the condition the ball was removed from the market.\nOfficially approved balls are designed to be as symmetrical as possible. This symmetry is the result of a dispute that stemmed from the original Polara, that had six rows of normal dimples on its equator but very shallow dimples elsewhere. This asymmetrical design helped the ball self-adjust its spin-axis during the flight. Over 300,000 balls were sold. The United States Golf Association refused to approve it for tournament play and, in 1981, changed the rules to ban aerodynamic asymmetrical balls. Polara's producer sued the USGA and the association paid US$1.375 million in a 1985 out-of-court settlement.\nMarket research performed by Golf Datatech found that roughly 28% of frequent golfers would be interested in playing a ball with benefits, even if it was nonconforming. According to Gary De Bay, Polara Golf CEO, about 40% of golfers who tried the ball at a demo day said they would buy it. An article in \"The New York Times\" in May 2011 sparked a media blitz, including a segment on CNBC. The great demand \"crashed Polara Golf’s computer servers for hours.\" There was backlash against the \"illegal\" ball. Ken Hambleton backtracked after interviewing Felker, writing \"The problem with the latest version of Polara ... is that it works.\"\nIn January 2012, Polara announced its new XD and XDS balls, which have higher ball flight and extra distance.\nProducts.\nThe Polara Ultimate Straight and Polara Ultimate Straight XS golf balls featuring \"self-correcting technology\" that reduces hooks and slices by up to 75%. David L. Felker, the CEO and Head of Technology of Aero-X Golf, co-invented the Polara Ultimate Straight golf balls with Douglas C. Winfield. The newer Polara Ultimate Straight golf ball was released in August 2010, and represents a large performance improvement over the original Polara golf ball, which was first sold in 1977. The ball has shallow truncated dimples around its equator and has deep spherical and small spherical dimples on each of the ball's poles.\nIn January 2012, Polara added two additional products to its line of self-correcting golf balls: Polara XD and Polara XDS. \"XD\" stands for \"Extra Distance\" and \"XDS\" stands for \"Extra Distance and Spin\". The \"Ultimate Straight\" Polara golf balls are designed for the golfer whose primary need is slice or hook correction. The \"XD\" and \"XDS\" correct only 50%, as opposed to 75% correction for the \"Ultimate Straight\", but have a slightly higher trajectory, which for many golfers will provide additional distance."

        "text": "This is a list of rivalries in the National Rugby League.\nTraditional NSW Rivalries.\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs vs Parramatta Eels.\nThe rivalry between Canterbury and Parramatta is one of the fiercest in The NRL. The two clubs have been geographically close throughout their whole histories. In the 1980s, Canterbury and Parramatta both won four premierships each and played against each other in two grand finals (1984,1986). In the 1990s at the height of the super league war, Parramatta signed four of Canterbury's star players Jarrod Mccracken, Dean Pay, Jim Dymock and Jason Smith which helped Parramatta reach the finals for the first time in eleven years. In the 1998 preliminary final, Parramatta were winning against Canterbury 18–2 with less than 10 minutes to play when Canterbury staged one of the biggest finals comebacks defeating Parramatta 32–20 in extra time. In 2009, Parramatta defeated Canterbury in the preliminary final to cap off a remarkable run to the grand final. The crowd which attended the match was a non grand final record of 74,000 fans. Speaking of the rivalry in 2015, former Canterbury player James Graham said \"As soon as I came to this club, I was told that they were the closest club to us and that there was no love lost between players and fans\". Andrew Ryan who played for both clubs said \"Both clubs do speak about the rivalry, in the change room and leading into the clashes, they always want to get the wood on their rival, I went for Canterbury when I was a kid, but then got my first opportunity in first grade to play for Parramatta. They place a huge amount of emphasis on the game. I think I was one of the only players to go the other way, a lot of players who had played for the Bulldogs played for Parramatta, not too many went the other way\".\nNorth Sydney Bears vs Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nPrior to the ill-fated Northern Eagles joint venture from 2000 to 2002, the rivalry between Manly and foundation club Norths was arguably one of rugby league's fiercest. Manly were admitted into the premiership in 1947 with North Sydney at the time being one of the main advocators for a team to be in Manly. In Manly's first season, most of the side was made up of former Norths players including captain Max Whitehead who played for Norths in their 1943 grand final defeat to Newtown. The intense feelings between the two sides continued over the next couple of decades fuelled as players switched between the two clubs. The biggest defection occurred in 1971 when Norths life member and one of the game's greatest wingers Ken Irvine joined Manly. Former Manly and North Sydney player Phil Blake said of the rivalry \"It was certainly a game you looked forward playing in. The ground was always packed and it was always a great afternoon\". In 2016, Norths and Manly played their final competitive senior game against each other in the Intrust Super Premiership NSW competition where Norths won the match 32–18. Manly had announced earlier in the 2016 season that they would be merging their lower grade sides with the Blacktown Workers teams to become the Blacktown Workers Sea Eagles. The only competitive games played between the two rivals as of 2017 are between the Norths and Manly Harold Matthews Cup, SG Ball and Jersey Flegg competitions.\nSydney Roosters vs St. George Illawarra Dragons.\nThese two clubs traditionally play each other in the ANZAC Day clash.\nThe first time the two club's met in a finals match stretches back to 1927 when St. George defeated Eastern Suburbs 26–11 at Earl Park, Arncliffe. In the 1930 season, both teams played against each other in the semi-final with St. George running out winners 11–10. In 1933, St. George defeated Easts for the third time in a row during a finals game. In 1940, Eastern Suburbs finally managed to beat St. George in a finals game winning 10-3 where they progressed to the grand final and defeated Canterbury-Bankstown.\nThe following year, St. George won their first premiership defeating Easts 31–14 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It wasn't until the 1953 season when the two clubs met again with St. George defeating Easts in the semi-final. In 1960, Eastern Suburbs reached their first grand final since 1945 where they faced St. George but were beaten 31–6.\nIn 1975, Eastern Suburbs defeated St. George 38–0 in the grand final which until the 2008 NRL season was the biggest winning margin in a grand final. In the 1996 ARL season, the two club's met in the semi-final with St. George winning 36–16 at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nAfter St. George formed a joint venture with the Illawarra Steelers in 1999 to form St. George Illawarra the two club's have met each other twice in finals matches, the first coming in 1999 which St. George won and in the 2010 NRL Grand Final where St. George won their first premiership as a joint venture defeating the Sydney Roosters 32–8 at ANZ Stadium.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs vs St. George Illawarra Dragons.\nSouth Sydney and St. George have met in several Grand Finals many times throughout their history, and share the same geographical area that is Sydney's inner-southern suburbs. The first time the two club's met was in the 1927 NSWRL Grand Final which Souths won 20–11 at the Sydney Agricultural Ground. In 1949, St. George would win their second premiership defeating Souths 19–12 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Souths would then gain revenge by defeating St. George in the 1953 final. In 1965, St. George won their tenth premiership in a row defeating Souths 12–8 in front of a packed Sydney Cricket Ground, with crowd estimates as high as 200,000 (the official attendance was 78,056). The last time the two club's have met in a grand final was in 1971 when Souths won their 20th premiership defeating Saints 16–10. This would be Souths last premiership until winning the 2014 NRL Grand Final.\nThe Charity Shield was contested between these two clubs throughout the 1980s and 1990s; in 2002 it was revived after Souths were readmitted into the competition. In 2001, South Sydney chairman and club legend George Piggins said there would be no chance of the Charity Shield being revived if Souths were to be included back into the NRL saying \"The Dragons: They sold us out\". This was in reference to St. George signing an affidavit which included that it would be detrimental if Souths were returned to the competition.\nThe match is always played as a pre-season fixture. In 2018, both sides met for the first time in a finals match since 1984. After 80 tense minutes of absorbing action, Souths won a close semi final 13–12 in front of over 48,000 at ANZ Stadium.\nSydney Roosters vs Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nThe Sydney Roosters have a long-standing rivalry with fellow Sydney team, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Whilst both teams had crossed premiership paths in Grand Finals on five occasions.\nIn 1938, Canterbury-Bankstown won their first premiership against Eastern Suburbs as what they were known as back then winning 19–6 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Two years later in 1940, the sides met again with Easts winning the 1940 grand final 24–14. \nIn 1974 Eastern Suburbs broke a 30 plus year drought defeating Canterbury-Bankstown 19–4.\nIn 1980, Canterbury-Bankstown broke a 38-year premiership drought defeating Eastern Suburbs 18–4 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nIn 2002, the Sydney Roosters won the 2002 NRL Premiership on the back of a 9-game winning streak. This was the same year the premiership favourite Bulldogs were stripped of 37 points due to systematic breaches of the salary cap in the 2001 and the 2002 seasons. In 2003, the Roosters proved themselves worthy of their Defending Premiers title when they defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final 28–18 in front of a sold out Aussie Stadium.\nIn 2004, the Roosters defeated Canterbury 35-0 and fighting broke out in the stands during and after the game had been completed. While the Roosters finished the regular season with the Minor Premiership, Canterbury defeated them in the Grand Final 16-13 after trailing 13–6 at half-time.\nAs of the 2022 NRL season, the last time the two clubs met in a finals game was the 2015 elimination final which the Sydney Roosters won 38–12 at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons vs Parramatta Eels.\nThe rivalry between St. George and Parramatta stretches back to 1977 when St. George and Parramatta played out the first ever drawn Grand Final result. Parramatta, seeking their first ever premiership after having finished on top of the ladder at the end of the regular season, were beaten 22–0 in the replay by the Dragons, which won its first premiership since 1966.\nThere have recently been some controversial matches between the Dragons and the Eels. Firstly, in Round 18, 2005, the Eels won 40–14 in a match which saw Trent Barrett and PJ Marsh trade blows after Marsh's crude charge-down attempt at Barrett, sparking an all-in brawl whilst the Eels' Wade McKinnon sprinted to score a match-turning 80-metre try.\nA less-memorable match saw no points scored between the two teams in Round 13, 2006 in the first 70 minutes of play before the Eels slotted a field goal with nine minutes remaining, before the Dragons struck back with two one-pointers to take a 2–1 lead. The Dragons then scored a try through Matt Cooper with mere seconds remaining on the clock to claim an 8–1 victory.\nIn the 2009 finals series, St George finished as minor premiers and faced a Parramatta side who finished eighth on the ladder. A week earlier at the same venue St George had defeated Parramatta 37-0 but in the finals game, Parramatta won 25–12 with Parramatta player Jarryd Hayne scoring a brilliant solo try. As of the 2022 NRL season, this is the last time the two sides have played against each other in the finals.\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles vs Parramatta Eels.\nManly and Parramatta have built a fierce rivalry since the 1970s. They met in the 1976 Grand Final in which Manly denied the Parramatta club a maiden premiership. However, the Eels won both the 1982 and 1983 Grand Finals against Manly.\nSince the 1983 grand final, Parramatta and Manly have only played against each other in one other finals game which was in 2005 when Parramatta finished as minor premiers and Manly finished in eighth place. Parramatta won the match 46–22.\nOn 18 May 2003, Parramatta and Manly played in the first ever golden point match in NRL history. Manly would win the match 36–34 at Brookvale Oval courtesy of a Ben Walker penalty goal.\nIn round 2 of the 2018 NRL season, Parramatta suffered their worst ever loss to Manly. The game was played in temperatures of nearly 40 degrees where Manly ran out 54-0 winners.\nIn the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta beat Manly in round 25 to take Manly's fifth spot on the ladder and would go on to beat Brisbane 58–0 in the elimination final. The victory is currently the biggest win in finals history.\nIn round 11 of the 2022 NRL season, Manly lead Parramatta by ten points in the second half before Parramatta scored two tries to make it 20-20. Parramatta player Mitchell Moses then converted a goal from the side line to win the match 22–20.\nIn round 21 of the 2022 NRL season, the two sides met at Brookvale Oval where Manly needed to defeat Parramatta if they were to stand any chance of reaching the finals. Parramatta would win the game 36–20 with the maligned Jakob Arthur providing two try assists for Parramatta which ended Manly's finals hopes.\nSince the 2000s, the rivalry has seen numerous player swaps or players who have featured for both clubs which in the early days was a rare occurrence of the fixture. Such players who have been at both clubs since 2000 include Jamie Lyon, Daniel Heckenberg, Shayne Dunley, Kylie Leuluai, Michael Witt, Aaron Cannings, Jack Afamasaga, Feleti Mateo, Richard Faʻaoso, Blake Green, Joe Galuvao, Tony Williams, Jeff Robson, Jonathan Wright, Justin Horo, Chris Hicks, Cheyse Blair, Darcy Lussick, Kelepi Tanginoa, Brayden Wiliame, Daniel Harrison, William Hopoate, David Gower, Anthony Watmough, Clinton Gutherson, Kieran Foran, Siosaia Vave, Shaun Lane, Andrew Davey, Joey Lussick, Michael Oldfield and Jake Arthur.\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles vs Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nThis rivalry has been dubbed the \"Battle of the Beaches\", and they met in a brutal Grand Final in 1973 which was described as the dirtiest and toughest Grand Final of them all. The rivalry between the two sides has been described as one of the most one sided in the competition with Manly having won 67 matches as opposed to Cronulla's 25 matches. Manly defeated Cronulla 16–0 in the 1978 Grand Final replay after the original contest had ended in an 11–11 draw.\nIn 1996, Manly and Cronulla played each other in the 1996 preliminary final where Manly defeated Cronulla 24–0. In the 2013 finals series, the two clubs met at the Sydney Football Stadium with Manly running out 24-18 winners. In week one of the 2019 finals series, Manly defeated Cronulla to win the game 28–16 at Brookvale Oval and eliminate Cronulla from the finals race.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs vs Sydney Roosters.\nThe rivalry between the Sydney Roosters and the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league teams is regarded as the fiercest in the NRL and the oldest continuing rivalry with both clubs founded in 1908 and both sides still competing as stand alone entities in the NRL. The rivalry increased after 1950 due to conflict between junior territories, and escalated once more in the 1990s with the increased financial success of the Roosters eclipsing the decreasing funds of the Rabbitohs. In 2005, South Sydney broke a ten-year, thirteen-game losing streak to the Roosters in a close 17–16 match. In the final round of 2013 the Roosters defeated Souths to claim the Minor Premiership, a feat they repeated the following year.\nIn 2014, Souths defeated the Sydney Roosters in the preliminary final to reach their first grand final in 43 years. The rivalry has also seen a number of player swaps over the years most notably with Ron Coote, Elwyn Walters, Craig Wing, Bryan Fletcher, Chris Walker, Shannon Hegarty, Ashley Harrison, Luke Keary, Angus Crichton, Daniel Suluka-Fifita and Latrell Mitchell.\nIn 2018, the Sydney Roosters defeated Souths 12–4 in the preliminary final at Allianz Stadium which was the last game to be played at the venue. The crowd of 44,380 was also a ground record.\nIn 2019, the two clubs met in the qualifying final which was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. South Sydney had beaten the Sydney Roosters only a week prior in the final game of the regular season but in the qualifying final, the Roosters won the match 30–6 in a dominant display.\nIn 2020 the Sydney Roosters managed to record a victory over South Sydney 28–12 in round 3. In the final round of the 2020 NRL season, Souths defeated the Sydney Roosters 60–8. This was the biggest win South Sydney had ever recorded over their rivals eclipsing the previous score set in 1952 when Souths defeated Eastern Suburbs 52–0.\nBefore round 25 of the 2022 NRL season where the two sides were to meet, Sydney Roosters CEO Nick Politis issued a warning to South Sydney stating that the new Sydney Football Stadium has always been the home ground and territory of the Eastern Suburbs club and not South Sydney. Souths had declared they wanted to leave Stadium Australia and make the new Sydney Football Stadium as their home ground. Politis said to Fox Sports “I’ve heard other people say they want to play there because it’s their home, The point is we’ve been there since 1928. We started with the old sports ground and then 30 years with the old Allianz Stadium, Nobody else has played there. For another club to say we want to go there because it’s our home, it’s not their home. The Roosters are the only people that belong there. It’s our true home and it’s very sacred\".\nDespite Politis claims, the South Sydney club had used the Sydney Sports Ground as a home ground before Eastern Suburbs and the two clubs often ground shared for the first 30 years of its existence at the venue.\nIn the 2022 elimination final, seven players were sin binned which was the most in an NRL era game as South Sydney upset the Sydney Roosters 30-14 ending their season.\nIn the last round of the 2023 NRL season, the Sydney Roosters defeated South Sydney 26–12 to end their season and deny them a finals spot. Before the match started both sides knew whoever lost the game would miss out on the finals.\nIn round 3 of the 2024 NRL season, the Sydney Roosters recorded their second biggest win over South Sydney since 1908 beating them 48-6.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons vs Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nA rivalry exists between the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, which share the same geographic region. Cronulla were viewed as St George's \"little brother\" from 1967 to 1998. The St. George Dragons and now the St. George Illawarra Dragons have enjoyed more success than Cronulla, who remained premiership-less since their inception in 1967 until 2016 when they won 14–12 against the Melbourne Storm, while St. George managed to win their first title as a joint venture after eleven years in the competition, with the original St. George winning fifteen titles.\nIn fact, since the joint venture entered the competition in 1999, both clubs have finished higher than another six times apiece. On ANZAC Day 1999, Cronulla CEO Peter Gow famously cut up a St. George jersey with a pair of scissors in front of onlookers at Cronulla's leagues club and assaulted former St. George player Barry Beath who had become involved in the situation. Gow was later sacked by Cronulla for defacing the jersey and for assaulting a club patron. \nCronulla finished the 1999 season as minor premiers, but St George beat them 24–8 in the preliminary final to progress to the 1999 NRL Grand Final at Cronulla's expense. The Dragons trailed 8–0 at halftime. In the 2002 finals series, both teams met in the semi-final which Cronulla won 40–24 at the Sydney Football Stadium. The rivalry increased further in 2005 when they met in a qualifying final at a sold out WIN Stadium with the Dragons winning 28–22. As of the 2022 NRL season, this is the last time the two club's have played each other in a finals game.\nIn round 18 of the 2023 NRL season, Cronulla recorded their biggest ever victory over either St. George or St. George Illawarra defeating the latter 52-16.\nParramatta Eels vs Penrith Panthers.\nParramatta entered the NSWRL now NRL competition in 1947, meanwhile Penrith entered 20 years later in 1967. Parramatta are the closest NRL team to Penrith geographically. The match between the two is known as the \"Western Sydney derby\" or \"The Battle of the West\". Aside from local 'bragging rights' the rivalry is also partly founded in bitterness associated with the former status of the Penrith district as part of the Parramatta rugby league district. The relationship between local Penrith clubs and the Parramatta District was often problematic; players and officials in the Penrith area considered themselves ignored and neglected by the Parramatta club during the 1950s and 1960s. Parramatta beat Penrith in two finals games in 1985 winning 38-6 and in 2000 when Parramatta won again 28–10. In 2021, Penrith beat Parramatta in a tight and bruising affair 8–6 on their way to winning the 2021 Grand Final.\nIn round 9 of the 2022 NRL season, Parramatta defeated Penrith 22–20 at Penrith Stadium. This ended Penrith's eight match winning streak to start the season and it was also the first time Penrith had lost at the ground since the 2019 NRL season.\nIn round 20 of the same season, Parramatta defeated Penrith 34–10. Parramatta were the only team in the 2022 NRL season to beat Penrith twice. In the 2022 finals series, Penrith defeated Parramatta 27–8 in the qualifying final. The two clubs would then meet in the 2022 NRL Grand Final with Penrith securing back to back premierships defeating Parramatta 28–12. Following the grand final, some of the Penrith players mocked the Parramatta club in public and on social media with James Fisher-Harris saying that Parramatta were now Penrith's sons followed by the player inviting Penrith supporters to chant \"We hate Parra\" and Jarome Luai posting on social media \"Daddy loves you\" which was in reference to Luai saying before the grand final that Penrith were now Parramatta's \"Daddy\".\nIn round 4 of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta met Penrith in the grand final rematch. Parramatta went into the game having started the season winless. Parramatta lead the match 16-8 with less than seven minutes to play but Penrith managed to level the game at 16-16 after Nathan Cleary kicked a 40 metre field goal with seconds remaining. In golden point extra-time, Mitchell Moses kicked a field goal to win the game for Parramatta 17-16.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons vs Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nSt George Illawarra has a fierce rivalry with neighbour the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Canterbury-Bankstown were founded in 1935, 14 years after St George. St. George inflicted a premiership record 91–6 defeat of Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first in 1938, and St George in 1941. In the 1942 NSWRFL season, the two clubs met in the 1942 grand final with Canterbury-Bankstown defeating St. George 11–9 in a low-scoring affair at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After that however, St. George recorded 11 straight premierships in the years following (1955–1966). It was also Canterbury who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when they beat them by a point in the preliminary final to face South Sydney in the Grand Final. Since then, both clubs inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, St George defeating Canterbury in their last Grand Final success in 1979, Canterbury returning the favour in 1985.\nThe two teams subsequently met in the 1993 preliminary final which St. George won 27–12. They would meet again in the 1995 and 1998 finals series with Canterbury running out winners on both occasions. The elimination final in 1998 was also St. George's final game as a stand-alone entity as the club elected to form a joint venture with Illawarra for the 1999 NRL season.\nCanterbury superstar Sonny Bill Williams walked out on the club just prior to a match against the St. George. The match also marked the first-grade debut of future Dally M Medallist Ben Barba.\nSince St. George formed a joint venture with Illawarra, the two clubs have met each other in the 2001 finals series which St. George Illawarra defeated Canterbury 23-22 and in the 2015 finals series which Canterbury won 11–10 at ANZ Stadium. In the 2017 NRL season, St. George Illawarra needed to beat Canterbury in the final game of the regular season to qualify for the finals. Canterbury who were already out of contention for the finals defeated St. George 26-20 which allowed North Queensland to get the last finals spot and finish eighth. North Queensland would then go on to reach the 2017 NRL Grand Final as a result.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs vs Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nSouths and Canterbury-Bankstown have played each other every Good Friday since 2012. They met in the 1967 NSWRFL Grand Final with South Sydney winning 12–10. However, their rivalry intensified when they met in the 2014 NRL Grand Final where Souths won 30–6 to claim their first premiership since 1971. During their Good Friday clash in 2015, this game was labelled for its controversy, as South Sydney won 18-17 thanks to a late penalty goal. Canterbury fans were angry about the match officials decision and attacked the match officials when they walked off the field, throwing bottles at them, even causing one of them to slip over. Some fans were given lifetime bans for throwing bottles at the match officials.\nIn round 4 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were defeated 38-0 by South Sydney in the traditional Good Friday game. Canterbury became only the second team in the NRL era to lose three straight games without scoring a point after Cronulla who achieved this in the 2014 NRL season.\nIt was also the worst start to a season by any team since Glebe in the 1928 NSWRFL season who managed to only score 12 points in their first four matches.\nIn round 6 of the 2023 NRL season, South Sydney recorded the most amount of points scored by a winning team in the Good Friday game as they defeated Canterbury 50-16. As of the 2024 NRL season, the two clubs have only met each other in the finals four times.\nDespite the game being considered a rivalry by some supporters, Canterbury were one of the only teams after Souths were expelled from the league who were in favour of the club being readmitted to the NRL.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs vs Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.\nThe competitive rivalry between South Sydney and Manly Warringah is very historic and continues to this day. South Sydney and Manly-Warringah first met in the 1951 NSWRFL season's Grand Final. South Sydney would win the match 42-14 which as of 2022 is the highest scoring grand final in NSWRL/NRL history. The clubs would then meet again in the 1968 and 1970 grand finals which South Sydney both won.\nIn the 2013 preliminary final, Souths were looking to reach their first grand final since 1971 when they faced off against Manly. Souths lead the match 14-0 early on but were eventually defeated by Manly 30–20.\nIn the 2020 NRL season, South Sydney recorded a 56-16 victory over Manly which was their biggest loss against any team since 2005.\nIn the 2021 NRL season, South Sydney and Manly once again met in the preliminary final but on this occasion South Sydney ran out comfortable winners to reach the 2021 NRL Grand Final.\nIn round 4 of the 2023 NRL season, South Sydney defeated Manly 13-12 in golden point extra-time courtesy of a field goal by Lachlan Ilias.\nManly have, since 1970, purchased many of Souths' star players including John O'Neill, Ray Branighan, Ian Roberts, and more recently Dylan Walker.\nQueensland Rivalries.\nBrisbane Broncos vs North Queensland Cowboys.\nBetween 1999 and 2006 inclusive, these two clubs were the only clubs from Queensland playing in the National Rugby League. In the early days, Brisbane would always beat North Queensland either in Brisbane or Townsville where North Queensland are based. North Queensland would not record their first victory until the 2004 NRL season where they defeated Brisbane 10-0 in the semi-final at Dairy Farmers Stadium.\nIn the 2012 NRL season, the two sides met in the elimination final which North Queensland won 33-16.\nNorth Queensland and Brisbane would meet in another elimination final during the 2014 NRL season which North Queensland won 32-20.\nThey met in the 2015 NRL Grand Final on 4 October at ANZ Stadium. This game is often regarded as one of the best grand finals ever with Jonathan Thurston kicking a field goal in golden point to win North Queensland's first ever premiership. Following the 2015 final, the two clubs played four matches in succession where the game was decided by six points or less.\nIn the final round of the 2020 NRL season, Brisbane who were running last had the opportunity to avoid their first ever wooden spoon if they could defeat North Queensland who were sitting in 14th position. North Queensland would go on to defeat Brisbane 32–16 at Suncorp Stadium and condemn Brisbane to the wooden spoon.\nBrisbane Broncos vs Gold Coast Titans.\nThe South East Queensland derby started in 2007 with the admission of the Gold Coast into the NRL. That year in Round 17, Darren Lockyer kicked a monumental field goal that hit both uprights and gave the Broncos a 19-18 victory in front of over 40,000 spectators at Suncorp Stadium.\nThe two clubs also met in the 2010 Finals with the Brisbane side winning 40-32 in the week one match-up on the Titans' turf at Skilled Park in front of a sellout crowd. The next finals meeting between the clubs came in 2016, with Brisbane again winning, this time 44-28. The match saw a contentious penalty try awarded to Broncos winger Jordan Kahu, where the ball was kicked from his hands.\nIn 2018, the lowly Gold Coast side beat Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium 26-14 on Easter Sunday, which was regarded as a major upset at the time. In round 12 of the 2022 NRL season, Brisbane came from 24-4 down at half-time to defeat the Gold Coast 35-24.\nBrisbane have a superior record in the fixture having won 23 of the 33 meetings.\nBrisbane Broncos vs Dolphins.\nThe Battle of Brisbane is a new rivalry which began with the Dolphins' admission as the second Brisbane club in 2023. This marked the first time that Brisbane has had two professional rugby league teams since the demise of the South Queensland Crushers in 1997. In round 4 of the 2023 NRL season, the two sides played against each other for the first time. In a match which saw both sides take the lead, Brisbane would go on to win 18-12 in front of 51,047 fans. This was the biggest crowd at Suncorp Stadium for a regular season game in its history.\nInterstate Rivalries.\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles vs Melbourne Storm.\nThis is regarded as one of the biggest rivalries in the modern era, and the two clubs met in the 2007 and 2008 Grand Finals.\nAfter Manly had gone on to win the 2011 premiership, both teams fought out the 2012 preliminary final in Melbourne. Melbourne defeated Manly 40–12, ending their chances of winning back to back titles. Melbourne would go on to win their second legitimate premiership after being stripped of their 2007 and 2009 premierships after the NRL discovered systematic salary cap rorting by the club.\nAfter nine years without playing each other in the finals, Manly and Melbourne met in week one of the 2021 NRL finals series where Melbourne won the match 40–12 at the Sunshine Coast Stadium.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks vs Melbourne Storm.\nA fairly recent rivalry that reached its height in the 2016 NRL Grand Final which was won by Cronulla.\nRound 2 of the 2008 NRL season saw the sides meet at Olympic Park in Melbourne, and Cronulla was able to reverse the result by the same scoreline via a Brett Kimmorley field goal. The match was marred by an ugly brawl which saw Cronulla's Ben Ross and Melbourne's Brett White sent from the field. It was the only loss Melbourne suffered at home during the 2008 regular season.\nThe two sides met again in the preliminary final where Melbourne, despite missing captain Cameron Smith to suspension, defeated Cronulla 28–0 to advance to the grand final against Manly-Warringah.\nMelbourne began the 2012 NRL season with nine straight victories, before a Paul Gallen-less Sharks pipped them 12-10 thanks to a Jeremy Smith try and clutch conversion from Todd Carney. It looked like Cronulla would land two wins over Melbourne that year, leading 18–10 with 90 seconds to go in the second game between the sides.\nMelbourne somehow scored twice to win 20–18. The competitive rivalry between the two sides officially began in late 2015 when Melbourne beat Cronulla 30–2 in spiteful circumstances. Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan accused Melbourne of slowing down the game with their wrestling tackle technique. The loss meant that Melbourne leap-frogged Cronulla into fourth place heading into the finals. Again Cronulla-Sutherland handed Melbourne their first loss of the 2016 NRL season, winning the round 4 clash 14–6. It was the first match in Cronulla's record-breaking 15 matches winning streak.\nThe two sides would meet in the final round of the regular season with the winner taking out the minor premiership. Melbourne won 26-6 and took out the JJ Giltinan Shield. However, Cronulla-Sutherland would win the biggest game ever between the two sides 4 weeks later, winning the 2016 grand final by 14–12 in a thriller.\nThe two teams traded close wins in 2017, with Cronulla winning 11–2 at AAMI Park before Melbourne returned serve with an 18–13 victory at Southern Cross Group Stadium. 2018 saw Cronulla win both encounters with Melbourne during the regular season, yet despite this, lost to them in the preliminary final 22 to 6.\nThe match featured a controversial moment when Melbourne player Billy Slater made an illegal tackle on Cronulla winger Sosaia Feki while he was in the act of scoring, therefore constituting a professional foul. Slater managed to avoid the Sin Bin despite being penalized for the action, as well as avoiding suspension, with the NRL judiciary controversially ruling that the tackle did not constitute a shoulder charge. Their round 4 clash in 2018 saw a record 33 penalties blown, and Cameron Smith was sin-binned for the first time in his career.\nIn the 2021 NRL season, former Melbourne player Will Chambers signed a contract to join Cronulla-Sutherland which closed the chapter of the two sides competitive rivalry. Chambers had previously labelled Cronulla captain Paul Gallen and other Cronulla players as \"Drug Cheats\" during a 2017 game between the two sides.\nBrisbane Broncos vs Melbourne Storm.\nMelbourne and Brisbane first played each other in a finals series game during Melbourne's first season in the competition in 1998. Brisbane won the match 30–6 at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nThese two sides then played each other in the finals from 2004 until 2009, with one of them being the 2006 NRL Grand Final. Five of those six finals were won by Melbourne, however, the most important meeting in the finals between the two sides was in 2006 when Brisbane were able to get their sixth, and so far most recent premiership with a scoreline of 15–8.\nMelbourne got their revenge on the Broncos on three later occasions in the finals, firstly in the 2007 Qualifying Finals where they won 40–0, in 2009 they won 40–10 in the Preliminary Finals, in which they qualified for their fourth consecutive grand final appearance, but most notably their last-minute 16–14 win in Brisbane, which was hailed as the match of the 2008 NRL Season.\nThey met again in the Preliminary Finals in 2017, with Melbourne easily defeating Brisbane 30–0. In round 27 of the 2023 NRL season, the two sides met in the final round of the regular campaign. Brisbane and Melbourne both rested several players as each team had qualified for the finals. Melbourne would go on to win the game 32-22 which denied Brisbane their first Minor Premiership since the 2000 NRL season.\nThe two sides would meet the following week in the 2023 qualifying final with Brisbane defeating Melbourne 26-0 to book a place in the preliminary final. It was the first time Brisbane had beaten Melbourne at Suncorp Stadium since 2009 and the first time that they had defeated Melbourne in 14 attempts.\nSince the 2006 Grand Final, Melbourne have had the wood over Brisbane, Brisbane have only beaten them 5 times since then.\nSydney Roosters vs Melbourne Storm.\nThis competitive rivalry began in the 2017 NRL season when the two clubs met in round 16 at the Adelaide Oval. The Sydney Roosters won a very tight game in Golden Point 25-24 then only seven weeks later, Melbourne won the return game 16–13 at AAMI Park. In this game, the Sydney Roosters were leading 13-12 after 73 minutes after kicking a field goal before Joe Stimson scored a late try to seal the win just before full time. The competitive nature with the Sydney Roosters increased in the off season when long time player Cooper Cronk announced that he was moving to Sydney and joining the club for 2018.\nIn the 2018 premiership season, the two clubs only played one game, again at the Adelaide Oval. It was another tight game which this time Melbourne won 9–8 with Cameron Smith kicking a late field goal to claim victory. The two clubs remained neck and neck at the top of the table with the Sydney Roosters pipping Melbourne for the minor premiership on points difference. The two clubs did not meet until the 2018 NRL Grand Final with the Sydney Roosters winning 21–6. In the game, Cooper Cronk playing injured, assumed a virtual on-field player-coach role, using his years of Grand Final experience to help the Roosters defeat the Melbourne side.\nIn 2019, the teams played twice during the season and both games were close. On Good Friday, the Sydney Roosters defeated Melbourne 21–20 in Golden point overtime before the teams met once again in Adelaide, with Melbourne prevailing 14–12. The third clash of the year was the preliminary final, which the Sydney Roosters won 14–6 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nWith the 2020 NRL season disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Melbourne's Round 8 \"home\" game against the Roosters was transferred to Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. In a game that produced one of the more extraordinary finishes to an NRL game, the Sydney Roosters were leading 22–12 with 12 minutes left when Melbourne then scored two tries to take a 24–22 lead. The game was then tied up by a penalty goal to the Roosters before they also scored a 78th minute field goal to lead 25–24. With seconds remaining, Melbourne's Ryan Papenhuyzen scored a field goal of his own to tie scores up again at 25 all and send the game into Golden Point. Melbourne won the game with Cameron Smith kicking a penalty goal.\nIn round 24 of the 2022 NRL season these two teams played out a thrilling yet very physical game which saw the Sydney Roosters win 18–14. The Sydney Roosters had an early 14–0 lead but had to withstand a late Melbourne comeback to win the game which included an amazing try saver which won the Roosters the game. This game didn't come without controversy though as there were multiple stoppages in play as the players went toe to toe with each other, including when Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Nelson Asofa-Solomona had a fight which saw Hargreaves sent to the sin bin.\nThe two sides would meet in the second week of the 2023 NRL finals series. Melbourne were heavy favourites going into the game but with only minutes remaining the Sydney Roosters were in front 13-12. This was until with three minutes remaining Melbourne scored a try through William Warbrick to win the match 18-13. The match wasn't without controversy due to Melbourne scoring a try in the first half which came directly after Harry Grant had knocked the ball on from a cross-field kick."

        "text": "The beginning of women's badminton in Australia dates back to the year 1900, when for the first time badminton was played in Australia.\nHistory.\nThe first regional badminton championships were held in 1932 in Victoria followed by the first national championships in 1935.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds. The purpose was to increase women's interest in sport by providing them opportunities to play. Sports that were included on the programme included cricket, field hockey, women's basketball, bowls, rowing, swimming, athletics, rifle shooting, baseball, golf, tennis and badminton. There were over 1,000 bowlers involved over the course a week. Cricket featured a match versus a visiting English side. Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The ninth most popular sport that these women participated in was croquet, with 3 having played the sport. The sport was tied with billiards, chess, fishing, field hockey, horse racing, squash, table tennis and shooting.\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. The women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the period of the war. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\nTournaments.\nThere are organized many national badminton tournaments for all age groups in Australia. Most of the tournaments are open for male and for female contestants together. Team, singles, doubles and mixed doubles tournaments are held, where singles, doubles and mixed doubles events are in the most cases held together during one and the same tournament. The most important national tournaments are the Australian national championships, the Clendinnen Shield, the H. B. Wray Trophy, the C. Maddern Trophy, the Melbourne Silver Bowl and Australian ranking tournaments. Australian championships were open for international contestants until the end of the 1990s. In the meantime the Australian championships were divided into an international one (Australia Open championships or Australia International) and a national one (Australia closed championships).\nOn the international level, Australia organizes the already mentioned Australia Open championships and alternating with New Zealand the team competition for the Whyte Trophy. The Australian teams and players participate in all major tournaments of the BWF. In single and doubles tournaments, the players participate for instance in the World championships, Oceania championships, Commonwealth games and the BWF Super Series. The mixed national team competes in the Sudirman Cup, the women's team in the Uber Cup. Australia did not participate in the first women's world team championship in 1957. In the second championship Australia lost in the final of the preliminary round to New Zealand."

        "text": "History.\nWhile not being urged to avoid competition, women had few opportunities to compete in sport in Australia until the 1880s. After that date, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. Boxing classes were being offered to women in Australia by 1892, at locations such as the Brisbane Gymnasium on Turbot Street, close to the city's railway station. While classes may have been offered for women, serious training was not permitted for women by the 1900s and women were banned from pursuing the sport in a competitive way. Women were also barred from attending boxing matches. New South Wales banned women's boxing from 1986 to 2009. Women's boxing was resumed in NSW with an exhibition fight between Kaye Scott and Ramona Stephenson in October 2009. Women's boxing was legalized in Queensland in 2000.\nCulture.\nFemale boxers in Australia have historically faced problems with acceptance of their involvement in the sport. In many places, they have been unable to find places to train and faced difficulties with the law prohibiting them from competing. In 2005, a PhD student in Australia was doing research on the history of women's boxing in the country.\nCompetitions.\nIn 2002, Desi Kontos of South Australia became the first Australian woman to represent the country at the boxing world championships.\nIn 2008, several national championships happened in Australia for women. These events were held in July in Melbourne and included the Australian Under 17 Women's Championships, Australian Senior Women's Championships and the Australian Women's Championships Medal Winners. In 2008, the women's national championships were unable to be held alongside the men's because women's boxing was illegal in New South Wales.\nThe Australian 2010 Women's World Championships 75 kg Selection Trial were held from 3–4 July in Canberra.\nThe Australian World Elite and Junior Teams Selection Trials were held from 27 to 29 March in 2009 in Port Adelaide.\nNaomi Fischer-Rasmussen was the first female boxer to represent Australia at the Olympics when she competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics."

After that date, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created.\nEarly history.\nOrganised cricket has been played by women in Australia since no later than 1874 when the first recorded match took place in Bendigo. The founding mother of women's cricket in Australia was the young Tasmanian, Lily Poulett-Harris, who captained the Oyster Cove team in the league she created in 1894. Lily's obituary, from her death a few years later in 1897, states that her team was almost certainly the first to be formed in the colonies .\nDuring the 1890s, cricket and rowing were two of the most popular competitive sports for women in Australia. Another of the first all women's sport clubs founded in Australia was the Rockhampton Ladies' Club. They were fielding a women's cricket team in the mid-1890s. The team wore dresses with long skirts and long sleeves, sashes attached to their uniform, tight belts and straw boater hats.\nEarly Twentieth Century.\nOne location where cricket was being played was Bundaberg, where a ladies' town team had been established that was competing until as late as 1909. Cricket players, like other female athletes of this era, dressed in ankle length skirts, wore long sleeved blouses, and wore a hat and tie. The uniforms made it difficult to play as they did not allow a full range of movement. Another place where women played cricket on an all women's team was in Memerambi, a Queensland town that is to the southwest of Maryborough. In 1911, this team had several notable players including A. B. Postle who was the sister of the current world champion sprinter. By 1911, the skirts had changed to include fewer layers and allowed for greater movement of the legs. This improvement was offset by the need to wear wide brimmed hats.\nThe Victorian Ladies' Cricket Association was founded in 1905 and disbanded in 1916 during the Great War. The Victorian Women's Cricket Association was formed in 1923. The Australian Women's Cricket Council was formed in 1931.\nDuring the early part of the twentieth century, small towns in rural areas often lacked enough male players to have a full team. This problem was solved by allowing for mixed gendered teams. One town with a mixed gendered team was found in Croydon at the Croydon Villa Cricket Club. The lack of players was also a problem in the bush. Mixed gendered teams were created as part of informal games at locations such as the Cooroy Showgrounds. By the 1920s, women were playing cricket in outfits similar to men: Long white trousers, white sweaters and blouses. Batters had pads for their shins. The hats had smaller brims and were more fitted to their heads. This change in outfits allowed women a greater range of movement when they played the game. A female cricket team active during the 1920s was found in Toowoomba.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.\nIn 1933, the New South Wales Amateur Women's Sport Council was created by Gwendolen Game. The organisation brought together all the women's sporting bodies on the state level. Sports represented included New South Wales's women's field hockey, cricket, women's basketball, baseball, rowing and vigoro. A similar organisation covering similar sports had been created in Victoria in 1931.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds. The purpose was to increase women's interest in sport by providing them opportunities to play.

Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nIn 1986, Lyn Larsen, at the age of 22, became the youngest captain ever of the Australian women's national cricket team. In 1988, the Australian women won the Cricket World Cup.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The nineteenth most popular sport that these women participated in was cricket, with 2 having played the sport.

Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\nTwenty-First Century.\nThe current 50-over limited-over domestic tournament for Women in Australia is the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). The competition has been held since the 1996–97 season. The league currently consists of seven teams: New South Wales Breakers, Queensland Fire, South Australian Scorpions, Tasmanian Roar, Victorian Spirit, Western Fury and ACT Meteors.\nThe 2013-2014 Australian National Cricket Census showed that female participation in the sport was up 39% to 247,000, with females making up 22% of total cricket participants in Australia.\nA female Twenty20 league, the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), has been aligned with the Mens Big Bash League (BBL) since the 2015–2016 season. The eight women's teams are: Perth Scorchers (WBBL), Hobart Hurricanes (WBBL), Brisbane Heat (WBBL), Adelaide Strikers (WBBL), Melbourne Stars (WBBL), Melbourne Renegades (WBBL), Sydney Sixers (WBBL) and Sydney Thunder (WBBL). Each team uses the same team name and colours as those of its male counterpart.\nImportant current day ambassadors for women's cricket in Australia include Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning, Alex Blackwell and Alyssa Healy.\nThe Ashes.\nThe first ashes game, occurred in 1934. When the AWCC (Australian Women's Cricket Council) sent an invitation to the WCA (Women's Cricket Association), inviting England to tour in Australia. The tour consisted of 14, 3-day test matches, in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The first game being was played in Brisbane with a crowd of 1,500. England won the game by 9 wickets after a stunning performance from England's spinning allrounder Myrtle Maclagan who took 7 wickets for 10 runs.\nInternational Short-Form Competition.\nNot only do Australian women compete in cricket domestically, but also on the international stage. The Australian Women's Cricket Team (The Southern Stars) have competed at an international level in the short forms of the game since the first World Cup in 1973, in England. They won their first world cup in 1978 and then claiming the title on another five occasions in 1982, 1988, 1997, 2005 and 2013.\nSince their first match in the 1973 World Cup the Southern Stars have played 254 ODIs (One Day Internationals), having 122 women represent Australia in the ODI team.\nAnother short form of the game that the Stars are very competitive in is the Twenty20 competition. The Australian Women's Team have taken home the top trophy for the past three consecutive years at the Women's Twenty20 World Cup. And resulting from their efforts this the Southern Stars received a pay rise making them the highest paid women's sporting team in Australia."

        "text": "Women's cycling was controversial during the 1890s in Australia. The issue was discussed in several periodicals of the era including the \"Bulletin\". There was a question of whether women should be allowed to ride bicycles in the first place, an issue settled in 1895 of yes. There was a question of the appropriate clothing to wear while riding a bicycle, if women should be allowed to compete in bicycle races, the most appropriate style of bicycle riding for women, if bicycle riding was good for a woman's health, and if the sport was appropriate for women to participate because of the possibility of making women more manly. Bicycle shops, such as Massey-Harris Bicycles of Brisbane, Rockhampton and Charters Towers, were catering to female customers by 1896. Malvern Star was also featuring female cyclists on the cover of their cycling catalogs during the same period. During the 1890s, cycling's popularity increased because it served several purposes, including transportation and recreation. It made parts of Australia more accessible to women than they had previously been.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was considered \"medically appropriate\" for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the media gave very little attention to women who set endurance records. Instead the media chose to focus on male cyclists. During this period, Australian women were setting records. Edna Sayers tackled the Goulburn to Sydney course on the same day as the men, setting off half an hour prior to the male professionals, lowering the women's record to 7 hours 41 minutes and 5 seconds in 1933, and to 6 hours 11 minutes and 30 seconds in 1935. In 1937, Joyce Barry rode from Newcastle, New South Wales to Sydney, a distance of in six and a half hours. in September 1938 Barry established the women's seven-day day record of . Valda Unthank set several records in the same era, including a 1938 distance record for her ride from Adelaide, South Australia to Melbourne. Unthank broke Barry's seven-day record by riding .\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post-war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe. When international sport resumed in the post-war period, Australian women were at an advantage as a result."

One of the reasons women were encouraged to play croquet, tennis and golf during the late 1800s was because it was scene as beneficial to their health. These sports were also seen as passive, non-aggressive and non-threatening to the period's concepts of masculinity and femininity. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, women were allowed to be members of golf clubs but most women could not be because the game was too expensive to play. Women were also limited because of restrictions imposed upon them by the men who ran the clubs and courses. For example, at the Brisbane Golf Club in 1901, women were not allowed to become full members, only associate members, could not belong to any club committees and there were limited times when they could play. Women were allowed to play and did in places such as Willowburn, Queensland. Like other sports of the time, women wore long sleeved blouses and skirts that were ankle length. They also wore hats while they were playing.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held.

There were over 1,000 bowlers involved over the course a week. Cricket featured a match versus a visiting English side. Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done.

Their participation in the sport was hampered because of a lack of facilities and participation rates were not as high as other sports.\nHistory.\nWomen were involved in gambling on horse racing in Australia during the 1890s. They won some money by placing bets and in some cases were calling odds on races. Women frequently attended horse racing events as spectators in Queensland during the second half of the nineteenth century. By the late 1920s, there were efforts to ban horse racing in Australia because the sport was seen to have a corrupting influence on Australian women. In 1934, the first female owned horse was entered in the Melbourne Cup. Women were involved in horse racing around the country by the 1930s. They were among the attendees at a 1939 race in Yass, New South Wales.

After that date, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. During the 1890s, cricket and rowing two of the most popular competitive sports for women in Australia. A sculling race was held between two women from Victoria and New South Wales at the Albert Park Lake in Melbourne in 1901, during a regatta organised to celebrate a royal visit. The first recorded women's rowing club was the Albert Park Ladies' Rowing Club, formed in 1907 and based at Albert Park, with similar clubs formed in Brisbane in 1908 (the Brisbane LRC), Sydney in 1909 (the Western Suburbs LRC), and Tasmania in 1912 (the Buckingham LRC and the Sandy Bay LRC). During that time period, rowing was considered an acceptable sport for women to participate in, and was one of the first sports in which women were required to practise daily in order to excel at it. Interstate competition commenced in 1912, when the Brisbane club travelled to Melbourne to race the Albert Park crew. A return race was held the following year in Queensland, but no more interstate events were held until after the conclusion of World War I, when a Victorian crew lost to a South Australian crew in Adelaide. The Women's Four-Oared Championship of Australia was first contested in 1920, in conjunction with the men's King's Cup, and was won by South Australia, who were to win seven of the first eight tournaments.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held.

The national championship was for four women boats, Also in 1920, the first national women's rowing sporting body was created. It was called the Australian Women's Rowing Council. The rules of rowing changed, and starting in 1934, the national championship also had a competition for eight women boats. In 1939, the national championships were canceled. This was being the men's only Victorian Rowing Council prevented the competition from happening by citing an obscure rule in their organisational rulebook that forbid men and women from rowing together on the same programme.\nIn 1933, the New South Wales Amateur Women's Sport Council was created by Gwendolen Game. The organisation brought together all the women's sporting bodies on the state level. Sports represented included New South Wales's women's field hockey, cricket, women's basketball, baseball, rowing and vigoro.

After that date, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. For swimming, the rapid expansion of facilities took place during the 1880s and the 1890s. Compared to the past when the whole of the swimming community was made up of males, currently 55 percent of the Australian swimming membership is made up of women. Not only do females dominate swimming in the pool but there are more than 5,500 female coaches in the swimming world in Australian and over 2,000 female technical officials.\nHistory.\n1800s.\nDuring the middle part of the 1800s, swimming in Australia was segregated by sex. The times and facilities allocated to women at existing swimming clubs were inferior to those of their male counterparts. Australian women were forced by men to wear swim costumes that covered them up in order to prevent men from staring at them in a suggestive manner.\n1860s.\nIn 1867, two international women swimmers visited Australia: Alice Moon and Elphinstone Dick. Dick had set an English swimming distance record when she swam from Shoreham to Brighton, a distance of in less than ideal weather. Dick stayed in Melbourne, Victoria for two years and taught many women how to swim.\n1900s.\nOn 12 March 1904 a 12-year-old schoolgirl, J Hill, won the 50 yards event at what was described as the first carnival of the Australian Swimming Championships, held in Sydney at Rushcutters Bay. In the same year a swim carnival exclusively for women was held at the Booroodabin Baths in Brisbane.\nDuring this period, women in Australia wore swim suits that covered themselves from knee to the neck. Another early swim carnival for women in Queensland was organised in 1907 in Toowoomba. One of the teams competing in it was the Brisbane City Club, featuring a relay team with V. Nichol, F. Carr, B. Chapman and M. Mahoney.\nDuring the 1900s, a number of publicly recognised female swimmers emerged, engaging in swimming and diving exhibitions as well as competitive swimming. These notably included Annette Kellerman and Beatrice Kerr, who was billed as \"Australia's Champion Lady Swimmer and Diver\" and inspired others to follow their example.\nSwimming was a popular women's spectator sport in Queensland during the 1900s. Women attended many swimming events including ones held at the baths in Brisbane. A popular swimming location for Queensland women during the 1900s and 1910s was the water around Wellington Point. During this period, some popular swimming locations, like Yeppon's beach, had sheds for women to change in. These sheds prevented men from looking at women while they changed into their bathing costume. Swimming was a sport enjoyed in rural, bush areas in Australia during the 1900s. The local waterhole was used for swimming and cooling down during the warm summers, but was more often a place for men and women to congregate and socialise.\n1910s.\nOn 15 July 1912, at the Stockholm Olympics, Fanny Durack became the first Australian to win a swimming event on a world stage and first Australian female to win an Olympic gold medal. At the meet she won the 100m in a time of 1 minute and 25 seconds, just beating fellow Australian Mina Wylie. Miss Durack and Miss Wylie had been training for the London Olympics in the same year. Unfortunately restrictions were put in place during the Olympics to make sure that women could not compete in events that men were also competing in. This meant that the girls had to pull out of the Olympics and decided instead to enter the 100m event, the only event open to females at the time, at the Stockholm Olympics. Around the mid-1910s, women faced similar participation barriers that women in other sports like golf faced during the same period. These restrictions included reduced times in which to swim, changing areas and lack of comparable facilities that men had. By 1914, women were beginning to speak out in Queensland about these conditions asking for greater access to the facilities or new women only facilities to be built. The government complied in some cases and some pools began to ease restrictions on female usage of the facilities. The giving in on the part of swimming officials was because of recognition about the importance of physical activity for women's physical and psychological health.\n1920s.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding. One of Australia's best swimmers in the first part of the twentieth century was Mabel Springfield. She was selected for the 1920 Summer Olympics but could not go. She went to the 1928 Summer Olympics as a chaperone for the Australian women's swim team.\n1930s.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds.

Some swimmers players, such as Rhoda Cavill, quit competitive swimming during the war. Others, such as Judy Joy Davies Evelyn De Lacy continued. De Lacy's only break came in the period around the birth of her child. Australian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\n1990s.\nAustralian women like Shelly Taylor-Smith and Susan Maroney were beating Australian male competitors in long distance swim races.\n2000s.\n2000 was a big year for sports in Australia where they held the 2000 Olympic Games. There games were also the celebration of 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games. There were some amazing and outstanding achievements by women. Some include Susie O’Neill who won the women's 200m freestyle and silver in the 200m butterfly, Leisel Jones got silver in the 100m breaststroke, Petria Thomas got bronze in the 200m butterfly, the women's 4x200 freestyle relay got silver and the women's 4 × 100 medley got silver.\nParticipation.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The fourth most popular sport that these women participated in was swimming, with 25 having participated in the sport.\nSwimming is one of Australia's sports with the highest rates of participation by women. A total of 11.8% of Australian women regularly swim. This is behind only walking and aerobics.\nFor more than 100 years, swimming has provided Australian women the chance to make their mark on the international and national stage, with not many other sports allowing females to compete in. In the latest National Team, female competitors made up 55 per cent of the team and in the communities there are more than 5000 female coaches and more than 2000 female officials.\nInternational.\nAustralia has a long history of sending competitors to international events.\nCommonwealth and Empire Games.\nIn 1935, a decision was made to allow women to compete in the 1938 Empire Games. The decision was made that year that the Australians were to host the event and they were the ones who would determine what events would be competed. The women's events that were to be included were swimming and athletics, events that Australia was to dominate in.\nDuring the 1950s, Australian women dominated the swimming competitions at the Empire Games. The most famous of these swimmers were Marjory McQuade, Lorraine Crapp and Dawn Fraser.\nOlympics.\nThe first Olympic gold medal to be officially awarded to a woman at any Olympics was the Australian swimmer, Fanny Durack, who won medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics in the freestyle event.\nAtt the 1956 Summer Olympics, an Australian woman won a medal in every women's swimming event held during the games.\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics, Suzanne Landells won a silver medal in the 400-metre medley, Karen Phillips won a silver medal in the 200 metres butterfly, and Michelle Pearson won a bronze in the 200-metre medley.\nAt the 2012 London Olympic Games, despite only winning ten medals in the pool, the Australian women's team performed at a high level. The 4 × 100 m Women's freestyle relay team was the only race in which Australia won a gold medal, with the team composed of Cate Campbell, Alicia Coutts, Brittany Elmslie and Melanie Schlanger. Australian women, also picked up another six medals at the Olympic Games, including four individual medals.\nThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, saw Australian women win eight gold medals in the pool including double individual golds for Emma McKeon, \nAriarne Titmus and Kaylee McKeown. Overall McKeon won four gold medals and her total of seven medals equalled the record for most medals by a female athlete from any sport at any single Olympic Games."

One of the reason women were encouraged to play croquet, tennis and golf during the late 1800s was because it was seen as beneficial to their health. These sports were also seen as passive, non-aggressive and non-threatening to the period's concepts of masculinity and femininity.\nThe \"Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil\" from 4 March 1882 ran a lithograph of men and women playing tennis together. In this era, tennis courts were sometimes part of the grounds of Australian mansions.\nTennis was occasionally played aboard ships in Australia. Some of these matches were played by women.\nSphairistike was an early form of tennis. It was being played in Brisbane by 1876 by women. By the end of the 1870s, a number of Women's tennis clubs and mixed gender tennis clubs had been established in Australia and Queensland. By the mid-1880s, these clubs were well established and women's participation in the sport was widely accepted. During this time period, Australian women wore long skirts and long sleeved blouses to play the game. Clubs that had been established Maryborough, Bundaberg, Charters Towers, Ipswich, Gladstone, Townsville, Warwick, and Toowoomba. Tennis was not cheap: women were also playing on private courts. Racquets cost between fifteen shillings and two pounds. Balls cost one shilling. At the time, most working women made about two pounds a week. Beyond the cities and towns, tennis was also being played in the bush during this time period.\nIn Australia and Queensland's early colonial history, tennis and croquet were acceptable sports for society women to participate in. During that period, women wore big hats and dresses that covered their arms and legs. In 1908, playing outfits also featured high collared, long sleeved shirts and ties. This uniform had changed little by 1917. By 1920, the uniforms had changed and girls were allowed to wear \"holland uniforms\" that featured skirts that went down to mid-calf, thigh-high stockings, a heavy hat and gloves taken off before the match, and a tie.\nInterstate tennis was established by 1908, when the Queensland Ladies' Interstate Tennis Team counted as its team members May Thurlow, Maud Larad, Eva Thurlow and Florence Horton.\nSeveral tennis clubs were created in Queensland during the early part of the 1900s. One such club was the Cosmo Tennis Club of Gympie. It was active around 1911 and provided its female members a chance to socialise and play in a competitive environment. Others clubs were the Townsville Tennis Club and the Charters Towers Tennis Club, which were founded in 1889. Both of these clubs allowed male and female participation. They two clubs regularly competed against each other in the 1900s.\nIt was hard to get supplies to build tennis courts in rural and bush areas during the 1900s. One of the alternative supplies used for the ground for tennis courts in the bush was crushed termite nests. Mixed gender tennis was being played in Queensland by 1909 at places like the Endeavour Tennis Club in Cooktown. As this area was particularly rural and isolated, the tennis club helped to create community connections that might not exist otherwise. Mixed gendered and single women's tennis was played in the bush on stations like Gracemere Station during the 1910s and 1920s.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The purpose was to increase women's interest in sport by providing them opportunities to play. Sports that were included on the programme included cricket, field hockey, women's basketball, bowls, rowing, swimming, athletics, rifle shooting, baseball, golf, tennis and badminton. There were over 1,000 bowlers involved over the course a week. Cricket featured a match versus a visiting English side. Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The most popular sport that these women participated in was tennis, with 86 having played the sport.\nThe second World War was disruptive to women's tennis in Australia. Some tennis players, such as Nell Hopman, joined up to help the war effort. Other tennis players such as Wilma Fowler joined the Women's Land Army.\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport was not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\nDuring the 1950s, Australian tennis players competed and won at the Empire Games. These players included Margaret Court and Evonne Cawley.\nDaniela Di Toro is a wheelchair tennis player from Australia. She has won the Australian Open eight times, a record number of times.\nAshleigh Barty is an Australian women's tennis play who is currently ranked number 1 in the world. Her most recent major title was the 2019 French Open."

However, after an 1885 storm blew the pavilion away, the club found a new home at Belfast Road, where it remained until 1996. \nIn 1997, Holywood faced difficulties due to the raising by St Paul’s Gaelic Athletic Club on its adjacent pitch, which was used by the cricket club as its outfield. For the 1997 season, the club moved to Sullivan Upper School, thanks to the generosity of the school and its then headmaster John Young. This arrangement lasted for 8 seasons until the club moved to their current home at the Seapark Oval. The male teams of the club are known as The Black Knights, the junior/youth teams as the Green Dragons, and the women's teams are known as the Aces and Bandits.\nHolywood has produced many great players over the years including Bill Pollock, Brian Shannon, Ernie Shannon, Con McCall, and Stewart McCormick. International wicketkeepers who learned the game at Holywood are Paul Moore and Gary Wilson. On the administration side, Holywood has produced NCU presidents such as R.M. Erskine and Dawson Moreland. Cecil Cave was president of what is now Cricket Ireland in 1976.\nThe Graham Cup, the premier U15 competition in the NCU, is also linked to Holywood. The cup was donated by Mr. H Graham, who's son was a member of the Holywood team that won the trophy in its first year. The final was held at Holywood until 1996.\nJunior cricket.\nIn 2018 Holywood created an extensive schools coaching programme that provides an introduction to the game for many primary and secondary schools in North Down and East Belfast.\nThe Club has a large junior section for both boys and girls (more than 300 children in 2019) aged 3+ and fields 2 U9 teams (incrediball), 4 Under11 hardball teams (including 1 all-girls team. The only club in Northern Ireland to do so), 3 Under13 teams (including 1 all-girls team) and an Under15 team. In June the club hosts \"The Mini World Cup\" of KWIK Cricket for ~ 200 primary school age boys and girls from 10+ different schools and also hosts 2 all-girls KWIK Cricket Tournaments for ~ 280 players at Under13 and Under15 levels.\nIn 2019 Holywood introduced \"Mini Bouncers\" for kids aged 3 to 7 to provide their 1st contact with the sport of cricket and the fundamentals of movement.\nGirls and women's cricket.\nIn 2018 the club began a long term strategic plan to become a centre for female cricket, working closely with Sullivan Upper School, Rockport School and Strathearn School. Holywood hosts numerous female cricket tournaments, both inter-school and inter-club. The latter featuring its own club female teams the Holywood Aces and Holywood Bandits."

At that time they played at the university grounds at Cherryvale on the Ravenhill Rd. a wonderful ground.\nThe university team never really played well until after their annual tour to a variety of venues (e.g. Scotland 1953, London area 1954, etc.) after which they seemed to jell as a team.\nColors matches were played against Trinity College Dublin and in 1957 against St Andrews the current Scottish University champion.\nMembers of the 1953 team were Pat McMillan Capt. Ron McKinnon Vice. Capt., Robin Bailey, Frank Fee, R.J. Woods, Jimmy McKelvey, Wally Boyce, Ian Roulston, Ozzie McKee, Wally Kirkpatrick. Stewart Johnson. Edward Cathcart (Wks.)

When he came to live at the Muckamore School House with the Entwhistle family in 1874 he formed Muckamore Cricket Club. The original ground was at Boghead but circumstances meant the ground was moved to Oldstone and later to Moylena, where we have been playing continuously for about 125 years.\nIn 1894, a local minister strongly disapproved of a barrel of beer being delivered to the ground each Saturday and finished on the Sunday, so he formed Greenmount Cricket Club for the junior members and boys from his Bible class. This club played on the opposite side of the Six Mile Water from Moylena, but in 1897 the two clubs agreed to merge, electing John G. Entwhistle to captain Muckamore, a position he continuously held for 27 years."

        "text": "The 1914 Stanley Cup Finals was a series between the Victoria Aristocrats, champions of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), and the Toronto Hockey Club (, in media of the day, the Torontos or the Blueshirts), champions of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The Torontos defeated the Aristocrats in three games to win the best-of-five series. It was the first officially sanctioned series for the Stanley Cup between the two leagues, starting the \"World's Series\" era where the NHL champion played off against a PCHA or Western league champion annually for the Stanley Cup. It was also the final series of the \"challenge\" era, where inter-league series for the Stanley Cup were sanctioned by the Stanley Cup trustees. An anticipated follow-on challenge series between Toronto and Sydney, champions of the Maritime League did not take place as Sydney abandoned their challenge for the Cup.\nPaths to the Finals.\nNearing the end of the season, the NHA made arrangements for the NHA champion to receive a challenge from the Sydney Millionaires, Maritime champions, ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees. As arranged by the NHA, the series would have taken place on March 9–11. After that, the winner would face off in a series with the PCHA champions in Toronto. NHA Season ended in a tie. So a 2-game series was set for March 7 &amp; March 11 to declare the NHA Champion and Stanley Cup Champion. Montreal and Toronto each to host a game.\nToronto Blueshirts vs. Montreal Canadiens.\nBecause of the NHA playoff game, the series with Sydney Millionaires was postponed. After dispatching the Canadiens, the Blue Shirts series with Sydeny was cancelled. Toronto agreed to play a best of 5 series against the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the series was accepted.\nSeveral days later, Foran wrote to Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\"\nGame summaries.\nThe first game, the first Stanley Cup game in Toronto, was played under NHA rules. Toronto won 5–2 as the \"Coast Champions Did Not Show Expected Form\" according to the \"Toronto Globe\". Victoria had too much individual play and not enough \"team play and combination work.\"\nScotty Davidson, Toronto's captain, sat out the second game due to the flu. The second game was seven-man hockey, played under PCHA rules, which also meant dividing up the ice into three zones, with the centre zone open to \"off-side\" passing. Toronto led 3–2 after the first period. Lester Patrick scored twice and Tommy Dunderdale scored in the second to give Victoria a 5–3 lead after two periods. Frank Foyston scored twice in the third to tie the score, sending it to overtime. McGiffin scored the winning goal after 18 minutes of overtime.\nDavidson returned for the third game as a substitute for Cully Wilson. The Victoria forwards back-checked well and reduced the shooting opportunities of Toronto. The game had a lot of rough play, and \"the man with the puck was generally sent sprawling before he had a chance to shoot,\" according to \"The Globe.\" The Victoria forwards played a good game bringing many shots against Toronto's Harry Holmes in net. Victoria's Patrick injured his wrist in the second period and could not shoot after that. Davidson and Bobby Genge started a fight at 15 minutes of the third period, clearing the benches. Foyston scored for Toronto in the second period, and Cameron scored in the third to score the winning goal. Victoria's Dubby Kerr scored with seven minutes to go, but Victoria was not able to get an equalizer.\nAll games played at Arena Gardens.\nTotal attendance for the series was 14,260 for an average of 4,753 in the 7,500 capacity Arena. At the time, professional hockey was less of a draw than Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) senior hockey. Two games between local OHA senior teams had combined to exceed 14,000 total attendance. The Torontos players and staff received $297 each as their share of the gate receipts.\nGame summaries.\nToronto: Harry \"Happy\" Holmes goal; George McNamara, point; Jack Marshall, cover point; Frank Foyston, centre; Allan \"Scotty\" Davidson, Capt., right wing; Jack Walker, left wing; Spares -Con Corbeau -P, Roy \"Minnie\" McGiffin -RW, Carol \"Cully\" Wilson -LW, Claude Wilson -G.\nVictorias: Bert Lindsay, goal; Bob Genge, point; Lester Patrick, cover point; Tommy Dunderdale, centre; George \"Sinner\" Poulin, right wing; Albert \"Dubbie\" Kerr, left wing; Bobby Rowe -RW, Walter Smaill -LW, Jack Ulrich -RW.\nOfficials: Russel Bowie, referee, Jack Brennan, judge of play.\nAtt: 5,100\nToronto: Holmes, Harry 'Happy\" Holmes goal; George McNamara, point; Jack Marshall, cover point; Jack Walker, Rover; Frank Foyston, centre; Allan \"Scotty\" Davidson, Capt., right wing; Carol \"Cully\" Wilson, left wing; Spares - Carol \"Cully\" Wilson - LW, Con Corbeau -P, Roy \"Minnie\" McGiffin -RW, Claude Wilson -G.\nVictorias: Bert Lindsay, goal; Bob Genge, point; Lester Patrick, cover point; George \"Sinner\" Poulin Rover; Tommy Dunderdale, centre; Albert \"Dubbie\" Kerr, right wing; Walter Smaill-LW, left wing; Bobby Rowe -RW, Jack Ulrich -RW.\nOfficials: Russell Bowie, referee, Tommy Phillips, judge of play.\nAttendance, 4,600.

        "title": "2011 Giro d'Italia, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2011 Giro d'Italia began on 7 May, and stage 11 occurred on 18 May. The 2011 edition commemorated the 150th anniversary of Italian unification. The majority of the race, and the entire first half, was situated entirely within Italy without visiting any other nations. The race commenced with a team time trial, an event where each member of a team starts together racing against the clock. The stage provided for the first two race leaders, members of the winning team.\nThe race, and the entire cycling world, were turned upside down by the death of rider Wouter Weylandt in stage 3. Weylandt had crashed from near the back of the race while descending a hill, and sustained such grievous injury that he was established to have died instantly upon falling to the road. The next day's stage was neutralized, as the peloton rode slowly and allowed Weylandt's teammates, as well as his good friend and training partner Tyler Farrar from the squad, to cross the line first with their arms around one another. All of them subsequently withdrew from the Giro.\nDutch rider Pieter Weening won the first stage competitively raced after Weylandt's death, and took over the race leadership for four days. He surrendered it to another stage winner, strong overall favorite Alberto Contador who dominated the field on the way up Mount Etna. Although it was perhaps against his will, Contador continued to hold the race leadership through the end of the first half of the race, topping the overall standings with the much more difficult second half of the Giro still to race.\nStage 1.\nThe Giro begins with a team time trial, a favored event of race director Angelo Zomegnan who has included such a stage in every Giro since he first assumed that mantle. The course is flat, but is also technical, with several sharp turns, and it also covers tram tracks. Pre-race analysis found it comparable to the equivalent stage in Venice which began the 2009 Giro. The team, known at that time as , are again favorites, along with several other teams. While the Giro itself commemorates the anniversary of Italian unification, so too does the first stage in particular, by visiting Italy's first capital of Turin.\nThe team was the first on the course, and stopped the clock in 21'21\", which held up as a competitive time for the rest of the stage. Nearly every squad came within a second, on either side, of matching their time of ten minutes flat at the intermediate time check. The one which was notably faster was , who were at 9'48\" after 9 km. They were the only squad to finish in under 21 minutes, winning the stage with a time of 20'59\". Team time trial winners from the 2010 Giro opted to ride somewhat conservatively, particularly over the tram tracks, knowing that with less than 20 km of racing that resultant time gaps would not be excessive. Their leader Vincenzo Nibali effectively gained eight seconds on Giro favorite Alberto Contador with finishing eighth to Liquigas-Cannondale's fourth. Michele Scarponi also gained time on Contador, with the six seconds better than Contador's squad. The most notable time loss on the day however was suffered by Joaquim Rodríguez, with his squad finishing a distant 20th, over a minute off HTC-Highroad's winning time. Marco Pinotti was the first HTC-Highroad rider over the finish line, giving him the first pink jersey. He had previously held the jersey for four days in the 2007 Giro, but he made it clear after the stage that he would work for Mark Cavendish in the first road race stage and could possibly cede the jersey to the Manxman.\nStage 2.\nThis stage was flat, and one of few stages intended to end in a mass sprint. It took place on National Bicycle Day in Italy, the second time such an occasion was observed. A very short fourth-category climb occurred from the finish line, to award the first green jersey. The arrival town of Parma hosted the Giro on eight other occasions, and was chosen for National Bicycle Day due to the vast quantities of bike trails it has.\nA singular rider formed the day's breakaway. Sebastian Lang of accelerated out of the peloton after just . No one joined him, and the German stayed out front alone for the next , having held an advantage at one point of over 20 minutes. He had still been in first position over the fourth-category climb, meaning he was awarded the green jersey on the podium after the stage. After he was caught, some from the finish, an eight-man counter-attack formed. Their advantage was never greater than 30 seconds, and when Eduard Vorganov crashed from the end of the stage, the others lost their rhythm and were caught soon after. rode on the front of the peloton in the final kilometers, trying to set up the finish for their sprinter Tyler Farrar. At the finish, however, Farrar's last leadout man Murilo Fischer was unable to match the accelerations of Mark Renshaw and Danilo Hondo, respective leadout men for Mark Cavendish and Alessandro Petacchi, and the American faded to seventh on the day. Petacchi opened the sprint first, to the right of Renshaw, leaving Cavendish to take the line to Renshaw's left. Just as Cavendish occupied a position with open road in front of him, Petacchi deviated from his line and rode directly in front of Cavendish for a few meters. When Cavendish tried to go around Petacchi, the Italian again changed his line to stay in front of Cavendish. After a moment, both sprinted with open road in front of them, and Petacchi came across the line first by a matter of millimeters. Cavendish was visibly upset, shouting and gesticulating at Petacchi after they crossed the finish line.\nCavendish's 12-second time bonus for second place nonetheless made him the new overall race leader. Cavendish later explained that his frustration was not directed at Petacchi, but at race officials, since he felt he would be relegated if he had sprinted in a similar manner. However, he also said that he never had the intention of appealing the result. His sporting director Valerio Piva also took that stance, stating that Petacchi's sprint was \"not really fair play.\" The next day, Cavendish made a point of apologizing to Petacchi via Twitter for his outburst after crossing the finish line.\nStage 3.\nThis stage was categorized flat, though there were two climbs near the end. The third-category Passo del Bocco was expected to split the peloton, while the fourth-category Madonna delle Grazie climb was expected to make the finish trying for any sprinters remaining at the front of the race. Pre-race analysis led to speculation that the race lead would probably change hands on this stage. The departure town of Reggio Emilia was chosen for this Giro because it is where the flag of Italy was first created.\nRace report.\nFour riders distinguished themselves as the day's breakaway – Bart De Clercq, Gianluca Brambilla, Pavel Brutt, and Davide Ricci Bitti. They established their position as the day's signature escape after . Overnight race leader Mark Cavendish had repeated mechanical trouble, needing two full bike changes early in the stage. This gapped him off from the front of the race, leaving him three minutes back of the stage winner at day's end and surrendering the pink jersey. The break's time gap began to fall at the to go mark, having been at a maximum of six minutes. De Clercq tried to accelerate out of the breakaway for the mountains points at the top of the Passo del Bocco, since his teammate Sebastian Lang held the mountains jersey after his day-long breakaway in stage 2. He started his sprint much too early, however, and Brambilla beat him to the summit, making the Italian the new wearer of the green jersey. The main field, paced mostly by as they tried to keep the pace difficult to isolate Cavendish while protecting their sprinter Alessandro Petacchi, caught them with left to race. Shortly thereafter, another four-man group formed. After some moments, they were joined by David Millar to make for a leading quintet. This group stayed away to the finish, with 's Ángel Vicioso was easily the strongest sprinter present, taking the win. Millar's time bonus for second, coupled with the group's 21-second gap over the main field, made the Briton the new race leader.\nDeath of Wouter Weylandt.\nDuring the descent of the Passo del Bocco, rider Wouter Weylandt crashed and suffered catastrophic injury. Race doctor Giovanni Tredici, and the doctor for the team were in cars very near Weylandt's group on the road, and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation for approximately 40 minutes. Doctors also gave Weylandt adrenaline and atropine to try to restart his heart, though Tredici stated that resuscitation efforts were rather clearly in vain, and that Weylandt was already dead by the time they got to him. Doctors were never able to revive Weylandt, and he was declared dead on the spot. A short time later, Weylandt's body was airlifted off the descent and taken to a nearby hospital, where the pathologist conducting the autopsy concluded that the Belgian had died immediately upon crashing. Weylandt's death was the first at the Giro in 25 years, and the first at one of cycling's Grand Tours since Fabio Casartelli died during the 1995 Tour de France.\nManuel Antonio Cardoso of had been nearest to Weylandt when he crashed, and stated that Weylandt had touched a small retaining wall on the left side of the road with either his pedal or his handlebars, and was then catapulted across the road to the other side, where he again collided with something. He had looked behind him to ascertain his exact position in the race when he clipped the wall. Teammate Tom Stamsnijder also witnessed the accident, saying \"it was a very hard fall.\" Italian police, conducting an inquest into Weylandt's death, also took an official statement from the Portuguese rider at Team RadioShack's hotel. A memorial was placed at the crash site, where Weylandt's widow and mother, along with cyclists, passersby and residents of nearby villages, placed flowers. The team remained in the race for another day at the encouragement of Weylandt's family. Zomegnan said in a post-stage press conference that race officials would respect whatever decision the peloton made regarding the next day's stage. New race leader Millar spent the evening discussing with members of , Weylandt's best friend Tyler Farrar, and his widow and mother how best to pay tribute to the fallen rider. Weylandt wore bib number 108 in the race, and Giro officials have said they will not assign the number in future editions of the race.\nStage 4.\nThis stage was categorized medium mountain, though it was nearly as flat as stage 3. The third-category Passo del Bracco crested after , and the fourth-category Montenero climb occurred just before the finish.\nFollowing the death of Wouter Weylandt, this stage was preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a procession in his memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took to the front of the peloton for about 15 minutes, and members of his team , along with his friend and training mate Tyler Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Race leader David Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining squad all decided to leave the race.\nRemained the General classification after stage 4\nStage 5.\nThe profile for this stage was bumpy, but more significantly, it incorporated of unpaved roads. One analyst referred to the course profile as resembling \"a mini Tour of Lombardy.\" Along with two third-category climbs on course, there was a brief uphill at the finish that counted as a mountain climb, as well as numerous uncategorized rises. Zomegnan selected this course specifically to include the sectors of so-called \"white roads\" after the similar stage in Tuscany in the 2010 Giro opened some large time gaps among the race favorites and was generally accepted as one of the race's more spectacular stages.\nAfter the withdrawals of Tyler Farrar and Leopard Trek, 197 riders took the start for stage five. rider Martin Kohler went on the attack after , and for the second time in this Giro, they day's principal breakaway comprised a single rider. His advantage ballooned to almost 13 minutes at one point, but even when it did begin to fall, it did not fall precipitously at first. With left to race, the Swiss rider still had eight minutes on the main field. He was therefore first over the two third-category climbs on the course, and while mountains leader Gianluca Brambilla took maximum points from the peloton on both, Kohler took the green jersey from him at day's end. Where the dirt roads had been muddy in the 2010 Giro, due to heavy rainfall the day that stage was run, on this dry, sunny day, the peloton's passage over unpaved roads led to massive amounts of dust being kicked up in the air.\nRace leader David Millar and second-place man Ángel Vicioso collided and crashed while contesting the intermediate sprint for its bonus time. The crash would later prove costly for Millar. He was caught behind an acceleration from the team at the top of the Croce di Fighime, the first dirt-road climb. The only riders with him after the split were Fabio Taborre and Valerio Agnoli, riders whose team leaders were up the road, meaning Millar would have to mount the chase all on his own. Nagging injuries from the crash and allergies exacerbated by the dust in the air made the task extremely trying for Millar. He bridged back up to the leading group once, but fell off a second time in the final dirt sector, eventually finishing 2'50\" back on the day and surrendering the pink jersey. He later said that despite his effort, \"it wasn't possible\" to successfully defend the jersey. Numerous other crashes occurred on the day, with 's Tom Slagter's the most striking. The Dutch neo-pro lay prone on the road for several minutes, during which time race officials had to frantically wave oncoming riders to pass to the right of him. He was taken to a local hospital and diagnosed with a broken jaw, but was not seriously hurt.\nBram Tankink and Dario Cataldo were the first attackers out of the main field to try to bridge to Kohler, but both had mechanical trouble and had to drop back again. A short time after their effort, Pieter Weening and John Gadret successfully made the bridge, joining the front of the race with about left to race. After moments, Weening attacked out of this group and became the sole leader on the road, as Gadret and Kohler were both swept up by the group of overall favorites, the next on the road. Weening continued to hold a tenuous lead the rest of the way, but just as the overall favorites appeared to be about to overtake him, their tactics changed and they simply marked one another in the final kilometer. David Arroyo tried an acceleration with about to go, but it was much too late to have any effect, and Weening stayed away for the stage win. Fabio Duarte and José Serpa took the remaining time bonuses, for second and third, with Christophe Le Mével just behind. Had Le Mével taken any of the time bonuses on offer, he would have become the new race leader. Instead, Weening took the pink jersey, the first Dutchman to hold it since Jeroen Blijlevens in the 1999 Giro d'Italia. He gave the physical jersey awarded to him on the podium to Wouter Weylandt's family.\nStage 6.\nThere are no categorized climbs in this course, but it is again undulating, visiting the Apennines east of Rome. Michele Scarponi offered his analysis of the stage, believing it unlikely that it would be a stage for the sprinters, and that a small breakaway would likely decide the day. Zomegnan concurred that a breakaway would be likely to stay away on this stage, believing it a prelude to the Giro's first high mountain stage the next day.\nThis was a more straightforward day of racing than the one previous. Five riders formed the day's principal breakaway – Yaroslav Popovych, Kristof Vandewalle, Sacha Modolo, Frederik Veuchelen, and the original instigator Jussi Veikkanen. Their maximum advantage was left carefully controlled at six minutes. Modolo was the first to lose the pace, and rode for several kilometers in a no-man's land between the other four and the peloton, an effort that cost him sufficient strength that he finished dead last on the day. Veikkanen next fell off the pace to leave a leading trio. At this point, Modolo's teammate Stefano Pirazzi set off on the attack from the main field to try to bridge up to the leaders, but he was never able, being caught between the two groups for some . Pirazzi's attack made little if any strategic sense, but it pleased the roadside fans who had brought signs showing their support for the Italian. With about 10 km left to race, Vandewalle tried to solo to the finish, leaving Popovych and Veuchelen behind to be swept up by the main field. His advantage was only 48 seconds at that point, and the peloton reabsorbed him with just under remaining. Attacks from David Millar, František Raboň, Matthias Frank, and Robert Kišerlovski were all very short-lived. Within the final kilometer, Danilo Di Luca took first position on the road and for a moment appeared poised for victory before he was passed up by former teammate Alessandro Petacchi. The points leader had started his sprint from nearly out, since leadout man Danilo Hondo pulled off at that point upon seeing that Francisco Ventoso and not Petacchi was sitting in his slipstream. Ventoso occupied first position with about to go, at which point it seemed that Petacchi was going to pass him and claim the stage win, but the Italian suddenly stopped pedaling just meters from the finish line, giving Ventoso the stage win. When interviewed by media shortly after the stage's conclusion, Petacchi was so exhausted that for over a minute he did not have sufficient breath to speak, and could only gasp for air. He later said he was satisfied with second on the day, since the uphill finish meant victory was unlikely for a field sprinter like him. Ventoso, for his part, had targeted this stage ahead of time, believing that the group that arrived at the finish together would be select and not include the entire peloton. The top ten in the overall standings were essentially unchanged, giving Pieter Weening another day in the pink jersey.\nStage 7.\nMontevergine di Mercogliano is a frequently-used summit arrival in the Giro. Damiano Cunego and Danilo Di Luca both won stages ending at this climb en route to overall victory, in 2004 and 2007 respectively. The climb is long but averages only 5 percent gradient, with its hardest sections at 10 percent. Former Giro champion Gilberto Simoni analyzed the stage, believing that with a flat stage to follow that the overall contenders would show themselves on this one, with a pure climber the likes of Joaquim Rodríguez perhaps the favorite.\nThis stage was largely similar to stage 5 in terms of how it played out. A five-rider breakaway distinguished itself after , with Federico Canuti, Jérôme Pineau, Lars Bak, Giovanni Visconti, and Matteo Montaguti the riders involved. Their time gap was kept quite small, due to the short distance of the stage. rider Johnny Hoogerland made the bridge to the leading group and not only kept their wheels, he pulled at the front for several kilometers. By the time the Montevergine climb, began Pineau and Visconti had been reabsorbed by the peloton. Canuti then crashed, and fell back. Bak was the rider to put in the solo attack, leaving Montaguti and Hoogerland behind. This was more likely to protect Kanstantsin Sivtsov's and Marco Pinotti's high positions in the overall classification than for Bak's own chances at victory, since the stocky Dane hardly had the right build to succeed on a summit finish. With their teammate up the road, Sivtsov and Pinotti could sit on wheels and led the onus for chasing down the remaining breakaway rider fall on other teams. Bak was caught with about remaining to race.\n's Sebastian Lang briefly escaped, but later his teammate, Belgian neo-pro Bart De Clercq, was able to get away and build a solid lead. His advantage stretched to 30 seconds entering the final , which averaged a 6% gradient. He still had a time gap entering the final kilometer. At this point, Michele Scarponi accelerated out of the group of overall favorites, second on the road, and the resultant responses brought the race's elite rapidly up to De Clercq at the front of the race. De Clercq was able to hold on for the first win of his pro career by about the length of his front tire.\nDe Clercq said after the stage that he had been suffering badly in the final 3 km and saw the elite riders closing on him, but managed to just maintain his advantage. He admitted that his departed compatriot Weylandt had not really been in his thoughts when he crossed the finish line. Roman Kreuziger, who took third on the stage, felt that Scarponi had been the strongest rider in the uphill sprint, but he also said he was pleased with his own placing. Stefano Garzelli, fourth on the day, had had his squad doing the bulk of the pacemaking in the peloton at the foot of the climb and on its early stretches. He criticized his rivals' teams after the stage for a seeming lack of interest in stage wins, since none of them sent any riders to the front to aid the chase. Going against pre-stage expectations, race leader Pieter Weening managed to retain the pink jersey by finishing 19th on the day, safely in with the 26-rider group that finished together at the head of the race.\nStage 8.\nThis was a flat stage, with the course staying right along the Tyrrhenian coast. There were no categorized climbs, short uncategorized rises on course, and a slight, but sudden, uphill right at the finish.\nTwo Italian riders found an early breakaway in this stage. They were 's Mirko Selvaggi and 's Leonardo Giordani. They rode off the front after just and were afforded nearly 11 minutes as their maximum time gap, a sizable margin considering the stage's flat profile. led the chase from the peloton for their sprinter Mark Cavendish, who noted before the stage that positioning coming into the slight uphill at the finale would be critical. Though their advantage held up than the stage's profile might have indicated, Giordani and Selvaggi did not stay away. The two Italians patted one another on the back as the main field passed them up with some to go. The team took over at the front at that point, setting up Oscar Gatto to accelerate out of the main field with just under remaining. He quickly attained a time gap, and with the uphill at the finish, the sprinters' teams were unable to bring him back, giving him the stage win. The day's major surprise came just behind him, as captain and prohibitive Giro favorite Alberto Contador duplicated Gatto's attack to surge clear moments later. He too stayed out front to the finish, coming in just behind Gatto to gain 5 seconds of actual time and a 12-second time bonus. This moved him up to fifth overall, best placed among the true overall favorites. Contador's manager Bjarne Riis commented after the stage that his star rider's attack had not been planned going into the stage, but he credited the Spaniard for seizing an opportunity when it presented itself.\nStage 9.\nEurope's most active volcano was the principal feature of stage 9. The peloton ascended the mountain twice, first up the northern face and then on the steeper southern face for a summit arrival. The departure town of Messina is general classification contender Vincenzo Nibali's hometown, and pre-race analysis expected that he may target this stage for that reason.\nThe Giro's most difficult stage so far also featured the largest morning breakaway so far. Nine riders found the breakaway, among them Giovanni Visconti and Yaroslav Popovych, both of whom had been in breakaways earlier in the race also, as well as Pablo Lastras, who came into the day in seventh place in the overall classification. Their maximum advantage was five minutes, though after the chase had begun in earnest and the time gap fell to 3'32\" it again went up to 4'27\". The official beginning of the Etna summit finish came with just under to race, but the road went uphill for easily twice that distance, meaning the final climb was quite long indeed. At to go, only Visconti, Lastras, Mathias Frank and Jan Bakelants remained at the front of the race, with a gap of 2'30\" over the group of overall favorites and their remaining teammates. Bakelants tried a solo move at this point, but this succeeded in only in dropping Lastras, and the other three continued to form a leading trio.\nAt about to go, race leader Pieter Weening lost the pace of the group of favorites, after he had held it during the first ascent of Etna. He finished the day six and a half minutes back of the stage winner, now the fourth rider to lose the pink jersey. Around this time, Bakelants accelerated from the front of the race again to become sole leader on the road. José Rujano also put in a move from the group of favorites and quickly got a time gap.\nJust after Rujano's move came an acceleration from overall favorite Alberto Contador. Michele Scarponi tried to follow, but very quickly lost the pace and struggled even to keep the pace of those Contador initially left behind, ceding 17 seconds at the finish line to most of the other overall contenders. Rujano put in an intensive effort simply to hold Contador's wheel. The two very quickly passed up the remaining three riders from the morning breakaway, and attained nearly a minute's advantage over the other contenders in only about 2 kilometers. Contador gestured to Rujano to seemingly ask him to take a pull at the front, but when the Venezuelan did not do so, Contador shed him as well to solo to a dominant stage win. Though Contador had won the 2008 Giro d'Italia, this was his first stage win at the Italian Grand Tour.\nEveryone lost major time to Contador. Stefano Garzelli, Vincenzo Nibali, Roman Kreuziger, David Arroyo, and Kanstantsin Sivtsov (who began the day second overall and retained that position) lost 50 seconds. Igor Antón lost 59 seconds. Scarponi's group 1'07\" down also included Christophe Le Mével and José Serpa. The most noteworthy time losses among the overall contenders were sustained by Denis Menchov and Joaquim Rodríguez. Both lost over two minutes, which coupled with mediocre stage 1 team trial performances effectively eliminated the overall hopes for either, as they sat over three minutes down in 20th and 22nd place respectively. At the end of the day, the group containing Mark Cavendish and several of his teammates and leadout men narrowly missed disqualification based on the time cut, beating the minimum survival time by 30 seconds. This near miss touched off a bit of controversy, as fellow sprinter Francisco Ventoso claimed that Cavendish had illegally used the race caravan for slipstreams to ease his way up the mountain and should have been disqualified. Two riders, however, did succumb to the time cut, Robbie McEwen and Graeme Brown. The two Australian sprinters had remarkably finished nearly an hour slower than Contador and over half an hour beyond the time cut, leading to their disqualifications from the race. After the stage, Nibali and Kreuziger both commented that Contador seemed well better than the rest of the field on Etna, though the Spaniard himself cautioned that there was a long way and several very difficult stages left to go in the race.\nStage 10.\nThis stage was to take place after a very long transfer on the race's first rest day and was to be another flat stage. Scarponi believed that with the long, shallow uphill at the end of the course it was unlikely to feature a mass sprint, instead favoring an attacking rider like Di Luca. This stage visited the small Molise region, one of 17 visited by this year's Giro, due to unification celebrations (the three regions not visited – Sardinia, Apulia, and Valle d'Aosta – would be utilized in later editions of the Giro). The course turned northwards to head back towards the finishing city of Milan. Zomegnan, unlike Scarponi, believed that this would be a sprinter's stage.\nNearly immediately after the true beginning of the stage, Fumiyuki Beppu and Pierre Cazaux went on the attack and got clear of the field. Yuriy Krivtsov made the bridge a short while later, and the three formed the day's breakaway. When their time gap began to exceed six minutes, took to the front of the peloton to protect race leader Alberto Contador. Beppu did most of the work in the breakaway, and won the one hill climb and intermediate sprint on the course. At to go, the time gap had fallen to under three minutes, which meant the peloton risked catching the escapees too early and inviting a counter move. Their pace eased a bit, and the trio was not brought back until to go. No one attempted a counterattack at that time. The sprint teams, most notably and , took over at the front at that point. As the peloton passed under the to go banner, former race leader David Millar surged clear. He occupied first position until just before the red kite at to go. had been the ones to chase him down, and in so doing their sprinter Mark Cavendish was left without his usual leadout train – from Cavendish's team only he, Kanstantsin Sivtsov and Marco Pinotti (two general classification riders), finished with the leading group. Danilo Hondo was in position to lead out Alessandro Petacchi, but pulled off early and left the Italian to sprint for victory from out. This was much too far, as Petacchi admitted after the stage. At to go, Cavendish came around Petacchi and easily had the speed to beat him to the finish line for the stage win. Francisco Ventoso also overtook Petacchi, to finish second. After the stage, Cavendish addressed Ventoso's remarks from the day before, challenging the Spaniard to join him in the \"gruppetto\" for a stage. Cavendish claimed that, due to his celebrity status, he was always surrounded by race officials and cameramen, even when he was nowhere near the front of the race. There was no significant change to the overall classification with the day's results.\nStage 11.\nThis was another heavily undulating stage. Four fourth-category ascents were the only point-awarding climbs, but at least eight other uncategorized rises occurred. The stage ended about from Scarponi's hometown, and one pre-race analyst expected him to be among the attackers on the day. Scarponi himself seemed to leave the possibility open. This was the first time the departure town of Tortoreto has featured in the Giro.\nRace leader Alberto Contador hinted in the previous days that he and his team may tactically relinquish the pink jersey in this stage. While the sprinters teams took up the chase in stage 10 and were likely to do so again in the even flatter stage 12, there was no particular benefit (beyond a difficult-to-achieve stage victory) to any team to chasing down a breakaway on a hilly course like this one. Thus, it made this day's breakaway a very important one, since one of its members could quite possibly obtain the race leadership.\nThe day's racing was preceded by a moment of silence and a blessing from a Catholic priest for Wouter Weylandt, whose funeral was held the same day. Because of the significance to this particular breakaway, it took a very long time for a group to get away. Nearly half the stage was covered before 11 riders from 10 teams ( was the squad to place two riders in the break) came clear. The best-placed man in the group was Christophe Le Mével, third overall and a rider who had come close to claiming the pink jersey earlier in the Giro. Le Mével said he went for the break \"on instinct,\" and had not planned to escape, since he figured his high GC position would keep him from being allowed up the road. Le Mével was the virtual race leader much of the day, when the group's time gap over the peloton exceeded the 1'19\" by which he trailed Contador entering the stage. The time gap held steady at two minutes for much of the stage. In the peloton, Contador spoke with Le Mével's teammates David Millar and Murilo Fischer, likely discussing whether the Spaniard was content to allow Le Mével to take the race lead.\nThe breakaway group's teamwork fell apart when 's Daniel Moreno sprinted for the last hill climb, from the finish. Instead of waiting for the other riders to rejoin him, he kept riding hard. The other riders were unable to work together in any effort to chase Moreno down. Le Mével led a four-man chase, with catching Moreno and maintaining the time gap over Contador of equal concern, but Moreno's advantage continued to increase. 's Ignatas Konovalovas, a time trial specialist who won the second individual time trial at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, put those skills to work by escaping Le Mével's group and catching Moreno with remaining. With to go, the peloton caught all the breakaway members except Konovalovas and Moreno, who held a 45-second advantage. They had been driven mostly by , with even points leader Alessandro Petacchi taking pulls at the front of the main field, to set up their captain Michele Scarponi. The final kilometer of the stage featured a section with a 10% gradient. Konovalovas and Moreno had 11 seconds going into it. Moreno shed the Lithuanian with remaining, only to be passed up himself by 's John Gadret with to go. Gadret's attack proved to have the right timing, as the Frenchman stayed in first position across the line for the stage win. Gadret said he had had Weylandt on his mind when racing, and although the two were not well acquainted, Gadret dedicated his win to the fallen Belgian. Gadret called it \"the most beautiful win in [his] career.\" It was his first Grand Tour stage win and his team's first Giro stage win since the 2006 Giro d'Italia. He described seeing Konovalovas and Moreno slowing, and knew that the overall contenders in the main field were not gunning for the stage win, which made him decide to make his well-fated attack. Scarponi admitted after the stage that he had hoped for victory, but Gadret's attack caught the field by surprise. He praised his team, mentioning Petacchi in particular, for their hard work at the front of the race much of the day. Largely due to Scarponi's team, Contador retained the pink jersey. There was a minor change to the overall standings. After being caught, Le Mével missed a late split at the front of the race and finished 13 seconds back. Since he won bonus time in the breakaway, his loss for the day was 9 seconds, but this was still enough to drop him from third to fourth overall. Contador said after the stage that he would have been perfectly happy to let Le Mével take the jersey, but the ambitions of other teams (namely, the stage win) meant the peloton had little choice but to catch the breakaway."

It was the third world championships to be held in London, involving amateur men and women from twenty-eight countries across the world. There were three styles on offer; Semi-Contact, Light-Contact and Musical Forms, and for the first time since Milan 1981, there would be no Full-Contact kickboxing competition at a W.A.K.O. world championships. Each country was allowed one competitor per weight division per category, although participants were allowed to participate in more than one category.\nBy the end of the championships the USA were the top nation, just about pushing hosts Great Britain into second by virtue of their performance in Musical Forms, with Hungary in third. There was also a little bit of history made in London with the American Christine Bannon-Rodrigues being the first person to win three golds at a single championships, winning gold medals in Semi-Contact and Musical Forms (x2). The event was held in London over two days at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London, England, UK, starting on Saturday 12 October and finishing on Sunday 13 October 1991.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing in which fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1991.

The most notable winner was Christine Bannon-Rodrigues who would also win two more golds in Musical Forms. By the end of the championships the hosts Great Britain were the strongest nation in Semi-Contact, winning three golds, three silvers and three bronzes across the male and female competitions.\nLight-Contact.\nMore physical than Semi-Contact but less so than Full-Contact, points were awarded and fights won on the basis of speed and technique over power, and it was seen as a transition stage for fighters who were considering a move from Semi to Full-Contact. More information on Light-Contact rules can be found of the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1991. For the first time ever at a W.A.K.O. world championships, both men and women were allowed to take part in Light-Contact, with the men having seven weight classes, starting at 57 kg/125.4 lbs and ending at over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs and the women's having four weight classes beginning at 50 kg/110 lbs and ending at over 60 kg/+132 lbs. The most notable medallist was Jeff Roufus who although he only gained a bronze would later having future success as a multiple pro world champion. By the end of the event, hosts Great Britain were the strongest country in Light-Contact winning four golds, one silver and two bronze medals.\nForms.\nMusical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information can be accessed on the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1991. For the first time ever, women were officially recognised in Musical Forms at a world championships, with the men having four styles and the women three. An explanation of the various styles is provided below:\nWomen were also allowed to use weapons but it was one separate category. The most notable winner was Christine Bannon-Rodrigues who claimed two gold medals in Soft Styles and Weapons to add to the gold she won in Semi-Contact to make history as the first person to win three golds at a single W.A.K.O. championships.

        "text": "Walter Ernest Peterson (born 7 November 1883) was an Ireland men's field hockey international. He was a member of the Ireland team that played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning a silver medal. Peterson was one of six brothers who played field hockey for Avoca, Palmerstown and Ireland. His brother, Jack Peterson, also played for Ireland at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Walter and Jack Peterson were also team mates at Monkstown. Peterson also won Irish Senior Cup titles with both Palmerstown and Monkstown.\nEarly years, family and education.\nWalter Peterson was born into a Church of Ireland family on 7 November 1883 at Ulster Terrace, Stillorgan, County Dublin. He was the youngest son of Nicholas George Peterson, a chartered accountant and auditor who was originally from Cork, and Marion Peterson (\"née\" Penny) who was originally from England. Peterson was the youngest of six brothers. He also had an older sister, Mary Maud. He attended Avoca School, where he began to play field hockey. In 1901 the Peterson family lived at 14 Sydney Parade Avenue in Donnybrook, Dublin. In 1911 they were living at 6 Eaton Place in Blackrock, Dublin. Peterson worked as insurance broker.\nDomestic teams.\nWalter Peterson and his five brothers – Jack Peterson, William Peterson, Nicholas Peterson, Herbert Peterson and Cecil Peterson – began playing for Avoca in 1896. In 1899 the brothers moved to Palmerstown. They formed the nucleus of team that between 1900 and 1905 lost only two matches out of 160 played. During this run they won the Irish Senior Cup on four occasions. The two defeats were both cup matches against Dublin University, and both games were lost by a single goal. In one season Palmerstown scored 102 goals and conceded just seven. After Palmerstown disbanded in 1907, most of the brothers, including Walter and Jack moved to Monkstown where he won two more Irish Senior Cup titles in 1911 and 1914. In addition to his five brothers, his team mates at Palmerstown and Monkstown also included J.E. Mills and William Graham. Between 1903 and 1912 Walter Peterson also made 14 appearances for Leinster at interprovincial level.\nIreland international.\nBetween 1903 and 1914 Walter Peterson made 23 senior appearances for Ireland. He made his debut in 1903 in a 7–0 win against Wales. Peterson played as a right full-back and, for most of his international career, he was partnered at left-back by his brother, Jack Peterson. In 1904 the Peterson brothers were members of the Ireland team that won the Triple Crown. Ireland won the title after defeating Wales 4–2 away and England 3–2 at home. As well as his brother Jack at left-back, the team also included his brothers Nicholas (right-half), William (inside-left) and Cecil (midfield). Another brother, Herbert made two Ireland appearances between 1900 and 1902. In total the brothers won sixty six caps between them. Walter and Jack Peterson were both members of the Ireland team that played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning a silver medal. Ireland defeated Wales 3–1 in a semi-final before losing 8–1 to England in the final. Peterson made his last appearance for Ireland in a 2–2 draw away to England in early 1914.\nUmpire.\nWalter Peterson was listed as an umpire at an Ireland–England international in 1921."

        "title": "Division 1-A Rugby",
        "text": "Division 1-A Rugby (formerly known as the College Premier Division) is the highest level of college rugby within the United States and is administered by USA Rugby. Division 1-A rugby is modeled after NCAA athletic competitions, with the 46 D1-A rugby schools divided into eight conferences: East, Midwest, Rocky Mountain, California, Big Ten, Red River, PAC, and Independent.\nThe regular season sees all teams in the conference play one another, with the two top seeds qualifying for the playoffs. Playoffs are a single-elimination format, occurring each year in April and May, with the winner of D1-A declared the National Champion. Regular seasons for most conferences are played in the spring, although some cold-weather conferences, such as the Big Ten Universities, play their regular season in the fall.\nThe competition's first season was played during 2011 and consisted of teams from 31 schools from across the United States. The first ever match of the competition was played on Friday March 4, the Arizona State Sun Devils hosted the Colorado Buffaloes at the Arizona State University Soccer Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. The 2011 final was played at Rio Tinto Stadium, in Sandy, Utah, on the 21 May 2011.\nD1-A Rugby secured sponsorships in 2012 with World Rugby Shop and Veloce.\nSeveral players who have excelled in the top level competitions in college rugby have also represented their country as part of the United States national under-20 rugby union team or the All Americans rugby union team.\nFormation.\nHistory of college rugby in the U.S..\nA group of British Army officers organized a game of rugby against the students of McGill University (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) in 1865; the Canadians were so enamored of the game that they decided to continue to play football by the Rugby code. In 1874 McGill organized two games of football against Harvard, one was played under Harvard's rules, the other under \"McGill\" rugby rules. In late 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, and won by three tries in front of 2,000 spectators. In 1875 Harvard athlete Nathaniel Curtis challenged Yale's captain, William Arnold to a rugby-style game. Columbia, Princeton and Yale were persuaded by Harvard to play football according to the Rugby School code in 1876. These four colleges formed the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA), an organization that eventually expanded to become the \"Ivy League.\" In fact, the governing body of all American intercollegiate varsity sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) traces its roots to the IFA and is thus a product of rugby rather than any of the sports it now governs.\nBy 1886 the Yale coach Walter Camp had modified rugby's rules in order to solve the problem of tackled players lying on the ball by introducing a series of four downs to gain ten yards; ironically in the same year the Rugby Football Union in England solved the same problem by requiring that tackled players release the ball. This is still one of the most fundamental differences between Rugby Union and American Football but one further modification, that of allowing one forward pass per down, was suggested by the Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne which, when accepted in 1905, gave rise to that distinctly American form of football.\nAround the turn of the century American football was being frowned upon for its violence. Publication of graphic photographs of a harsh game between Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania caused a stir; President Theodore Roosevelt was forced to insist upon reform or abolition of the game. During this period of uncertainty, rugby made a brief but important reappearance in many colleges, most notably at the University of California and at Stanford. It was Stanford that supplied most of the players to the two US Olympic rugby teams (1920 and 1924), along with Santa Clara University and the University of California, who claimed fame by winning both gold medals. As 1924 was the last time the Olympic Games staged a rugby competition, this made the USA the defending Olympic champions when rugby was re-introduced after almost a century at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nIn 1934, there was only one official rugby body in the United States, the Eastern Rugby Union, with a total of 9 member teams. By 1950, there were 30 clubs in the US, existing only in small pockets on the East and West Coasts.\nIt was not until the mid-1960s that rugby began to re-appear with regular fixtures and competitions; the game suited the mildly anarchistic temperament of American College students of the period; it required minimal costs for the individual, the style of the game provided constant action, there was an emphasis on enjoyment rather than winning because rugby was not part of the now rigidly institutionalized athletic system that American Universities had developed. The formation of the United States of America Rugby Football Union (USARFU, now USA Rugby) in 1976 was a major organizational milestone for the sport in the US, and by 1980 there were over 1,000 clubs nationwide.\nIn 2011, there were 2,433 clubs in the United States with more than 88,000 registered players, approximately 40% of which are college players (about three-quarters being male and one quarter female).\nFormation of Division 1-A.\nPrior to the formation of Division 1-A, there had been some difficulty in determining how many teams each territory would send to the \"Sweet 16\" tournament, as the relative strengths of the rugby teams in each territory fluctuated over time, and despite the disparity in the levels of rugby, it was politically difficult to deny a union any playoff bids, even though the team that came third or fourth in a more powerful territory might be a better side. Further problems occurred because of the different competitive seasons across the continent; in the East the league season is played in the fall while in the South and West spring is the primary season, so this structure was frequently open to criticism.\nBecause of these issues, and to raise the level of rugby in the consciousness of the American public, USA Rugby restructured Division 1 college rugby. In 2010, several of the top college teams agreed to form the College Premier League to begin play in spring 2011. USA Rugby and the top colleges believed that an elite level college rugby competition would make it easier to get college rugby onto TV and attract sponsors. USA Rugby also believed that a higher level college competition would develop players to potentially play for the U.S. national team.\nThe governance of collegiate rugby was split and diverged in 2021. National Collegiate Rugby (NCR), formerly NSCRO, emerged as a rival by expanding beyond small colleges to include the higher divisions. The umbrella of the USA Rugby Collegiate Council includes College Rugby Association of America (CRAA), among several other organizations. In 2021, there were five men’s DIA conferences plus independents under USA Rugby/CRAA. Two men’s conferences that played DIA in 2019 joined NCR in 2021.\nD1-A Championships results.\nCollegiate Championship results prior to D1-A Formation.\nThe earliest claims to a national title go back to the mid-1960s when \"Sports Illustrated\" Magazine started demonstrating an interest in Collegiate rugby. During the 1965-1966 season, the University of Notre Dame won several cups and tournaments and, in the absence of a bona fide national championship, \"Sports Illustrated\" named them unofficial Collegiate Rugby Champions. The next year, under the authority of USARFU, Notre Dame played a match on April 8, 1967 against California at Memorial Stadium for the unofficial national championship, again as a result of both teams being highly rated by \"Sports Illustrated\"; Cal won 37-3.\nNational Invitational Championship\nThe first official National Collegiate Championship series began in 1980. Rugby in the United States is divided into territorial unions (the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, Pacific Coast, the South, Southern California, and the West). Each of these unions organized collegiate rugby into \"Division One\" and \"Division Two\" league competitions, generally with promotion and relegation between the divisions. Between 1980 and 2010 each Territory qualified Division One and Two teams for the \"Sweet 16\" of a D1 and D2 National championship.\nCalifornia was dominant in Division One for the 31 years that the competition was run in this format, winning 25 titles. Air Force won three titles; Harvard, San Diego State, and Brigham Young University each won one D1 national championship. \nParticipants.\nBelow is the list of Division 1A conference participants for the 2023–2024 season.\nRankings.\nNotes:\nSeasons.\n2011 season.\nRecords and final standings for 2011.\nx-Conference champion \ny-Qualified for playoffs \nGold = national champion \nSilver = national runner-up \nBronze = national semifinalists\n2012 season.\nRecords and final standings for 2012.\nx-Conference champion \ny-Qualified for playoffs\n2013 season.\nx = conference champion and automatic quarterfinal berth \ny = conference runner-up and eligible for playoffs \nz = conference champion and eligible for playoffs\n2015 season.\nFor the 2014–2015 school year, a number of conferences — particularly those in the colder northeast and upper midwest — played their regular seasons in the fall.\n2017 season.\nThe Varsity Cup folded in November 2017 when the organizer, broadcast partner and a major sponsor, Penn Mutual, withdrew their support.\nRudy Scholz Award Winners.\nThe Rudy Scholz award goes to the best male Division 1-A rugby player in the country.

Fourteen medal events were contested by 550 athletes, 353 men and 197 women.\nGreat Britain was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with four golds and nine in total. New Zealand finished second with three golds and five medals overall.\nVenue.\nAll of the rowing events were staged at the Eton Dorney Rowing Centre at Dorney Lake near Windsor Castle, west of London. The venue has eight lanes and is 2,200 m in length with a capacity of 30,000 spectators.\nQualification.\nEach competing nation may qualify one boat for each of the fourteen events. The majority of qualification places were awarded based on results at the 2011 World Championships, held at Lake Bled, Slovenia, in August and September. Places are awarded to National Olympic Committees, not the specific athletes, finishing in the top 11 of men's events and top seven to nine of women's events, except in the eights where the first seven in the men's event and first five in the women's qualified. Further berths were allocated at three continental qualifying regattas in Africa, Asia and Latin America and a final Olympic qualification regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland.\nEvents.\nThere were eight events for men and six for women. Events included categories for open weight and restricted weight (lightweight) athletes, and two styles of rowing: sweep, where competitors each use a single oar, and sculling, where they use two.\nSculling events include men's and women's singles, doubles, lightweight doubles, and quads. Sweep events are men's and women's pairs and eights, and men's fours and lightweight fours."

Listed at 5' 11\", 175 lb., Thompson was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nFollowing his graduation from Harding University High School, Thompson became the first African American born in Charlotte to join the Major Leagues. He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 1972 amateur draft, and played six years in the Rangers Minor league system before joining the big team on April 16, 1978.\nIn his only major league season, Thompson served as a reserve outfielder for Al Oliver, Juan Beníquez and Bobby Bonds, being also used in pinch-hitting and pinch-running duties while appearing in 64 games. He hit for a .225 average (27-for-120), including three doubles, three triples, two home runs and seven stolen bases, while driving in 12 runs and scoring 23 times. He played his last game on September 25. In a six-season minor league career, he hit .273 and 29 home runs in 520 games.\nThompson died at his residence in Charlotte at the age of 57."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1946–47",
        "text": "The 1946–47 Australians defeated the touring England team 3–0 in the 1946–47 Ashes series. First-class cricket had continued in Australia until January 1942 and as grade cricket had continued throughout the war there had been less of an hiatus than in England. Their cricket grounds had not been bombed and compared to austerity Britain, Australia was a land of plenty, which allowed for a more rapid recovery than in the old country, as had happened after the First World War. There was no Sheffield Shield in 1945–46, but the Australian Services XI had played all the states and there had been non-Shield interstate games. However, Australia's main advantage was the encouragement of their younger players, in particular by Bradman. Though overshadowed by the great 1948 Australian team, in 1975 Don Bradman reckoned that it was Australia's strongest post-war home team, with the 1974–75 Australians coming a close second and the 1950–51 Australians third. It was also superior to the pre-war Australian teams, as though they were just as strong in batting they had no fast bowlers and depended heavily on the leg-spin of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly. In 1946–47 Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller emerged as a great new-ball partnership, with quality support from Ernie Toshack, Ian Johnson and Colin McCool. The only area for improvement was in finding another top-order strokemaker, which was soon resolved by the arrival of Neil Harvey.\nThe captain.\nBatsman.\n\"He was not the most exciting and entertaining of batsmen, but was untouchable when it came to efficiency and all-round batting strength. He had self-confidence that was quite chilling and there was not a bowler he did not feel he could master. There was something of a \"Little Dictator\" about him at the wicket, and an indication of his legendary run-making skill is that it was considered a failure whenever he missed out on a century.\"\n\"Donald George Bradman\", better known as Don Bradman or The Don, was the greatest batsman of all time, ranked first in ESPN's Legends of Cricket and can be statistically regarded as the greatest sportsman of all, as \"no other athlete dominates an international sport to the extent that Bradman does cricket\". His unorthodox grip meant he could not cream the ball through the covers like Wally Hammond and purists contend that Jack Hobbs was better on a sticky wicket, but on any pitch that did not make batting a lottery he simply made more runs. He made them fast too, until the 1990s his 3.7 runs per six ball over in Tests was the fastest scoring rate of any batsmen except Gilbert Jessop (4.2). Even if his pre-war career was ignored his feats would make him the greatest batsman of all time; 680 runs (97.14) against England in 1946–47, 715 runs (178.75) against India in 1947–48 and 508 runs (72.57) in England in 1948, with 8 hundreds in his last 15 Tests. Ironically he was bowled by an Eric Hollies googly for a duck in his final Test innings when he was 4 runs short of a batting average of 100.00, he had to settle for 99.94.\nHealth.\n\"Don Bradman went into a huddle and refused to make any statement concerning his cricket future; it was not until this sagacious colossus had obtained first-hand reports from Perth, and had sampled the bowling at Adelaide and Melbourne then he told the Board of Control he would be available for the opening Test...Bradman is justifiably proud of his marvellous record, and one suggestion is that only consented to play because of his supreme confidence of being able to gather in his full share of runs, and that his health would stand up to any strain imposed on it.\"\nBradman volunteered for the RAAF in 1940, but transferred to the Australian Army as a lieutenant in the Army School of Physical Training. Stress and depression aggravated his fibrositis and he was invalided out of the army in 1941, after which he spent months in poor physical condition and lost the use of his right thumb and forefinger. He resumed stockbroking in 1942 and set up his own firm after his employer was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement. In 1945 he joined the South Australian Cricket Association and became their representative with the Board of Control and he seriously considered retiring from cricket in order to concentrate on an administrative role. He played a few games in 1945–46, but Richard Whittington thought he was \"the ghost of a once great cricketer\". The press and public badly wanted to see him play and after a few warm up matches Bradman agreed to captain Australia against the advice of his doctor. In the First Test he played poorly for 28 when he chopped a ball to Jack Ikin in gully. The England players (and Keith Miller from the dressing room) thought he was out, but Bradman was confident that the ball had been jammed into the ground by his bat before it flew up to Ikin and refused to walk. The umpire gave him the benefit of the doubt, but Wally Hammond told Bradman \"That's a fine way to start a Test series.\" Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and it was thought if Bradman had been given out he would have retired from cricket.\nAustralian captain.\n\"To Bradman, even in the first series after so many years of war and suffering, there was apparently no room for carefree cricket in an Anglo-Australian Test. He knew of only one way in which to play this game...In the 1946–47 Tests he was in charge of the stronger side, and for that reason seemed to overshadow Hammond, although he went on the field with an outlook that was vastly different to the Englishman. He appeared as determined in seeking convincing victory as if he had been opposed by a team of Jardines and Larwoods\"\nIn Don Bradman's time as an Australian batsman before the war England won 13 Ashes Tests to Australia's 10, some of them by huge margins. He made his debut in the First Test of 1928–29, making 18 and 1 as Australia were beaten by a record 675 runs. In their last Test before the war England had made 903/7 – Wally Hammond waiting the Don was unfit to bat before he declared – and Australia lost by an innings and 579 runs, another record. Bradman was not the man to forget such things and now he had the better team he was determined to repay the favour. The First Test of 1946–47 saw Australia win their largest victory over England by an innings and 332 runs, the first time that a Test team had lost and won successive Tests by an innings, albeit with a ten-year gap due to the war. As a captain Bradman had few rivals, tough, shrewd and rarely missing a trick. He liked to play aggressive cricket, racking up huge scores with his batting then bowling the opposition out. While fielding Bradman carefully watched batsmen play, and if he saw a weakness he would call over the bowlers to tell them and reset his field accordingly. In the First Test at Brisbane he even took Ernie Toshack down the pitch, showed him exactly where he wanted him to bowl and make him bowl a practice over alongside the pitch before play, after which the left-armer took 9 of the 15 English wickets to fall that day. He was often criticised for being distant and removed from his team and too conscious of his superiority, \"a star with ten extras\". However, he built the 1946–47 team from scratch, gave them encouragement, and made them Bradman-minded; \"When you get in front, nail 'em into the ground. When you get 'em down, never let up.\" By 1948 he had moulded them into one of the great teams in cricket history, nicknamed \"The Invincables\" [sic] as they won the 1948 Ashes series 4–0 and were undefeated on tour. He retired at the end of the 1948–49 season and is the only Australian to be knighted for his services to cricket.\nUnbeaten run.\n\"With typical resilience, Australian youth participated in the restoration of sport to pre-war grade, directly khaki and the blue uniforms were laid aside. every effort had been made by administrators to preserve the framework of competition during the years of strife, and in addition to the services games, club matches in all cities were played every Saturday...We are, perhaps, on the threshold of another Golden Age – but, as, yet, only on the threshold.\"\nAfter the Second World War Australia began a record unbeaten run of games; 14 Tests against England, 26 Tests against all countries and 96 games in all cricket, having lost their last game to England at the Oval in 1938. Their record remained until England played 27 Tests without defeat in 1968–71. \nBatting.\nOpening batsmen.\n\"It was common knowledge that Arthur Morris, after failing in the first two Tests, was in grave danger of being dropped, and Meuleman was his obvious successor. In the first innings Arthur made 21 and we all thought Ken's chances were sky high. Arthur scored 155 in the second innings and saved his place. Meuleman, twelfth man in the first two Tests...was instantly dropped. And he has never been asked to play since. If ever a man was thrown on the scrap heap it was Ken\".\nAustralia had three great openers in this period, Bill Brown, Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris. Brown had been an Australian batsman for most of the 1930s, coming in at number three after Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford or opening with Jack Fingleton. He captained Australia on their tour of New Zealand in 1945–46, which unlike other such tours had one of its matches belatedly recognised as a Test. Brown missed the 1946–47 series through injury so Barnes was promoted to open with Morris and soon established themselves as Australia's opening pair. When Brown recovered too he returned to batting at number three. Barnes played one Test before the war – at the Oval in 1938 – so hardly rates as a pre-war player even though he made his first class debut in 1936. He was a back-foot strokeplayer known for his off-side cuts and drives before the war, but so improved his on-side play that Alec Bedser changed his bowling grip so as to avoid bowling in-swingers at his legs. It is as an eccentric that he is best remembered, playing in Don Bradman's testimonial match using a miniature bat, serving drinks in a state match wearing a lounge suit instead of whites and leaping over the turnstiles at the MCG. In the Second Test in 1946–47 he threw away his wicket when he reached 234 so that he would make the same score as his captain. He was dropped from the Australian team because of his antics, and unsuccessfully took the case to court. Barnes made 846 runs (70.50) against England in the 1940s and his opening partner Arthur Morris 1,199 (79.93), but Morris' Test average suffered after facing the powerful England attacks of the 1950s. A stylish left-hander who uniquely made 148 and 111 on his first class debut in 1940–41 Morris had excellent footwork which made him a good player against spin, but was vulnerable to in-swinging balls aimed at his leg-stump. As a result, he was labelled \"Bedser's Bunny\" in 1950–51 until he made 206 in the Fourth Test. In 1946–47 he made three centuries in a row, 155 in the Third Test at Melbourne and 122 and 124 not out in the Fourth at Adelaide. Only Bradman made more than his 503 runs and in 1948 he made the most runs (696) and topped the averages (87.00), but as E.W. Swanton wrote \"what the figures do not say is that few more charming men have played for Australia, and I cannot name one who was more popular with his opponents\". Merv Harvey was a middle order strokeplayer who was called up to open with Morris when Sid Barnes was unfit to play in the Fourth Test. He made 12 and 31 and never played for Australia again, though his younger brother Neil became a famous Test batsman.\nTop order batsmen.\nAfter Don Bradman in the batting order was his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a dimulative (5'6\") batsman who had been a great strokemaker before the war and had made his Test debut in England in 1938. He captained the scratch Australian Services cricket team which drew the Victory Tests 2–2 against England in 1945. After the war he took his batting more seriously and was more defensive, though never dull, and he never failed in a series. He had an impish good humour, but this stopped when he walked onto the field and \"there is no better team man in Australia\". Keith Miller had been a young batsman before the war better known for playing Australian rules football in his native Victoria. In the war he was a Flight Lieutenant in the RAAF, and injured his back crash-landing a de Havilland Mosquito, which affected the rest of his playing career. He was the star of the Victory Tests, having decided that \"The people of England wanted an escape from the hellish suffering they had experienced for so many years. Those who turned up to watch cricket deserved something better than grim, unentertaining stonewalling, and I was determined to go for runs every time I went in to bat\". He hit a swashbuckling 185 in 165 minutes for the Dominion XI vs England at Lords with seven towering sixes and became a cricketing star. Miller kept to this philosophy throughout his career, becoming one of the world's most entertaining strokemakers and a magnet for the crowds. Although an all-rounder Miller saw himself as a batsman first and batted in the top order throughout his career, though it suffered as he was often spent from bowling. Ron Hamence was the nearly man of the Australian team, he made his Test debut after his career best 145 vs the MCC and was stranded on 30 not out in their first innings collapse to Doug Wright. He played India in 1947–48 and toured England in 1948, but played only two more Tests as he could not force his way into the strong Australian team.\nMiddle order batsmen.\nOne of the great strengths of the team was its plentiful all-rounders, apart from Keith Miller, there was Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and the wicketkeeper Don Tallon. Lindwall took to fast bowling after seeing Harold Larwood as a boy, but was a strong striker of the ball and a menace to parked cars in grade cricket. In the Third Test he hit exactly 100 off 90 balls with 14 fours and a six and added 154 in an hour and a half with Tallon, whose 92 off 108 balls with 10 fours was the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh made 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74. Like Tallon Ian Johnson never quite batted as well as expected, but topped the averages in the 1954-55 Ashes series by making 116 runs (58.00). McCool made 95 in the First Test and 104 not out in the Third, when he came in at 188/5 and dominated the strike. He was a good player of spin with wristy cuts and vigorous hooks.\nBowling.\nStrange as it may seem when the veteran leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly announced his retirement at the beginning of the season there were fears that Australia's untried bowlers would suffer against the much-vaulted England batting line up of Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton and Wally Hammond. The opposite became true as the English batsmen initially failed and Australia won the First and Second Tests by an innings.\nPace bowlers.\n\"Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall handsomely exemplified the axiom that great fast bowlers win matches. For a decade they were a magnificent bowling combination for Australia, and in the immediate post-war years they were devastating ... Lindwall and Miller took thirty-five wickets in that 1946/7 series and at last Australia had a winning combination. The havoc wrought by Larwood and company a decade earlier still rankled; the nation wanted genuine fast bowlers to repay the humiliation.\"\nAt the forefront of the bowling attack was Ray Lindwall, who became a fast bowler after watching Harold Larwood in 1932-33. His whose smooth run up and perfect delivery produced swing and control and bouncers at a lethal pace, though he dropped the ball short less than Miller. Neville Cardus later wrote that \"He has so many brains it's a wonder why he ever went in for fast bowling\" and working hand-in-glove with his captain Don Bradman he would think batsman out and catch them in carefully selected field-placings. A. P. Herbert was moved to poetry to describe his bowling action and Trevor Bailey wrote \"Watching him bowl was one of the most satisfying spectacles the game has ever produced\". Even so, his arm was thought to be too low (Frank Tyson thought him almost a round-arm bowler) and his long drag could have produced numerous no balls, though he was rarely called for this. His partner Keith Miller had been a batsman, but in the Victory Tests the Australian Services XI were short of bowlers and Hassett used Miller initially as a change bowler and then gave him the new ball. To everyone's surprise he picked up wickets and soon his strength and natural talent made him into a genuine fast bowler. Bradman knew Australia needed this more than another batsman and encouraged Miller to develop his new talent, though his back injury limited him to short spells. Unlike his new-ball partner Miller liked to drop the ball short and lacked consistency, sometimes bowling leg-breaks or off-spin. Bill O'Reilly wrote \"The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone\". Together they formed the best fast bowling duo in post-war cricket, perhaps the greatest of any era, and were the spearhead of Australia's success. Ernie Toshack was a left-arm medium pace bowler who bowled with a packed leg-side field and tied up the batsmen when Lindwall and Miller were resting. In the First Test he had the perfect pace to unhinge the English batting on a Brisbane sticky, but failed to understand Bradman's instructions. In the end Bradman took him to the middle, pointed to the spot where he wanted Toshack to bowl, and made him practice alongside the wicket until he understood what was required. Once this was done 9 of the last 15 wickets fell to his bowling and Australia won by an innings. Fred Freer was a steady fast-medium swing bowler who liked to drop the ball short and replaced Ray Lindwall in the Second Test when the fast bowler had chickenpox.\nSpin bowlers.\n\"The game was all but decided in an evil hour Hutton, Compton and Hammond himself – the flower of England's batting – went one by one to the high, slow, teasing spin of Colin McCool and Ian Johnson, each giving the ball more and more air as though trying to discover whether there was any parabola they could not describe without impelling the forward step that would have allowed the ball to be met on the full-pitch or the half-volley.\"\nThe England captain Wally Hammond ordered his batsmen to stay within their crease when facing the Australian spinners, whose figures were flattered as a result. In the Second Test Ian Johnson took 6/42 off 241 balls with his off-spin, including one spell of 1/3 off 88 balls, of which 85 were not scored from. Johnson's off spin was a rarity in Australia, where the pitches work better to leg-spin, and was not a big spinner of the ball, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and could tie down one end. Colin McCool was \"a better fieldsman than a batsman, and a better batsman than he was a bowler\" But before the MCC team had even landed in Australia he snapped up 35 wickets (28.82) with his flighty leg-spin for Queensland with help from Don Tallon behind the stumps. He dismissed Hammond, Hutton, Washbrook, Compton, Yardley, Edrich and Voce in his 7/106 for an Australian XI against the MCC, 5/109 in the Third Test and 5/44 in the Fifth and \"the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated in the presence of a snake\". Bruce Dooland was another leg-spinner who was brought into the South Australia side after one club match in 1945. He was not overawed and soon earned a place on the tour of New Zealand. He was not as deadly as McCool and by the end of the tour he suffered as the England batsman became used to his flighted leg-breaks. George Tribe was a rare specialist slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler who took more first class wickets than any other Australian bowler in 1945–46 and 1946–47. He suffered from uneven form, taking 6/49 for Victoria vs the MCC, but costly in the Tests.\nFielding.\n\"Hawk-eyed, swift in action after sure reception, Tallon goes for everything...many of his deeds he has accomplished have been remarkable for sheer speed of thought and execution and his only fault in his early matches was impetuous appealing.\"\nDon Tallon first appeared as a wicket-keeper in 1933 and was a shock exclusion for the Ashes tour in 1938. In 1939 he equalled Ted Pooley's record by dismissing 12 batsman in a first class match and another when he held 7 catches in another match. He was 30 when he made his Test debut and proved to be an excellent keeper, but in his eagerness would move in front of the slips, denying them the full view of the ball. Tallon was also \"one of the most notorious appealers of all time\" and \"was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision which so greatly affected Washbrook\". Tallon had scooped up a ball from the ground which the batsmen and other observers thought touched the ground, but having made the appeal Bradman backed Tallon and Washbrook was given out. However he improved on his performances and Bill O'Reilly wrote \"I have never seen a better keeper than Tallon as he was in England in 1948. Otherwise Australia had a fine fielding team which was younger and quicker than their English opponents. Bradman himself has been a good mid-fielder, but was probably restricted by fibrositis and was unable to field in the Second Test due to a pulled leg muscle. Keith Miller \"was a captain's dream, because he is alert, sure and fast in no matter what position he is placed\". Ian Johnson and Colin McCool were noted slip fielders and Sid Barnes was a good catcher close to the wicket at short-leg.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\""

As decided by WAKO's world congress in Munich 1987, international championship are to be split up into two events and locations to accommodate fighters for newly added Light-Contact and later Low-Kick. Therefore, European championships for Full-Contact kickboxing and Forms took place at a separate event in Trogir, Yugoslavia. Each country was allowed one competitor per weight class per category. By the end of the event, hosts Italy were the top nation across all categories, with Great Britain second and regular European leaders West Germany in the third. It was held at the Palasport Taliercio in Mestre, Italy in 1988.\nSemi-Contact.\nBoth men and women took part in Semi-Contact competitions in Mestre. Semi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1988. At Mestre the men had seven weight classes, starting at 57 kg/125.4 lbs and ending at over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, while the women's competition had four weight classes beginning at 50 kg/110 lbs and ending at over 60 kg/132 lbs. By the end of the championships, host nation Italy were the top country in Semi-Contact with six golds, one silver and one bronze medal.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact made its W.A.K.O. championships debut in Mestre. It involved more physicality than Semi-Contact but less so than Full-Contact, with emphasis put on speed, skill and technique over power. It was also seen as a stepping stone for fighters who were looking to make the transaction from Semi to Full-Contact.

He was a left-handed pitcher whose professional career lasted for four seasons (1962–1965), including major league stints with the and New York Mets. While Dillon appeared in only three major league games during his career, all in relief, he pitched in the first-ever night game played at Shea Stadium on May 6, 1964.\nListed at tall and , Dillon initially signed with the New York Yankees and turned in a stellar 14–7 won–lost record for the 1962 Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Class D Florida State League, striking out 196 batters in 169 innings pitched, with a 2.61 earned run average. He was selected by the Mets in the first-year player draft after that season and spent 1963 with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He made his Met debut on Thursday, September 5, in a 9–0 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. Relieving Roger Craig in the sixth inning, he lasted 1⅔ frames and gave up three hits and two earned runs (on a triple by Tim McCarver), with one strikeout.\nHe made the Mets' 28-man roster out of spring training in 1964, and hurled an inning of relief on April 24 at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field before being called into the first game played under the lights at the Mets' new ballpark, Shea Stadium, on Wednesday, May 6. He was the Mets' fifth and final pitcher that evening in a 12–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Dillon got the Reds out in order in the eighth inning, but in the ninth, he gave up a leadoff home run to Vada Pinson and a single to Leo Cárdenas that scored a run. Pinson's blast hit the right-center field scoreboard at the new park. When Dillon reached the dugout, legendary Mets' manager Casey Stengel told him, \"Listen, if another player hits a home run off that scoreboard and breaks it, you're paying for it.\" It was Dillon's last big league game; he returned to minor league baseball when the rosters were reduced to 25 men in May.\nDillon retired from baseball because of low minor league wages. His major league totals included seven hits and five earned runs allowed in 4⅔ innings pitched, with three strikeouts. Dillon became a salesman, then a New York City police officer for over twenty years. As of 2009, he was living in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, on Long Island. Steve pitched in the Mets Old Timers game at Citi Field on August 27, 2022."

The majority of the race was situated entirely within Italy – only the end of stage 13 and beginning of stage 14, in Austria, featured roads outside the home nation.\nAlberto Contador entered the second half of the Giro holding the race lead, and never relinquished it. Instead, he continually added to his advantage. After no stage was second place closer to him than it had been the day before. The largest chunk of time taken in one day came in stage 13, the first of three high-mountain stages that preceded the Giro's second rest day. Contador and José Rujano finished over a minute and a half ahead of the rest of the field. Contador essentially gifted the stage win to Rujano, something he also did later in the race with his former teammate Paolo Tiralongo, since the three-minute overall advantage it gave him was already close to the largest he had ever had in a Grand Tour. He did take one stage win for himself in the second half of the Giro, the uphill individual time trial to the Nevegal.\nTwo stages in the second half of the Giro had their courses altered shortly before they were run. Stage 14 had been hyped as the debut of the Monte Crostis in the Giro d'Italia, but commissaries from the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) mandated it be removed the night before Stage 14 was run. The Giro's last stage, an individual time trial in Milan, was also shortened. Stage 15 was perhaps the queen stage, containing five high-rated climbs, including the \"Cima Coppi\" (the race's tallest climb) at the Passo Giau.\nIn the end, Contador won the Giro by over six minutes against Michele Scarponi, and also won the points classification. Roman Kreuziger and Stefano Garzelli won the other jersey awards.\nStage 12.\nThis was the last flat stage, and as such was seen as likely to be the last stage in which the Giro's sprinters would take the start.\nOn easily the most straightforward day of racing at this year's Giro, four relatively unaccomplished riders formed the morning breakaway early in the race. Stef Clement, Michał Gołaś, Miguel Minguez, and Davide Ricci Bitti had just seven professional victories among them, all of them Clement's. Their time gap over the peloton was never more than four minutes, since the sprinters' teams, mainly , were vigilant not to let the prime opportunity go to waste. The catch was as controlled as the time gap had been for the stage, occurring with to go. drove the peloton into the final kilometers to set up their sprinter Mark Cavendish, effectively staying at the front of the field all day. With to go, a crash occurred about 15 riders deep in the peloton. 's sprinter Robbie Hunter lost the front wheel on his bicycle and bickered with rider Sacha Modolo who had crashed near him, even though an rider had caused the crash. While only a little more than a dozen riders actually finished together, everyone who was in the front group at the time of the crash was given the same time at the end of the stage since it took place within the stage's final . executed a very strong leadout, with Lars Bak driving from to go before pulling off for Alex Rasmussen to do the same until a little about to go. At that point, Cavendish's favored leadout man Mark Renshaw took over, leaving the Manx sprint ace to launch from to go. The sprint was tight at the finish, with 's Davide Appollonio neck-and-neck with Cavendish, but the man paid off his team's efforts by taking his second win of the Giro, making them the only team to this point to win two mass-start stages. Points leader Alessandro Petacchi was third.\nStage 13.\nThis was the first of three consecutive high mountain stages before the second rest day. This was the second time the Giro finished at Grossglockner, the first being 40 years prior. However, this time the race did not go to its summit, instead climbing to an elevation of . The climb was long and averaged more than 6% gradient, with hardest sections at 14%, though the easiest part of the climb occurred right at the finish.\nSeveral sprinters and leadout men pulled out of the Giro before this stage was run, and several more failed to complete it. A total of ten riders left the race, chief among them stage winners Mark Cavendish, Francisco Ventoso, and points leader Alessandro Petacchi. The points classification lead transferred to overall race leader Alberto Contador, with second-placed Roberto Ferrari wearing the red jersey during this stage. The race began with a flurry of attacks and counter-attacks, resulting in none going clear for quite a while. Finally, into the stage, 16 riders from 15 teams came free. was the squad to place two riders, having both Pablo Lastras and Branislau Samoilau in the group. Lastras was the best-placed rider in the group, 28th overall at just under seven minutes back of Contador. The chase was taken up not by Contador's squad but by , indicating perhaps that their leader Igor Antón was targeting the stage win.\nSamoilau won the first two climbs on the course, and as such was the leader of the mountains classification pending the conclusion of the stage. As the breakaway neared the top of the third climb, still a good from the finish of the stage, Robert Kišerlovski set out on the attack alone. After a short while, he attained a two-minute time gap over the rest of the morning escapees. The main field, rapidly dwindling to a select group of overall contenders and their support riders, began reabsorbing the members of the morning breakaway as the Grossglockner ascent began. Two riders from the breakaway, Cayetano Sarmiento and former race leader Pieter Weening made it to the front of the race and displaced Kiserlovski as the first man on the road with about to go. Mere minutes later, the group of overall contenders made it to the front of the race. Michele Scarponi and Igor Antón were the first riders on the attack up the Austrian peak, but neither got away. Contador then rode clear, but it was not an explosive attack like he had put in on the stage that ended at Mount Etna, rather a slow, grinding move. The only rider to have an answer was José Rujano. Again unlike the Etna stage, where Rujano struggled mightily simply to hold Contador's wheel, the two were able to work cohesively for the final of the stage and build a substantial time gap over the remainder of the field. Rujano, having lost five minutes during stage 5 earlier in the race, was an ideal ally for Contador in that had climbing prowess but was not an overall threat. The two approached the finish with the other overall contenders still a full away. Contador did not contest a sprint for the line, content to have Rujano win the stage. From behind them, the tandem of John Gadret and Hubert Dupont both rode away from the other overall contenders who Contador and Rujano left behind. Gadret crossed the line third, almost a full minute and a half down on Contador and Rujano but, with actual time and time bonus, 17 seconds better than the others.\nContador's lead in the overall standings surpassed three minutes with his gains on this stage. He was also awarded all three jerseys for which he was eligible, the pink for the general classification, the green for the mountains classification, and the red for the points classification. Due to greater losses by Kanstantsin Sivtsov and Christophe Le Mével, Vincenzo Nibali and Michele Scarponi were able to move into the top three overall, but at a significant gap to Contador.\nStage 14.\nAs the course was originally designed, this was perhaps the Giro's single most difficult stage. The stage ends at Monte Zoncolan, visited for the fourth time in the past eight years and second year in a row. The Zoncolan is not especially tall, but it is absurdly steep, averaging a 12% gradient with sections as high as 22%. Originally, it was but the final challenge on the course as the first-category Monte Crostis, a new climb which was to be used for the first time in this year's Giro, crests from the finish. The Crostis is nearly as steep as the Zoncolan, and is taller, with its summit at . Even before the Crostis were a second-category climb and two third-category climbs, leaving hardly a single kilometer of flat racing in this stage. Giro favorite Alberto Contador reconned both the Crostis and the Zoncolan climbs in the weeks before the Giro, saying that he liked the Zoncolan, but that he was afraid of the Crostis.\nOn the night before this stage was to be run, UCI commissaires ordered the Monte Crostis be removed from the race route. There had been talk of a rider protest on the basis of the extremely steep and poorly maintained roads the race was to go down, instigated somewhat after the death of Wouter Weylandt earlier in the race, but the UCI's decision was not on the basis of safety. Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol wherein team cars would not follow the race up or down the Crostis, and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders. Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal, and this was given as the basis of the UCI's decision. They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course, but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race. Thus, the Crostis was eliminated, and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of . The resultant course was still quite hilly, and the second-category Tualis climb was added to the route for the day to offset the loss of the Crostis. However, protests from spectators disappointed by the removal of the Crostis part of the route, including many who had volunteered for works to make parts of that road safe, lead to the cancellation of the Tualis climb. The route was diverted while the stage was in progress to avoid a small village at the foot of the Tualis where protesters had gathered. Therefore, the exact distance of this stage is unknown. Race director Angelo Zomegnan had earlier insisted that the Crostis would stay in the race, but he was obligated to accept the overruling decision of cycling's governing body. Reportedly, five teams, including , , and were willing to ride over and down the Crostis, but the other 17 were against it. Riders were satisfied that safety had been assured, but concurred that the sporting aspect of the race was not fairly served by only allowing a motorbike per team up the mountain. Zomegnan appeared on Italian television shortly before the stage was run and had scathing words for the teams and managers who had apparently approved the climb in October 2010 and again in March, in advance of the Giro, but lobbied for its removal at the last moment.\nWith leading the peloton at a relatively easy pace over the first two climbs on the course, the day's breakaway gained a lead over 10 minutes at one point. None of them – Matteo Rabottini, Bram Tankink, or Gianluca Brambilla – had particularly good climbing ability, meaning the peloton could afford to give them a large time gap. As the peloton approached the Zoncolan, Vincenzo Nibali had his teammates take to the front of the main field to quicken the pace and try to make the race selective. The time gap fell much more quickly in that time than it had when was leading the field. The breakaway still had four and a half minutes with remaining. Ordinarily, this would be enough time to assure that the day's winner would come from the lead group, but the incredibly steep pitches of the Zoncolan meant this was unlikely even with such a large time gap and little road remaining.\nNo cars followed the race up the Zoncolan due to the risk that they would stall on the mountain and obstruct the riders. With to go, Brambilla attacked from the leading group and got free to be the sole leader on the road. At the same time, Joaquim Rodríguez did the same out of the trailing group. Igor Antón and race leader Alberto Contador soon followed, and overtook Rodríguez. Michele Scarponi followed their wheels as they rode to the front of the race, easily passing up the three breakaway riders. Antón put in his own attack and succeeded in getting free, and Contador and Scarponi were subsequently able to drop Rodríguez back to the trailing group containing Nibali, Roman Kreuziger, and Denis Menchov. Nibali was eventually bridge up to Contador, and in trying to ride away from him he established himself and Contador as the second group on the road, behind Antón and ahead of Scarponi, Menchov, and John Gadret, as Kreuziger faded (eventually finishing 16th). Antón's lead was only a few seconds for most of the climb, but he stayed out front all the way to the finish line to claim the stage victory. Nibali motioned several times for Contador to take a pull at the front of their group, but the Spaniard refused. He eventually attacked Nibali near the finish line, taking second on the day seven seconds ahead of the Italian. Nibali complained after the stage that Contador's tactics were disrespectful, and revealed that he had not intended to aggressively descend the Monte Crostis should it have been raced. Contador added 11 seconds to his lead over second-placed Nibali, and Antón rose to third in the overall classification, just a single second behind Nibali. The ride achieved Antón's stated goal of a stage win, and he mused after the stage that he may try to hold onto his podium position.\nStage 15.\nThe course for the last stage prior to the second rest day was again crushingly difficult, featuring five climbs. There were three first-category climbs, one second-category climb, and the \"Cima Coppi\" climb (the name given to the highest point in the race) of the Passo Giau. Each of the four climbs prior to the summit finish featured a lengthy descent, meaning that this stage contained the most vertical climbing of any in the race. The final climb to Val di Fassa features maximum gradients of 16%.\nThe stage began with a group of seven coming clear of the peloton. This group included Yaroslav Popovych, who had made several breaks earlier in the race and therefore led the \"Trofeo Fuga Pinarello\" classification for most kilometers spent in a breakaway of ten riders or fewer. They, however, were not to stay away as the day's principal break, being brought back after had been raced. Eleven riders counter-attacked when the first seven were brought back. This group included former Giro winners Danilo Di Luca and Stefano Garzelli, former Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre, and former leader of this race Pieter Weening. Their advantage over the main field quickly extended to nearly ten minutes while on the slopes of the day's second climb, the Passo Cibiana. took the pace at the front end of the peloton to try to set up their leader Vincenzo Nibali.\nJohnny Hoogerland was the first rider to attack out of the breakaway to try to claim the \"Cima Coppi\", and the cash prize to go with it. He attained a lead of over a minute, but Garzelli and Mikel Nieve formed a cohesive chase behind him and passed him up after a while. Garzelli went solo ahead of the Basque to claim the Passo Giau by a margin of 45 seconds. Hoogerland followed at 1'25\", with the remainder of the breakaway next at 1'44\". From the peloton behind, Joaquim Rodríguez and David Arroyo put in attacks that led to a selection among the race's top rider. Those two along with Michele Scarponi, Igor Antón, Denis Menchov, Roman Kreuziger, race leader Alberto Contador, and Nibali coalescing as the fourth group on the road. Nibali chose to aggressively descend the Passo Giau, nearly bridging up to Nieve. He later commented that this intensive dig was in effort to win the stage and not necessarily to distance Contador. Contador himself also put in an attack, on the Passo Fedaia which followed the Passo Giau, but neither was destined to stay away for long. Nibali in particular paid for his efforts, being gapped off from Contador's group. He chased back on once, but was unable to keep Contador's pace to the finish, losing a further minute and a half to the Spaniard at day's end.\nGarzelli was also first over the Passo Fedaia, giving him maximum mountains points on three of the day's climbs. He held an advantage of six minutes over Nieve as the Gardeccia climb began, but he was spent from his efforts and was passed up by Nieve with to go. Nieve continuously built his advantage as the grueling final climb wore on, winning the stage by nearly two minutes over Garzelli, who narrowly held on for second against a fast-charging Contador. Garzelli took over leadership in the mountains classification with the day's results, with a commanding 23-point lead over Nieve. For his part, Nieve's ride propelled him into fifth in the overall classification. Contador further padded his already sizeable lead, now holding over four minutes against Scarponi with no other rider inside five minutes.\nStage 16.\nThis was another climbing time trial, similar to the stages in the 2008 and 2010 editions of the Giro which featured a race against the clock ending at the Plan de Corones. Nevegal is perhaps an easier climb than Plan de Corones, but still averages 10% gradient with its hardest section, from the top, reaching 14%.\nBefore the time trial began, a moment of silence was observed for Xavier Tondó, a rider who was killed in a freak accident at his home the day prior. Riders and team staff held a meeting at their hotel shortly after hearing the news, to discuss whether they would continue in the race. The riders unanimously voted to ride on.\nMost riders used normal road bikes for this stage – very few even added the clip-on aerodynamic handlebars, which are normally standard equipment in a time trial. The first competitive time up the mountain came from 's Stef Clement, a time trial specialist. While the Nevegal climb was undoubtedly the main feature of this time trial course, it also contained a flat section at the very beginning, and a mostly flat final , meaning riders best suited for time trialing would have a chance to be competitive with pure climbers. Clement was the 41st of 165 riders to take the start, and his time held as best until Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau finished his ride about an hour later, taking 34 seconds out of the Dutchman as the first rider on the day under 30 minutes. Samoilau was visibly overcome with emotion when being interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Shortly after, Samoilau came the top riders in the race. Mountains leader Stefano Garzelli was the next rider to post a provisional best time, coming home 13 seconds faster than Samoilau. It seemed for a while that Garzelli's time might hold up as best, since riders like Roman Kreuziger, Denis Menchov, and Joaquim Rodríguez came close but did not knock off the 2000 Giro winner. José Rujano did eventually best Garzelli, by seven seconds.\nThe last three men on the course were the top three men in the overall standings. Third-placed Vincenzo Nibali posted the best time at the intermediate time check, but since this time check came at and before the road went uphill, this was not necessarily indicative of his form and standing. Race leader Alberto Contador was 13th at the first time check, 13 seconds back. Nibali posted the day's best time when he crossed the finish line, five seconds better than Rujano. Second place man Michele Scarponi came very close to displacing Nibali, but was the worse of him by a single second. Nibali commented after the stage that his main ambition for the remainder of the Giro was to reclaim second place from Scarponi, essentially giving up on winning the race overall in the face of Contador's all but insurmountable advantage. Contador, per his usual riding style, rode the climb with a much higher cadence and lower gear than the other top riders in the field. He was the only rider on the day to finish within 29 minutes, stopping the clock 34 seconds faster than Nibali for a second dominant stage win in this Giro. Most of the other time gaps were close – Contador's advantage over second place was the second-biggest difference between two consecutive riders in the standings (the largest was the last and second-to-last riders, separated by 58 seconds). While no time bonuses were awarded in this stage, Contador nonetheless increased his lead yet again, now holding almost five minutes over second place. Contador's ride was not without a touch of controversy. His personal mechanic Faustino Muñoz was expelled from the race for opening the door of the car he was riding in, behind Contador, to swat at a fan he thought he was going to push Contador off his bicycle. Muñoz was barred from attending any of the further stages, though he was permitted to stay with the team and work on Contador's bicycle before and after the stages. Contador downplayed reports of the Italian fans being harsh with him, saying he had \"no problem with the tifosi.\" Contador immediately dedicated his win to Tondó on the podium after the stage. He, like many riders, had worn a black armband to memorialize Tondó.\nStage 17.\nTwo frequently-used Giro climbs featured in this course, the Passo del Tonale and the Aprica. The finish, however, came on the descent from the Aprica with a flat final , so pre-race analysis found it unlikely that the overall favorites would be a factor on this stage. This stage was originally designed to be longer and end at Sondrio, but safety concerns led to the alterations in the course.\nAfter over an hour of racing, ridden at a fast speed of , 15 riders from 13 teams came clear of the peloton. and were both able to place two riders in the group. After a chase, 's Hubert Dupont made the bridge, to make for a 16-man leading group. The group contained some riders who could conceivably threaten top-ten placings, as 12th-placed Kanstantsin Sivtsov, 15th-placed Dupont, and 16th-placed Christophe Le Mével were all up the road. This meant that race leader Alberto Contador's team could afford to pace the peloton gently, as they had nothing to lose were they to allow this group several minutes but other teams might. As such, the squad came to the front end of the main field to take up the chase when the group's advantage was such that Sivtsov was in position to displace their leader Vincenzo Nibali from third place. When they successfully lowered the time gap to the point where Nibali's position was no longer in jeopardy, they gave way to and , working similarly to protect the high overall positions held by Denis Menchov and Mikel Nieve. These teams' efforts were not as successful, as Sivtsov's eventual tenth place on the day moved him up to fifth in the overall classification.\nThe hilly parcours made for attrition in the leading group, as seven eventually came free of the sixteen, and later four broke free of the seven. The main field only caught two riders from the initial group of 16, as Luca Mazzanti was the first over the line from the peloton for 15th. The four riders who remained at the front of the race to the finish were Diego Ulissi, Giovanni Visconti, Jan Bakelants, and Pablo Lastras. Bakelants had tried to solo to the finish line from out, but the other three held his wheel. Ulissi originally opened his sprint a full from the line, but when Bakelants covered his move he sat up and let the Belgian lead out the sprint. He launched again from out, at which point Bakelants sat up and faded to fourth. Visconti tried to take the line to Ulissi's left, even though Ulissi was already quite near the barricades and there was not very much room there. Ulissi then deviated from his line slightly and moved even closer to the barricades. Visconti was visibly enraged and twice took his right hand off the handlebars to shove Ulissi. Both Italians sat up just before the finish line, but Lastras was unable to come around them. Visconti crossed the finish line first, and was still shouting and gesticulating at Ulissi after the finish. Shortly after the stage, race officials stripped him of his apparent stage win and relegated him to the last position in his group, third, for irregular sprinting. The victory instead went to Ulissi, who had crossed the line second.\nThe two riders involved in the controversial finish later shook hands after an intense face-to-face meeting on Italian television. Visconti adamantly claimed he had done nothing wrong, and that he had shoved Ulissi to keep himself from crashing. He stated that he believed himself winner of the stage despite what the official results said, since he was strongest and fastest. He asserted that Ulissi had specifically maneuvered him to the barricades because he knew that Visconti was the faster finisher, and that Ulissi had not done his equal share of work in the breakaway. Visconti's director Luca Scinto admitted that he agreed with the decision to relegate his rider, but he felt that Ulissi also should have been relegated and the stage victory awarded to Lastras. Ulissi did not deny that he had not taken as many pulls as other riders in the breakaway, or that he had used tactics in the sprint, but he claimed that more than half of the breakaway were lax on taking pulls and that he had simply done what he needed to do to win the stage. Other than Sivtsov's leap back into the top ten, there were no changes to the top of the overall standings, since the top riders all finished together three minutes behind the leading trio.\nStage 18.\nThis stage was mostly flat, but about from the finish, the second-category Passo di Ganda crested. The finish came after a nearly long descent from the height reached on the Ganda, and a brief flat section.\nWith the last two road race stages featuring summit finishes, this was likely to be the last chance at a stage win for opportunistic breakaway riders. As such, there were a great number of attacks and counter-attacks in the first hour of racing, which covered . Even well into the second hour of the stage, no group could distinguish itself off the front of the main field. Finally, after had been covered, 's Philip Deignan instigated a move on the Bergamo Alta, a steep cobbled climb that once featured in the Giro di Lombardia. He took with him ten riders from nine teams ( placed both Jérôme Pineau and Kevin Seeldraeyers in the group). Race leader Alberto Contador's squad did not come to the front of the main field after these riders slipped away, content to let one of them be the stage victor. As they had in the previous stage, and did most of the work at the head of the peloton.\n rode to hinder the chase rather than help it, since their rider Eros Capecchi had made the breakaway and was in fact proving himself to be one of the strongest riders on the day. He drove the escape group up the Passo di Ganda, and succeeded in whittling the leading group down to three – Capecchi himself, Seeldraeyers, and former race leader Marco Pinotti. The three worked cohesively to build a time gap, with Capecchi taking the most pulls, until there were only left to race. At this point it was clear that one of them would be the stage winner, so there was no need for further cooperation. Since none of the three of them had any sprinting abilities of note, tactics were to play a key role in the finale. Pinotti led out from just past the red kite indicating to go, with Seeldraeyers in second position and Capecchi third, coming close to losing the Belgian's wheel. The young Italian was able to take the optimal line on the final left-hand turn, with to go, to claim first position long enough to cross the line first ahead of Pinotti and then Seeldraeyers.\nAfter the stage, Capecchi dedicated the victory to his late grandfather and cousin. He said the Giro so far had been a disappointment for him since he had not been able to help Vincenzo Nibali very much, and since he had missed out on wearing the white jersey for the best young rider competition. A seven-year pro despite being only 24 years old, Capecchi also took the occasion to outline further goals for his career, up to and including overall victory in a Grand Tour. Pinotti, for his part, was crushed to miss the stage win. He had specifically targeted this stage, since it ended near his childhood home. He correctly anticipated that the race would split on the Bergamo Alta, and found the winning breakaway, but did not have the closing speed to hold off Capecchi. He turned his attentions to the forthcoming stage 21 time trial. There was no change to the top of the overall standings after this stage, as all the top riders finished together again.\nStage 19.\nThis was categorized as a high mountain stage and involved a summit finish at Macugnaga. Since a far more difficult stage followed, pre-race analysis led to the expectation that the race's overall favorites would mostly mark one another on this stage and not show themselves strongly. Parts of 11 different Italian provinces were covered by the course for this stage.\nJust like the previous day, a very combative first hour of racing resulted in no breakaway group establishing itself early on. After , Jérôme Pineau, Matteo Rabottini, and Lars Bak, all of whom had previously found breakaways, were able to come clear. Heading toward the first climb of the day, the first-category Mottarone, took control of the peloton, setting up their captain Stefano Garzelli for an attack on the climb. He took maximum points from the peloton to increase his lead in the mountains classification against overall leader Alberto Contador to a fairly substantial 11 points. He made it to the leading trio on the descent, as did Johann Tschopp and Mikaël Cherel who followed his acceleration. On approach to the second climb, Macugnaga, began pulling at the front of the main field, to try to set up their leader Joaquim Rodríguez. A big crash happened just after the Russian team took control of the race, resulting in 's Craig Lewis and Marco Pinotti both needing to leave the race. Lewis struck a traffic sign and had a fractured femur, while Pinotti was treated for a knee injury and a suspected broken collarbone.\n's efforts succeeded in bringing back the breakaway riders. After strenuous pulls from Danilo Di Luca, the group of overall favorites occupied first position on the road with remaining. rider Paolo Tiralongo, Roman Kreuziger's top support rider in this Giro, attacked out of this group with remaining to the finish, all of it uphill. Hubert Dupont then launched with to, drawing Rodríguez with him. In short order, Rodríguez sped past Dupont, leaving himself second on the road behind Tiralongo. With to go, Contador came out of the trailing group and easily sped past both Rodríguez and Tiralongo. However, upon reaching Tiralongo, he effectively led him out to sprint for the finish. The two shared a few words in the stage's final meters, and for the second time Contador appeared to allow another rider a stage win he could have easily taken himself. Contador said after the stage that he wanted to give the stage victory to Tiralongo as a gesture of thanks for all the riding the Italian did for him when he was with Astana the season prior. He said that he considers Tiralongo a good friend, and hopes that will sign him once his contract with Astana expires, after the 2011 season. Tiralongo echoed many of these sentiments, recalling that he had spent less time with his family at home than with Contador and Alexander Vinokourov during the 2010 season. He also revealed that Contador had been the one to encourage him to attack for victory. It was the first race win in Tiralongo's 12-year career. While Vincenzo Nibali's third place time gap and time bonus moved him 13 seconds closer to Michele Scarponi in the overall standings, the biggest change in the overall standings was due to José Rujano finishing a distant 23rd on the day, 2'20\" back of Tiralongo and Contador. He dropped to tenth overall.\nStage 20.\nThe course for the final road race stage was flat for the first , but it was at that point that the first-category Colle delle Finestre began. This climb is long, has some unpaved sections, and reaches in height. After a descent, the somewhat easier second-category ascent of Sestriere was the race's final climb. Sestriere first featured in the Giro in 1911, making this its 100th anniversary in the race.\nA group of 13 riders, each representing a different team, broke away from the peloton almost immediately after the beginning of this stage. They quickly attained an advantage of over 11 minutes, since no GC threat was posed – Vasil Kiryienka, starting the day over an hour down on race leader Alberto Contador, was the highest-placed man in the group. took the pace in the main field when the break's time gap reached its highest point, trying to make the race hard for Michele Scarponi and the other riders near their leader Vincenzo Nibali in the overall standings. An attack by José Rujano out the front of this group effectively reduced it to just 30 riders. On the ascent of the Colle delle Finestre, Kiryienka attacked and easily got clear of his breakaway companions, none of whom had any real climbing prowess. He crested the Finestre with an advantage of over four minutes on the pink jersey group. As that group neared the top, at a point with many switchback turns, Rujano again attacked and got clear. He stayed clear to the finish, moving up from tenth overall to sixth with his ride on the day. The efforts to chase him down resulted in Nibali getting gapped off the back of the group. He was able to chase back onto the group on the descent of the Finestre, but again lost pace on the ascent of Sestriere, finishing 22 seconds behind Scarponi's group and losing any real chance of overtaking him for second place. The only remaining stage was the individual time trial, and though Nibali is the better time trialist of the two, he was unlikely to take 56 seconds out of Scarponi, which was his deficit to his fellow Italian.\nJoaquim Rodríguez and Steven Kruijswijk, trying to enter the top five and top ten overall respectively, attacked on the way up Sestriere. Rodríguez' was much more successful, as he finished more than a minute ahead of the other elite riders and moved up to fifth overall with the result. Kruijswijk took 18 seconds out of Roman Kreuziger for the best young rider competition, but with over two minutes still in hand the Czech rider was all but assured of winning the jersey at the Giro's conclusion. The young Dutchman did, however, enter the top ten, at the expense of Kanstantsin Sivtsov, who lost three and a half minutes to the race's elite riders and fell to 11th place overall. Mikel Nieve also lost considerable time in 17th on the day, falling from sixth to tenth.\nWith the race among themselves the primary concern, the top overall riders never made any serious inroads into Kiryienka's advantage. They surpassed every other member of the morning breakaway other than 's Carlos Betancur, but the Belarusian at the front of the race actually continued to add to his advantage as the Sestriere climb wore on. He was first at the finish by nearly five minutes over Rujano in second. Knowing he had the stage won by a considerable margin, Kiryienka slowed in the final meters to straighten out his jersey to more clearly show his team's sponsor's logo. As he crossed the finish line, he looked and pointed skyward, dedicating his victory to recently deceased teammate Xavier Tondó. He said after the stage that even though Tondó had not been part of the team for very long, his loss was still profoundly felt. Kiryienka acknowledged that the team had discussed possibly withdrawing from the race, but he and the other riders all felt that the best tribute to Tondó was to continue racing, and to get a further stage win in his honor, while other members of the team spent time with his family. He had come to the Giro hoping to ride for an overall placing, but had a bad day on the Passo Giau and fell precipitously in the overall classification because of it, which further intensified his desire for a stage win.\nStage 21.\nThis was the Giro's one and only straightforward individual time trial. The course was flat and somewhat technical, with a handful of sharp turns. There were also several long straightaways. The course was shortened by four days before the stage took place, due to a special election taking place in Milan the same day as the stage. City officials expected high voter turnout and did not want the city center tied up by the race all day, so the revised route began at the outskirts of Milan instead of its center. It still ended, per its original design, at the Duomo di Milano.\nThere was not very much to decide with regards to the overall standings coming into this stage. Race leader Alberto Contador held the biggest advantage over second place that he had ever had in any Grand Tour. Michele Scarponi, while a lesser time trialist than third-placed Vincenzo Nibali, also had sufficient time that, barring a crash, he could be all but assured of remaining in second overall. Fourth and fifth-placed John Gadret and Joaquim Rodríguez were both noted as especially poor time trialists, but Gadret had a substantial time advantage over Rodríguez and Rodríguez likewise over sixth-placed José Rujano. Sixth through eighth overall were in play, as only 28 seconds separated Rujano, Roman Kreuziger, and Denis Menchov, but there was over two minutes to the next main in the standings, Steven Kruijswijk. This meant both that Rujano, Kreuziger, and Menchov were almost certain to hold onto their top-ten placings, and Kreuziger would likewise retain and win the white jersey as best young rider.\nFormer race leader David Millar targeted the time trial, saying that with the withdrawal two days earlier of Marco Pinotti that he saw Contador as his chief rival. Contador, for his part, stated that he would not ride the time trial to win, already savoring overall victory. Millar was among the earliest starters on the day and posted a time of 30'13\" that proved solidly better than the rest of the field, bar 's Alex Rasmussen. The Dane had started shortly after Millar and stopped the clocked in 30'20\", but had ridden the last kilometer with a flat rear tire. He rued the day after the stage that it had cost him a stage win, because no one finished within 30 seconds of these two riders. Remarkably, Contador's ride was good for third on the day, despite having said he was purposely not going to give his strongest effort. Both Rasmussen and Contador were better than Millar at the intermediate time check, but neither was faster at the finish. The win gave Millar the distinction of stage wins for his career at all three Grand Tours, after he had earlier in the race earned the distinction of having worn the overall leader's jersey at all three Grand Tours.\nMost of the other overall positions held up, as the race's top riders had incident-free time trials. Rujano ceded 59 seconds to Kreuziger, which resulted in him dropping to seventh. He might have dropped further had Menchov not had an uncharacteristically bad day racing against the clock. The Russian all-round was 35th on the day, only 22 seconds better than Rujano, which was not enough to overtake him. Mikel Nieve, known to be a weak time trialist, was nearly four minutes slower than the winning time, which opened the door for Kanstantsin Sivtsov, tenth on the day, to move back into the top ten overall. Nieve's final overall placing was 11th, still almost two minutes better than Hubert Dupont. Contador cemented his sixth career Grand Tour victory, though with a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, it was far from certain what place his ride would occupy in the history books. He also won the red jersey for the points competition, with Kreuziger taking home the white jersey for the youth competition and Stefano Garzelli the mountains classification green jersey."

        "title": "D. J. Smith (American football)",
        "text": "Darryl Devon ”D. J.” Smith Jr. (born February 24, 1989), is an American football coach and former linebacker who is currently the linebackers coach at the University of Missouri. He was selected by the Green Bay Packers out of Appalachian State University in the sixth round (186th pick overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nSmith attended Independence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he started for three years out of four and was part of a team that went undefeated and won four straight state titles. During his time at Independence High School, he was often rotated between middle and outside linebacker. He was an all-state recognition twice, an all-conference nominee three times, and named team MVP his senior year. Smith also lettered three years in basketball.\nCollege career.\nSmith went on to play for the Appalachian State University Mountaineers, where he led the NCAA Division I FCS in active tackles with 525 by the end of his career. He also became the first Appalachian State player since three-time NFL Pro Bowl nominee Dexter Coakley to have more than 500 tackles in his career. He majored in Business Management.\n2007.\nSmith had an eventful first season with the Mountaineers, even though he did not hold the starting job until the seventh game of the season. Even so, he recorded more tackles than any Appalachian State freshman since Dexter Coakley in 1993, and had at least 10 tackles in five of his first nine starts. He was named the Southern Conference Defensive Player of the month for November after leading the conference in tackles with 49, interceptions with two, and passes deflected with five. His first interception was against The Citadel, which he ran back 43 yards for a touchdown. During this game, he broke the record for tackles by a freshman in a game (also held by Coakley). He was named the Southern Conference Player of the week after a game against Chattanooga after recording 14 tackles and 2 pass break-ups. In the National Championship game against the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens, he recorded 10 more tackles.\n2008.\nFollowing his successful freshman year, Smith continued on as the starting linebacker and started all 14 games. His arguably best performance of his sophomore season took place against the Samford Bulldogs, a game in which he had 16 tackles (12 solo). Following this game, was once named the Southern Conference defensive player of the week. He again received this honor after a contest against the Alabama Crimson Tide. Smith finished the season with 123 tackles, including 53 solo tackles. He finished second in the conference and 12th in the nation and received second-team Southern Conference honors.\n2009.\nSmith's success at Appalachian State University continued into his junior year, a year in which he was elected a first-team All-American by the Sports Network, and all-conference by the coaches and media. He started all fourteen games of the season and tallied fourteen tackles in the opener against East Carolina University. He continued on to earn National and Southern Conference Defensive player of the week for his performance against Samford University with 17 tackles, the most by any Mountaineer since his Freshman year. He finished the season with 137 tackles (60 solo), and with two forced fumbles and recoveries, the most on the team.\n2010.\nContinuing the streak, Smith started all 13 games in his final season as a Mountaineer and was once again named a First-team All American by the Sports Network and College Football News. He was named as a second-team all-American by Phil Steele, and to the third-team by the Associated Press. On top of this, he was given first-team all Southern-Conference honors by the Coaches and Media. Though he did in fact start every game that season, only six of them were at weak-side linebacker (The position he had played most of his career). He was then moved to middle linebacker due to injuries. Even so, he still posted double-digit tackles in ten out of thirteen games. His first start at linebacker came against Samford, where he intercepted a pass and returned it 26 yards to set up a touchdown. In his final season, he registered a career-high 146 tackles (5th nationally), with 76 of them being solo.\nProfessional career.\nSmith was thought by scouts to be on the shorter side for a linebacker. Some noted that he \"has trouble finding the ball inside at times due to his lack of height.\" Scouts stated that his arms were too small and limited his ability to \"grab NFL backs on the way through or get off blocks\". They also stated that he had a habit of overrunning plays. On the positive side, they remarked that Smith was a \"Thick, compact linebacker\", who often \"Scrapes down the line, stays square to get to the ball\". NFL scouts also said that he was good at changing directions with limited space and that he was an \"Excellent wrap-up tackler in space\".\nGreen Bay Packers.\nSmith was selected by the Packers 186 overall with the second of three sixth round picks in the 2011 NFL Draft. Smith responded to being drafted by stating: \"I'm ecstatic that Green Bay saw my talent and decided to pick me up.”\nSmith was released by the Packers on April 24, 2013 after he failed a physical.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nSmith was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Chargers on April 25, 2013. He was released before the season.\nHouston Texans.\nSmith signed with the Houston Texans on November 13, 2013.\nCarolina Panthers.\nSmith signed with the Carolina Panthers on January 3, 2014.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his playing career ended, Smith accepted an offer from his former high school coach to be the defensive coordinator at Vance High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He accepted a position at his alma mater Appalachian State in 2016 as the program's director of recruiting relations. He was reassigned to a defensive analyst position in 2017, and promoted to outside linebackers coach in 2018.\nSmith was named the linebackers coach at Missouri in 2020. In January 2022, Smith was named co-defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator while retaining his role as linebacker coach. Following the conclusion of the 2022 season, Smith signed an extension with Missouri through 2024 with an annual salary of $550,000."

        "title": "1974 Asian Games medal table",
        "text": "The 1974 Asian Games (officially known as the Seventh Asian Games) was a multi-sport event held in Tehran, Iran from September 1, 1974, to September 16, 1974. This was the first time that Asian Games were celebrated in any Middle East country. A total of 3,010 athletes selected from 25 Asian National Olympic Committees participated in 16 sports divided into 202 events. The number of participating countries was the greatest in Asian Games history, eighteen nations competed in Bangkok, host of the 1970 Asian Games. Fencing, gymnastics (artistic) and women's basketball were included for the first time; while sailing—which made its debut in the previous Asian Games—was not included, however since 1978, sailing is a part of the Asian Games sports.\nThe Republic of China (Taiwan) was expelled from the Games after the decision made in the Asian Games Federation's conference held on November 16, 1973, to allow the entry of the People's Republic of China. Mongolia and North Korea also entered the Games for the first time. Athletes from the Arab nations, Pakistan, China and North Korea refused to face Israel in tennis, fencing, basketball and football events, due to political reasons.\nNineteen nations earned medals at the Games, and fifteen of them won at least one gold medal. Japan led the medal count for the seventh consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 75 gold and 175 overall medals. Competitors from the host nation, Iran, finished at the second spot in the medal table, the best performance of Iran since 1951, claiming 81 medals in total (including 36 gold). In its debut, China finished third with a total of 106 medals, including 33 gold. South Korea devolved to fourth position with 16 gold and 57 overall medals, South Korea ranking second in the medal table of the previous Asian Games.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nA total of 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100 kg category of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nOn September 10, 1974, Oscar State, secretary general of the International Weightlifting Federation, announced that two weightlifters—North Korean Kim Joong-iI (heavyweight) and Japanese Masushi Ouchi (middle heavyweight)—had tested positive for a banned substance (stimulant) and were stripped of their medals. Kim had won three gold medals (snatch, clean &amp; jerk and total) in the heavyweight category, while Masashi had won two gold (snatch and total) and one silver (clean &amp; jerk) in the middle heavyweight. Kim usually competed in the middle heavyweight category, but due to being marginally overweight, he was forced to compete in heavyweight; after his disqualification, all three gold medals of the heavyweight category went to Houshang Kargarnejad of Iran. Snatch's gold and silver of clean &amp; jerk of Masashi went to China's Qian Yukai and gold of total to Ali Vali of Iran."

        "text": "Richard Lloyd Hoover (December 11, 1925 – April 12, 1981) was an American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Boston Braves during the 1952 season. Listed at , 170 lb., he batted and threw left-handed.\nCareer.\nBorn in Columbus, Ohio, the 17-year-old Dick Hoover was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent prior to the start of the 1943 season. He was assigned to the Appalachian League, where he finished 11–1 to lead the league in winning percentage (.917) while helping lead the Bristol Twins to a 74–35 pennant-winning record. But his baseball career was interrupted in 1944 after he entered service in the United States Navy during World War II.\nFollowing his discharge in 1946, Hoover was part of successive transactions between the Giants, Cubs and Pirates organizations, playing for six different teams in a span of three years. Before the 1949 season, Hoover was sent by the Giants along with Gary Gearhart and cash consideration to the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in exchange for Davey Williams. By then, the Crackers were a Class AA affiliate of the Boston Braves, a period during which they won more games than any other league team.\nHoover had two solid years with the Crackers, after going 11–11 with a 3.97 ERA in 1949 and 16–7, 3.35 in 1950. He was promoted to Triple A Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in 1951, ending with a 5–4 record and a 3.14 ERA in 27 games, basically as a middle reliever and spot starter.\nHoover opened 1952 with the Boston Braves, pitching for them from April 16 through April 23. He made two relief appearances, allowing four runs on eight hits and three walks while striking out one batter in innings of work. He did not have a decision, but gained notoriety by serving up the home run ball hit by future Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm in his first Major League at bat. It would be the only homer Wilhelm would hit in his 20-year major league career.\nFollowing his brief stint in the majors, Hoover returned to Milwaukee for the rest of the 1952 season. He went 10–5 while leading the pitching staff with a 2.60 ERA. He finished his career with Triple A Columbus Jets in 1955. His career highlight came on August 14, when he hurled a no-hitter against the Richmond Virginians.\nIn an 11-season, minors career Hoover posted an 89–72 record and a 3.44 ERA in 313 pitching appearances.\nAfter baseball retirement in 1955, Hoover worked as a police sergeant in his native Columbus. He died in a traffic collision in Lake Placid, Florida at the age of 55 years, while making a vacation trip."

        "title": "2012 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 96th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday May 27, 2012. It was the premier event of the 2012 IZOD IndyCar Series season. For the first time since 1996 all entries featured turbocharged engines, and all entries were brand new model-year chassis, as part of the ICONIC Project. This was the first time since 2003, and only the fourth time since 1985, that all cars were a new model-year chassis.\nThe track opened for practice on Saturday May 12. Time trials were held May 19–20. Ryan Briscoe of Penske Racing qualified for the pole position. The final practice, traditionally dubbed \"Carb Day\", was held Friday May 25.\nDario Franchitti, who previously won the race in 2007 and 2010, won the event, becoming a three-time Indy 500 champion.\nOn the final lap, second place Takuma Sato challenged Franchitti for the lead in turn one, but Franchitti maintained a low line, forcing Sato's left tires on or over the white line marking the edge of the course.\nAs the two cars were side by side, Sato spun and crashed into the outside wall. Sato finished in 17th, while Franchitti went on to take the victory.\nFranchitti's teammate Scott Dixon finished second, sweeping a 1-2 finish for Chip Ganassi Racing. The race set an all-time record with 34 lead changes. Franchitti's win represented the ninth consecutive Indy victory for Honda, despite the presence of multiple engine manufacturers for the first time since 2005.\nDario Franchitti won his first Indianapolis 500 with Brembo-equipped brakes. This was the last win of Dario Franchitti's 12 season career. In the penultimate race of the 2013 IndyCar Series in Houston, Franchitti would be involved in a multi-car accident that would prematurely end his career.\nEvent background.\nFor the first time since 1947, the previous year's race winner had been killed in a racing crash in the time between races. Defending race winner Dan Wheldon was killed in a horrific crash during the 2011 season finale, the 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Several winners have missed the following year due to either retirements, injuries, or racing in a different series. The last time the defending champion did not participate in the race due to injury or death was 2004 race winner Buddy Rice, who suffered a concussion during practice, and sat out the 2005 race (also won by Wheldon). The last time a defending Indianapolis 500 champion did not participate in the race under any circumstances was 2007 race winner Dario Franchitti, who was injured in a NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Talladega Superspeedway in April 2008 and had a full-time racing schedule in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in 2008.\nJim Nabors, who has traditionally sung \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" during the pre-race ceremonies in most years since 1972, was not able to attend the race due to health reasons. The Speedway sent a film crew to record a video of him performing the song at his home in Hawaii, and aired it on video boards on race morning.\nGoing into the month, there was growing concern about filling the field to the traditional 33 cars. This was due in part to the struggles of Lotus, and lease issues in the first year of the new engine package, namely involving Dragon Racing. However, on Bump Day, the field was filled to exactly 33 cars, with no cars bumped, a similar situation to 2003.\nSchedule.\nOther scheduled events included:\nEntry list.\nOn April 18, 2012, the official entry list of thirty-four car/driver combinations was released. Former winners entered include Dario Franchitti, Hélio Castroneves and Scott Dixon. In an unusual move, Chip Ganassi Racing sponsor Target changed Franchitti's car number for the month. While Franchitti was legally entitled to using #1, the team decided instead to keep the team's #10 identity for the season, but to celebrate Target's fifty years in business, the car carried #50 for the race. The stylised #50 utilised the Target logo.\nFormer Formula One driver Jean Alesi was listed as an entry for Newman Haas Racing, but the car was later withdrawn. Lotus continued to find a team for Alesi, and struck a deal with Indy Lights team Fan Force United to run a car. Rubens Barrichello, winner of the 2002 U.S. Grand Prix at Indy was the first former winner of that event to attempt to qualify for the Indy 500.\nMichel Jourdain Jr., who had last raced at Indy sixteen years earlier in 1996, was named to Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Jourdain would be the only driver in the field from the 1990s. With John Andretti not entered, not a single driver from the 1980s was in the field.\nTesting and rookie orientation.\nWith the introduction of the new chassis and engine package, testing was conducted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the offseason. The first phase of testing involved Dan Wheldon, and testing was conducted on the USGP road course at Indianapolis on September 1, and on the oval in late September. Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan tested at Indianapolis in early November for Honda and Chevrolet. Test results were mixed at the Speedway, with drivers complaining of weight imbalance issues, and speeds (208–216 mph) were down from what was expected.\nTexas Motor Speedway Test — Monday, May 7.\nFor the second year in a row, IndyCar held an official pre-Indy oval test. Since the Indy 500 will be the first oval race of the 2012 season, the league hosted a test for rookies to assimilate with ovals, and to test out an updated aero kit package for Texas Motor Speedway, a 1.5-mile 24-degree banked oval which has been a type of circuit that was questionable in light of the Las Vegas tragedy. The aero kit package at Texas was not used for Indianapolis or Fontana. Indianapolis and Fontana, home of the 2012 IZOD IndyCar World Championship, used the same superspeedway aero and rules package. The test also saw Rubens Barrichello take his first competitive laps on an oval on Monday May 7.\nTime Trials.\nSaturday May 19 – Pole Day.\nQualifying.\nQ1 The driver waved off and did not make an attempt during Q2. Per INDYCAR rules, Q1 times determine positions after the drivers who completed Q2.\nCarb Day.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe annual Pit Stop Competition featured twelve participants in a single-elimination bracket-style match-up. Four teams received byes, while eight teams competed in the first round. A total purse of $100,000 was at stake, with $50,000 going to the winning team. The format has two cars competing in a layout that resembles a drag race. The cars race from a standing start and drive into the pit box, change four tires, simulate a refueling, and race to a finish line a few hundred feet down the pit lane.\nChip Ganassi Racing won the pit stop competition for the first time, with driver Scott Dixon.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRyan Briscoe led from the start, was drafted and overtaken by James Hinchcliffe, who led at the end of the first lap. The pair swapped the lead again by the end of lap two. There were no accidents at the start and the green flag was given at the first attempt to start the race.\nFirst half.\nRyan Hunter-Reay overtook Marco Andretti before Bryan Clauson spun exiting turn one, akin to Danny Sullivan's spin in 1985, and brought out a caution period. Under caution many drivers chose to enter pit lane. Josef Newgarden stalled in the pits, was restarted and rejoined the race. 2007 and 2010 winner Dario Franchitti spun at his pit box, due to being hit from behind by E. J. Viso, but like Newgarden lost less time as the safety car was deployed. Jean Alesi and Simona de Silvestro were black flagged for failing to run within 105% of the front pace and duly retired. Upon the restart, which was intended to be single file, cars were seen on the pit straight before entering turn one as many as five abreast. At 32 laps Marco Andretti led from James Hinchcliffe and Ryan Briscoe. On lap 33 the stewards declared that Viso would not be penalised for the pit lane incident. No driver was able to pull away a substantial lead over the driver behind and cars behind appeared to face an aerodynamic advantage over those ahead. Takuma Sato then started to set fastest laps by lap 37 and Marco Andretti had led most laps with 15.\nAt the end of lap 46 the pitstops occurred for fuel and tires with Hinchcliffe and Castroneves pitting. Castroneves' pitstop was delayed due to a tire fitting problem. Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti stopped a lap later. Josef Newgarden stalled again at his second stop, unable to put the car in gear. The Ganassis of Dixon and Franchitti had been setting the fastest pace. By lap 50, one quarter distance, and after the first full pits, Marco Andretti led. There had been six leaders and twelve changes of lead.\nAt the end of lap 75 James Hinchcliffe pitted, then all three Penske cars pitted simultaneously, and Castroneves almost stalled, making it his second flawed pitstop. Pit stops left Dixon leading with Franchitti second some 11 second behind. On lap 79 Mike Conway was given a drive through penalty for hitting a crew member in the pits and breaking his front wing. Conway collided with Will Power and caused a caution, the second of the race, on lap 81. Conway was driving slower than Power, having just left the pits, and slid. The rear of the car lost grip and Conway slid backwards into the wall, and Power hit Conway's spinning car with nowhere left to go as he caught Conway's car on the exit of the turn.\nThe safety car remained out until the end of lap 88. \nAna Beatriz spun on the exit of turn one and hit the wall, bringing out another full course caution with her car stopping in the middle of the track.\nCars pitted under caution including Hinchcliffe. Dixon and Franchitti led.\nSecond half.\nAt the half distance point the leaderboard was\nDixon, Franchitti, Hunter-Reay, Rahal, Wilson, Sato, Kimball, Hildebrand, Bell. \nOn lap 110 Briscoe had a gearbox issue and ran more slowly for a lap and put the car into an emergency gearbox setting whilst running seventeenth. \nHunter-Reay stopped for fuel and tires on lap 113. This left all of the top six runners being Honda powered, in contrast to pre-race predictions on relative engine performance and economy.\nOn lap 115 Hildebrand pitted from sixteenth. Rahal pitted afterwards. \nOn lap 119 Franchitti pit stopped from second place with no adjustments made to the car and the following lap Dixon pitted from the lead having led for a total of 37 laps by that stage. This left Sato leading, the eighteenth leader of the day. Andretti ran second. \nSato pitted from the lead on lap 124. On lap 125 Hinchcliffe pitted and Barrichello who had led for one lap pitted. \nOn lap 126 Sato lead, with Franchitti behind. \nOn lap 128 Ryan Hunter-Reay retired with a failure of an upright on the car's suspension.\nOn lap 134 the \nleaderboard stood as Sato, Franchitti, Andretti, Dixon, Rahal.\nOn lap 145 Andretti pitted having complained about a vibration on the car and replaced the tires. Rahal also pitted just before. \nThe caution was issued on lap 146 when Saavedra stopped on the exit of the pitlane. \nStarting lap 147 under caution the majority of the lead drivers stopped including Sato, Franchitti, Dixon, Rahal, Hinchcliffe and more.\nFollowing such pitstops, by lap 150 Sato led followed by Franchitti, Dixon, Hinchcliffe, Wilson, Kimball, Briscoe, Kanaan and Castroneves.\nOn lap 153 the restart occurred and Franchiti passed Sato on the backstraight of the circuit and at the start of lap 154 Dixon passed Sato for second into turn one. \nOn lap 160 Dixon started to pressure Franchitti and had come under pressure from Sato behind. Dixon passed for the lead but starting lap 161 Dario Franchitti retook the lead at turn one.\nOn lap 163 Josef Newgarden stopped due to engine problems, pulling over to the left hand area of grass on the inside of the track on the backstraight between turns two and three, bringing out the safety car and another full course caution. \nSato, Franchitti and Dixon pitted under caution, along with Hinchcliffe and others. Hinchcliffe stopped for a longer period than the others and appeared to run over some pit equipment upon exiting.\nPrior to the restart Dixon led from Franchiti and Sato.\nOn lap 171 the race restarted. Wilson passed Sato upon the restart. Franchitti repassed Dixon. \nStarting lap 173 Wilson was repassed by Sato and soon was passed by Carpenter, Kanaan and Kimball having run high on the exit of the turn when passed by Sato and lost speed.\nBy lap 176, 28 lead changes had taken place, one fewer than the 1960 record of 29 changes in one Indianapolis 500 race. Starting lap 178 when Franchitti overtook Dixon this broke the record. \nThe leading Ganassi pair of Franchitti and Dixon appeared to express concern over fuel consumption and speed.\nOn lap 180 Carpenter spun but did not hit the wall, spinning across the track and coming to a halt, then gesticulating at marshals to help turn the car around. This caused a full course caution and seemingly eliminated the need for the leaders to need to refuel. Carpenter then continued. \nOn lap 187 Andretti overcalculated and drove into the wall, sliding across the track and coming to a halt.\nFinish.\nTony Kanaan led the race during the caution, but when the green flag waved he soon fell to fourth behind Franchitti, Dixon and Sato. Teammates Franchitti and Dixon traded the lead several times until the start of lap 199, when Franchitti took the lead from Dixon and Sato followed him through into second place. On the final lap, Sato attempted a pass on Franchitti in turn one but spun and hit the turn 1 wall. Franchitti won the race, with Dixon second and Kanaan third. Under the final caution flag of the day, the three friends lined up to cross the finish line side by side.\nIn Victory Lane, Franchitti dedicated his win to the memory of 2005 and 2011 champion Dan Wheldon. When asked about the final-lap incident, he said that he had moved up the track to give Sato room on the inside. Sato had a different view, claiming that Franchitti had forced him nearly into the grass and caused him to lose control. Race officials ruled it a racing incident and confirmed Franchitti as the winner.\nOwing to the newly-introduced engine formula, Dario Franchitti earned the distinction of the first driver to win in both a normally aspirated and turbocharged engine since Arie Luyendyk (1990 and 1997). Franchitti's victories in 2007 and 2010 came while the series was utilizing normally aspirated engines. Franchitti also became the first driver to win the race with a V-6 engine since George Robson in 1946.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nJean Alesi was penalized 2 laps for ignoring the black flag, which dropped him to last as he had been in front of Simona de Silvestro when they were both black flagged under the 105% rule.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nTime trials and Carb Day were covered live in the United States on NBC Sports Network.

        "title": "Matt Carpenter (baseball)",
        "text": "Matthew Martin Lee Carpenter (born November 26, 1985) is an American professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has also played in MLB for the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres. A left-handed batter and right-handed thrower, Carpenter stands and weighs .\nSince becoming a regular player in 2013, Carpenter has spent considerable time at first base, second base and third base. The Cardinals selected him in the 13th round of the 2009 MLB draft from Texas Christian University (TCU). A three-time second-team All Mountain West Conference selectee, he broke TCU's school record for games played and at bats and is second in hits, doubles and walks. He was the Cardinals' organization Player of the Year in 2010. A three-time MLB All-Star Game selection, he became the first Silver Slugger Award winner at second base in Cardinals franchise history after leading the major leagues in hits, runs scored and doubles in 2013.\nBackground.\nCarpenter was born in Galveston, Texas, on November 26, 1985, the son of Rick and Tammie Carpenter. The elder Carpenter is a former college baseball player turned high school coach. His mother played softball in her youth. The Carpenter family spent seven years in La Marque, Texas, where Rick Carpenter taught and coached at La Marque High School before moving to Fort Bend Dulles High School and eventually at Fort Bend Lawrence E. Elkins High School. There, Rick coached for another fifteen years. The school's baseball team won numerous championships, including nine at the district level, six regional, three state, and one national. He also coached three other major leaguers: James Loney, Kip Wells and Chad Huffman. Rick Carpenter also coached at Prosper High School near Dallas until he retired in 2019, winning a state championship in 2015. Carpenter's brother, Tyler, was a minor league baseball player in the New York Mets organization.\nAmateur career.\nAt Elkins High School, Carpenter was a three-year first-team all-district performer and two-time all-state tournament team selection. He helped lead the team to a 35–1 record and the \"USA Today\" National Prep Championship in 2002, and was named the District Sophomore of the Year that year. His father, Rick Carpenter, was honored as the \"USA Today\" High School Baseball Coach of the Year. Matt was named a 2004 TPX second-team High School All-American. He holds the Elkins High School record for most career hits. One of his high school teammates was James Loney.\nCarpenter attended Texas Christian University (TCU) and majored in communications. One of Carpenter's teammates at TCU was pitcher and fellow future major leaguer Jake Arrieta—who, after Carpenter became a St. Louis Cardinal, would later join the Chicago Cubs on the opposite end of the storied Cardinals–Cubs rivalry. In his freshman year as an athlete, Carpenter played 50 games and batted .289, 27 runs batted in (RBI), eight doubles (2B) and one home run (HR) with 11 multi-hit games and eight multiple-RBI games. The next season, he finished second on the team with a .349 average, one home run, and 36 RBIs in 62 games. He hit safely in 47 games and reached base in 56.\nHowever, Carpenter's junior season was cut short after eight games due to a tearing a ligament in his elbow while throwing from first base. Tommy John surgery was necessary making him the first TCU position player to undergo a procedure much more common for pitchers to have. As a result he was granted a two-year medical redshirt (RS). Because his weight increased to and he was rehabilitating his elbow at an age more advanced than most players who are drafted, doubt lingered about Carpenter's future as a professional baseball player. While he was very disciplined as a player, his discipline off the field was poor, including his grades and physical conditioning. This contributed to his weight being higher than average. Carpenter attributes personal motivation and a speech from his head coach Jim Schlossnagle to getting him motivated to change his habits off the field. Thus, he applied the same dedication off the field as he did on the field. As a result Carpenter lost .\nWhile Carpenter was still rehabilitating during his junior year, major league outfielder Torii Hunter moved to Prosper, Texas, the same high school district where Rick Carpenter coached baseball. Hunter introduced himself to Carpenter because his son, Torii, Jr., would attend and play baseball there. The elder Hunter also met Matt Carpenter, who he eventually invited to train at the same gymnasium where he trained. It was an expensive facility, and at this point Carpenter was still in the minor leagues; he could not afford to pay for a membership at the gym. However Hunter covered the fees because he believed that Carpenter would take full advantage of the opportunity to train.\nIn Carpenter's RS-junior season, he played in all 63 games and was named second-team all-conference at third base. He finished with a .283 batting average, team-high 11 home runs and 46 RBI and ranked third on the team with 48 runs scored. His fifth-year senior season included a .333 batting average, .472 on-base percentage (OBP) and .662 slugging percentage (SLG) with 11 home runs. Along with Carpenter's increased performance, TCU's overall strong effort nearly led to a College World Series appearance. During his collegiate career, Carpenter broke school career records for games played (241) and at-bats (843), and finished second in hits (263), doubles (57) and walks (BB, with 150). He was named second-team All Mountain West Conference in 2006, 2008 and 2009.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues (2009–11).\nThe St. Louis Cardinals selected Carpenter in the 13th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. Due to advanced age stemming from his redshirt senior season at TCU, he had little leverage in negotiations, and was forced to settle for a $1,000 bonus. He spent his first professional season with various A-level teams, including the Batavia Muckdogs, Quad Cities River Bandits, and the Palm Beach Cardinals Between the three clubs, he batted .283 with two home runs and 22 RBIs. In 2010, Carpenter returned to Palm Beach to begin the year; over 28 games, he hit .283 while also drawing 26 walks, placing his OBP at .441.\nThis resulted in a call-up to the Springfield Cardinals, with whom he played 105 games. With Springfield he batted .316 with 76 runs scored, 26 doubles, 12 home runs, 53 RBIs, and 11 stolen bases. He was chosen as a Topps' Double-A All-Star, Texas Mid-Season All-Star, and Texas Post-Season All-Star for his 2010 season. Carpenter also garnered the TCN/Scout.com Cardinals Minor League Player of the Year and Cardinals organization Player of the Year awards for 2010.\nAfter his 2010 performance, Carpenter started to garner attention, and was expected to compete for one of the MLB Cardinals final roster openings the next spring training. Despite batting .333 with a .414 OBP and six extra base hits in spring training, he started the 2011 season in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of Pacific Coast League (PCL). He spent 130 total games with Memphis, batting .300 with 12 home runs, seventy RBIs, 84 walks, a .417 on-base percentage, and a .483 slugging percentage. His OBP placed fourth in the PCL.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2011–21).\nEarly major league career (2011–12).\nCarpenter made his major league debut on June 4, 2011, starting at third base and batting seventh. During his brief stint in the majors that year, he played seven games, collecting one double, a .067 batting average and four walks. The Cardinals qualified for the postseason by clinching the wild card, but left him off the postseason roster. St. Louis became the World Series champions when they defeated the Texas Rangers. The Cardinals awarded Carpenter a championship ring for his contributions throughout the year.\nAfter the 2011 season, the departures of Albert Pujols and Nick Punto — along with an injury to Allen Craig — opened up an opportunity for Carpenter to make the major league club. During the following spring training, he worked at first base and in the outfield to increase his versatility, where he served as a backup and spot starter in 2012 season. He made an early-season impact against the Chicago Cubs on April 15, driving in five runs with a home run and triple as the Cardinals won, 10–3.\nIncurring a right flank strain on May 23, the team placed Carpenter on the disabled list (DL). The injury happened while swinging the bat for a double. At the time, he was batting .288 with three home runs and 20 RBIs in 39 games while filling in at first base for the injured Lance Berkman. In July, he made his first appearance at second base since turning professional. He played in 114 games for the season, tallying 340 plate appearances and batting .294 with six home runs, 46 RBIs, 22 doubles, a .365 OBP, and .463 SLG.\nCarpenter hit his first career postseason home run on October 17, 2012, during Game 3 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the San Francisco Giants. The two-run home run came with two out in the bottom of the third inning off Giants starter Matt Cain. Carpenter was inserted into the game from the bench to replace an injured Carlos Beltrán in the second inning. After a lengthy rain delay, the Cardinals won the game 3–1 to take a two-game-to-one series lead in the NLCS. However the Giants won the NLCS in seven games on their way to becoming the World Series champions.\nFirst All-Star selection (2013).\nUncertain of where the club would find adequate offensive production from second base, the Cardinals advised Carpenter to work out there in the off-season prior to 2013. He had played mainly third base and had totaled just 18 total innings at second base since the Cardinals drafted him — all during the 2012 season after his major league call-up. After his tryout in spring training, he made the team as the starting second baseman.\nWith Rafael Furcal out for the season due to injury, and Jon Jay starting the season slowly, the Cardinals clamored for productivity from their leadoff hitters. Manager Mike Matheny moved Carpenter into the leadoff spot midway through April in spite of him lacking the speed sought after for that post in the lineup. He responded by proving to be an all-around hitter, gaining his first All-Star selection at Citi Field with 25 doubles, 65 runs scored, and two 12-game hitting streaks at the All-Star break.\nWith his 54th double on September 21, Carpenter broke Stan Musial's six decade-old franchise record for doubles (Musial's 53 came in 1953) by a left-handed batter. He finished the season leading the Major Leagues in hits (199), doubles (55), and runs (126), while batting .318. He also finished in the top ten in the NL in batting average, on-base percentage (.392), total bases (301), singles (126), triples (seven), walks (72), and adjusted OPS (143), among others. Among NL leadoff hitters, he finished second in OBP to Shin-Soo Choo's .423.\nDespite his stellar regular season, Carpenter batted only .203 in the postseason. Against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NLDS, he started slowly, managing just one hit in 19 at-bats (.053). He improved his batting average to .261 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. In the fourth inning of Game 6, Carpenter faced Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw and lined a double to right field to end an 11-pitch at bat and ignite a four-run outburst. They eventually won, 9–0, securing a trip to the World Series. Carpenter batted .296 in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox. However, in the ninth inning in Game 6 against Boston closer Koji Uehara, he struck out for the final out of the series and season, resulting in the Cardinals' elimination from the final round of the postseason.\nThe following November, in earning his first Silver Slugger Award, Carpenter also became the first winner at second base in Cardinals history. He finished fourth in the NL Most Valuable Player Award balloting. He was also selected as the team finalist for Heart &amp; Hustle Award; Boston's Dustin Pedroia was the winner. The club then signed Carpenter to a six-year, $52 million extension to run through 2019 on March 6, 2014. Included was an option for 2020 worth $18.5 million. General manager John Mozeliak cited his work ethic as another factor in Carpenter getting the extension.\nSecond All-Star selection (2014).\nWith second base prospect Kolten Wong viewed as major league-ready, Carpenter moved back to his customary position of third base in 2014. He continued as the Cardinals leadoff hitter. He started the season slowly, batting .264 in April with three doubles and one home run. His productivity returned in May, when he batted .307 with 10 doubles. However on May 15, his batting average had dropped to .256 with a .315 SLG. From May 18 to June 1, he hit safely in 14 consecutive games and collected a combined 24 hits in 60 at-bats for a .400 batting average.\nIn a June 4 matchup against the Kansas City Royals, Carpenter raked five hits in five at-bats to raise his batting average to a season-high .307. His double in the eleventh inning provided the game-winning RBI in a 5–2 victory. It was the first five-hit game for the Cardinals since Ryan Ludwick's on September 4, 2009. Carpenter finished that game having reached base in 10 consecutive plate appearances. The five hits brought him into a tie for the NL lead in hits (73), and until that point he led NL leadoff hitters in runs (40) and BB (33). After first-half results through July 6 including a .282 batting average, four home runs, 32 RBI, and a .375 OBP, he was selected to his second All-Star Game at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFor the season, Carpenter batted .271 with a .375 OBP, .375 SLG, 33 doubles, eight home runs, 59 RBIs, 99 runs scored and 95 walks in 158 games. He finished third in the NL in runs scored and eighth in OBP, and led the league in walks. His average of 4.36 pitches per plate appearance was far above the MLB average of 3.82. According to a computerized tracking system, he also led the league in pitches taken that were erroneously pronounced strikes. In spite of the significant drop in batting average from the season before, his increased walk total helped him produce an OBP of no less than .362 in each month of 2014.\nIn the NLDS against the Dodgers, the Cardinals again faced Kershaw in Game 1. Carpenter's home run against him in the sixth inning stopped a string of 14 consecutive batters the lefty ace had retired. In the following at bat opposing Kershaw in the seventh inning, he found himself in an 0–2 count, but battled eight pitches for a bases-clearing double that gave the Cardinals a 7–6 lead. The Cardinals won 10–9.\nIn Game 2, Carpenter's second home run of the series tied the game late, but the Dodgers prevailed 3–2. In the first three games of the Cardinals-Dodgers playoff, Carpenter knocked in seven runs with two doubles, two solo homers, and a two-run homer. By hitting a home run and a double in each of the first three games of the NLDS, he became the first player to do so in the postseason. Between the NLDS and NLCS against the Giants, Carpenter hit safely ten times in 26 at bats with four home runs, four doubles, and eight RBI.\n2015.\nShowing initial great success in early at-bats in 2015, Carpenter's first home run was also a game-winner. Deciding a 7–5 margin, the home run occurred in the 11th inning of the April 12 contest against Cincinnati. During the Cardinals' first homestand of the season, he doubled four times in a six at-bat span on April 17–18 against the Reds. On April 17, he scored a run when he somersaulted over catcher Brayan Peña; traditionally runners attempt to score with a direct collision with the catcher.\nIncluding his fifth career leadoff home run against Cincinnati on April 19, Carpenter recorded his seventh straight two-hit game. It was the seventh consecutive game with an extra base hit and it was just the 37th occasion in the century in which a Cardinal achieved this feat. Further, the seven consecutive multi-hit games with at least one extra base hit in each tied the Cardinals' franchise record which Ripper Collins originally set in 1935. That same streak was the longest in the Major Leagues since Paul Molitor achieved the same as a member of the Brewers in 1991. From April 12–19, Carpenter netted a .480 average, .880 SLG, seven doubles, one home run, and five RBI. His 22 total bases led the NL. MLB subsequently named him to his first NL Player of the Week Award for that period. Carpenter continued his extra-base hit surge. He ripped his second leadoff home run of the season against Washington on April 22, and the next day he lined the first pitch of the game off Max Scherzer for a double.\nMatheny moved Carpenter to the number two spot in the batting order in late April. He continued a strong hitting effort. His second game-winner of the season was a sacrifice fly against Pittsburgh on May 2, giving the Cardinals a walk-off 2–1 win in the 11th inning. He left early the next day due to lightheadedness. On May 6 against the Chicago Cubs, his three-run home run tied the score as St. Louis triumphed, 7–4. It was a four-RBI game, giving him 20 in his team's first 26 games.\nHe was withheld from a weekend series against Pittsburgh May 8–10 due to \"extreme fatigue\", after team physicians diagnosed dehydration and an accelerated heart rate. On May 24 against the Royals, his eighth home run off Yordano Ventura matched his previous season's total. It was also Carpenter's 500th career hit and 300th career run scored. In the month of June, he batted .190 with four doubles, no home runs and 10 RBI.\nAfter being moved down in the order, Carpenter then endured a three-month slump in which he batted .216. He returned to the lead off position on July 30 for his first career multi-home run game. He also had four hits, four runs scored and four RBI, and was instrumental in a 9–8 home walk-off victory over the Colorado Rockies. Carpenter's ground rule double in the bottom of the ninth started the decisive rally. He hit five home runs from July 30 to August 5. In August, \"Baseball America\" rated Carpenter as having the third-best strike zone judgment in the NL. Carpenter reached 20 home runs for the first time in his career on August 30 in a 7–5 win over the Giants. He led the National League in doubles (44) for a second time, and the Cardinals in home runs (28) and RBI (84). He also finished in the top ten in the National League in slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, runs scored, total bases, walks, home runs and strikeouts. During his time batting second, he batted .225 with six home runs and 33 RBI. As the leadoff hitter, he batted .322 with 22 home runs, fifty RBIs and a 1.022 OPS. He finished 12th in the MVP balloting.\nThird All-Star selection (2016).\nCarpenter's first career walk-off home run came on May 7, 2016, in a 6–4 win over Pittsburgh. On May 19, he established a new career-high six RBI in a game at Busch Stadium against the Colorado Rockies, with two doubles and his ninth home run of the season in 13–7 win. From 2013 through May 2016, he led all major league leadoff hitters in hits, runs, home runs and RBI. MLB named Carpenter the NL Player of the Week on June 6 after batting .560 with five doubles. He generated consecutive four-hit games against Milwaukee on May 30−31, then six hits in a three games series versus San Francisco, leading all of MLB with a .577 OBP and 10 runs. He produced a .920 SLG and 1.497 OPS. After the series against the Giants, he moved back to second base to accommodate the return of Jhonny Peralta from the DL.\nAfter leading the NL in OPS (1.008) for the first half of the season, Carpenter was selected as a reserve on July 5 for the All-Star Game at Petco Park in San Diego. The Cardinals placed him on the 15-day DL on July 7 with an abdominal oblique strain. After returning from the DL, he played in 51 games, batting .229, having a .410 slugging percentage, and a .726 OPS. He indicated he was still unable to swing properly after returning from the oblique injury. He completed the season having appeared in 129 games, and batting .271 with a career-high .885 OPS, twenty home runs, 36 doubles, and 68 RBIs. His 81 walks placed seventh and 135 adjusted OPS+ eighth in the league. On defense, he made at least 40 appearances each at first base, second base, and third base.\n2017.\nThe Cardinals made Carpenter their primary first baseman to begin the 2017 season. He served a one-game suspension on April 25 of a series opener versus the Toronto Blue Jays for having bumped umpire John Tumpane two days prior, when he had been ejected for arguing a pair of called strikes in the seventh inning. Carpenter hit a walk-off grand slam, and the first grand slam of his career, in the 11th inning of an 8−4 victory, in the first game of a split double-header versus the Blue Jays on April 27. He homered on May 14 versus Arrieta, then with the Cubs, to end an 0-for-28 and nine-strikeout slump in their matchups. On May 17 versus the Boston Red Sox, Carpenter's sacrifice fly to shortstop Xander Bogaerts—the third of his career to the shortstop position—made him the only player since at least 1970 to accomplish the feat.\nAfter experiencing tightness in his right quadriceps on July 23 versus the Cubs, Carpenter exited the game. He was removed from the lineup on August 23 versus the San Diego Padres due to an illness. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey flooding Greater Houston in late August, Carpenter announced that he would donate $10,000 to relief efforts for every homer he hit for the rest of the season. At the time, he had hit 17 in 121 games. Both Wainwright and the Cardinals offered to match his pledge. On September 5, an MRI of his shoulder revealed inflammation without significant damage. Carpenter walked a career-high 109 times in 2017, ranking second in the NL. For the season, he had the lowest ground ball percentage of all major league hitters (26.9%). Over 145 games for the 2017 season, Carpenter batted .241/.384/.451 with 23 home runs and 69 RBIs.\nWhile batting leadoff, Carpenter continued to produce at an elite level: in 2017, he attained a .418 OBP. Over 2,191 career plate appearances through 2017 while leading off, he slashed .291/.391/.487 with park-adjusted runs created (WRC+) of 142, or 42 percent above the league average. However as Matheny continued to utilize him in other spots in the batting order to attempt to increase the overall productivity of the Cardinals' lineup, the results were significantly inferior. Over 1,044 plate appearances, Carpenter went.243/.343/.395 with 104 WRC+. Because Carpenter did not permanently bat as the leadoff hitter, widespread debate and questioning of Matheny's decisions ensued.\nFollowing the season, an MRI on Carpenter's shoulder again revealed inflammation without further damage. It was determined that surgery was not necessary and an offseason of rest would be sufficient for recuperation.\n2018.\nThe 2018 season commenced with Carpenter laboring through one of the deepest hitting slumps of his career: through May 15, he batted .140 with a .558 OPS, ranking 157th of 163 hitters who had qualified for the batting title. However that period of time was not without highlights for Carpenter. On April 10, he hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning versus the Brewers, capping a 5−3 victory. He hit his 100th career home run on May 1, a game-tying hit in the ninth inning versus Joakim Soria of the Chicago White Sox, which the Cardinals eventually won, 3−2. On June 26, Carpenter became the first player in Cardinals history to attain five hits, five runs scored, and two home runs in one game, in an 11–2 victory over ace Corey Kluber and the Cleveland Indians. From May 15 until July 20 — a span of 214 at bats — Carpenter hit 20 home runs, 24 doubles, and .738 SLG. Meanwhile his improved performance garnered nomination as one of five finalists for the NL Final Vote to play in the All-Star Game, which the Brewers' Jesús Aguilar won.\nDuring a matchup on July 20 at Wrigley Field versus the Chicago Cubs, Carpenter's three home runs and two doubles contributed to him tying or setting multiple records, while amassing all five hits and seven RBI within the first six innings of an 18−5 rout. He became the first player in Cardinal franchise history, and second in Major League history, to hit three home runs and two doubles in a single game, following Kris Bryant of the Cubs. One of Carpenter's home runs was leading off the game, passing Lou Brock for the franchise record with five in one season. Carpenter also tied Mark Whiten's club record with 16 total bases, which he generated in his landmark four home run game in 1993. Carpenter was removed from the game after the sixth inning. On July 22, he was named NL Player of the Week after batting .529 with six home runs and a 1.706 slugging percentage during St. Louis' five-game set in Chicago.\nOn July 31, 2018, at Busch Stadium versus the Colorado Rockies Carpenter hit his 22nd career leadoff home run, breaking Brock's franchise record for most career leadoff home runs. Meanwhile, Carpenter won his first career Player of the Month Award, having hit a major league-leading 11 home runs in July. He also batted .333/.447/.774, raising his season OPS from .871 to .960. He later set a career high in home runs with 29 before being named Player of the Week again on August 6. That week's production included 11-for-35, four home runs, seven runs scored, two doubles and eight walks, while extending an on-base streak to 24 games. His resurgent performance gained national attention as an MVP candidate, having established himself as the league leader in doubles, home runs, slugging percentage, OPS, and Fangraphs WAR in early August. However, Carpenter faltered in September, batting just .170 and hitting only one home run.\nCarpenter finished the 2018 campaign batting .257 with 36 home runs and 81 RBI in 156 games. He had the highest percentage of hard-hit batted balls in the majors (49.0%), and for the second season in a row, he had the lowest ground ball percentage of all major league hitters (26.4%). Over 564 at bats, the entire season elapsed with Carpenter having avoided grounding into a double play, making him the first Cardinal to achieve the feat with at least 550 at-bats.\n2019.\nOn April 10, 2019, Carpenter signed a two-year, $39 million contract extension to remain with the Cardinals. The deal included a vesting option for 2022 worth $18.5 million by reaching 1,100 plate appearances in 2019–20.\nFrom September 9, 2017, to April 14, 2019, Carpenter hit 43 home runs between grounding into double plays, a record until surpassed by Byron Buxton in 2022.\nCarpenter struggled to begin the 2019 season. Through July 2, he was hitting .216/.325/.381 with ten home runs, and was placed on the injured list with a lower back strain that same day. He was activated on July 11, but placed back on the IL after fouling a ball off of his foot. He was reinstated from the IL on August 4. Overall, Carpenter hit .226/.334/.392 with 15 home runs and 46 RBIs over 129 games.\n2020.\nIn the pandemic-shortened 60-game season in 2020, Carpenter appeared in 50 games, with new career-lows in his entire slash line of .186/.325/.314.\n2021.\nCarpenter entered the 2021 season as a backup and bench player after the Cardinals acquired third baseman Nolan Arenado and announced that Tommy Edman would be the primary second baseman. On May 15, 2021, in the bottom of the 7th inning against the San Diego Padres, Carpenter made his first appearance pitching. He gave up an RBI single to Austin Nola, before getting Brian O’Grady to pop out to end the inning. For the 2021 season, Carpenter batted .169/.305/.275 with three home runs and 21 RBIs over 207 at-bats.\nFollowing the season's end, the Cardinals declined Carpenter's option for the 2022 season, making him a free agent for the first time in his career.\nCarpenter, frustrated with how his career in Saint Louis ended, reached out to former NL Central rival Joey Votto, on how to resurge his career like Votto did following the shorted 2020 season. After taking notes and advice from Votto, Carpenter pledged in that off-season he would travel around the country in order to fix his swing. He spent time in Baton Rouge, LA., Santa Clarita. CA., and finally in Stillwater, OK., with a trusted former teammate. Carpenter eventually went to Marruci and later found out switching the type of bat he used, would ultimately improve his swing and therefore his production. \nTexas Rangers (2022).\nOn March 18, 2022, Carpenter signed a minor-league contract with the Texas Rangers with an invitation to major-league spring training. Carpenter did not make the Rangers' Opening Day roster, and he accepted an assignment with the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On May 19, 2022, the Rangers released Carpenter after he batted .275 with six home runs over 21 games.\nNew York Yankees (2022).\nOn May 26, 2022, the New York Yankees signed Carpenter to a major-league contract. On June 12, Carpenter became the first Yankee to hit six or more home runs in his first 10 games with the team. That day, he tied his career high with seven RBI, while hitting two home runs with a double and a walk to lead a defeat of the Chicago Cubs, 18–4. Carpenter broke a team record for home runs in a player's first 30 games with the Yankees, hitting two three-run home runs against the Red Sox on July 16; his total of 13 homers broke the team record previously set by Kevin Maas in 1990 and Glenallen Hill in 2000. He became the first Yankees outfielder with seven RBIs in a game against the Red Sox since Joe DiMaggio accomplished the feat in 1940.\nDuring his tenure on the Yankees, Carpenter served as a utility player, far exceeding offensive expectations from manager Aaron Boone. On July 18, 2022, Carpenter was named AL Player of the Week, succeeding teammate Aaron Judge. On August 8, Carpenter fouled a pitch off his left foot, breaking it and putting him on the injured list for an estimated 6–8 weeks. Carpenter returned from the injured list for the 2022 postseason, going 1-12 with 9 strikeouts and 0 walks over 6 games played.\nSan Diego Padres (2023).\nOn December 20, 2022, Carpenter signed a one-year, $6.5 million contract with the San Diego Padres that included a $5 million player option for a second year. He hit .176 in 76 games for the Padres in 2023 with five homers and 31 RBI. He exercised his player option for the 2024 season.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Padres traded Carpenter and Ray Kerr with cash considerations to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Drew Campbell. He was released by the Braves three days later.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2024–present).\nOn January 19, 2024, Carpenter signed a one-year contract with the Cardinals.\nPersonal life.\nWhen he was in high school, Matt Carpenter was given a framed poster of Lance Berkman, his childhood hero and also his teammate from 2011–12. The poster was a gift from his now-wife, Mackenzie (Detmore) Carpenter. Carpenter and Mackenzie attended the same High School, where they began to date. After becoming engaged in May 2011, the couple were married on December 10, 2011, in Missouri City, Texas. Jake Arrieta served as a groomsman. The Carpenters' first child, a daughter, was born May 25, 2016. Mackenzie gave birth to their second child, a boy, on November 20, 2017.\nCarpenter is a Christian. He has said, “There was so much relief in [surrendering my life to Christ]. From that point on, literally, like it changed me. … The game of baseball I have no control over. The game of life I have no control over. All I have is my faith. If you’re looking for some solid ground or some rock to hold onto, there’s only one way and that’s through Him.” When Carpenter had elbow surgery at Texas Christian University, he stated that he leaned on his faith during that tough time. \"But when you have something taken away from you, it really opens up your eyes to what’s really important, and it took me leaning on my faith to get to the point where I could play the game again.\"\nKnown for being one of the few major leaguers to not wear batting gloves during games, Carpenter has said that he has not worn them in organized baseball except for one game during college in Colorado Springs while visiting Air Force. His right palm shows the effects of not wearing gloves; he has many calluses and small cuts.\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey flooding the Greater Houston area in 2017, Carpenter pledged to donate $10,000 to the flooding victims for every home run he hit the remainder of the season."

        "text": "Michael Robert McQueen (August 30, 1950 – October 9, 2017) was a professional baseball pitcher. He pitched all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball between 1969 and 1974 for the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds.\nCareer.\nBraves.\nMcQueen was drafted out of Spring Branch High School by the Braves in the fourth round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft. He began his professional career with the Magic Valley Cowboys of the Pioneer League, but was soon promoted to the Double-A Shreveport Braves.\nMcQueen missed most of the 1969 season, appearing in just four games for Shreveport. Despite this, he was chosen to start on October 2, the last game of the regular season, for the major league Braves. He pitched just three innings, giving up one run on two hits, walking three batters and striking out three. At age 19, he was the youngest player to appear in the major leagues that year.\nThe next season, McQueen started the year with the Triple-A Richmond Braves. He was again recalled to Atlanta in early June, where he was used out of the bullpen for most of the season. He was moved into the starting rotation in September, and his last appearance of the season was a complete game victory over the Reds.\nIn 1971, McQueen opened the season with Atlanta, again pitching mostly out of the bullpen. That spring, Hank Aaron compared McQueen to Warren Spahn Unfortunately, McQueen missed large chunks of the season to injury, appearing in just 17 games, winning four of them. That would turn out to be his career high.\nMcQueen suffered through another injury-plagued campaign in 1972, posting an 0–5 record in 23 games. He missed the entire 1973 season because of a hip dislocation resulting from a December 20, 1972 traffic collision near Uvalde, Texas. The automobile carrying McQueen and teammate Jim Breazeale was struck head-on by a car with a driver who attempted to pass a semi-trailer truck.\nRemaining career.\nWorking on a comeback in 1974, McQueen was taken off the Braves' 40-man roster. He was selected by the Reds from the Richmond Braves in the Rule 5 draft on December 3, 1973. He began the year in the Reds' bullpen. After appearing in 10 games and posting a 5.40 earned run average, McQueen was sent back to the Braves on July 1. He spent a month in Richmond, then was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on August 7 for a minor league pitcher. He appeared in just four more games that season.\nMcQueen was let go by the Orioles, and he sat out both the 1975 and 1976 seasons. In 1977, he decided to give baseball another chance, and he signed with the Houston Astros. He started out in A-ball with the Cocoa Astros, where he posted a 1.93 ERA in 28.1 innings, earning a promotion to Double-A Columbus. Things went downhill quickly, as he posted an ERA of 6.50 in 14 games, at which point he left professional baseball. Overall, from 1969 to 1974 McQueen appeared in 73 games as a pitcher, making 19 starts for the Braves and Reds.\nMcQueen died at age 67 in Batesville, Arkansas."

The competition was held from August 7 to 8 1984. 63 fencers from 26 nations competed. Each nation was limited to 3 fencers. The event was won by Philippe Boisse of France, the nation's first victory in the men's individual épée since 1928 and fourth overall (second-most after Italy's six). France also took bronze, with Philippe Riboud winning the bronze medal match after losing to Boisse in the semifinals. It was Riboud's second consecutive bronze medal in the event, making him the 10th man to earn multiple medals in the individual épée. Silver went to Björne Väggö of Sweden. Hungary's four-Games podium streak in the event ended due to that nation joining the Soviet-led boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nOne of the six finalists from 1980 returned: bronze medalist Philippe Riboud of France.

There were three pool rounds: \nThe second phase was a truncated double-elimination tournament. Four fencers advanced to the final round through the winners brackets and four more advanced via the repechage.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. (This was changed from a 6-man final round-robin pool in previous years.)\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination and final rounds were to 10 touches."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1984 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twentieth appearance of the event. The competition was held from August 3 to 4, 1984. 33 fencers from 16 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Jean-François Lamour of France, the nation's first victory in the event since 1900 (and second overall). Marco Marin of Italy took silver and Peter Westbrook of the United States took bronze. It was the first medal in the event in many Games for each of the three nations since 1964 for France, since 1960 for Italy, and since 1904 for the United States), as the men's sabre competitions had been dominated by Hungary and the Soviet Union. With both of those nations boycotting the 1984 Games, other nations had an opportunity to win medals in the sabre.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. None of the finalists from 1980 returned; five of the six were from boycotting countries and Michele Maffei (at age 38) was no longer on the Italian team. All three of the world champions since the 1980 Games had been from boycotting nations as well. The favorite was rising French star Jean-François Lamour, a seven-time French champion who had never placed better than fifth in a global championship—though this time he would be facing Italians and Romanians rather than Soviets and Hungarians.\nThe People's Republic of China, Monaco, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 18th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 Olympics.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1984 tournament used a three-phase format similar to that of 1976 and 1980, though the final phase was different.\nThe first phase was a multi-round round-robin pool play format; each fencer in a pool faced each other fencer in that pool once. There were three pool rounds: \nThe second phase was a truncated double-elimination tournament. Four fencers advanced to the final round through the winners brackets and four more advanced via the repechage.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. (This was changed from a 6-man final round-robin pool in previous years.)\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination and final rounds were to 10 touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 Pool E.\nAllam did not start.\nRound 1 Pool F.\nKo did not start."

Williams played two matches for Wales, against New Zealand in 1924 and England in 1925.\nPersonal history.\nWilliams was born in Llangennech in 1898, becoming a collier on leaving school. He served in the Royal Navy during the First World War, and on return to civilian duties he joined the Glamorgan Constabulary. He died at the age of 32, shortly after his marriage.\nRugby career.\nWilliams first played rugby as a schoolboy, representing Llangennech School, before progressing to the Llangennech club. He switched to first-class side Llanelli, and while at the club he was first selected for the Wales national side in a game against the 1924 touring New Zealanders. Initially the Aberavon forward, Bob Randall, had been the preferred choice as hooker, but withdrew with a knee injury, allowing Williams to take his place. The match was a one-sided affair with Wales outclassed in speed and combination, but the Welsh forwards worked tirelessly against a much heavier pack. The game ended 19-0 to New Zealand.\nJust three days later, on 2 December, Williams faced the New Zealand 'All Blacks' again, this time as part of his club team Llanelli. Williams, along with Albert Jenkins and Ernie Finch, who were also part of the Wales team that faced New Zealand, inspired the team in a close encounter. It was only some poor Llanelli kicking that cost the club team a victory over an exceptional touring side.\nWilliams won his second and final cap in the England encounter of the 1925 Five Nations Championship. The next season, Williams switched club to Cardiff, spending two years and making 39 appearances for the 'Blue and Blacks'. His time with the Royal Navy and Glamorgan Constabulary, saw him represent the rugby teams of both."

        "text": "England has a comprehensive league structure in place, including national fully professional leagues to amateur regional leagues.\nThe format and competitiveness of the leagues have changed greatly since their beginnings in 1987. Likewise the leagues started off amateur but professionalism has since been permitted. However, it has always had three or four national leagues with various regional and county leagues below.\nSunday Telegraph Merit Tables.\n\"The Sunday Telegraph\" published Merit Tables for the leading English clubs from the 1960s to the 1980s. The position of the clubs was based on the percentage of matches won with only matches against other clubs in the table counting.\nSunday Telegraph English Champions 1964 to 1987:\nPrecursor competitions.\nWhile there were experiments with county leagues in the north in the nineteenth century for most of rugby union's history there have been no organised leagues. The 1970s saw the creation of a national cup and a series of regional and county merit leagues (the most important of which being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit league).\nIn 1984 this was taken one step further with the creation of two national merit leagues for the top twenty four clubs (based around playing a minimum of sixteen fixtures against each other, a factor which led to Exeter's exclusion after consideration). The top division had three clubs from each of the major merit leagues. In these clubs had to play a minimum of eight fixtures against the other clubs in their division but it was largely based around pre-existing fixtures. There was a system of promotion and relegation between the Merit Tables. 1985 saw the addition of a third national merit table, albeit without promotion and relegation to the top two.\n1984–85 season.\nThe initial lineups of the merit tables was as follows:\nMerit Table A\nMerit Table B\nMerit Table A\nMerit Table B\n1985–86.\nThis year saw the creation of Merit Table C with the following clubs:\nFoundation of the national league system.\nIn 1987 the merit tables formed the basis of the top three divisions of the national league system. For the first season there were no fixed fixtures so clubs had to arrange their own (to a minimum of ten out of eleven opponents, only one game against each club could count). For the initial season there was no promotion and relegation between National 2 and National 3 but this was created for the following season. National 3 had a minimum of two clubs per region (with the top four clubs in the previous season's Merit Table C getting a guaranteed spot outside this quota) thus Roundhay missed out on a spot to Maidstone.\nIn 1988 clubs had their fixtures set by the league for them though still only played each other once.\nInitial composition of major leagues.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nArea League North\nArea League South\n1987–88 season.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nArea League North\nArea League South\n1988–89 season.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nArea League North\nArea League South\n1989–90 season.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nArea League North\nArea League South\n1990–91 season.\nFor the 1990–91 season all divisions were increased to 13 teams and the Area Leagues were renamed National 4 North and National 4 South.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nNational 4 North\nNational 4 South\n1991–92 season.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nNational 4 North\nNational 4 South\n1992–93 season.\nNational 1\nNational 2\nNational 3\nNational 4 North\nNational 4 South\nIntroduction of home and away fixtures.\n1993–94 season.\nThe 1993–94 season saw the reduction in size of the national divisions to 10 teams and the creation of a new National 4 division.

        "text": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 1990 were the tenth European kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization and the first ever to be held in Spain. The event was open to amateur men and women from twenty-four countries across Europe, with four styles on offer; Full-Contact (men only), Semi-Contact, Light-Contact and Musical Forms (men only), with women participating in Light-Contact for the first time ever. Each country was allowed one competitor per weight division per category, although fighters could take part in more than one style. By the end of the championships, Great Britain was the top nation in terms of medals won, with West Germany second and Italy third. The event was held over three days in Madrid, Spain, from Friday 16 November to Sunday 18 November, 1990. \nFull-Contact.\nAt Madrid Full-Contact was available to men only and was made up of ten weight divisions ranging from 54 kg/118.8 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. All bouts were fought under Full-Contact kickboxing rules - more detail on the rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that they may have changed slightly since 1990. The most notable winner was future pro boxer Przemysław Saleta who added to the gold medal he had won at the European championships at the beginning of the year by claiming gold in the -91 kg category. By the end of the championships CIS was the top nation in Full-Contact, winning two golds, one silver and two bronze medals. \nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact was available to both men and women in Madrid. Semi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1990. The men had seven weight classes, starting at 57 kg/125.4 lbs and ending at over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, while the women's competition had four weight classes beginning at 50 kg/110 lbs and ending at over 60 kg/132 lbs. The most notable winner was Abidin Uz who won his second gold medal at Madrid, having picked up a gold in Light-Contact as well. By the end of the championships Great Britain was by far the most successful nation in Semi-Contact, picking up five gold, two silvers and one bronze in the male and female categories. \nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact in Madrid was available to men and, for the first time ever at a W.A.K.O. championships, to women. Involving more physical contact than Semi but less so than Full, points were awarded on the basis of speed and technique over power. Light-Contact was also seen by some as an intermediate stage for kickboxers who were considering a move from Semi to Full-Contact. More information on Light-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1990. Like Semi-Contact, the men had seven weight classes, starting at 57 kg/125.4 lbs and ending at over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, while the women had four weight classes beginning at 50 kg/110 lbs and ending at over 60 kg/132 lbs. The most notable winner was Abidin Uz who won his second gold medal at Madrid, having picked up a gold in Semi-Contact as well. By the championships end, Hungary was the most successful nation in Light-Contact, winning three golds and two bronzes.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms was open to men only at Madrid. Musical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information can be accessed on the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1990. Musical Forms at these championships was not well documented and several winners are absent, but from the existing records it would appear that the Netherlands were the most successful nation with one gold and one silver.

The race took place on May 21, 2005, and was televised in the United States on the NBC television network. Afleet Alex, who was jockeyed by Jeremy Rose, won the race by four and three quarter lengths over runner-up Scrappy T. Approximate post time was 6:21 p.m. Eastern Time. The race was run over a fast track in a final time of 1:55.04. The Maryland Jockey Club reported total attendance of 125,687, this is recorded as second highest on the list of American thoroughbred racing top attended events for North America in 2005.\nRace description.\nScrappy T broke well and went to the early lead, then was overtaken by High Limit and Going Wild who set a reasonably fast pace. Afleet Alex settled behind the leaders, then started his move on the far turn, racing wide to pass other horses. Scrappy T retook the lead as they rounded into the stretch, but his jockey Ramon Domínguez looked back and saw that Afleet Alex was gaining ground on the outside. Dominguez swung the whip left-handed and Scrappy T swerved sharply away, directly into the path of Afleet Alex. The two horses clipped heels and Afleet Alex stumbled to his knees, his nose nearly touching the ground. \"I thought for sure we were going down\", said Jeremy Rose, the jockey of Afleet Alex. \"The thought process was I was going to get run over. The instinct was just to hang on and try to get my balance back.\"\nThe crowd gasped, but Afleet Alex regained his balance and was quickly back into stride. Rose, a young jockey who was riding in the Preakness for the first time, was credited for skill in staying on, but gave the credit to Afleet Alex. \"He was just that athletic, and I was just that scared\", he said. Scrappy T had reopened his lead after the incident but Afleet Alex soon ran him down and pulled away to win by lengths.\n\"Over 30 years, I've seen some horses take some bad steps in races and still win\", said trainer Tim Ritchey. \"I've never seen a horse stumble that badly and lose his momentum that much to come back on and win in a grade I race like this.\" Veteran sportswriter Steve Haskin wrote that it \"remains arguably the single most athletic feat by a Thoroughbred seen in many years.\"\nPayout.\nThe 130th Preakness Stakes Payout Schedule"

After retiring as a professional player and leaving his position on the WPBSA, he served as the mayor of Ollerton and Boughton between 2009 and 2010.

In 2022, it was confirmed that Ferguson would continue serving as chairman for at least four more years.\nPlaying career.\nFerguson turned professional in 1990. Two years later he qualified for the World Snooker Championships, losing in the first round, and reached the last 16 of the UK Championship.

Ferguson was at the time ranked #56 in the world. He was criticised for endorsing the board's decision to fire chief executive Jim McKenzie one week after becoming chairman.\nAfter several years away from the post, Ferguson was re-elected as chairman of the WPBSA following a board meeting in July 2010. He survived a vote of confidence in December 2010 by a margin of 31 votes to three.

This tournament is still held each year and with no doubt it is the oldest lacrosse tournament in the Continental Europe.\nFor the second beginning, the exact date and place is known – it was May 9, 1986 when some players of Czech (one-handed) lacrosse gathered at Prague’s Hvězda Open Air Arena to experience a new version of their beloved sport. Many of them had hand-made fiber glass sticks which could not survive the demands imposed by players’ enthusiasm. Just few players owned or even saw a real lacrosse stick. But it did not matter, a new passion was born.\nNext year, four teams of which three (TJ Malešice, LCC Radotín and Plzeň) are still active formed a local box lacrosse league played ever since (today called National Box Lacrosse League).\nA visit of Quebec’s Pierre Fillion, an inventor of intercrosse, and his group of players in 1987 provided another momentum to the development of lacrosse in the former Czechoslovakia not only because Canadians donated sixty wooden sticks to the local players.\nShortly after this visit, an English field lacrosse team led by the former ELF president Peter Mundy arrived to Prague in 1988 to promote field lacrosse behind the Iron Curtain. Czech lacrosse representatives recognized that field lacrosse was more common version of lacrosse at the international level and pursued to equalize the focus between both versions of the game. Czech field lacrosse league (National Field Lacrosse League as it has been called since 2006) was initiated in 1992, attended by four teams LC Jižní Město, TJ Malešice, LC Plzeň and LCC Radotín. The Czech Republic was also the constituting member of the European Lacrosse Federation in 1995.\nAt the international level, the Czech field lacrosse team made its first appearance in the Manchester World Cup’s First Division in 1994 and attended every World Championship ever since. In 1995, the first European Lacrosse Championship was held in Prague and the Czech team ended as runner-up.\nIn 2003, the Czech team attended the first World Box (Indoor) Lacrosse Championship in Canada and went home with 5 losses and no win. Only 8 years later, almost exactly 25 years after the first box lacrosse match played in the Czech Republic, the World Box (Indoor) Lacrosse Championship was held in Prague and the Czechs reached their best position ever in their preferred and beloved game when reached the semifinals as the best team from Europe.\nIn 2017 at first ever European Box Lacrosse Championships that was held in Turku, Finland, the team of the Czech Republic performed very well and they journey to become European Champions was stopped by Israelis in the final game. Despite this heartbreaking loss just by one goal, the Czechs confirmed their box lacrosse dominance in Europe.\nCzech women made their debut at the international level in 1993 when the national team participated at the Women's World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland and reached 8th place. Czech players then participate at World Championships in 2005 (Annapolis, USA), 2009 (Prague, Czech Republic) and in 2017 (Guilford, England) and always reached Top 10.\nLeagues.\nBox Lacrosse\nField Lacrosse\nWomen's lacrosse\nIntercrosse\nCzech lacrosse (one-handed)"

        "text": "The 1998 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team. The New Zealand national rugby league team defeated Great Britain 2–0 in the three match test series.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand arrived in Great Britain for the first time since the 1995 World Cup, having already lost a test series 1–2 with Australia. It was the first full tour of Great Britain by a New Zealand side since 1993.\nMany of the squad, including coach Frank Endacott, had been involved in the Auckland Warriors' 1998 season, where they had finished 15th out of 20 clubs. In addition to this the Auckland Rugby League were looking to sell the club during the tour.\nSquad.\nThe squad included two sets of brothers; the Iros, Kevin and Tony and the Pauls, Robbie and Henry.\nFixtures.\nThey won the first two test matches 22–16 and 36–16 before being held to a 23-all draw in the third and final test match. Australian referee Bill Harrigan controlled all three Test matches.\nIn the second test match Great Britain were ahead 16–8 at halftime before letting in 28 points in the second half to lose the match and the series.\nAftermath.\nNew Zealand next competed against Great Britain in the 1999 Tri-Nations but did not tour Great Britain again until the 2000 World Cup. The next full tour was conducted in 2002 which saw a drawn test series 1-all.\nThe Auckland Warriors were sold to a consortium that included majority investor the Tainui tribe as well as Graham Lowe and Malcolm Boyle. Kiwi coach Frank Endacott was replaced as Warriors coach and several Kiwis left the club included Stephen Kearney, Quentin Pongia, and Kevin Iro. Endacott's next coaching assignment would be the 1999 ANZAC Test on 23 April."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades",
        "text": "Playing Major League Baseball in four decades has been attained by only 31 players in the league's history, dating from the 1870s to the present day.\nIntroduction.\nSince 1900 (the first year that a player could play in a \"fourth decade\"), every completed decade except the 1910s has added at least one player to the list.\nOutside of skill and durability, a player must usually have some \"generational luck\" to have started his career in the later years of a decade, so that if he is still playing 21–24 years later, he is playing in the early years of a fourth decade. For example, Albert Pujols started his career in 2001, so he would have had to play 30 seasons to make the list. Whereas Bill Buckner, whose career started in the last year of the 1960s, finished his career in the first year of the 1990s, requiring only 22 seasons to make the list. Most of the players on the list started their careers in the final or second-to-last year of their first decade and finished their careers in the first or second year of their fourth decade (a notable exception is Nolan Ryan, whose 27 seasons played is a major league record). \nAlthough it has always been possible for a retired three-decade player to make a cameo appearance in a fourth decade for the purpose of joining the list, the only player to have actually done this was Minnie Miñoso, who took the field twice for his former team, the White Sox, at the ages of 50 and 54 as part of a publicity stunt organized by owners Bill and Mike Veeck. Such a stunt has become less likely in the modern era after the introduction of the 40 man roster and league minimum salaries.\nFive-decade players.\nMinnie Miñoso, Nick Altrock and Satchel Paige are the only three players to have appeared in major league baseball games in five different decades. None were continuously active at the MLB level; Altrock was a coach on the Washington Senators and appeared sparingly over just seventeen games in a twenty-two season span from 1912-1933, while Satchel Paige spent significant time in the minors during his 40 years in professional baseball. \nPaige was added to the list post mortem, due to Major League Baseball incorporating Negro league records (and thus his career in the 1920s and 1930s) into its own history in 2021. Paige was just one of at least a dozen Negro League players whose careers spanned four decades, or more. Candy Jim Taylor's career as a full-time player began in 1904 and ended in the mid-1930s, but he made a handful of appearances while managing in the Negro American League in the 1940s. Hence, like Paige, Taylor qualifies as a five-decade player.\nPre-National League four-decade players.\nMajor League Baseball recognizes the first major league season as 1876, the inaugural season of the National League. The following three players played parts of their careers in the 1850s and 1860s, and do not qualify as four-decade players, although they played four decades at the highest level of play available to them at the time: Joe Start (1859-1886), Candy Nelson (1867-1890), and Deacon White (1868-1890).\nThe National Association is widely recognized as a precursor to modern major league baseball. It existed from 1871 to 1875, before giving way to the National League in 1876. One four-decade player, Jim O'Rourke began his career in 1872 with the National Association's Middletown Mansfields.\nNegro Leagues four-decade players.\nAfrican Americans have played professionally since 1878 when Bud Fowler first played professionally, although he had been playing since at least 1877 and possibly as early as 1872. Major League Baseball does not consider any players or leagues prior to 1920 to be Major league players. The following players played four decades at the highest level of play possible to them at the time: Bud Fowler (1878-1904), Clarence Williams (1886-1913), Candy Jim Taylor (1904-1942) (as noted above), Smokey Joe Williams (1905-1932), John Henry Lloyd (1906-1932), Pelayo Chacón (1908-1931), Oscar Charleston (1915-1941), José Fernández (1915-1947), George Britt (1917-1942), and Bill Holland (1919-1941). Taylor also played at the highest level possible to him for five decades.\nFuture candidates.\nIt is now unlikely that the 2020s will add any players to the list as none who debuted in the 1990s has played past 2019. Near misses include Rick Ankiel (debuted 1999), who ended his attempt at a comeback in 2019, Adrian Beltre (born 1979), who made his debut in 1998, but retired after the 2018 season, and Bartolo Colón (debuted 1997) whose reported interest in pitching for the New York Mets in 2022 came to nothing. Colón did manage to play national championship baseball during four different decades, with 11 games for the Mexican League's Acereros de Monclova in 2021.\nBaseball-Reference.com lists 19 still-active players who debuted in 2009 or earlier and have a chance to make the list by playing until 2030. The youngest is Madison Bumgarner, born in 1989, who will turn 41 in 2030.\nList of players.\nThe players are listed by primary position played and years spanning their careers. Fifteen players from the group have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Of the 31 players, 12 were primarily pitchers, six were primarily catchers, seven were primarily outfielders, and six were primarily infielders; the group covers virtually the complete range of baseball positions, missing only a third baseman."

        "text": "Keith Bradshaw (7 April 1939 – 2 February 2014) was a international rugby union player. He was capped nine times for Wales, and at club level played for Bridgend.\nRugby career.\nBradshaw first played rugby at club level for his home town team of Cefn Cribwr RFC. He later played for Tondu before switching to first-class team Bridgend. Bradshaw was first selected to represent Wales in the opening encounter of the 1964 Five Nations Championship, played against England at Twickenham. Bradshaw was paired at centre with Llanelli's Ken Jones, in a game that ended in a 6-6 draw.\nBradshaw retained his place for the rest of the 1964 tournament, and in his second game, a home fixture with Scotland, he scored his first international points for Wales with a try, a conversion and a penalty goal, in a convincing win. He was on the score sheet for the next match, when away against Ireland he successfully converted all three Welsh tries. Wales won 15-6. The last game of the 1964 Championship was a home match against France, but their form shown against the Home Nations left the team, and they struggled to keep up with a poor French team. At one point, France were eight points in front, and only some fine place-kicking from Bradshaw (with a conversion and two penalties) allowed the team to snatch a draw.\nIn May 1964, Bradshaw was chosen as part of the Welsh squad to tour Africa, the first team from Wales to play outside Europe. Bradshaw was given kicking duties, scoring four conversions and a penalty against East Africa and then, in the only Test of the tour, he scored the only Welsh points, with a single penalty, in a humiliating 24-3 loss against South Africa.\nIn the 1964/65 season Bradshaw was made captain of the senior Bridgend team. Bradshaw failed to play for Wales in the 1965 Championship, but the next year he played in all four games of the 1966 tournament. Wales beat England and Scotland, Bradshaw scoring a conversion in the Scottish encounter. Despite scoring a penalty goal for Wales in the Ireland game, the Welsh team were beaten 6-9, leaving the team needing a win over France to secure the Championship title. The France encounter was an exciting contest filled with incident. Bradshaw kicked two penalties to bring Wales back into the game after France built up an eight-point lead in the first 12 minutes; then Stuart Watkins intercepted a French pass in their own 25, completing a 70-yard run to score the winning try. Wales took the match and the Championship. This was Bradshaw's final international game.\nPersonal history.\nBradshaw was born in Cefn Cribwr in 1939, and was educated at Ogmore Grammar School. He was employed as a draughtsman for the National Coal Board, before becoming a schoolmaster. His son, Chris, also played rugby, for Bridgend and Swansea and was named the 'Bill Everson Man of the Tournament' in the 1991 Snelling Sevens competition.\nOn 2 February 2014, he died at the age of 74 after a long illness."

They lost in the quarterfinals (which was also the first round back then) to Duquesne.\nAs a junior, White averaged 10.2 points per game. Then, as a senior in 1941–42, he averaged 9.5 per game. That year he received the Haggerty Award, which is an annual award given since 1935–36 to the best male collegiate basketball player in the New York City metropolitan area.\nHe played one season of professional basketball with the Elizabeth Braves in the American Basketball League. He eventually became a businessman and served as vice-president of NBC Television. In 1992, he was inducted into St. John's University Athletic Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Barbados Cricket Buckle",
        "text": "The Barbados Cricket Buckle is a repoussé engraving on a belt buckle of a slave playing cricket in Barbados circa 1780–1810.\nIt is believed to be the only known image of a slave playing cricket and is thought to be the oldest surviving artifact depicting cricket outside the British Isles.\n\"That the belt buckle depicts the slave, unmistakably in bondage, with bat in hand, suggests that the creator must have detected in their cricketing endeavours the germ of the quest for self-expression, if not liberation.\" Professor Clem Seecharan, Muscular Education.\nHistory.\nThe Buckle was found in 1979 in a gravel spit in the River Tweed, close to the Anglo-Scottish border, by an English holiday-maker, Clive Williams, a retired advertising consultant from London, with a metal detector. It depicts a \"well-muscled mulatto, probably the offspring of a white overseer and a black slave mother\" at the wicket being bowled out. He is carrying a spliceless bat and wears a slave collar around his neck. To his left a wattle and daub slave hut can be seen and to the right a windmill processing sugarcane by a Caribbean royal palm tree. The engraving is believed to be portraiture although the identity of the slave, if intended as a specific depiction, is unknown. Metallurgical analysis of the Buckle by Oxford University placed its manufacture in the \"early Victorian period or before\".\nThe earliest dated reference to cricket in Barbados is 1806, however cricket had been played in \"all the West Indian islands from a quite early time\". Freed slaves played cricket from the mid-18th century and there are several existing reports of plantation owners encouraging slaves to play cricket.\nBarbados suffered a highly destructive hurricane in October 1780 which obliterated most palms, windmills and slave huts. The Buckle engraving predates that event. However the three stumps on the Buckle would indicate a date after 1777, when the middle stump was added to the wicket, which had previously had only two stumps.\nMilitary connection.\nAn analysis by the University of Oxford revealed the buckle to be made of \"navy brass\" (90% copper and 10% zinc). British sailors and soldiers were, for the most part, responsible for exporting cricket out of Great Britain and around Britain's colonial empire. According to Bowen, \"Recreation had to be found for troops and sailors; cricket was an ideal source of it.\" As noted by historian Hilary Beckles, the first references to cricket matches played in Barbados (as reported on by the Barbadian press) reported that they were done so by soldiers and sailors who \"played at cricket as a principle stress relieving activity – one that allowed them to 'play being at home' whilst being away from home\".\nThe location of the Buckle in the River Tweed suggested that it may have been owned and originally commissioned by a member of the Hotham family whose estate was upstream, specifically William Hotham, a Royal Navy officer who had been stationed in Barbados from 1779 to 1780. The Hothams were also noted cricketers who were known as \"the lucky hits of Westminster\".\nIn 1838, James Kelly noted the significance of friendly \"mutual confidence and familiarity\" between British sailors and Afro-Caribbean slaves, so much so that \"In the presence of the sailor the Negro feels a man\".\nThe Buckle, Cricket and Slavery.\nThere has been much debate about the origins of cricket in the West Indies and the role that cricket (a game exported with a \"made in England\" hallmark) has played in subjugation and emancipation. In his book 40 Million Dollar Slaves, William C. Rhoden recognised that: \"In play the slave could become master; the powerless could become powerful. Athletic competition or a mere athletic feat ... cutting cane ...was a free space where bodies bound and scarred by chains could soar\". Although focused on US slaves, Rhoden's comments are apposite for the experience of slaves in all nations.\nIn the first chapter of his book \"Muscular Learning\", Professor Clem Seecharan reflects at some length on the importance of the Barbados Cricket Buckle recognising that its depiction on a Barbados postage stamp on the 60th anniversary of West Indies cricket was appropriate given cricket's role as a \"political instrument\" from slavery through emancipation to independence.\nAlthough references to slavery and cricket are extremely rare they do exist. In reference to a diary entry by Jamaican slave owner Thistlewood that cricket was played in June 1778, Professor R Burton was prompted to wonder if the slaves tasked to retrieve the ball when it went beyond the boundary were becoming drawn into the game. This was echoed by Seecharan who notes that in Barbados, cricket was played in clearings in cane fields and slaves were tasked with retrieving the ball and throwing it back into play and points out that \"there are accounts of planters too encouraging slaves to play cricket\".\nThis encounter of slaves with cricket is supported by former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley in his extensive History of West Indies Cricket, writing that: \"the young sons of the slaves were required to bowl at the young sons of the slave owners or to the army officers\" adding \"of course the sons of the slaves practised batting in their spare time\".\nThe engraving on the Barbados Buckle depicts the point when slaves moved not merely within the boundary but to the batting crease itself. The point when they became, as C.L.R. James put it in Beyond a Boundary, \"that \"genus Britannicus\", a fine batsman\". Although the Buckle batsman is depicted as being clean bowled, Seecharan highlights the Buckle slave's role as batsman; noting that his possession of bat rather than ball is subversive.\nUses of the Buckle.\nThe Buckle has been featured on coins, stamps and cricket trophies.\nCoins.\nThe Central Bank of Barbados authorised the Royal Mint to strike a limited number of proof coins to mark the discovery of the Barbadian Buckle. The coins were minted at the Royal Mint in London.\nThe reverse of the coin bears a representation of the Barbados Cricket Buckle. A surrounding inscription reads \"International Cricket Buckle\". The obverse features the Barbados' Coat of Arms. The central element of this official emblem is a shield supported by a dolphin and a pelican. Two Pride of Barbados (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) flowers and one of the island's Bearded Fig Trees (ficus citrifolia) are depicted on the shield. Above the shield is a crest consisting of a raised forearm holding crossed sugar cane stalks above a helmet and mantling. A ribbon bears the inscription \"pride and industry\", the national motto of Barbados. The coins were finished with a proof with frosted relief.\nStamps.\nStamps featuring the Barbados Buckle (aka International Cricket Buckle) and key cricketers were issued by the respective Postmasters General for the countries of Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago on 6 June 1988.\nBarbados.\n101 of the 50c stamp were issued in error featuring a photograph of Edward Lawson \"Barto\" Bartlett instead of Herman Griffith. These errors were issued through Parcel Post Office in Bridgetown Barbados. All other postal counters had their stocks recovered before 9am on Monday 6 June 1988 and the corrected 50c stamps depicting Griffith were issued on 11 July 1988.\nTrophy.\nRepresentations of the Buckle provided the centrepiece of 3 trophies for the Cable &amp; Wireless West Indies-England Test matches and One Day Internationals 1990:\nBuckle Award for winners of One Day International Series 1990.\nWest Indies captain Desmond Haynes presented with silver gilt depiction of the Buckle. Presentation was made by Lord Sharp, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless at Kensington Oval Barbados. 3 April 1990."

        "text": "The 2011–12 Australian Baseball League season is the second Australian Baseball League (ABL) season, and is being held from 4 November 2011 to 12 February 2012. The season was scheduled to start on 3 November with a single game between the Perth Heat and the Adelaide Bite at Baseball Park in Perth, but the game was postponed due to wet weather.\nThe season consists of six teams competing in a 45-game schedule followed by a three-round postseason to determine the ABL champion. During the regular season, defending champions Perth Heat will participate in the 2011 Asia Series against the champions from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The 2011–12 champions will likewise qualify for the 2012 Asia Series.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the Perth Heat, Melbourne Aces, Adelaide Bite and Sydney Blue Sox progressed to the finals series, while the Brisbane Bandits and Canberra Cavalry were only eliminated from contention on the final day of the season. The Sydney Blue Sox eliminated the Adelaide Bite in the first round of the postseason, who were in turn eliminated by the Melbourne Aces in the second round. The Perth Heat defeated the Aces two games to one in the championship series, to win back–to–back ABL championships.\nChanges from 2010–11 season.\nEntry to Asia Series.\nAnnounced after the inaugural ABL season had been completed, the league's champions each season will be invited to the restarted Asia Series. The event had previously been contested between the winners of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Japan Series, Korea Professional Baseball's (KPB) Korean Series, Chinese Professional Baseball League's (CPBL) Taiwan Series, and China Baseball League's (CBL) championship series. The 2011 tournament will not feature the CBL's champions, but officials have stated that a team would participate in future editions. Unlike all four previous editions of the tournament which were held in Japan, the 2011 edition will be held in Taiwan. The tournament follows a round-robin format, where each team plays each other once. The top two teams then face each other in a single game to decide the champion.\nThe Asia Series is held in November, which would otherwise create a conflict for the ABL champion team as the following season would have already commenced. To avoid this, the League announced that during the 2011–12 season, the Perth Heat–2010–11 champions—would be scheduled to have a bye while competing in Taiwan.\nRegular season schedule.\nThe previous season included 40 games for each team and facing each team eight times, four at home and four on the road. This was expanded for the 2011–12 season to 45 games, by increasing one of the series between each team from four to five games, so that there were nine games between each team. This also resulted in three teams playing one more game at home than on the road, and the reverse for the other three teams.\nTo allow for Perth Heat's participation in the 2011 Asia Series, all six teams received a bye during the early rounds of the regular season. The Heat and Brisbane Bandits' bye was timed to line up with the tournament in round four, with the Adelaide Bite and Canberra Cavalry's bye in round three, and the Melbourne Aces and Sydney Blue Sox' bye in round five.\nTeams.\nVenues.\nEach of the six teams returned from the previous season, and continued to use the same grounds for their home games. The name of Sydney's home ground changed during the off season, changing from Blacktown Olympic Park to Blacktown International Sportspark Sydney, and the main baseball diamond in the complex being called Blue Sox Stadium.\nRosters.\nAs in the previous season, each team had an active roster of 22 players available each round. These players were drawn from 35-man squads. Each team had several foreign players in their squad, and each team included at least one player from the United States. Not counting Australia, there were players from eleven countries on the rosters of the teams participating.\nRegular season.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-Star Game.\nThe 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game, known as the 2011 ConocoPhillips Australia ABL All-Star Game due to naming rights sponsorship from ConocoPhillips, was the first exhibition game held by the Australian Baseball League (ABL) between Team Australia and a team of World All-Stars. The game was held on Wednesday, 21 December 2011 at Baseball Park in Perth, Western Australia, home of the Perth Heat. The players involved were selected from the rosters of the six ABL teams, with players not eligible for selection in the Australian team for international tournaments eligible for the World All-Stars.\nThe World All-Stars defeated Team Australia 8–5. Tyler Collins, designated hitter for the World All-Stars won the game's Most Valuable Player award.\nPostseason.\nFormat.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the postseason involved the teams in a three-round structure. The first- and second-place teams played each other in the major semi-final, the winner of which proceeded directly to the championship series and the loser to the preliminary final. The winner of the minor semi-final between the third- and fourth-place teams also qualified for the preliminary final, while the loser was eliminated. Likewise, the winner of the preliminary final qualified for the championship series, the loser being eliminated. Unlike the previous postseason, where each round consisted of a best-of-three game series, both of the semi-finals and the preliminary final will be played out over best-of-five game series. The championship series once again used a best-of-three game format.\nBracket.\nQualification.\nThe Perth Heat were the first team to clinch a postseason position when they defeated the Brisbane Bandits in Perth on 8 January, and then clinched a first place finish in their next game when they defeated the Canberra Cavalry in Canberra on 12 January. The three remaining positions in the postseason, and the teams that would take them, were not determined until the last game was finished. The Melbourne Aces finished a half-game ahead of a four-way tie between the Adelaide Bite, Brisbane Bandits, Canberra Cavalry and Sydney Blue Sox to secure the remaining spot in the major semi-final. The Bite and the Blue Sox finished third and fourth respectively after the ABL's tiebreakers were applied.\nUntil only a few hours before their final game of the season, Cavalry officials believed that regardless of the result in the game they would progress to the postseason based on their interpretation of the tiebreaking procedures. However they were informed by the League that was not the case. Canberra's interpretation was that once Adelaide were determined as having finished third, a separate tiebreaker would be held between themselves, Brisbane and Sydney and excluding Adelaide, which would have result in Canberra progressing. The actual process used was to continue with the next level of the tiebreaker as Brisbane and Sydney as they were still level after using the head-to-head records between the four teams. As Sydney had won their season series with Brisbane 5-4, Sydney claimed the final postseason position, Brisbane were left in fifth place, and Canberra in sixth."

        "text": "The 2007 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship was the second World Indoor Lacrosse Championship, an international box lacrosse tournament organized by the Federation of International Lacrosse every four years. It took place between May 14 and 20 at the Halifax Metro Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Canada was the defending champion and again beat the Iroquois Nationals in the final, this time 15–14 in overtime. Eight nations took part in this event, the six nations from the 2003 WILC and two newcomers - England and Ireland. There was an estimated 850,000 television viewers of the tournament in Canada and the games were streamed live in Europe.\nPool play.\nThe eight participating teams were placed in two groups. After playing a round-robin, the first place team in each group advanced to the semi-finals, the second and third placed teams advanced to the quarter-finals, and the fourth place teams advanced to the 7th place game.\nAs predicted, both Canada and Iroquois went through the round-robin with three comfortable wins. Both Ireland and the Czech Republic finished winless, but the Czechs showed a lot of enthusiasm and had two very narrow defeats against England and Scotland. By contrast, Scotland failed to repeat their impressive results from 2003.\nChampionship bracket.\nThe final, with the expected pairing of Canada against the Iroquois Nationals, was one of the best games in box lacrosse history. Team Canada went through the first quarter with a 4–2 lead, then the Nationals were able to come back in the second and third. The Iroquois were up 10–9 at the start of the fourth quarter. Three quick Canadian goals put them in front again, but they were answered by another three goals by the Nationals. Then John Grant, Jr. scored two goals and the victory for Canada was almost secured. But Dean Hill scored in the final minute of regulation to tie it at 14, sending the championship into overtime. Thirty seconds into overtime, Jeff Zywicki scored his first goal of the game, making it 15–14 for Canada's second gold medal."

        "text": "The 2011–12 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the 2011–2012 college basketball season. The team's head coach was Roy Williams, who was in his 9th season as UNC's head men's basketball coach. The 2011–12 North Carolina team finished the regular season with a final record of 32–6, and with a 14–2 record in ACC regular season play, winning the conference regular season championship outright. They were invited to the 2012 ACC men's basketball tournament, where they beat Maryland and North Carolina State before falling to Florida State in the championship game. They were also invited to the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament reaching the Elite Eight where they were defeated by Kansas. This was the second time UNC lost to Kansas in the NCAA Tournament with Roy Williams as UNC head coach. Roy Williams previously coached Kansas from 1988–2003. Kansas later fell to Kentucky 59-67 in the National Championship Game. The Tar Heels won their previous three games in the NCAA Tournament by an average of 13.7 points. In the second-round game versus Creighton, starting UNC point guard Kendall Marshall broke his right wrist with 10:56 remaining in the second half. Kendall Marshall did not play in UNC's two following games in the NCAA Tournament, a 73-65 overtime win over Ohio in the Sweet 16 and a 67-80 loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight. The loss to Kansas was UNC's second straight loss in the Elite Eight, after losing to Kentucky the year before.\nSeason.\nNon-conference play.\nThe Tar Heels started out as a near-unanimous #1 in all major polls. They opened the season against Michigan State in the inaugural Carrier Classic, which they won handily 67–55. They were not seriously tested until the finals of the 2011 Las Vegas Invitational, in which they were upset by UNLV 90–80. After a close win over Wisconsin and an equally close loss to Kentucky, they made it relatively unscathed through the rest of the nonconference slate, with the only close game being against Long Beach State.\nConference play.\nThe ACC schedule opened with dominating wins over Boston College and Miami. However, in their third conference game, the Tar Heels suffered a 90–57 flogging at the hands of Florida State — easily the worst loss Williams had suffered in his nine years in Chapel Hill. They quickly rebounded and won their next five games with relative ease. They were well on their way to making Duke their sixth straight victim, but Duke came back from 10 points down with two minutes to go to win the game on an Austin Rivers 3-pointer at the buzzer.\nThe Tar Heels would not lose again for the rest of the season, though they got a scare from Virginia before hanging on for a 54–51 win. An easy win over Maryland set up the seventh winner-take-all game in the 93-year history of the Carolina-Duke rivalry, with the winner clinching the ACC regular-season title and the number-one seed in the 2012 ACC tournament. The Tar Heels dominated from start to finish, leading by as much as 26 before going on to an 88–70 win—in the process, winning their 29th ACC regular season title and their fifth outright title in eight years.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

Games held during it are considered some of Kent's most popular fixtures. Historically the event has usually been held in May or June but moved to July in 2015 for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Following a reorganisation of the English domestic cricket season the week reverted to its more traditional place in the calendar for the 2017 season.\nHistory.\nThe cricket week has been running since 1902, with a single Kent match held the previous year at the Nevill Ground. It is currently one of Kent's two outgrounds with all other home matches being played at the St. Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.\nThe week has had a poem written about it.\nCricket.\nA traditional cricket week at The Nevill Ground usually comprised two County Championship games, with occasional limited overs games added to the programme from the 1960s onwards. With the advent of Twenty20 cricket, the one day game was sometimes replaced with a Twenty20 game. In some years Kent have played an extra one day or T20 game during the week. For the 2017 season only a single four-day County Championship game was scheduled for the festival. This was due to the reorganisation of the English domestic cricket season by the England and Wales Cricket Board which led to Kent having to choose which of their two out-grounds to allocate a single one-day fixture to. The county opted to allocate the one-day game to their ground at Beckenham on the south-eastern edge of London rather than to Tunbridge Wells.\nGames during the Tunbridge Wells Festival week are often high-scoring with the pitch at the Nevill Ground sometimes being considered a \"batting paradise\". This could be seen during the 2010 County Championship game against Nottinghamshire, where 1,242 runs were scored despite the game being hit with rain."

European Championships 1998 in Leverkusen were the joint fourteenth European kickboxing championships (the other was held in Kyiv the same year) hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization and the fourth championships (world and European) to be held in Germany. The event was open to amateur men and women based in Europe only and there were just the two styles on offer; Full-Contact and Light-Contact kickboxing. By the end of the championships Russia was by far the dominant nation in terms of medals won, with Poland second and Hungary third. The event was held in Leverkusen, Germany over six days starting on Tuesday, 1 December and ending on Sunday, 6 December 1998.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where fights are won primarily by stoppage or points decision, with kicks and punches allowed above the waist, although unlike professional kickboxing fighters had to wear head and body protection - more detail on the rules are available on the W.A.K.O. website. At Leverkusen the men had twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had six, ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 65 kg/+143 lbs. Notable medalists included Robert Nowak, Almaz Gismeev and future female boxing legend Natascha Ragosina who had all won gold medals back at the last European championships in Belgrade. By the championships end Russia was the strongest nation overall in Full-Contact, winning five golds, three silvers and three bronzes.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as an intermediate step between the two. Fights are generally won by points scored on the basis of speed and technique over brute force and both fighters must wear head and body protection - more detail on Light-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had eight weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 89 kg/+195.8 lbs while the women had five ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 65 kg/143 lbs. The most notable winner was Tomaž Barada who added to the gold he won at the last European championships. By the end of the event Hungary was the top nation overall in Light-Contact with two golds, six silvers and two bronze medals."

        "title": "Saxon Switzerland climbing region",
        "text": "Saxon Switzerland () is the largest and one of the best-known rock climbing regions in Germany, located in the Free State of Saxony. The region is largely coterminous with the natural region of the same name, Saxon Switzerland, but extends well beyond the territory of the National Park within it. It includes the western part of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and is the oldest non-Alpine rock climbing region in Germany. Its history of climbing dates back to the first ascent in modern times of the Falkenstein by Bad Schandau gymnasts in 1864. Currently, there are over 1,100 peaks with more than 17,000 climbing routes in the Saxon Switzerland area.\nClimbing.\nThe climbing is characterized by a strong traditional climbing ethic and a number of peculiarities rarely found in other climbing regions, or at least not to the same extent. An exception are Czech sandstone climbing regions, where similar rules apply. Climbers must observe the Saxon Climbing Regulations, which were first formulated in 1913 and are binding. The main principles of climbing in Saxon Switzerland are based on the idea of free climbing and a commitment to protecting the soft sandstone, which is prone to erosion and can be easily damaged, especially when wet. This results in specific rules and customs regarding safety equipment and climbing style.\nProtection.\nThe main means of protection are slings which are tied around natural features or threaded through natural holes in the rock. Knotted slings can be firmly placed within cracks, functioning similar to a camming device. Any form of metal protection such as nuts, cams or pitons are forbidden to use as they may damage the rock.\nRing bolts can only be found in routes of the Saxon grade V and higher (with a few exceptions) but are only placed when no other protection is possible. There are usually large distances between rings and routes with only one or two of them are very common. Therefore, climbers often face large runouts and need to rely on slings for protection even in very hard routes.\nOnly the person who makes the first ascent of a route is allowed to install ring bolts during the climb from the ground up. Bolting a route while hanging from a top rope is not permitted (e.g. top rope climbing). In exceptional cases, later additions of ring bolts are decided by a commission of the Saxon Climbers Federation (SBB) when natural protection features have been destroyed or a route proves to be too dangerous. Bolts may also be placed as belay anchors in multipitch routes.\nClimbing style.\nThe lead climber places all the protection from the ground up. Due to the limited protection, falls should be avoided, especially when relying on slings only. Upon reaching the summit, the leader anchors him- or herself using the abseil ring, a preinstalled anchor bolt or slings, and belays the second and other members of the climbing party from the top. The second removes the protection during their climb. When all members of the climbing party have reached the top, the summit register is signed and all climbers usually rappel. Toproping is generally frowned upon and only allowed when not using abseil rings and it is ensured that the rope can not damage the rock.\nThe Saxon-Switzerland offers a large variety of single and multipitch routes of all difficulties and techniques such as chimneys, cracks, slabs and face climbing. The sometimes sparse and unusual possibilities of placing protection require practice and not only physical but also mental strength. Climbers should be confident to master a grade before starting a climb because resting on a weighted rope or retreating might not be safe or easy options.\nGrading system.\nThe Saxon-Switzerland has its own Saxon grading system that was developed at the beginning of the 20th century. It uses roman numerals to denote the level of difficulty. Grades of VII and higher are subdivided by the letters a, b, and c. The Saxon Grading System is also used in other parts of East Germany and the Czech Republic. The hardest route in Saxon Switzerland is graded at XIc.\nThere are also specific grades for horizontal jumps, represented by Arabic numerals ranging from 1 to 7.\nRoutes that are deemed especially worthwhile are marked with one or two asterisks.\nRestrictions.\nClimbing is only permitted on designated free-standing rock towers with at least 10 m prominence. An historic exception are three massifs which may be climbed. Almost all summits are furnished with summit registers and abseiling rings. These, like other safety rings, are looked after and maintained by the Saxon Climbers' Federation (SBB).\nRegulations.\nClimbing regulations for Saxon Switzerland were first printed in 1913 in a climbing guide published by Rudolf Fehrmann, and have only been slightly amended since. The basic principles had been developed before 1900, mainly by Oscar Schuster. Their main feature is, that artificial aids to rock climbing are not permitted. They, therefore, constitute one of the foundations of the concept of free climbing, which is the most prevalent form of rock climbing today.\nThe climbing regulations are also part of the mountain sport concept required under the National Parks Ordinance for the Free State of Saxony, which lays down how and to what extent climbing in the Saxon Switzerland National Park may be undertaken.\nThe most important regulations are:\nIn addition, the regulations go on to cover in detail the procedure for first ascents, climbing bans, the scale of climbing grades and conduct when climbing. \nClimbing areas.\nThe climbing region Saxon Switzerland is divided into the following areas:\nClimbing rocks.\nThe following is a selection of climbing rocks in the Saxon Switzerland climbing region:"

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 1987 were the sixth world kickboxing championships hosted by W.A.K.O. arranged by the German Karate pioneer Georg Brueckner and Carl Wiedmeier. The event was open to amateur men and women, with 290 competitors from 29 countries taking part. The styles on offer were Full-Contact (men only), Semi-Contact and Musical Forms (men only). Typically, each country was allowed one competitor per weight division, although in some incidences more than one was allowed. Participants were also allowed to compete in more than one style. By the end of the championships, USA was the top of the medals tables, with hosts West Germany in second and Canada way behind in third. The event was held at the Olympiahalle in Munich, Germany over two days (Saturday 10 October/Sunday 11 October) and were attended by an estimated 11,000 spectators.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact was available to men only at Munich and consisted of the usual ten weight divisions ranging from 54 kg/118.8 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. All bouts were fought under Full-Contact kickboxing rules – more detail on the rules can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that they may have changed slightly since 1987. There were some notable winners with future professional world champions Marek Piotrowski (kickboxing) and Troy Dorsey (boxing), Hungarian Olympic wrestling champ Norbert Növényi, and the ever present Ferdinand Mack picking up gold medals. For Ferdinand Mack it would be his eight gold medal at a W.A.K.O. championships. By the end of the championships the USA just about shaded hosts West Germany as the top nation in Full-Contact, with three golds, two silvers and one bronze.\nSemi-Contact.\nBoth men and women took part in Semi-Contact competitions in Munich. Semi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fights were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited – more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1987. At Munich the men had seven weight classes, starting at 57 kg/125.4 lbs and ending at over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, while the women's competition had four weight classes beginning at 50 kg/110 lbs and ending at over 60 kg/132 lbs. There were a few notable winners in the men's events with Mike Anderson winning gold and American teammate and future pro-boxing world champion Troy Dorsey picking up silver (both had won gold in the Full-Contact category at the same games). By the end of the championships, USA were the top nation in Semi-Contact with five golds, one silver and one bronze (male and female combined).\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms returned to a W.A.K.O. championships having been absent at the European championships in Athens. The event was for men only but unlike the previous appearances in London and Milan there were now more categories; with hard styles, soft styles and weapons introduced. Musical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques – more information can be accessed on the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1987. By the end of the championships, the USA were the top nation in Musical Forms, winning two gold and one silver medal. "

Worcester Warriors had been promoted as champions from the 2010–11 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nSummary.\nHarlequins won their first title after defeating Leicester Tigers in the final at Twickenham having also topped the regular season table.

It was the second time that Newcastle have been relegated from the top flight since the leagues began and the first time since the 1993–94 Premiership Rugby season.\nAs usual, round 1 included the London Double Header at Twickenham, the eighth instance since its inception in 2004.\nRule changes.\nThis season saw the first major change in the Premiership's salary cap, which at the time stood at £4 million per team. In what is now a permanent feature of the cap system, academy credits were introduced. Each team receives a £30,000 credit for every home-grown player in their senior squad, with a maximum of eight such credits. In addition, a standard provision of the cap system that applies only in seasons that run up against the Rugby World Cup provided each team with a credit of £30,000 for each senior squad player that participated in the World Cup.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and Worcester Warriors who were promoted from the 2010–11 RFU Championship after a top flight absence of one year. They replaced Leeds Carnege who were relegated after two years in the top flight.\nPre-season.\nThe 2011 edition of the Premiership Rugby Sevens Series began on 15 July 2011 at The Recreation Ground, continued on 22 July at Franklin's Gardens and 29 July at Edgeley Park. This was the first opportunity of the season for any of the teams competing in the Premiership to win a trophy. The finals were held on 5 August 2011 at The Stoop and the Series was won by Newcastle Falcons.\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage.

He continued this into 2018, starting four of the Six Nations tests, and starting both matches against Argentina as Wales toured North and South America.\nInjuries prevented Williams from taking part in either the 2018 Autumn internationals and 2019 Six Nations.\nIn 2021, Williams was briefly recalled to the Welsh squad, after Willis Halaholo tested positive for coronavirus. Upon Halaholo's recovery, Williams was released back to the Scarlets and did not feature for Wales."

        "title": "United States Youth Cricket Association",
        "text": "The United States Youth Cricket Association (USYCA) is the largest organization in the United States devoted to the promotion of the game of cricket among young people and is an Associate Member of United States of America Cricket Association. USYCA promotes cricket in America by donating cricket sets and instruction to schools, at no cost to the schools, through its Schools Program. USYCA has 60 member organizations: 21 Affiliates, which are organizations that are primarily engaged in youth cricket activities, and 39 Associates, which are organizations that support the USYCA mission, but are primarily engaged in other activities. USYCA is a program partner with the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and is a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nHistory.\nUSYCA was founded in April 2010 by Jamie Harrison, Edward Fox and Rakesh Kallem. The previous month, DreamCricket.com, a US-based cricket website and online retailer, had agreed to donate ten cricket sets for placement in American schools under a pilot program directed by Harrison.\nAfter receiving an invitation from Physical Education instructor Charles Silberman, Highland Park Elementary School in Prince George's County, Maryland became the first school to receive a cricket set from USYCA in May 2010. In June and July, summer camps were the beneficiaries of USYCA donations, as schools were no longer in session. By the end of the summer, however, the Prince George's County school system had extended a welcome to USYCA, as had schools in Baltimore City. In the Fall of 2010, other jurisdictions in Maryland signed on, such as Kent and Queen Anne's counties on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nOn 24 June it was announced that the C.C. Morris Cricket Library Association had agreed to fund the organization's infrastructure expenses, such as liability insurance and fees associated with the securing of federal tax-exempt status, up to a maximum of $5000. This was followed on 13 July with the announcement that DreamCricket.com had raised its pledge to 100 sets, ensuring USYCA of a useful supply of high-quality children's sets with which to approach school systems. This allowed the organization to break free of the time-consuming process of placing sets in one school at a time.\nAnother key development that summer was the introduction to USYCA of Maria Grossi, and DTY Pty Ltd., an Australian firm that was the supplier of cricket sets and apparel to Cricket Australia's MILO In2Cricket program. The referral came by way of Rebecca Mulgrew of CA, who first came into contact with Harrison in 2009 while he was coaching the cricket team at Cardinal Gibbons School in Baltimore. By August, DTY was in discussions with USYCA that would result in the donation of 500 custom-made cricket sets, designed especially for the USYCA Schools Program. These sets would eventually be named the American Cricket Champ, and was the first set ever produced specifically for the American market.\nAlso that summer, USYCA produced its constitution, which was largely based upon the USACA document, and in August the organization elected its first office holders.\nShortly thereafter, Michael Thomas of Maryland, a member of the British Officers Cricket Club and the C.C. Morris group, was appointed as USYCA's first treasurer.\nDuring these early months, individuals were volunteering to lead state youth cricket organizations for USYCA, so that by the end of August, USYCA was represented in 16 US states.\nIn September, the first three USYCA standing committees were established: membership, finance and constitution/by-laws.\nIn the Fall of 2010, USYCA began placing cricket sets in schools in Maryland, and international cricket celebrities, such as Australia's Nathan Bracken and Damien Martyn, posed for photos wearing USYCA tee shirts. Bracken included his son, Chase (also in a USYCA shirt), in his portrait. Also that fall, a USYCA instructional video was produced by Rohit Kulkarni and City Lights Films, and was added to the USYCA YouTube page. This three-part video, \"Introducing Cricket To Children in the United States,\" was viewed thousands of times in its first year online, and became key in delivering the USYCA formula to those spreading cricket to new demographics.\nIn November, USYCA was granted Associate Member status by USACA, and made itself eligible for recognition and support from the International Cricket Council. This eligibility soon paid off handsomely, as the USYCA Schools Program was awarded the top prize in the Junior Participation Initiative category by the ICC America's region in the 2010 Pepsi ICC Development Programme Awards.\nThis award in January 2011 came only days after Mike Young, the American fielding coach for the Australian national cricket team, had come out in public support for USYCA, modeling the organization's apparel at a photo shoot on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne, only hours before the Aussies were to take on the English in a One Day International match.\nIn February, American Cricket Champ sets began to arrive at USYCA headquarters in Maryland, and were quickly redistributed to schools across the country.\nOn 14 April 2011, USYCA held its first-ever Annual General Meeting.\nIn June, USYCA donated cricket sets to sixteen Alabama schools that had suffered severe tornado damage two months prior. In July, USYCA announced that 136 elementary and middle schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system in North Carolina were adding cricket to their PE curriculums, and the schools would also be offering students opportunities to play the game in other venues.\nIn December, the USYCA purchased the USYCA Foxfire Field, one of the country's best cricket grounds, for $1 per year and will be the venue for countless youth cricket tournaments and development of youth cricket in the United States. The field is located centrally 20 miles south of Wichita, Kansas, and it had been the vision of USYCA vice-president Edward Fox, who personally funded the construction at a total cost of $120,000.\nUSYCA announced the opening of its first national headquarters, and a dedicated phone line, in January 2012. The headquarters building is located in Glen Burnie, Maryland, near Baltimore-Washington International Airport.\nIn July 2013, the first state championship was held in Maryland. The match was played between Germantown and Cockeysville, Germantown being the victor. The third place match was played between Bowie and Timonium, Bowie being the victor. Maryland Deputy Secretary of State, Rajan Natarajan, attended the matches, and presented awards following it.\nIn April 2016, USYCA has its third election and Ranjeet Singh from St. Louis, Missouri was elected as the President. In March 2017, a new chapter opened in history of USYCA, when NYCL, the largest youth cricket event in USA became part of USYCA. NYCL in 2017 featured 45 Teams and was held in Connecticut and New Jersey, hosted by New England Youth Cricket Academy, DreamCricket and CricMax.\nAssociation With Reebok.\nIn March 2012, USYCA announced a three-year sponsorship deal with Reebok Cricket, the first of its kind for an international sports brand in the United States cricket market.\nPartnership With American Cricket Federation.\nOn 6 May 2013, USYCA announced its partnership with the American Cricket Federation. The agreement gives USYCA the lead role in cricket development in age groups up to 13-Under, while ACF will coordinate the transition to older age groups. The partnership anticipated a substantial sharing of resources, communications, facilities and volunteer networks.\nNational Youth Cricket Day.\nUSYCA established 24 March as National Youth Cricket Day. This day was selected because it was on that day in 2010 that Venu Palaparthi wrote to Harrison on behalf of DreamCricket.com, making the initial offer of donated cricket sets:\n\"We would like to support any initiative in Maryland that involves putting basic cricket kits in the hands of Phy Ed teachers. Our max budget is 10 kits – each costing $1000. So let us get this going.\" (The $1000 figure was a typo; he meant $100.)\nLogo.\nThe USYCA logo, unveiled on 5 May 2010, was designed by Jamie Harrison and produced by his 17-year-old son, Zachary. It reflects the mission of USYCA through its depiction of a young girl bowling and a young boy batting; its color scheme of red, white and blue marks it as clearly American."

        "title": "Handball (schoolyard game)",
        "text": "Handball is a children's ball game widely documented in Australian schools, similar to downball. The rules of the game vary considerably across different sites and conditions, but it is generally played on a flat game court with lined square zones (occasionally with a wall for rebounds), and involves at least two players, who each occupies a square and take turns hitting a ball (often a tennis ball, squash ball or, occasionally, a bouncy ball) with their bare hands into other player's square(s). The game is very easy to set up and can be conveniently adapted to any environments where square/rectangular-lined flat grounds can be found, such as other gyms/arenas, parking spaces and even concrete slabbed driveways and footpaths.\nHistory.\nOn July 4, 1954, the American folklorist Dorothy Howard arrived in Australia. In the next nine months, she visited nineteen primary schools across the country to painstakingly document the folk games the children played. Among the children's games Howard recorded was four square, also known as handball, which was played in seven of the schools. The rules of the game varied between them, and many schools played with considerable deviations.\nIn popular culture.\nHandball has entered the meme culture. In March 2013, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd released a video of him playing handball at Brisbane State High School, which led to him becoming part of a \"handball meme\". In late November 2017, Rudd played handball with students in a school in Brisbane, and the accompanying video - claiming he was the \"king of handball\" - reached 40,000 views on Facebook.\nHandball is the main theme of the children's television series, \"Handball Heroes\", which aired on ABC Me (Then ABC 3) in 2013, as well as \"Hardball\" which aired on ABC Me in 2019."

There are six modes to play: exhibition, Home Run Derby, defense practice, playoffs, league (in which teams play every other team in succession just like in \"NBA Jam\"), and \"Game Breaker\" (which allows players to change the course of Major League Baseball history).\nThe realistic-styled stadiums are contrasted with the cartoon-like graphics, but the stadiums are altered from their MLB counterparts due to copyright issues. Jack Buck provides a play-by-play analysis of the action.\nReception.\nThe video game review magazines of the mid-1990s gave this game mixed reviews. \"GamePro\" highly praised the game's selection of options and stats and the clearly detailed, comical graphics. However, they described the controls as poor, with both a confusing configuration and slow reactions to button presses. They concluded: \"With more features than any other baseball cart, \"Super RBI\" should've been serious competition for excellent games like \"World Series Baseball\". Too bad the controls undercut that potential\"."

Formed by employees of the Victorian Railways, VRI Fencing Club was funded, equipped and accommodated under the auspice of the Victorian Railways Institute, an organisation dedicated to providing self-learning, social and sport opportunities for railway employees. In addition to encouraging public participation in the sport of fencing, the club sought to train and develop competitive athletes in three weapons to represent Australia at the Melbourne 1956 Summer Olympics.\nThe club produced five athletes for the Melbourne Olympiad. Overall it has produced 35 athletes for 15 consecutive Olympiads, including most recently, three athletes for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. VRI Fencing Club produced a representative Australian athlete for every Olympiad since Australia first competed in fencing at Helsinki in 1952 up to Beijing in 2008. Overall the club has produced 48 per cent of Australia's total number of Olympic fencers.\nToday.\nVRI Fencing Club operates seven days a week. It is accessible to beginners and social fencers, and provides frequent beginner classes. The club's ongoing children's and schools programs make an introduction to the sport an easy and fun social occasion for children. It caters for all levels of skill - beginners young and old (from Musketeers aged 7 to 13; to elite athletes looking for cross training options; to fencers in their fifties, sixties and seventies); social fencers and competitive fencers. Many junior and senior athletes compete nationally and internationally. The club attracts many visiting fencers from around the world who travel to Melbourne to combine work or combine university study with an opportunity to train with the club's athletes. Fencers from the US, UK, Italy, Kuwait, France, India, China, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore are frequent visitors. The club operates an annual residential 'Ultimate Fencing Club' that involves guest international coaches and young fencers from across Australia, Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific.\nHome of Australian Fencing and State Centre for Excellence.\nIn 2011 the VRI Fencing Club and its Tigerland training centre was named the Home of Australian Fencing.

Switzerland has participated in 16 of 23 tournaments, sending 27 goaltenders and 187 skaters.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. Many of Canada's top players were professional, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused, and Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics in protest. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL did not allow its players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The Swiss national team is co-ordinated by the Swiss Ice Hockey Association and players are chosen by the team's management staff.\nSwitzerland has won two bronze medals in men's ice hockey, in the 1928 Games and 1948 Games; Bibi Torriani is the only player who won medals with both teams. Four players have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame – Torriani, brothers Ferdinand Cattini and Hans Cattini, and Jakob Kölliker. Three players – Martin Plüss, Mathias Seger, and Mark Streit – have played in four tournaments; Streit was captain for the first three of his appearances. Plüss, Seger, and Streit all have played in 19 games, the most of any Swiss player. Ulrich Poltera holds the record for most goals (21) and most total points (24), while five players have six assists each.\nGoaltenders.\nReserve goaltenders.\nThese goaltenders were named to the Olympic roster, but did not receive any ice time during games."

However, the organizing committee for the Games (COPAG) changed the venue to Omnilife Stadium, because of its superior infrastructure and technological capability to host the event. Also, its proximity to the athletes village helped expedite the transportation of athletes and helped ensure their safety. \nAs per tradition, the Pan American Sports Organization flag was presented to the mayor of the next host city, Rob Ford of Toronto.\nPuerto Rican singer Ricky Martin and The Wailers performed at the ceremony."

        "text": "The Blackrock Rugby Festival (also known as the St. Mary's Blackrock Festival or simply Blackrock), is an annual school's rugby union competition held at St. Mary's School in Nairobi, Kenya, usually around 17 and 23 May. It is claimed to be the biggest high school tournament in East Africa. The first tournament took place in 1983, and also featured a club rugby competition. The tournament is used by Kenyan rugby clubs to scout for new and upcoming players.\nSt. Mary's School was founded in 1939 and, for many years, was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers of Blackrock College in Ireland, hence the name of the tournament. The school uses the same badge as Blackrock College and their rugby team also wear the same blue and white hoops as their sister institution. A further reminder of the strong Irish influence on the school is the former name of their playing fields where the tournament takes place, \"Lansdowne Road\" (named after the Irish national rugby stadium in Dublin).\nThe Blackrock Festival is a key event where future rugby stars in Kenya are identified, nurtured, and given the platform to shine. The Most Valuable Players from this festival have gone on to achieve great things in the game. For instance, Allan Hicks, who was 19 when he played for Kenya at the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 2001, Innocent Simiyu, who captained both Kenya's 15s and Sevens teams, and went on to serve as Head Coach twice for Kenya Simbas. Other notable M.V.P.'s include Ugandan International Philip Wokorach and former Kenya Simbas Head Coach, Paul Odera.\nCompetition.\nThe tournament is played in a round-robin format, normally with 24 teams divided into 8 groups of 3 teams each.\nThe top team of each group qualifies for the quarter-finals of the Main Cup, while the second and third-placed team of each group qualify for the quarter-finals of the Plate and Bowl Cup respectively.\nRecently, a girls' tournament was introduced to run alongside the main boys' tournament. In the girls' tournament, there are 12 teams that compete for the cup.\nIn 2022, the competition was played in a seven-a-side format instead of the regular fifteen-a-side format while in 2023, the competition was played in a ten-a-side format with the competition returning to the regular fifteen-a-side format in 2024.\nKnockout stage.\nTeams in each group advance to the Main Cup, Plate and Bowl Cup as shown below.\nPublic influence.\nEntrance for spectators was free until 2012, when tickets began to be produced and sold for KSh.200/=, and later KSh.100/=. This was in response to several security concerns that arose in the past few tournaments, especially thefts and disturbing the peace.\nThe tournament usually attracts crowds of about 2,000 people each year."

The Golf Course was the original site of the 1901 Niagara Falls Country Club.\nHistory of Hyde Park Golf Course.\nThe course on Sugar Street was founded as the Niagara Falls Country Club in 1901 by Niagara Falls businessman Frank A. Dudley, who served as president for four terms.\nThe original course was the nine-hole golf course known as the Red Nine today. By 1912, the golf club was considered prosperous and the initiation fee for a member at that time was an astounding $7.50 () By the summer of 1916, after considerable growth, and in tune with changing demographics, the Country Club moved from Niagara Falls to its current Lewiston location in Lewiston Heights neighborhood. When the course opened for play on June 1, 1919, the head professional was Alfred \"Alf\" Campbell.\nIn 1938, the area was developed as Hyde Park and a brand new 18-hole facility along with the Red Nine was built for public play. The updated course was designed by Designed by William F. Gordon, ASGCA and David W. Gordon, ASGCA. The 18-hole Hyde Park course at the Hyde Park Municipal Golf Course facility in Niagara Falls, New York features 6,255 yards of golf from the longest tees for a par of 70. The course rating is 70.3 and it has a slope rating of 106.\nIn the late 1980s, a second club was formed due to growth in the market, named The Cataract Golf Club. Both clubs offered similar benefits to their members and maintained a friendly rivalry for over 15 years. Unfortunately once the explosion in golf waned, neither club could sustain its membership on its own and the two clubs merged with the original Hyde Park Golf Club name being used. The locals often refer to the course as \"Niagara Falls National\" in reference to the excellent course conditions often compared to Augusta National. The club schedules over 20 tournaments per year including a Club Championship and hosts the City Championship as well. The club also sponsors a Junior program allowing those under 18 years of age a chance to play and compete against other Junior clubs throughout Western New York.\nMembership.\nMembership allows members to play in all club sponsored tournaments, which include scheduled Tee Time Tournaments, Weekend Anyday Tournaments, Match Play Tournament, Club Championship and any other tournament that may be offered by the club.\nCourse Record.\nCourse record for tournament play: Walt Kudela, -9 (61) in 1999 City Championship."

        "text": "Albert Edward Cooke (5 October 1901 – 29 September 1977) was a New Zealand dual-code international rugby footballer of the 1920s and 1930s, who represented for New Zealand in both rugby union and rugby league.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Auckland in 1901, Cooke was the son of Albert Edward Cooke, a hairdresser, and his wife Sarah Jane Cooke (née Peterson). Cooke was educated at Hamilton East Primary and Hamilton Boys' High School.\nRugby union career.\nCooke joined the Grafton rugby union club in 1919 and graduated to senior club rugby in 1923. In that same year he made his Auckland debut and was a reserve for New Zealand against New South Wales. He was then part of the 1924–1925 \"Invincibles\" side that toured Great Britain. He again played for the All Blacks in 1925 and 1926 but withdrew from the 1928 tour of South Africa for business reasons. He did play twice in 1928 for New Zealand against New South Wales before making his last Test appearances in 1930 against Great Britain.\nCooke played for the North Island in 1931 and spent 1932 with Hawke's Bay, before switching codes. Cooke also represented Wairarapa and Wellington while playing rugby union. He finished his rugby union career with 121 tries in 131 first class matches.\nRugby league career.\nCooke joined the Richmond Rovers club in the Auckland Rugby League competition in 1932 and made an immediate impact, racing away for three tries in the inter-island game only weeks later. He was selected for New Zealand that year against the Great Britain Lions. Cooke also represented Auckland and captained New Zealand in two Test matches against Australia in 1935. He coached Auckland in 1936 as well as coaching the Ponsonby United senior side after he retired from playing with Richmond Rovers club the previous year. In the 1936 season the Ponsonby side finished with a 7 win, 6 loss record, coming 5th in the Fox Memorial competition. They were knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the first round of the same season but then went on to win the Phelan Shield after defeating Mount Albert, Papakura, Devonport, and Marist (in the final). In 1937 he was said to be going to coach Ponsonby once more but was rumoured to be going to coach the North Shore Rugby senior side as well. Ultimately he in fact came out of retirement and played two matches for Richmond Rovers before being injured in their round 1 match with Mount Albert and then giving the game away as a player. He then took on the coaching duties with the North Shore rugby senior side.\nLater years.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Cooke joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force and played rugby union for that service in the 1940 Auckland club competition. He died in Auckland in 1977."

        "title": "Tom Sullivan (basketball)",
        "text": "Thomas Sullivan (born April 18, 1950) is an American former professional basketball player and college coach.\nPlaying career.\nSullivan grew up in the Bronx, New York City. He played collegiately at Fordham University and was a four-year letterwinner from 1968 to 1969 through 1971–72, playing the center position. As a senior, Sullivan was the Rams' co-captain and named the team MVP. He guided Fordham to a berth in the National Invitation Tournament where they would lose in the first round to Jacksonville. At the end of that season, Sullivan was presented with the Haggerty Award, given annually since 1935–36 to the top male collegiate basketball player in the greater New York City area. He was the co-recipient with Manhattan's Richie Garner, becoming the first duo to share the award in its history up to that point.\nFollowing his career at Fordham, Sullivan was chosen in the 1972 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He was taken in the ninth round (139th overall). Although he was drafted, Sullivan never played in the National Basketball Association. Instead, he went to Italy to play professionally in 1972–73, took the following year off to coach back in the United States, and then spent the 1974–75 playing again, only this time in Switzerland. After two seasons in three years playing as an expatriate professional basketball player, Sullivan returned to the United States to pursue coaching full-time.\nCoaching career.\nSullivan began his coaching career as an assistant at Hunter College during the interim year between professional seasons. His next job came as an assistant coach at New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University) during 1975–76, and after only one year at the school he became its full-time head coach in 1976. Sullivan stayed at New Hampshire College from 1976 to 1977 through 1984–85 and also concurrently served as the athletic director for much of his tenure. During his nine-year career at the NCAA Division II school, he compiled an overall record of 152–99, including three 20-win seasons. Sullivan led the team to two Division II New England Region championships (1980, 1981) as he earned regional coach of the year honors both of those years.\nHe left New Hampshire College to take the reins at Manhattan College in which he compiled a 2–26 overall record his first year there. Sullivan only stayed one season, however, and left to become P. J. Carlesimo's assistant at Seton Hall between 1987–88 and 1993–94. During this seven-year stretch, the Pirates made six NCAA Division I Tournaments, including a national championship game appearance in 1989, which they lost to Michigan in overtime.\nWhen Carlesimo left after 1993–94, Sullivan was a finalist for the head coaching vacancy. The position ultimately went to George Blaney from Holy Cross. After a one-year absence from coaching, Sullivan became the new head coach at UMBC in 1995. Over the course of his nine-year coaching career at UMBC, he compiled an overall record of 106–145, becoming the second coach in program history to amass 100 wins. He named the Big South Conference Coach of the Year in 1998 after an eight-game improvement from the season before, and in 1999 was named the Northeast Conference Coach of the Year. The school had switched conferences between years, and the 1998–99 season saw the Retrievers set a league record for consecutive wins to begin a season (15) en route to the conference regular season title. Three years later, and for the first time in the program's Division I history, UMBC won 20 games in a season under Sullivan's guidance. After that season he signed a contract extension to be effective through the 2006–07 season. However, after a 7–21 year in 2003–04, Sullivan resigned. His career college head coaching record is 260–270 in 19 seasons."

        "text": "In 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The nineteenth most popular sport that these women participated in was surfing, with 2 having played the sport. The sport was tied with cricket, mountaineering, and rowing.\nIsabel Letham was one of the early icons of women's surfing in Australia. She inspired several women including Pam Burridge.\nDuring the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, women's surfing saw a large expansion in the number of competitors. Since then one-third of Australia's Surfing population are female.\nWomen's competitive surfing did not develop as quickly as men. This is due to many female competitions being cancelled at short notice leading to irregular competitions. Women also earned considerably less than men. In the 1984 Beaurepaire Open, women competed for A$5,000, whilst men A$95,000.\nSurf lifesaving in Australia banned women from rescue work and competition in 1914: \"conquering the sea was a man's prerogative and women were deemed physically too weak to carry a heavy belt and line or to swim competitively in surf races\" (Booth, 2007).\nAustralia has produced several women's world champions including Pam Burridge, Pauline Menczer and Wendy Botha.\nPam Burridge was one of the most influential women in Australian surfing to push for equality between the men's and women's parts of the sport. She competed in an era when men and women did not earn comparable prize money. She shocked many in the surfing community by chasing after and successfully surfing big waves, waves women were typically not known to surf.\nConstraints for Women in Surfing.\nIn 2012, a study was completed by Laura Fendt &amp; Erica Wilson which looked at the motivations and constraints experienced by women in relation to surfing and surf-related travel. This study was conducted by facilitating in-depth interviews with 20 women surfers in New South Wales, Australia. The interview was structured around questions designed to provoke a more in-depth response from participants. On completion of the study the following table of results was constructed using the responses of the 20 interviewed women.\n The numbers in this column do not equal 20 as each woman has stated several constraints\nPerformance Differences Between Men and Women.\nDue to the natural differences in strength between men and women, competitions have always been segregated between the sexes. The main aspect of surfing which gives male athletes an advantage in competition is the pop up phase. The pop-up movement occurs when the surfer has gained enough speed in the paddling stage to catch the wave and is complete. Once this momentum has been gained an explosive movement occurs as the surfer pushes off the board to stand on their feet.\nA study was conducted at the California State University to measure the exact advantage that men had over women in this pop-up stage. Men and women of the same ages were asked to perform three pop-ups on a plate that would measure relative peak force, relative rate of force development, peak velocity, rate of velocity development and relative power. In all of these criteria, men produced significantly better results.\nIt was then concluded from these results that female surfers are not physically able to perform the pop-up action with forces equal to that of their male competitors."

Because of clothing restrictions, during the 1900s, \"two masters, captaining opposing teams of boarders and day girls, did all the running.\"\nDuring the 1910s, vigoro was played in some schools in Australia. The game was a combination of baseball and cricket. It was popular in New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland.\nDuring the 1910s, girls' sports in schools were hard to organise because of a lack of available equipment and space set aside for them. There were also issues of the lack of available players at schools. This made it hard to play baseball at schools.\nIn 1911, there was a state organisation for women's baseball in Western Australia.\nIn the late 1920s, the YWCA started several baseball teams in Canberra.\nDuring the 1930s, companies sponsored women's sport teams, and occasionally women's baseball teams, because physical activity for women improved their productivity at work. Arnotts in New South Wales purpose built several facilities for its female employees, including a baseball diamond.\nDuring the 1930s, country competitions were frequently held for female sports players. One of the sports that country competition regularly took place for was baseball.\nIn the 1930s, changes were made to women's baseball player uniforms. These uniforms were known was \"plus fours\" or \"apple catchers\" or \"knickerboxers.\" Baseball players liked them because the uniforms were modest, while allowing for a wide range of movement.\nDuring the 1930s, \"The Sportswoman\" was published. It was a Melbourne based newspaper exclusively dedicated to women's sport. Maise McDiarmed was the newspaper's baseball reporter. This was during an era where the trend was women covered women's sport and men's covered men's sport.\nIn 1933, the New South Wales Amateur Women's Sport Council was created by Gwendolen Game. The organisation brought together all the women's sporting bodies on the state level. Sports represented included New South Wales's women's field hockey, cricket, women's basketball, baseball, rowing and vigoro. A similar organisation covering similar sports had been created in Victoria in 1931.\nThe 1933 women's baseball season in Queensland started in October.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds. The purpose was to increase women's interest in sport by providing them opportunities to play. Sports that were included on the programme included cricket, field hockey, women's basketball, bowls, rowing, swimming, athletics, rifle shooting, baseball, golf, tennis and badminton. There were over 1,000 bowlers involved over the course a week. Cricket featured a match versus a visiting English side. Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nThe rules for women's baseball in Australia were not formally codified on a national level until 1933. At this time, all the women's state organisations for baseball go together to formally codify them in order to allow interstate competitions to take place. The first formal interstate competition happened in 1934. Prior to 1933, New South Wales and Queensland baseball players pitched overhand. Victorian baseball players pitched underhand. The codifiers of the rules decided that they would use the overhand pitch because the ball was thrown faster and more accurately, making it more difficult to hit. The size of the field was also made smaller than the men's diamond of the time and a smaller ball was to be used. In 1933, the Australian Women's Baseball Association was created as a result of the meeting and rule codification. Western Australia finally joined the organisation in 1936.\nIn April 1934, the University of Sydney hosted the first women's baseball national championships. When the championships were completed, an All Australian team was selected. All Australian selection was the highest honour a player could get at a time when a national team did not exist. In 1936, the Australians reached out to see about creating a tournament with national teams from Canada, the United States and Japan.\nIn 1936, the Kelvin Grove baseball club in Brisbane banned women from using their field and equipment to play baseball because the \"baseball is nor a woman's game.\"\nIn 1938, a Queensland women's baseball team played the Victorian women's baseball team in interstate games at University of Sydney\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The twenty-fourth most popular sport that these women participated in was baseball, with 1 women having played the sport. The sport was tied with baseball, bowls, and ice hockey.ç\nIn 1942, softball was introduced to Australia by American nurses who were in the country because of World War II. Softball was a cross between rounders and baseball. In 1944, the Victorian Women's Softball Association was created. At its inception and the start of a competition organised by the association, it had 29 teams and 250 players. By 1944, softball was integrated into the University of Melbourne teacher physical education coursework. The first president of this organisation was Irene Burrows.\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe."

The sport was tied with baseball and bowls.\nIn 1983, the Australian Ice Hockey League dealt with the issue of Karen Sommerville trying to compete in a men's ice hockey league by amending the organisation's constitution to prohibit mixed gendered competitions. The organisation cited a need to protect women from harm, and stated that their decision \"has nothing to do with sexism or discrimination\".\nIn 1984, 98% of registered Australian ice hockey players were men: Only 2%, 60 total, were female. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, women's ice hockey saw a large expansion in the number of competitors.\nThe Australian women's national ice hockey team represents Australia at the International Ice Hockey Federation's IIHF World Women's Championships. The women's national team is controlled by Ice Hockey Australia. As of 2011, Australia has 313 female players. Australia is ranked 29th out of 37 countries in the IIHF World Ranking, as of October 2015.\nHistory.\nThe Adelaide Glaciarium (also known as Ice Palace Skating Rink) was the first indoor ice skating facility built in Australia. Opened in 1904, this is the birthplace for ice skating in Australia and is the location of the first hockey on the ice match in the country, which was an adaptation of roller polo for the ice using ice skates. Contemporary ice hockey was never played at this venue but this ice skating rink, the country's first, provided the \"test bed\" facility for its successor the Melbourne Glaciarium, the birthplace of ice hockey in Australia.\nIn 2000 Australia first competed in the qualification tournament held for the right to participate in the 2001 Division I championships. Australia lost all three of their group matches and finished seventh out of eight after beating South Africa in the seventh place game. The following year Australia again played in the qualification tournament in order to be promoted to Division I for the 2003 championships. Australia finished third in the group of five which saw Slovakia promoted to Division I for 2003.\nIn 2003 the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) introduced a new format for the World Championships with the inclusion of second and third division. Australia was placed in the third division and gained promotion to the 2004 Division II tournament after winning four of their five games and finishing on top of the standings. The 2004 World Championships saw Australia relegated along with Great Britain from Division II to Division III for the 2005 tournament.\nAt the 2005 World Championships Australia competed in Division III and narrowly avoided relegation to Division IV after finishing fifth out of six teams, beating only South Africa. The next World Championship in 2007, Australia improved, again gaining promotion to Division II for the next years tournament. Promotion to Division II however was again short as Australia finished last in the 2007 tournament and were relegated back to Division III. Australia ice hockey team has never qualified for an Olympic tournament.\nWomen's ice hockey today.\nThe Australian Ice Hockey Federation, currently trading as Ice Hockey Australia (IHA), is the official national governing body of ice hockey in Australia and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. It was first established in 1908, making it one of the oldest national ice hockey associations in the world.\nThe Australian Women's Ice Hockey League (AWIHL) is an amateur women's ice hockey league in Australia. This league represents the highest level national competition for women's hockey and is currently represented in four states: South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

It has been speculated that New Zealand may join the league in the upcoming years.\nTeam history.\nAdelaide Adrenaline.\nStarting their time in the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League as the Adelaide Assassins, the team began by winning the finals championship for the first 5 years in a row. The Assassins were renamed the Adelaide Adrenaline when they became part of the existing club that had a men's team in the national competition, the Australian Ice Hockey League in the 2011–2012 season.\nBrisbane Goannas.\nQueensland is represented by the Brisbane Goannas in the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League.\nMelbourne Ice.\nVictoria was originally represented by the Melbourne Dragons in the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League up until 2010 when they were renamed the Melbourne Ice, sharing their name with one of Melbourne's national men's teams in the Australian Ice Hockey League. From 2010, the Melbourne Ice home stadium was the Medibank Icehouse, which was renamed as of September 1, 2015 the O'Brien Group Arena.\nSydney Sirens.\nThe Sydney Sirens were one of the four founding teams in the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League and represent New South Wales. From 2011 to 2013 the Sydney Sirens were known as the North Star Sirens but reverted to their original name which they presently use.\nPerth Inferno\nPerth Inferno entered the league as an expansion team in the 2018-2019 season. The team was originally founded around the state team for WA in 2016. Perth has made every Finals weekend since their entrance to the league\nFormation of Under 18's team.\nThe Australia women's national under-18 ice hockey team was formed in 2012 in order to qualify and compete in the IIHF World Women's U18 Championships. The team held its first training camp in September 2012 in Adelaide, South Australia and in January 2013 held another training camp in Brisbane, Queensland. Tamra Jones was named as the team's first head coach with Jo Frankenberger as her assistant. Following the two camps, 14 players and one goalie were included on the team roster.

        "title": "Expansion of the National Rugby League",
        "text": "The National Rugby League is the top level rugby league competition in Australia and New Zealand. It was formed in 1998 after the merger of the Australian Super League and the Australian Rugby League. Inaugurally containing 20 teams, rationalisation cut this number down to 14 by 2000, before the competition expanded back to 16 in 2007 and 17 in 2023. Debate regarding the expansion of the competition to 18 and even 20 teams is ongoing.\nHistory.\nRationalisation (1998-2000).\nThe Australian Super league and the ARL combined had 22 teams in 1997. When the NRL was formed in 1998, it was decided that there would only be 20 teams. The Melbourne Storm were the sole expansion team that year, meaning that the NRL had to remove three teams: the WA Reds, the South Queensland Crushers and the Hunter Mariners. In 1999 the Adelaide Rams and the Gold Coast Chargers were removed from the competition, as were the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2000.\nThe NRL achieved further reduction in the number teams through mergers of established clubs from Sydney and regional New South Wales. There were three mergers between 1999 and 2000 – The St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers formed the St. George Illawarra Dragons, the Western Suburbs Magpies and Balmain Tigers formed Wests Tigers, and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and North Sydney Bears formed the Northern Eagles. The Northern Eagles dissolved in 2002 and the Sea Eagles returned to the competition the following year.\nReturn of the Rabbitohs (2002).\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs were re-admitted to the competition for the 2002 NRL season after a legal battle with the NRL over their expulsion in the 2000 season, with the help of New Zealand-born Australian actor and Rabbitohs supporter Russell Crowe.\nGold Coast Titans (2007).\nThe Gold Coast Titans were admitted to the NRL for the 2007 season, beating out bids from the Central Coast Bears and Wellington Orcas.\nRedcliffe Dolphins (NRL) (2023).\nOn 13 October 2021, Queensland Cup side the Redcliffe Dolphins were granted a license to field an NRL side from the 2023 season to become the NRL's 17th franchise. They beat out bids from other Queensland rivals, the Brisbane Jets and Brisbane Firehawks.\nFuture expansion.\nThe NRL has repeatedly expressed its intention of further expanding the competition.\nOn 28 April 2021, it was reported that the NRL was considering an eventual 18-team competition divided into two conferences. The format that was suggested by NRL officials would see the nine Sydney-based clubs compete in one conference and the remaining nine teams in the other, with each team playing each other once and then a second time against the other teams in their respective conference. The intended effect is to strengthen the rivalries between the Sydney-based clubs by guaranteeing they all play each other twice, but it would come with the downside of forcing non-Sydney teams to travel a lot more than Sydney teams.\nOn 12 March 2023, News Corp reported a 20-team competition, potentially to reach this number before the beginning of the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane, was being considered by the ARL Commission.\nProposed bids and markets.\nAdelaide Rams.\nAdelaide has not been represented in the NRL since the Adelaide Rams departed following its inaugural season, making it the second-largest city in Australia without a team.\nBrisbane Tigers.\nThe Brisbane Tigers bid for inclusion in the NRL in 2020 under the name \"Brisbane Firehawks\" - a bid which was defeated by the Dolphins. Following suggestions from the NRL that a fifth Queensland-based team could join the league, the Tigers announced they would again bid for the NRL in May 2023. The bid would be boosted by redevelopments to the club's home ground and intentions to target the south-west corridor between Ipswich and Logan. Should the club be accepted, it would be represented in the NRL under a name other than \"Tigers\", due to the Wests Tigers already competing in the league.\nFiji.\nIn March 2024, the Cabinet of Fiji approved an endorsement of Rugby League Bid (Fiji) Limited's goal of securing an NRL license. The Cabinet also approved a tax rebate of 200% for sponsors of the bidding consortium.\nNew Zealand.\nIn March 2021, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo suggested an 18th team could be based in New Zealand to create a rivalry with the New Zealand Warriors.\nSouthern Orcas.\nFollowing the allusion to a potential second New Zealand-based team, a resurrected Wellington Orcas bid was announced by former New Zealand Rugby League chair Andrew Chalmers. The proposed team, potentially under the name ‘Southern Orcas’, would play most home games at Sky Stadium and also take games to Christchurch and Dunedin.\nSouth Island NRL Bid.\nA South Island NRL bid based in Christchurch is headed by former Canterbury Rugby League chairman Tony Kidd, with the intention of playing a majority of home games at the under-construction Te Kaha stadium, with additional games at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. The bid is yet to confirm a name for its proposed team.\nSouth Island Kea.\nAnother bid intended to represent the South Island was announced on 14 March 2024, headed by former NRL chief executive David Moffett, with the name for the proposed team revealed to be the South Island Kea. This team would also make use of the Te Kaha stadium.\nNorth Sydney Bears.\nAfter the Northern Eagles went defunct, the North Sydney Bears have continued to field teams in several grades of the NSW rugby league competitions, and were behind the failed Central Coast Bears bid in the mid-2000s. However, the Bears have expressed their intentions to eventually return the brand to the NRL competition. \nOn October 27, 2021, the Bears stated their intention to return to the NRL, coinciding with the introduction of a new logo for the club. This franchise, which would have been known simply as 'The Bears', proposed splitting home matches between various regional centres as well as major cities that are otherwise currently without NRL representation, allocating between four and six games at a potentially upgraded North Sydney Oval. In 2024, the Bears announced a proposal for the club's identity to represent Pacific Island nations such as Papua New Guinea. The club has also insisted that, in any form a Bears NRL team takes, it would seek to play between four and six home games at North Sydney Oval and return its colours, logo, and the 'Bears' part of its name.\nPapua New Guinea Hunters.\nRugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea and the nation is currently represented in the Queensland Cup by the Papua New Guinea Hunters, who joined the competition in 2014 and the won the premiership in 2017.\nIn February 2021, PNG Prime Minister James Marape declared his hopes of an NRL side in the country by 2025.\nThrough 2023, a Papua New Guinea bid was viewed as a frontrunner to enter the NRL, in light of an Australian Government plan to invest $600 million over a 10-year period in rugby league and socio-economic programs in the country.\nPerth.\nSince the Western Reds were not included in the NRL’s inaugural season, Perth is the largest Australian city without a team in the competition. Advocates for a Perth-based team have argued it is necessary for the NRL to consider itself a ‘truly national’ competition. The Reds name was revived in 2006 as the WA Reds, competing in the under-18s S.G. Ball Cup with the intention of eventually fielding an NRL side. The team rebranded as the West Coast Pirates in 2012 and continued competing in the S.G. Ball Cup until the COVID-19 pandemic prevented them from being able to compete from 2020 onwards. In April 2021, ARLC commissioner Peter Beattie claimed that Western Australia was \"years away\" from having an NRL team.\nWA businessman Tony Sage, the former owner of A-League club Perth Glory, registered the name West Coast Quokkas in April 2021, as a potential name for a new NRL side in the state.\nFormer Reds chairman Laurie Puddy has also been invested in reintroducing a Perth-based NRL side. In May 2021, he criticised the NRL’s prioritisation of a second New Zealand team over a Perth team, calling it \"immoral\". In October, he revealed plans to revive the Reds name. He suggested such a team could be ready to begin competing in 2024, the year after the Dolphins began to play, and could also attract crowds of 20,000 at Perth's HBF Park.\nFormer first grade sides now in New South Wales Cup have proposed returning to the NRL via a Perth-based franchise. In 2018 the North Sydney Bears explored the possibility of combining with a Perth bid to establish a ‘Western Bears’ franchise. In June 2023, NewsCorp reported that the Newtown Jets were aiming to return to the NRL with a team based in Perth. Alongside this, they would follow a similar model to the one proposed by North Sydney Bears in which they would play a handful of games at their historic home ground of Henson Park. The bid is reported to be supported by the West Australian government and being spearheaded by MP Peter Tinley.\nPast bids.\nOther consortiums and clubs have expressed interest in launching an NRL team in past years. These bids have gone quiet more recently and are considered defunct.\nBrisbane Jets.\nThe Brisbane Jets bid was one of three considered by the NRL in 2021. An amalgamation of two other Brisbane-based bids, the Jets sought to tap into the south-west of Brisbane, including with a 20,500-seat stadium in Ipswich.\nBrothers Leprechauns.\nIn April 2013, a bid was made to bring Brothers Leprechauns into the NRL, uniting and representing a large base revolving around over 40 Brothers clubs across three states. Bid founder Justin Barlow proposed to base a Brothers NRL team at Corbett Park in Brisbane’s northern suburbs and primarily play out of Suncorp Stadium. The team was also proposed to take a handful of home games each year to regional centres, and would be the pathway for junior rugby league players that come up through a club in the Brothers Confraternity.\nThe Brothers Confraternity made no expression of interest when the NRL declared its interest in introducing another Brisbane-based side in 2020.\nCentral Coast Bears.\nThe Central Coast Bears were a proposed team based on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. They were trying to be included in an expanded National Rugby League competition since 2006. The proposed team would have played 11 games in Gosford and one game against Manly at North Sydney Oval, in the annual Heritage Round.\nCentral Queensland.\nIn April 2009, a consortium from the Central Queensland region declared their intent to launch a bid for an NRL team to be based in Rockhampton. The bid aimed to be a new club by 2013.\nSouth Pacific Cyclones.\nFollowing the failed Wellington Orcas bid, the Wellington Rugby League began working on a proposal and business plan for a second New Zealand based team in 2008. They proposed a club that would be based in Wellington and divide their games between the New Zealand capital and other locations in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands."

        "title": "Women's field hockey in Australia",
        "text": "Women's field hockey in Australia began informally in New South Wales and Tasmania from as early as 1901, with the first team developed in Sydney in 1903. Soon after, Women's field hockey began to be played in schools, universities and eventually developed state and national teams. Women's field hockey was eventually represented by the Australian Institute of Sport, though it did not receive the same support as the men's field hockey. The Australia women's national field hockey team (nicknamed \"the Hockeyroos\"), established in 1914, has placed highly in many competitions.\nHistory.\nThe first women's field hockey team founded in Australia was the Wandah Club. This club was based out of Sydney and was created in 1903. It was founded by Miss Clubbe and her sister. Later that year, after the club was founded, school based began to be played in Hobart and Sydney girls' schools. That year also saw the creation of clubs in New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia. Women's hockey in Australia predates this on an informal, non-club level. Women were informally playing field hockey in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania by 1901. Field hockey began to be played by women in Melbourne in 1907.\nIn 1934, the Victorian Women's Centennial Sports Carnival was held. The event was organised by the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council and held at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds. The purpose was to increase women's interest in sport by providing them opportunities to play. Sports that were included on the programme included cricket, field hockey, women's basketball, bowls, rowing, swimming, athletics, rifle shooting, baseball, golf, tennis and badminton. There were over 1,000 bowlers involved over the course a week. Cricket featured a match versus a visiting English side. Women's basketball featured a Victorian side playing against a representative all Australian side. There was a day for watersports such as swimming and rowing. A tennis tournament was held. A field hockey tournament featuring Australian, Kiwi and Fijian teams was played.\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\nIn January 1981, the Australian Institute of Sport opened. Field hockey, men's or women's, was not a sport that was part of the original group of sports represented by the institute. The sport was later included, with women being represented in equal numbers to their male peers. While the representation by gender would later be similar, space issues at the Australian Institute of Sport prevented some development when compared to the men's game. Hockey was originally based at the Australian Institute of Sport at a Perth-based headquarters. This arrangement was done with agreements between the institute, the Commonwealth government and the government of Western Australia. When hockey was first included at AIS, an initial committee was created which included a chairman from AIS, an AHA representative, an AWHA representative, a representative from WAIT, a representative from Western Australia's government and a sports medicine representative. At the onset, sixteen male players were awarded scholarships but zero female players were.\nWomen's state teams have historically been coached by men. This means that there are many similarities in the style of play between the men and women's style of play on the local, state and national level.\nGovernance.\nThe governance of women's field hockey in Australia began in 1907, when a New South Wales association was created. National governance came about on 2 July 1910 when the All Australian Women's Hockey Association was created. The first president of this organisation was Gwynneth Morris of Victoria. The national organisation became an affiliate of the All England Women's Hockey Association right away. Marie Montgomerie Hamilton who had led the New South Wales Hockey Association for over twenty years became the All-Australia chair from 1932 to 1934 and again from 1945 to 1954.\nIn 2000, Women's Hockey Australia merged with the Australian Hockey Association to form Hockey Australia.\nIn 1933, the New South Wales Amateur Women's Sport Council was created by Gwendolen Game. The organisation brought together all the women's sporting bodies on the state level. Sports represented included New South Wales's women's field hockey, cricket, women's basketball, baseball, rowing and vigoro. A similar organisation covering similar sports had been created in Victoria in 1931.\nSchools and university.\nA university field hockey team for women was first established at the University of Queensland in 1912.\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.\nInterstate.\nThe first interstate match in Australia occurred in 1909 when a New South Wales representative side competed against a representative Victorian side in Melbourne. The first interstate tournament occurred the following year at a competition in Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales. Representative sides from Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales competed.\nAn interstate competition was held to determine the national champions starting in 1946. In the period between 1946 and 1967, Western Australia's team claimed sole victory in all but five years. Those years they did not win sole victory include 1948 where they shared the top with New South Wales, 1954 when New South Wales won, 1956 when the competition was not held, 1961 when Queensland won, and 1965 when they shared victory with South Australia.\nState sides have historically been very competitive, making national team selection very difficult as the level of play is very high. An example of the level of competition being high on the state side can be found in 1983 when a South Australian representative side beat the Indian national team that was doing a tour of the country.\nInternational.\nthe Australia women's national field hockey team (nicknamed \"The Hockeyroos\") played its first game in 1914 against the England XI team. This was the first international match that Australia competed in. The English made an appearance in the country on a trip to New Zealand and played only one game. An English representative team was the first international team to tour Australia. They did this tour in 1927, playing three test matches, an inter-state tournament and matches in every Australian state. England won every game they played during this 1927 tour.\nFlorinda Katharine Ogilvie led the All Australia Women’s Hockey Association from 1926 and in 1930 she went with them when they undertook their first international tour.\nAustralia played their first international match on foreign soil that year when they went to South Africa and Rhodesia to compete in an Empire tournament. At the conclusion of this tournament, the team went on a tour of the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Australia made their first appearance in a World Championship competition in 1936 in the tournament held in the United States. Australia had their first victory against England in 1953. They beat England 2 goals to 1. This victory occurred at the 5th International Tournament that was held in England that year. In 1959, Australia won their first international tournament: The 1959 Holland Tournament.\nIn 1967, the Australian women's national team completed a tour of ten countries in a period of four months, playing thirty-one games and only losing five. That same year, they competed in the 9th World Championship where they finished in the top four alongside national teams from South Africa, England and the Netherlands. The Australian women participated in the first Women's World Cup for field hockey that was held in 1979. The team finished fourth. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Australia and New Zealand were both leading women's field hockey nations that were competitive with their European counterparts. In 1981, the Australians won the America's Cup, the first year this competition was held. That same year, the team also competed in the 1981 version of the World Cup. They finished fourth. In 1982, the Australians competed in a New Zealand tournament featuring teams from the Netherlands, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and England. The team finished second. That year, the team also competed in the New Zealand Tournament. They finished second.\nThe process for qualifying for the 1984 Summer Olympics depended on a team's performance at the 1983 World Cup. The 1983 World Cup was also a significant event for Australian women's field hockey because it was the first World Cup that was governed by the International Hockey Federation, an international governing body that for the first time represented both sexes. The World Cup was held in April in Kuala Lumpur. Australia was in pool A with Scotland, the United States, Wales, the Netherlands and India. Players for the team included Lorraine Wharton. Players for the team included Lorraine Wharton and Elspeth Clement. The team was coached by Brian Glencross. Elspeth Clement was the second leading scorer in the tournament, scoring seven goals, three less than Jane Swinnerton of England who scored ten. The Australians led in penalty scorners awarded in the tournament, with seventy-one, where they converted nine of them into goals. Australia finished tied with England for first in the tournament for penalty strokes award with three. They converted only one of those, compared to England's two. On the first day, Australia beat Wales five to zero. On the third day, Australia beat India by a score of three to two. On the fourth day, Australia tied Scotland one all. On day six, the Netherlands beat Australia one to zero. On day six, the Netherlands beat Australia one to zero. On day seven, Australia tied the American team one all. On day ten during the semi-finals, Australia tied Canada zero to zero. Extra time was played. The game was still a tie. The game went to penalty strokes, which Canada won eight to five. On day twelve, Australia played in the Bronze Medal match and beat Germany by a score of three to one. The Australian team finished third.\nBetween 1931 and 1983, Australia's national team has finished first in twice, second five times, third six times and fourth three times in international competitions. During that same time period, Australia's women have competed in sixty-two test matches, where they won twenty-seven, drew eleven and lost twenty-four matches. The team has one three Olympic gold medals (1988, 1996, 2000), two World Cup gold medals (1994, 1998), six Champions Trophies (1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 , 1999, 2003) and three Commonwealth Games gold medals (1998, 2006, 2010).\nPopularity.\nIn 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport. The ninth most popular sport that these women participated in was field hockey, with 3 having played the sport. The sport was tied with billiards, chess, fishing, croquet, horse racing, squash, table tennis and shooting.\nUniforms.\nEarly field hockey uniforms in the 1900s and 1910s consisted of high-button shoes, ankle length skirts and long sleeved button up shirts.\nPeople.\nOne of the important people in developing women's field hockey in Australia was Louie Wilkie."

        "text": "Rugby Club Rad Belgrade (Serbian: Рагби Клуб Рад Београд) is a rugby union club from Belgrade, Serbia. RK Rad, previously known as RK Pobednik, is one of the biggest rugby clubs within the former Yugoslavia, having won ten national championships and seven national cup trophies. The club is a member of the Serbian Rugby Union.\nHistory.\nIn December 1996, a group of enthusiasts and lovers of rugby, led by Bosko Strugar, founded Rugby Club Pobednik. The early years were not easy as there were no pitches or club house. However, all members helped develop the club which brought results quickly. In difficult times, the players bought the required equipment and funded travel so the club could survive. The club is now sponsored by Mozzart Sports Betting.\nIn December 2014 Pobednik was renamed Rad. This was previously the name of its associated junior rugby club, after a link was established with football club FK Rad. In English, Rad translates as \"work\" or \"labour\", and the football club was formed by the Serbian construction company of the same name. RK Rad's president Marko Kapor is also on the board of directors of FK Rad. The club wears a blue and white kit.\nDomestic competitions.\nIn the 1997/1998 season Pobednik joined the Rugby Championship of SR Yugoslavia and reached the playoffs. The first game ended with the triumph, with victory over the well-established club KBRK (now BRK Red Star). Ultimately Ragbi Klub Partizan took the championship in that season, but only two years later Pobednik defeated Partizan to become the new States champion. Pobednik won their second title the following year, and extended the winning streak to claim seven straight Championships from 2007 to 2013. Pobednik has also won 4 domestic Cups.\nRegional league.\nRegional Rugby Championship started in 2007, 3 teams from Serbia, 3 teams from Croatia, 2 teams from Slovenia, 3 teams from Hungary, 2 teams from Bosnia and Herzegovina, one team from Greece and one team from Austria. RC Pobednik were the runners-up in 4 seasons between 2007 and 2012.\nCurrent squad.\nThe club currently has more than a hundred members who compete in five categories. The youth categories are the greatest source of the club's strength with talented young players being produced every year. Pobednik (now Rad) has provided more national representative players for Serbia than any other club.\nPersonnel.\nClub 100.\nThe following players are members of the 100 club, having played 100 or more games for the club:\nKapor Marko, Rastovac Milan, Vuković Goran, Nikolić Srđan, Radulović Vladimir, Labus Jerko, Marković Predrag, Vraneš Predrag, Ristić Marko, Kapor Branko, Orlović Milan, Živanov Miladin, Jovanović Nebojša, Simonović Nemanja, Đukić Vladimir"

As Western Province has the best infrastructure sometimes the team was divided into two teams: Basnahira North and Basnahira South.\nHistory.\nFrom the early years of the Inter-Provincial tournament to the 2004/05 season the teams used English names, but from 2007/08 onwards the teams were named in Sinhalese. From its inception of the tournament Western Province presented more than one team to the tournament except for 2003/04 and 2004/05 seasons. Since then Western province teams became known as Basnahira North and Basnahira South (Basnahira is Sinhalese for West). The number of teams representing Western province varied from season to season, as did their names. In 2011 Basnahira North and South teams became Basnahira.

        "text": "The Madrid Open (; formerly known as the Madrid Masters, and currently known as the Mutua Madrid Open for sponsorship reasons) is an annual professional tennis tournament held in Madrid, Spain. It is played on clay courts at the Caja Mágica in Manzanares Park, San Fermín, and is held in late April and early May. The tournament is an ATP Masters 1000 event on the ATP Tour and a WTA 1000 event on the WTA Tour. The tournament is traditionally played on a red clay surface, though it was played on blue clay courts in 2012.\nIon Țiriac, a Romanian billionaire businessman and former ATP professional, was the owner of the tournament between 2009 and 2021. According to Digi Sport which interviewed Țiriac in 2019, the tournament brings to the city of Madrid annual benefits exceeding €107 million. In 2021, Țiriac sold the tournament to New York–based IMG for approximately €390 million.\nHistory.\nFrom its inauguration as a men's only event in 2002, the tournament was classified as one of the ATP Masters Series tournaments, where it replaced the now-defunct Eurocard Open in Stuttgart. It was held from 2002 to 2008 in the Madrid Arena as the first of two Master's indoor hard court late-season events that preceded the ATP Tour Finals (also indoors). It was replaced on the Masters schedule by the Shanghai Masters after the 2008 season. In 2009, the tournament was reborn under new ownership with a new location, new surface, and new time slot. It expanded to include a premier women's contest (replacing the tournament in Berlin) and shifted to an earlier period of the tennis season to become the second Master's tournament of the spring European clay-court swing (replacing the Hamburg Open). The event moved outdoors to Park Manzanares, where a new complex with a retractable-roof equipped main court was constructed, the Caja Magica.\nȚiriac announced in April 2019 that he has extended his sponsorship contract of the Mutua Madrid Open for 10 additional years, until 2031. Because he agreed to continue in Madrid, Țiriac will receive more than 30 million euros from the city of Madrid in the coming years. Feliciano López was announced as the Madrid tournament director, commencing 2019.\nStarting in 2021, the women's tournament, part of the WTA tour, expanded to become a two-week tournament.\nBy December of the same year, it was announced Tiriac sold the event to IMG, which is now the new organizator and has already planned an expansion of courts, including a new stadium for over 10,000 people, to be built by partly draining the lake circling Caja Magica.\nIn June 2022 ATP announced some changes to the ATP calendar for the coming year. The ATP Masters 1000 event in Madrid along with those in Shanghai and in Rome would now be held over two weeks starting in 2023, thus becoming 12 day events just like the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Miami.\nBlue clay.\nTiriac proposed and implemented in 2012 a new color of blue clay for all the courts' surfaces, motivating that it would supposedly be better visually, especially for viewers on television (analogous to some hardcourt surface events migrating to blue from various previous color schemes). Some speculated that the adaptation of blue colour was a nod to the titular sponsor of the tournament, the Spanish insurance giant Mutua Madrileña. This controversial change was subsequently granted and began to be used in the 2012 edition of the tournament. In 2009 one of the outer tennis courts had already been made of the new surface for the players to test it. Manuel Santana, the Open's director, had assured that aside from the colour, the surface kept the same properties as the traditional red clay.\nOn 1 December 2011, Țiriac confirmed that the blue clay surface was officially approved for the 2012 edition of the tournament, in both the ATP and WTA circuits.\nHowever, after the event took place in 2012, threats of future boycotts from some players, especially Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic (who both lost on the blue surface), led the tournament to return to the traditional red clay for the 2013 season. This was due to the blue clay being more slippery than regular clay.\nRoger Federer is the only male player to win the tournament on three different surfaces: hard courts (2006), red clay (2009), and blue clay (2012). Serena Williams is the only female player to win the tournament on two different surfaces: blue clay (2012) and red clay (2013)."

        "title": "Santa Clara Broncos baseball",
        "text": "The Santa Clara Broncos baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team that represents Santa Clara University in NCAA Division I college baseball. Santa Clara Baseball competes in the West Coast Conference, of which the Santa Clara Broncos were a charter member. The Broncos play their home games on campus at Stephen Schott Stadium, which opened in 2005. The Broncos and are led by head coach Rusty Filter, currently in his fifth season.\nHaving begun play in 1883, Santa Clara is currently in its 129th season of varsity baseball, and has enjoyed a long history of baseball excellence. Santa Clara has won 11 Conference Pennants, and appeared in 12 NCAA Tournaments, including a runner-up finish in the 1962 College World Series. Individually, 34 Broncos have been named All-Americans, and 158 players have been drafted in the MLB Draft, with 48 players making it to the Major Leagues.\nHistory.\nThe early years.\nBaseball is the oldest sport at Santa Clara, with the first recorded season coming in 1883. Prior to that, Santa Clara students had long engaged in baseball games against one another. Santa Clara's first intercollegiate baseball game came in 1883, when the Jesuit fathers finally allowed Santa Clara students to take an overnight trip to play fledgling Saint Mary's College, then located in San Francisco. Santa Clara lost the game, but began an athletic relationship with Saint Mary's that has blossomed into one of the oldest and most heated athletic rivalries in the west. For years, it was a long-standing tradition for Santa Clara and Saint Mary's to play on St. Patricks day. Early opponents like Pacific (1895), and Stanford (1892) remain fixtures on Santa Clara's baseball schedules 140 years later.\nThe seriousness that the students and administration gave to baseball is reflected in the caliber of coaches that were hired by the school. Early managers like Billy Hulen, Joe Corbett, Jay Hughes, Jimmy Byrnes, and Patsy O'Rourke were all former major league players who had made the trek west to coach baseball at what was the known as Santa Clara College. \nSanta Clara's Frank Arellanes was the first Hispanic professional baseball player, who played for the Boston Red Sox in 1908. Another Bronco baseball player from the early period was Harry Wolter, who recorded the first hit in then-new Fenway Park as a member of the Red Sox. Elmer Stricklett, who played at Santa Clara and made his way to the Major Leagues, is considered the inventor of the spitball.\nThe most notable contributor to Santa Clara Baseball was 1898 graduate Charlie Graham. A Santa Clara native, Graham played two years of baseball at Santa Clara, returned to teach Latin and Greek, as well as coach from 1901 to 1903. Graham then embarked on a baseball career which saw him rise from obscurity in the western minor leagues to becoming the starting catcher for the Boston Americans, and star pitcher Cy Young. Unfortunately, Graham was heartbroken by the news of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, ending his career only a few months into the season. He returned home, and ultimately became the owner of the San Francisco Seals, and donated generously to Santa Clara and the baseball program. The university's largest dormitory, Graham Hall, is named in his honor.\nDue to the nature of College Baseball in the Pre-War years, Santa Clara had no conference affiliation and made no post-season appearances in the early years, as those things had yet to come into existence. However, the competitiveness of the Santa Clara teams from prior to 1946 is exhibited in the number of Major League players produced in this period, notably Harry Wolter (Major League debut in 1907), Elmer Stricklett (1904), Hardin Barry (1912), Justin Fitzgerald (1911), Hal Chase (1905), Charlie Graham (1906), Tillie Shafer (1908), Frank Arellanes (1908), William Hogan (1911), Erv Kantlehner (1914), Frank Shellenback (1918), Bevo LeBourveau (1919), Bill Lawrence (1932), Jim O'Connell (1923), Marv Owen (1931), and Les Powers (1938).\nWartime cancellation, post-war success.\nSanta Clara was forced to cancel the baseball program for two seasons, 1943 and 1944, due to wartime restrictions and a devotion of resources and manpower to the war effort, though baseball remained a popular form of recreation on campus.\nFollowing the end of the war, Santa Clara returned to the diamond and found immediate success under John \"Paddy\" Cottrell, who coached the team from 1946 to 1951. Cottrell retired in 1951, but after watching Santa Clara languish under subsequent coaches, the university and Alumni asked him to come out of retirement in 1961. With Cottrell at the helm things began to fall into place for Santa Clara.\nSanta Clara, along with Stanford, California, USC, and Others, formed the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association in 1960. For the first time in their already 80-year-long history, Santa Clara baseball had a conference home. The CIBA stood as one of the preeminent baseball conferences, and allowed Santa Clara to recruit the highest possible caliber of player. Though Santa Clara stumbled in Cottrell's first year at the helm, in 1962 the Broncos jumped out to an impressive start, and held the #1 spot in the polls for almost the entirety of the 1962 season. The baseball crazed Bay Area, who had just received their first major league franchises a few years earlier, lent their full support to the Broncos. During this season, Santa Clara games were first made available by radio broadcast. Led by five future major leaguers – Bob Garibaldi, Ernie Fazio, John Boccabella, Pete Magrini, and Tim Cullen, the Broncos found their way to the College World Series finals. In heartbreaking fashion, Santa Clara fell to Michigan on a 15th inning passed ball. Bob Garibaldi was the College World Series MVP, and became the first player to have a million dollar signing bonus.\nThe success of the 1962 Broncos helped spur the fundraising efforts that lead to the building of Buck Shaw Stadium, home to Bronco baseball from 1963 until they moved to a baseball specific venue in 2005, Stephen Schott Stadium. John Cottrell, in his second stint as the Bronco manager from 1961 to 1964, amassed a 102–44 record, good for a .699 winning percentage. Collectively, the Broncos won nearly 70% of their games from 1961 to 1979.\nTaormina takes over.\nHe was followed as manager by Sal Taormina, who went 511–249 from 1965 to 1979, a .672 winning percentage. \"Dirty\" Al Gallagher, a future major leaguer, helped ease the transition from Cottrell to Taormina.\nThe CIBA Era ended when the WCAC, the former name of the modern WCC, began sponsoring baseball in 1968. The Broncos reeled off Conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances for four consecutive years, followed by three straight second-place finishes, setting the early tone that Santa Clara would be a name to respect in WCC baseball. To date, only Pepperdine holds more League Titles, NCAA Tournament Appearances, and College World Series appearances than the Broncos.\nIn his final year as Head Coach at SCU, Taormina took the Broncos back to the NCAA tournament in 1978.\nHot and cold.\nAfter the retirement of Coach Taormina, the Broncos were led by Al Endriss and Jerry McClain, neither of whom could replicate the success that Coach Taormina had sustained over his tenure. Santa Clara, however, found a dependable manager once again when alumnus John Oldham took the reins in 1985. Oldham would coach the Broncos for 12 seasons, leading SCU to 4 NCAA tournaments appearances, first in 1988, and then in 1994, 1996, and 1997. Notable players to play for Oldham include John Savage, Randy Winn, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. Santa Clara's Randy Winn, who also played basketball for the Broncos, enjoyed a decade long Major League career, and helped lead the Broncos to the NCAA tournament in basketball in 1994.\nFor 8 seasons, from 1977 to 1984, the WCAC ceased to sponsor baseball, and the Broncos found a home in the NCBA, the Northern California Baseball Association. Santa Clara and rival Fresno State dominated NCBA competition, as the Broncos and Bulldogs were the only teams to win the NCBA championship while the league existed. Santa Clara won the league twice in their stay, and appeared in the NCAA tournament in 1978. In 1985, the Broncos returned to the WCAC, which shortened its name to the WCC in 1988.\nSanta Clara's success has been peculiar, as in the NCAA tournament era, the Broncos have been coached by 11 men, but only 4 have taken the Broncos to the Tournament- Bill Leonard, Paddy Cottrell, Sal Taormina, and John Oldham. Still the Broncos 12 NCAA tournament trips ranks good enough for second all-time in the WCC. Santa Clara's baseball team has enjoyed periods of being both hot and cold, the history of Santa Clara baseball can be summed as having sustained success and NCAA tournament appearances under those four long tenured coaches, but sitting on sitting on the outside looking in while coached by anyone else.\nIn 1998, Santa Clara introduced Mark O'Brien as head coach. O'Brien would stay until 2011, in a tenure characterized by tantalizingly close results, with many years finishing in the top third of the conference, but never winning a conference title or making an NCAA tournament trip.\nDespite a string of 4 consecutive 1st and 2nd-place finished from 2001 to 2004 under Mark O'Brien, Santa Clara has not returned to the NCAA tournament since 1997. While at the helm of the Broncos, Mark O'Brien and his staff were said to have struggled to compete in recruiting while playing at the outdated multi-purpose Buck Shaw Stadium. Santa Clara responded by building the $8.6 million Stephen Schott Stadium, a 1,500 seat state-of-the-art baseball specific venue that is one of the finest facilities of its size on the West Coast. The stadium was financed in large part by Santa Clara Alumnus Stephen Schott, a varsity baseball player in 1960, and at that time, owner of the Oakland Athletics.\nHowever, the push to the top that the university and boosters expected from the new facility didn't materialize. From 2000 to 2004, the last seasons at Buck Shaw, the Broncos never finished lower than third place. However, when the Broncos moved to the new Stephen Schott Stadium, Mark O'Brien never lead the Broncos to anything higher than third, and twice finished as low as eighth. Since playing in a conference for the first time in 1960, the Broncos had never finished lower than fifth, and that had only happened three times in the 45-year span of conference play prior to moving to Schott.\nBecause of these disappointing results for the historic program in a brand new facility, Mark O'Brien was fired in 2011 and replaced with longtime UCSD manager, Dan O'Brien, no relation.\nMark O'Brien's tenure was not without notable products—Santa Clara's Daniel Nava made an improbable run from SCU baseball manager to a contributing player on the 2013 Red Sox, who won the world series, and Santa Clara's Tommy Medica made his MLB debut in 2013 for the San Diego Padres.\nDan O'Brien and the \"relentless development\" era.\nDan O'Brien, the 43rd manager of the Santa Clara Baseball program, came to Santa Clara from University of California, San Diego, where he was a player, assistant coach, and then head coach for a total of 16 seasons. O'Brien had led the Tritons from Division III to Division II, building the program into a national championship contender. He had led the Tritons to the NCAA Division II baseball tournament six times, and twice to the Division II College World Series, finishing as runner-up in 2010.\nO'Brien began the task of rebuilding the Bronco baseball program, leading the Broncos to a 26–28 record and a 9th-place finish in the WCC. Following the loss of the top five pitchers from 2012, Santa Clara sank to its lowest baseball nadir, finishing in last for the second year in a row with a 1–23 mark in the WCC. Despite the early rebuilding struggles, in 2014 O'Brien guided the Broncos to a 16–11 record in league play, their best record in the WCC since 2003, which earned them their first ever berth in the WCC Baseball Tournament. The four-team tournament was introduced in 2013, replacing the two-team championship that the conference had used since 1998. The appearance in the WCC Tournament marked the first time that Santa Clara had appeared in the post-season in 16 years.\nO'Brien vowed to return to Santa Clara to the baseball prominence it had enjoyed for nearly 110 years prior to the struggles of the Broncos since the retirement of John Oldham. O'Brien placed an emphasis on constant player development, with a system he called \"relentless development\". In addition, O'Brien felt that Santa Clara had shifted away from the old-school baseball mentality that once had characterized the program. As a result, Santa Clara introduced throwback uniforms in the 2013 season which were based on the uniforms worn by the Broncos in the late 1930s.\nRusty Filter Era.\nRusty Filter was brought in as the 44th manager of the Santa Clara Baseball program in June 2017; after spending the previous eight years at Stanford where he was among the top pitching coaches in the nation. In his first season at the helm, Filter led the Broncos to a 26–26 record and a 6th-place finish in the WCC, doubling the Broncos win total from the 2017 season. The Broncos could not build on the season in 2019, finishing the season with a 12–40 record overall, including 5–22 in WCC play, leading to finishing 10th in the conference. With two years two learn Filter's style of play, and 18 seniors on the roster, the Broncos got off to a hot start to the 2020 season with a 12–5 record. Two of the 12 wins were against top 25 teams in #25 Stanford at home and #3 Georgia on the road. Just before conference play started, the NCAA canceled all spring sports for the remainder of their respective seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced in May that 15 of the 18 seniors would be returning for their extra year of eligibility in 2021, granted by the NCAA to all spring athletes.\nSanta Clara Baseball Stadium History.\nThe Santa Clara Baseball team played their home games on campus at Buck Shaw Stadium from 1963 to 2004. Prior to 1963, Santa Clara played their games at the extant Washington Field, a large diamond located on the campus of Santa Clara High School, now Buchsher Middle School. A new era for Santa Clara University baseball began on April 30, 2005, with the sold-out opening of Stephen Schott Stadium. The $8.6 million project was kicked off in January, 2004 with a $4 million pledge from former SCU baseball player and former owner of the Oakland Athletics, Stephen Schott. The 1,500-seat stadium houses the entire Santa Clara baseball program, including its training, practice and equipment facilities. Also equipped with a 600 square-foot press box and VIP suite, Schott Stadium is one of the premier college baseball stadiums on the West Coast. Designed with player development in mind, Schott Stadium provides the Santa Clara baseball staff and players with every possible tool for success.\nIn the Pros.\nFormer Major Leaguer Baseball Players.\nNOTE: Team listed in parentheses is the Major League Baseball team they played for during their professional debut."

Miller played college football as a defensive end for the UCF Knights, finishing as the school's career leader in sacks with 35.5. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft and played for them until 2016, when he was released following an arrest for felony assault charges. He spent the next four years out of football before playing the 2020 season with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nCollege career.\nMiller attended Cherokee High School in Canton, Georgia, and the University of Central Florida (UCF), where he played college football for the UCF Knights. He redshirted in his first year and won All-Conference USA honors for four years. In college, he played defensive end. He was named CUSA Defensive Player of the Year in his junior and senior seasons.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nThe San Francisco 49ers selected Miller as a fullback in the seventh round, with the 211th overall selection, of the 2011 NFL draft. Miller scored his first NFL touchdown on a 30-yard pass from quarterback Alex Smith on November 6, 2011, in a game against the Washington Redskins. At the end of the 2012 season, Miller and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII. He contributed on offense and special teams as the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34–31. On March 20, 2014, Miller signed a three-year contract extension with the 49ers. \nDuring the 2016 offseason, Miller attempted to switch positions from fullback to tight end. On September 5, 2016, he was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department and charged with assault for allegedly attacking two men, a 70-year-old father and his middle aged son, vacationing at the Fisherman's Wharf location of the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco.

He was reinstated from suspension on December 14 and restored to the practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster on December 26 for the team's week 16 game against the Chicago Bears, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. His contract with the team expired after the season.\nLegal trouble.\nMiller pleaded no contest to misdemeanor disturbing the peace as a result of an incident involving his ex-fiancée on March 5, 2015 and was subsequently ordered to attend domestic violence counseling.\nIn May 2023, a threatening message was sent to U.S. Congressman Eric Swalwell on Twitter that was believed to be from Miller. Swalwell subsequently reported the matter to the Capitol Police."

        "text": "The men's track time trial in Cycling at the 2000 Summer Olympics was a time trial race in which each of the sixteen cyclists attempted to set the fastest time for four laps (1 kilometre) of the track. The race was held on Saturday, September 16 at the Dunc Gray Velodrome. For the first time since 1896, a nation had more than one cyclist: Germany had two. The event was won by Jason Queally of Great Britain, the nation's first victory in the men's track time trial (and first medal in the event since 1948). Stefan Nimke's silver was the first medal for Germany since 1936 (though the United Team of Germany, East Germany, and West Germany had each won medals). Shane Kelly, the 1992 silver medalist from Australia, became the fifth and last man to win multiple medals in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. For the first time, a women's track time trial event was held as well. Both the men's and women's versions would be cancelled after the 2004 Games, however.\nThe returning cyclists from 1996 were fourth-place finisher Soeren Lausberg of Germany, sixth-place finisher Grzegorz Krejner of Poland, seventh-place finisher Dimitrios Georgalis of Greece, and non-finisher Shane Kelly of Australia. Kelly had taken silver in 1992, won the world championship in 1995, and set the world record in 1995; he had been favored in 1996 but his foot slipped from his toe clip. Kelly won the world championship again in 1996 and 1997, coming in second to Arnaud Tournant of France in 1998 and 1999. Kelly and Tournant were the favorites in Sydney.\nThe Czech Republic made its debut in the men's track time trial, though Czechoslovakia has appeared before. France made its 18th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nJason Queally broke the Olympic record with a time of 1:01.609. Stefan Nimke also beat the old Olympic record, but raced after Queally and did not beat his new mark.\nResults.\nLausberg was the best of the first 12 cyclists. Queally went 13th, breaking the Olympic record and setting a time that nobody else would beat. Nimke rode after Queally, moving into second place. Kelly was 15th, recording a time that placed him third with only Tournant to go. The French cyclist, favored to win, had the best first-half but finished slowly and came in outside the medals with the fifth-best time."

        "text": "Matt Saunders (born 13 September 1982) is a former New Zealand rugby union player who played provincial rugby for Southland and initially Otago in the National Provincial Championship. He also represented the Highlanders in the Super Rugby competition.\nPlaying career.\nProvincial Rugby.\nSaunders' first-class rugby career started with a bang as he debuted for North Otago aged only 17 in a Ranfurly Shield contest against Waikato in 2000. After three seasons with North Otago, he transferred to the Otago Rugby Union in 2002. He made his provincial debut for Otago in 2003 and quickly established himself as a player of substantial promise.\nAfter injury ruled him out of the 2004 provincial season, he returned in fine form in 2005 in a year that was highlighted by his selection for a match against the touring British &amp; Irish Lions.\nHowever, another injury forced him to miss most of the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, and a disappointing 2007 season saw him released from both Otago and the Highlanders.\nWith his career at a crossroads, Saunders signed with Southland for the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup and began to work on rebuilding his career. With Southland, he proved to be a reliable performer on the wing, and helped the province to a historic Ranfurly Shield triumph in 2009. His strong performances in the 2010 ITM Cup saw him brought back into the Highlanders squad for the 2011 Super Rugby season.\nSuper Rugby.\nSaunders' performances for Otago saw him selected to the Highlanders squad for the 2004 Super 12 season, and given the chance to start 3 games late in the season responded with a series of outstanding performances. He carried that momentum into the 2005 Super 12 season, where he started 9 of the team's 11 games and was one of their most reliable backfield performers.\nHowever, his career would lose substantial momentum with a shoulder injury suffered during the 2006 preseason that forced him to miss the entire Super 14 campaign and most of the following provincial season. On his return for the 2007 Super 14 season, he appeared in every match for the Highlanders but struggled for form and was not as effective as before his injury.\nLeft off the Highlanders squad for the 2008 Super 14 season, Saunders was eventually called back into the squad as injury cover and made a further 5 appearances. However, these would be his last Super Rugby appearances for a further three years.\nAfter three seasons of consistent (and consistently healthy) play for Southland, Saunders was again included in the Highlanders squad for the 2011 Super Rugby season, although his season was interrupted by the death of his father while the team was in South Africa. He made his season debut against the Blues on 29 April. After receiving limited game action for most of the season, he finished the year on a high note with two tries against the Blues on 17 June."

        "title": "Umpiring in the 1946–47 Ashes series",
        "text": "The England team were unhappy with the umpiring in the 1946–47 Ashes series, in particular when Don Bradman was not given out when caught by Jack Ikin for 28 in the First Test and 22 in the Second (Bradman went on to make 187 and 234). Test cricket was not filmed except for highlights and the notion of Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques would have been considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as part and parcel of the game. However, touring teams sometimes felt that there was a natural bias towards the home team which led to some acrimony if important decisions always went against them. The Australian Ray Robinson wrote in \"The Cricketer\":\n\"Usually debatable decisions work out fairly evenly over a Test rubber, but weight of evidence suggests that the umpires were mistaken in giving Bradman not out caught for 28 in the First Test, Edrich out leg-before-wicket for 89 in the Third Test, and Washbrook out caught behind the wicket for 39 in the Fourth Test. These decisions came at such points in England's bids to gain an advantage that they could almost be termed turning-points of the three games.\"\nThe Umpires.\n\"Umpiring is a thankless sort of task. it is unspectacular, its financial rewards are not great, and it calls for unwavering concentration during hours of standing, sometimes under a pitless sun, sometimes in a biting wind. To this must be added the fact that decisions like stumpings, run-outs, l.b.w.s and catches at the wicket are frequently the cause of contention, with the umpire invariably coming in for adverse criticism.\"\nThe 1946–47 Ashes series was the first in Australia for ten years because of the Second World War. Only two umpires were used in the five Tests as there had been no opportunity for new umpires to come to the fore. They were George Borwick, who had been an umpire in the infamous Bodyline series of 1932-33 and John Scott, famous in Australia for cracking down on the same hostile fast bowling he used to serve up as a young man in the Sheffield Shield. They had been umpires in the \"Goodwill Tour\" of 1936-37 when there had been no problems and had the confidence of both teams. After the First Test the England captain Wally Hammond and his manager Major Rupert Howard tactfully suggested that other umpires might be added to the panel, but this proposal was rejected by the Australian Board of Control which included the Australian captain Don Bradman. It may simply have been the case that the ABC had no other umpire that it could use. Hammond had been asked by the MCC to promote sportsmanship and avoid disruption even at the cost of the series and therefore had limited options. He could have taken his concerns to the MCC so that they could make representations with greater authority or gone to the press to raise a public outcry and so force the ABC's hand, but he did neither. Even so, the English press corps in Australia (and some Australian journalists like Clif Cary) queried the competence of the umpires (their honesty was never questioned). As Australia won the first two Tests this was seen as 'squealing' by the Australia newspapers who were supported by journalists back in London who said that umpiring decisions must never be questioned. The furore was enough for Umpire Scott to resign after the Fifth Test, he told his critics that they had \"pilloried and lampooned him for doing his duty fearlessly...I gave no decision I regret, nor did I feel afterwards that I would have liked to have withdrawn any decision I made\". Umpire Borwick made a statement that he thought Ray Lindwall did not bowl bumpers in the series - contradicting Lindwall, who said he was ordered to bowl them by Bradman - and retired after the Indian tour of Australia in 1947-48.\nCatches and Stumpings.\n\"Bradman had only made 28, when he played Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it high in the air in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting watching from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind...the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.\"\nThe most contentious decision of the series was when Don Bradman was not given out when he was on 28 in the First Test. Bradman was returning to bat after the war and a serious illness had struggled for an hour even on a good batting strip. Australia were 72/2 when Bill Voce bowled a ball that \"flew from the blade of the bat to Ikin\". Clif Cary was watching Bradman with Zeiss glasses while commentating on the radio and reported \"The next ball from Voce rises as it goes away and Bradman is out...Bradman out, caught Ikin at second slip, bowled by Voce, for 28\". Ikin made the mistake of not appealing immediately as it was assumed that a batsman will walk when he is so obviously out, but \"Bradman stood there as if he had never hit the ball\" \"The fieldsmen stared as Bradman stood his ground, then appealed for a catch. In believing that he had jammed the ball on to the ground before it rose, Don was in a minority of the nearest witnesses on the field but that minority included the umpire\". As one player said afterwards \"cricket is coming to a pretty pass if a side has to appeal for everything; when that happens it will mean the end of all those things for which cricket is supposed to stand\".\nCary wrote \"there was not doubt of the legality of the catch\", Jack Fingleton called it \"one of the most unfortunate decisions in the history of the Tests.\" and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported \"The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'\". \nAlan McGilvray, radio commentator for the ABC, wrote about the incident. \"I remember discussing the matter with Jack Ikin years later. He remained adamant it was a fair catch. Borwick was equally adamant it was not. So was his square leg umpire Jack Scott, who went on record later to confirm Borwick's assessment. I was broadcasting at the time and I had not the slightest doubt it was a bump ball. Lindsay Hassett, at the other end, couldn't work out what the fuss was about. He saw it as I saw it. But the Englishment saw it very differently.\"\nHassett himself later stated, \"I felt certain the ball had hit the bottom edge of his bat, straight onto the pitch and then to Ikin.\"\nIn the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, \"That's a fine way to start a Test series\"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic \"I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right and I may have been wrong\" Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote \"that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous\".\nA similar incident occurred in the Second Test, though it might not have been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but \"this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way\". Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, but if he had he been given out he would have made only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook \"stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement\". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - \"he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision\" - and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman that it was not a clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote \"I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper scooped up the ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley\". Hammond tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC, who demanded proof of the incompetence of the umpires before they were willing to change them, but no photo was found.\nThe only complaint from the Australian side about the umpiring was that Ray Lindwall thought Denis Compton should have been stumped in both innings of the Fourth Test before he reached either of his centuries. In the first innings the glare from the sun (it was 105°F/40°C) was so bright that the white paint of the crease could not be seen clearly, and the same may have applied in the second innings, but little fuss was made of this.\nBad Light.\n\"We could have played on, but it was a Test match and we just had to win. I realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, in an effort to get the appeal upheld.\nAfter tea on the second day of the Second Test at Sydney Australia were 24/1 after Arthur Morris was bowled by Bill Edrich on a wet wicket suited to the England bowling attack. \"On a stormy Saturday Barnes and Johnson angered the crowd by making made 8 appeals against the light in 11 minutes...This stalling saved Australia losing more than Morris's wicket and the granting of the last appeal enabled Bradman to rest a strained leg for Monday\". The umpires gave in to the constant appealing and the batsmen were allowed to retire an hour before stumps. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled \"biased, unsportsmanlike squealers\" and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never use such underhand tactics. When the batsmen returned next day Barnes survived the early bad wicket and went on the make 234, his highest Test score, adding 405 with Bradman in what still is the highest Test partnership in Australia. Bradman had received permission from Hammond to use a substitute fielder earlier in the day because of a pulled leg muscle and as a result did not have to come out to bat on a wet wicket. He was able to rest on the Sunday and when play resumed on the Monday he lowered himself down the batting order and came out in the afternoon, when \"He limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill\", On the Tuesday he gave \"an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs - that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter\". After the series ended Barnes gave a radio interview and freely admitted that he had \"kept on appealing until the umpires answered me\" simply because he thought the wicket was bad.\nIn the Third Test Barnes appealed for light at the end of the second day, which was rejected, but he saw out the day with Morris. In the final half hour of the Test Norman Yardley and Godfrey Evans batted on when Australia wanted three wickets for their third victory of the series \"even though the light was atrocious and rain was falling heavily\". Hammond had been dismissed earlier, but refused to let his team appeal against the light, either to make a point about the Barnes appeal or simply due to sportsmanship. Bill O'Reilly said \"I could not understand why the English batsman seemed loath to appeal against the weather, even when the rain was coming down solidly. There are no praises for gallant gestures in Tests matches\". In the Fifth Test the new England captain Norman Yardley appealed against the light in a low scoring match where every run was vital. He had his appeal turned down and he and Jack Ikin lost their wickets in light so bad that the Australian cameramen were unable to take clear photographs. They were carrying light meters (not available to umpires for nearly 40 years) and stated that the light was much worse than when Barnes and Johnson were allowed off the field.\nLBW.\n\"On at least four occasions he was convinced he had Bradman in his bag but it was not to be. Wright, I believe was very keen to secure such a verdict over Bradman, who only once has been dismissed l.b.w. during his Anglo-Australian Test career, and that was in his maiden game when Tate found him in front. This is a Bradman record of which no mention is made on the statistical pages, but it reveals not only he marvellous eye, but also his splendid footwork...\" \nLeg before wicket decisions are notoriously difficult to judge and only the umpire is in the correct position to judge the line of the ball and its height when its hits the batsmen. The lbw laws of the time meant that a batsman could not be lbw to a ball that pitched outside the off-stump unless he was also outside the off-stump. Though this was meant to encourage off-side strokeplay and prevent batsmen from padding away balls it resulted in batsmen padding-up to off-side balls while in front of the wicket and encouraged inswing bowlers such as Alec Bedser who normally hit the batsmen in front of the leg-stump.\nIn the Third Test at Melbourne Bill Edrich was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall by Umpire Scott after he hit the ball onto his pads with his bat. The bowler wrote \"Bill genuinely thought he hit the ball onto his pad...I saw no deviation of the ball after it pitched and I heard no click\". A few minutes later he gave Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at him in disbelief before his walked off. Lindwall wrote that Compton \"made no stroke at a ball he thought had pitched outside his leg-stump, but which umpire and bowler declared pitched on the line of the leg stump\", which would make Compton out. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland. Cyril Washbrook was out soon after and England collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Scott was angry with the English pressmen who accused him of making the wrong decisions, saying Edrich had not hit the ball with his bat and Washbrook had thought Compton was out (though Washbrook was several yards to the right of the umpire and so unable to judge the line of the ball).\nConversely the England leg-spinner Doug Wright was considered to be the unluckiest bowler in the world; \"He continually rapped the pads with his straight one, and when the decision went against him, his face clouded with puzzled dismay.\" In the Third Test he caught Bradman with a straight ball that he to hit to leg, but missed and the ball hit him on the top of his pads plumb in front of the stumps. Wright and Evans appealed, but Bradman was given not out. However, a cameraman took a series of photographs of the delivery and \"the camera appears to give a different verdict\".\nNo Balls.\n\"Lindwall's drag of his right foot has often brought him under the fire of those who claimed that he was over the line before he released the ball...As a matter of fact Ray's right foot is well behind the crease when he starts to bring his arm over, but he releases the ball later in his swing than any other bowler I have seen.\"\nIn modern cricket the bowler is no-balled if he bowls without some part of the front foot (either grounded or raised) behind the popping crease when it lands (it is still a legal ball if it slides over the line) and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1940s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease and fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but they could drag it over the line and they would be no-balled. This proved to be a particular problem in the 1950s. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease. See Film on Youtube. It should have been called as a no-ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire. Lindwall's action was a text book model, but he was known for his heavy drag. Alan Kippax said that he watched Lindwall for 45 minutes in the Fourth Test at Adelaide without once seeing him bowl a legal delivery and sometimes his foot dragged 18 inches over the crease. However, the fast bowler was only called for no-balling twice in the series, which Clif Cary thought was a disservice to Lindwall as the English umpires would call him in 1948 if he did not correct his action in time (this proved not to be a problem). Lindwall himself wrote that if the no-ball law was enforced strictly almost every bowler would be no-balled and “the spirit of the law demanded that the bowler should land behind the bowling crease and as long as I did that I was playing the game”. The New South Wales Cricket Association asked him to bowl a yard back from his present delivery, but Bill O'Reilly advised him not to change until no-balled by an umpire and as a result Lindwall kept his action unchanged.\nThis was the opposite of what happened to the English leg-spinner Doug Wright, a notorious no-baller with a \"long, springy run and windmill action\" that saw him overstep the line too many times. Bill O'Reilly wrote \"He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps.\" Jack Fingleton called the no-ball \"Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history\", It was easier for the umpires to call Wright for no-balling as be bowled at a slow-medium pace and Lindwall's fast bowling was more difficult to judge, but they should have called them equally if their feet were over the line. Incidentally, Wright had a habit of licking his hand before bowling each ball which the umpires forbade in the 1950-51 Ashes series and upset his rhythm, but was allowed by Scott and Bowick in 1946-47.\nHostile Bowling.\n\"I must say when I bowled at Len I felt a sense of personal grudge I have never known against any other batsman. Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world. We both put in that little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time...he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.\"\nAfter the Bodyline series of 1932-33 hostile fast bowling was discouraged in Australia. In 1936-37 Umpires Scott and Borwick even gave the two teams a lecture on short pitched bowling. In the Goodwill Tour Gubby Allen, Bill Voce and Ernie McCormick bowled to a good length and the batsmen enjoyed making runs. After Len Hutton's 364 at the Oval in 1938 the Australian team reckoned fast bowling should return to normal as they thought Hutton had a weakness against fast bowling. Jack Fingleton reckoned he would have received a warm reception on the next tour of Australia. When Test cricket resumed with the 1946–47 Ashes series Australia found that they had two quality fast bowlers in Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and since England only had the medium pace of Alec Bedser and an aging Bill Voce they could bowl as many bouncers as they liked without fear of retaliation. Their particular target was Hutton, who was given an \"opening blitz\" at the start of the innings, but Hammond and Edrich also suffered.\nIn the First Test Keith Miller dug the ball in short and \"nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high\". “Edrich batted for 105 minutes. He suffered more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller\". Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich \"were hit on the body repeatedly\". Miller used a limited leg-trap some of the time, but he quickly slowed his pace as on the rain-affected pitch the ball leapt so much that it could hit the batsman, but not get them out. One English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Clif Cary wrote that \"the placements were sufficient to cause the batsmen worry, although they did not justify one journalist describing the attack as \"bodyline\" to lend colour and expression to his cable\". The England bowler Bill Voce and the reporter Bill Bowes did not comment on the matter, but Harold Larwood said that Bodyline was less dangerous as the batsman knew what to expect - bouncers on the leg-stump - but here they could get anything.\nAfter the Ashes had been retained Fingleton wrote that it would be sporting if the Fast bowlers stopped bouncing Hutton, whose left arm had been badly broken in the war - it had required 46 stitches to repair his arm, which was left two inches (5 cm) shorter and another injury could end his career. It was also thought unsportsmanlike to bowl them at Paul Gibb who wore glasses. It was noted that though Bradman did not tell Lindwall and Miller to stop bowling bouncers in general as a good captain he did not allow them to bowl short at Cyril Washbrook. As well as being a resolute batsman Washbrook had a weakness for cutting the ball outside the off-stump, so that is where Bradman directed his bowlers and he received fewer short balls as a result. Denis Compton and Norman Yardley had weaknesses against the spinners, so Bradman would bring on Ian Johnson and Colin McCool to bowl to them. \"So it was that bumpers were not wanted. They were generally kept for those who had a real hatred for them, while a few additional slammers were indiscriminately thrown in for good measure against all and sundry\"."

        "text": "The 2011 PartyPoker.com Premier League was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament. It was played under a variation of the standard rules of snooker. It was played from 18 August to 27 November 2011.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, and he won his 10th Premier League Snooker title by defeating Ding Junhui 7–1.\nFormat.\nAll evenings in the league stage featured three matches: two semi-finals and a final. All matches were best of 5 frames, with no dead frames played, points were awarded for every frame won. Meaning that the maximum number of points a player could obtain was 24 and the minimum was 0. All frames were subjected to a 20-second shot clock and there were two 20 second extensions available for each player in every frame. The miss rule was also changed; meaning that a player had three attempts to make legal contact with the ball on or otherwise ball in hand was given to the incoming player anywhere on the table. The final frame of any match was played under shoot-out rules. Each player appeared on 4 nights and were seeded to determine who they face. This was the first and only time in the events history there would be a clear winner in each match of the league phase. Unlike other years of the league phase when matches were best of 6 and therefore players could draw 3–3 on the night. In 2012 the Premier League reverted to the best of 6 round Robin matches. The play-offs were played to the rules used in previous editions. This meant that the top 4 after the league phase qualified for the semi-finals. As in other years 1st played 4th and 2nd played 3rd in the semi-finals.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: \nPlayers.\nPlayers were seeded according to their world rankings apart from the defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan who was the number one seed. \nLeague phase.\nTop four qualified for the play-offs. The order of players was decided on most frames won, and then least frames lost. (Breaks above 50 shown between (parentheses); century breaks are indicated with bold.)\nPlay-offs.\n26–27 November, Potters Leisure Resort, Hopton-on-Sea, England\nQualifiers.\nThe qualification for this tournament, the Championship League was played in eight groups from 3 January to 24 March 2011."
