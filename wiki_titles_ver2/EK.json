        "text": "The 1942–43 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the fourth season of the rugby league’s Wartime Emergency Leagues necessitated by the Second World War.\nAs in the previous wartime season, clubs did not all play the same number of games. Three clubs dropped out before the season started. Only 14 of the pre-war clubs participated with only three; Oldham, St Helens and Wigan from west of the Pennines.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1942–43 season began on Saturday 5 September 1942. As in the previous season, there were still only three Lancashire clubs, the Northern Rugby League continued with a single 14 club competition. As the clubs were playing different number of marches, the league positions were decided on a win percentage basis.\nAt the completion of the regular season Wigan were on top of the league with a percentage success of 81.25% and Dewsbury were second (78.12%). Although Bradford Northern won more games than anyone else their percentage success was only 73.80%, and consequently they finished third. St Helens finished last with only two wins from 15. \nDewsbury went on to defeat Halifax 33–16 on aggregate in the play-off final, however the Championship was declared null and void as the Dewsbury had fielded an ineligible player in the semi-final.\nIn the Rugby league Challenge Cup Final, Dewsbury beat Leeds 16–15 on aggregate over two legs in front of an aggregate crowd of 26,470.\nWith the Lancashire Cup suspended the duration of the war, Wigan competed in the Yorkshire Cup. The cup was won by Dewsbury who beat Huddersfield 7–2 on aggregate before an aggregate crowd of 17,252 in the two low scoring legs of the final\nChange in participation.\nThe RFL announced the fixture list at the end of July 1942 with 15 clubs entered. This was a reduction of two from the previous year as Bramley and Castleford had already notified the RFL of their intentions not to take part in the season. However before the season started, Hunslet's football committee announced their withdrawal due to the amount of travel required. The Hunslet committee's decision was contested by the members of the club who forced a special meeting of the club at which a resolution was passed instructing the committee to withdraw the notice given to the RFL, subject to additional financial guarantors being found. Meeting between prospective guarantors and the committee failed to reach agreement and Hunslet's withdrawal from the league stood, leaving the league with 14 clubs.\nChampionship play-offs.\nQualifying game.\nOn 1 May 1943 Bradford Northern beat Huddersfield 16–13 at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in the qualifying game.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 8 May 1943. Wigan lost 3–13 to Halifax at Central Park, Wigan. In the other game Bradford Northern beat Dewsbury 8–3 at Odsal. After the game Dewsbury submitted a protest to the Rugby Football League and Bradford Northern were disqualified for fielding an ineligible player.\nFinal.\nThe first leg was played on 15 May 1943 Dewsbury beat Halifax 11–3 at Crown Flatt, Dewsbury.\nThe second leg was played the following Saturday, 22 May 1943 and Dewbury won again this time 22–13 at Thrum Hall, Halifax in front of a crowd of 9,700.\nDewsbury won 33–16 on aggregate but at a meeting of the RFL committee in July the championship was declared null and void. The committee heard a complaint submitted by Bradford Northern that in the semi-final between them and Dewsbury, Dewsbury had also fielded an ineligible player. The complaint was upheld, the championship was voided, Dewsbury's title win was removed from the list of Championship wins and the club were fined £100.\nChallenge Cup.\nBarrow who had not entered the League programme, took part in this competition. In the final Dewsbury beat Leeds 16–15 on aggregate over two legs in front of an aggregate crowd of 26,470."

The Northern Rugby League continued with a single (now) 16 club single competition. As the clubs are still playing different number of marches, the league positions and the title would be decided on a percentage basis.\nAt the completion of the regular season Wakefield Trinity were on top of the league on both points and percentage success (with 38 points from 22 games and a percentage success of 86.36%), and Wigan were second (34 points from 21 games @ 80.95%).

        "title": "Afghanistan at the 2002 Asian Games",
        "text": "Afghanistan participated in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea, from September 29 to October 14, 2002. This marked Afghanistan's return to international sporting events after the fall of the Taliban regime. The Afghan delegation consisted of 12 officials (11 men and one woman) and 44 competitors (40 men and four women) participating in seven different sports. The Afghanistan national football team played its first international match since the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification phase. An English teacher from Kabul, Roia Zamani, won a bronze medal in the 72 kg middleweight class of taekwondo without winning a single match. Zamani was the only medalist for the Afghan side and the first Afghan medalist in 20 years. None of the remaining athletes advanced past the qualifying stages.\nBackground.\nAfghanistan is a member of the South Asian zone of the Olympic Council of Asia, and has competed in the Asian Games since the inaugural edition of the Games in 1951 in New Delhi. On September 26, 1996, the Taliban annexed the Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Under the Taliban regime all types of sporting activities were deprecated, as according to the Taliban, most of them were against the teachings of Islam and Islamic law. Many stadiums, like Ghazi Stadium of Kabul, were either destroyed or converted into venues for public executions and punishments. Women were banned from taking part in any type of sport; male athletes were allowed to participate in a few sports, but were forced to wear long sleeves, trousers and beards. Following such incidents and discrimination against women, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Afghanistan National Olympic Committee and barred them from taking part in the Olympic Games.\nA few months before the 2000 Summer Olympics, the IOC offered the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee the opportunity to send a contingent to the Games without the Taliban flag. The Committee declined to take part on this condition.\nAfghanistan did not send any delegation to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also made it impossible for Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games after the fall of the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.\nDelegation.\nThe delegation of Afghanistan for the 14th edition of the Asian Games was composed of 12 officials (11 men and one woman) and 44 competitors (40 men and four women) participating in seven different sports—boxing (6), cycling (1), football (20), karate (1), shooting (1), taekwondo (7) and wrestling (8).\nBoxing.\nSix Afghan pugilists went to the Games, competing in six out of the 12 boxing events. No Afghan competitor made it past the preliminary stages of competition. Three—Dawood Mahmoude (light flyweight), Rohullah Mustafa (flyweight) and Tamim Ahmed Akhtari (lightweight)—out of six boxers lost after RSCO (Referee Stopped Contest – Outclassed Opponent). Abdullah Shekib retired during his bout against Kazakhstani Gennady Golovkin. Sadeq Naqshbande lost to Sergey Rychko of Kazakhstan after referee stopped the contest (RSC). Sayed Haroon Sadat was the only Afghan boxer who completed his bout, losing to Kumar Adhikari of Nepal by a points difference of 11–13.\nCycling.\nMohammad Bahrooz was the only cyclist in the delegation of Afghanistan. He represented his nation in the men's 169.4 km individual road race event held on October 3 at the Road Cycle Race Stadium. A total of 28 competitors participated in the event; Bahrooz was one of six who did not finish the race. The event was won by Sergey Krushevskiy of Uzbekistan with a time of 4:17:59.\nFootball.\nAfghanistan sent its men's national team to compete in the football event of the Games. The last international match played by Afghanistan against any nation was during the qualification stage for the AFC Asian Cup in 1984. For the 2002 Asian Games, the international governing body of football, FIFA, provided financial aid to the Afghanistan Football Federation to make their trip to Busan possible. The team did not advance beyond the preliminary round, losing all three of their matches.\nThe first match of the Afghan team was scheduled with Iran on September 28 at the Busan Gudeok Stadium. The Iranian team dominated the match, winning by a score of 10 to 0. Alireza Vahedi Nikbakht scored five goals in the match. This was the largest margin of victory for Iran in the tournament. Iran would win the gold medal after defeating Japan in the final.\nAfghanistan and Qatar played on October 1 at the Munsu Cup Stadium. The Qatar team registered their biggest win of the tournament, defeating Afghan team by a score of 11 to 0. Qatari striker Sayed Ali Bechir scored four goals in the match.\nThe last match for the Afghan team was with Lebanon on October 5 at the Changwon Civic Stadium. The Lebanese team defeated Afghanistan by 11–0, Lebanon's largest margin of victory in the tournament. Lebanon scored five goals in the first half and six in the second.\nKarate.\nWahid Ahmad Joya competed in the kumite −75 kg event of karate held in the Yangsan College Gymnasium. Joya received a bye in the preliminary round. In the next round, the quarterfinals, Joya met with Farman Ahmed of Pakistan, but Joya was officially disqualified for being overweight.\nShooting.\nMalalai Afzali was scheduled to compete in the women's 10 m air pistol event held in the Changwon International Shooting Range on October 3, but did not start the event.\nTaekwondo.\nAfghanistan's taekwondo squad consisted of seven athletes, four of which were men: Farhad Qraishi (−58 kg), Ziaullah Aimal (−62 kg), Hamed Stanekzai (−72 kg) and Parwiz Nazari (−84 kg), and three women: Hakima Khashai (−55 kg), Fatima Hamidi (−63 kg) and Roia Zamani (−72 kg). Qraishi, Aimal and Stanekzai were eliminated in their respective first round matches. Nazari received a bye in his first match, and lost to Dindo Simpao of Philippines in the second round.\nHakima Khashai and Fatima Hamidi both were defeated by Malaysian opponents after the referee stopped the contest (RSC). Roia Zamani, an English teacher from Kabul, won a bronze medal in the 72 kg middleweight class without winning a single match. Only five athletes participated in the middleweight class event, making first round a quarterfinal match. She received a bye in her first round match. In the semifinal, she withdrew in the middle of match due to severe injuries, in which she was lagging behind by nil to four points. Zamani was beaten by her Korean opponent, Choi Jin-Mi, who left a cut over her right eyebrow. But the semifinal appearance of Zamani guaranteed her a bronze medal, which she shared with Sally Solis of Philippines. Zamani considered her participation in the Games as a \"first step\" for Afghan women.\nWrestling.\nEight Afghan wrestlers entered the competition: six for freestyle events and two for Greco-Roman events. Only two freestyle competitors—Mirdad Mir and Iqbal Ahmad Mancher—achieved victories. Mancher advanced to a repechage round, but lost to Wang Yuanyuan of China by a points difference of 0–10. Both the Greco-Roman wrestlers—Abdullahbik Baikzada and Mohammad Ashraf Timori—were eliminated in the preliminary rounds without winning a single bout."

        "title": "Mike Davies (tennis)",
        "text": "Michael Grenfell \"Mike\" Davies (9 January 1936 – 2 November 2015) was a Welsh professional tennis player, entrepreneur and administrator. He had a 60-year career in the tennis business, first as an amateur and professional tennis player, including a period as the number one ranked player in Great Britain and a member of the British Davis Cup team, then as an entrepreneur and one of the pioneers of the professional game.\nPlaying career.\nDavies was born in Swansea, Wales. He took up tennis at the age of 11, and was discovered by Fred Perry and Dan Maskell. He played on the British Davis Cup team with Bobby Wilson, Billy Knight and Roger Becker.\nIn 1952 Davies went to Australia for the first of three winter visits to work with Harry Hopman, the Australian Davis Cup Coach, and Australian players like Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle. It was there that Davies developed his game.\nFrom 1958 to 1960 Davies was ranked number 1 in Great Britain. He played on the Davis Cup team for Great Britain from 1956 to 1960 and had a 15/8 match record. In 1960 he reached the final of the men's doubles at Wimbledon with Bobby Wilson; the last time a British male reached the final of Wimbledon's men's singles or men's doubles until 2012.\nAfter that doubles final, in 1960, he was invited to turn professional with Jack Kramer for a two-year guarantee of £4,500-a-year. He joined a select group of players considered to be the best in the world such as Pancho Gonzales, Tony Trabert, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall and Pancho Segura.\nSince international tennis at this time was an amateur sport, Davies' professional status put him at odds with the ruling tennis body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and his membership of the All-England Club at Wimbledon was cancelled, and he became ineligible to ever play Davis Cup or any of the Grand Slams again. As well as playing he was elected to the board of the first Players' Association that was formed by this select group of approximately 12–15 players and found himself leading the charge to promote professional tennis and to fight for open tennis. Soon Davies found himself doubling up as the tour's spokesman and selling the upcoming events and taking the first steps towards a flourishing career in the promotion of tennis as a business. This first Players Association (IPTPA) was the forerunner of what is now the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), of which Davies was to become executive director in 1982.\nIn 1961 Davies published two books: one a teaching book, and the other a biography called \"Tennis Rebel\" (Stanley Paul, London).\nDavies retired in 1967, one year before Wimbledon finally allowed professionals to play. However, he did come out of retirement to play in the first Open at Wimbledon. He had missed 28 Grand Slam events during the ban.\nEntrepreneurial career.\nWCT.\nIn 1967 Lamar Hunt co-founded World Championship Tennis (WCT) with his nephew, Al G. Hill Jr. and, in 1968, they hired Davies as the executive director with the task of building WCT into a major force. They had eight contracted players and promoted them as The Handsome Eight: Dennis Ralston, Butch Buchholz, Pierre Barthès, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Nikki Pilic, Roger Taylor and Cliff Drysdale. WCT guaranteed each a certain amount of money for a certain number of weeks of play each year. After a couple of years, WCT bought the contracts of the other professional players at the time, including Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Andrés Gimeno and signed former amateurs Arthur Ashe and Stan Smith to professional contracts.\nIn 1970, Davies put together the plans for the first million-dollar tour: 20 tournaments throughout the world, played in 20 cities, 32 players under contract, each receiving $50,000. The eight with the best record would qualify for the WCT finals in Dallas. Davies ran the Dallas-based WCT as executive director for 13 years.\nDuring his time with WCT Davies was responsible for the following innovations and rule changes in the game:\nATP.\nIn 1981 Davies left WCT after 13 years and joined his lifelong friend Butch Buchholz as marketing director of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). One year later, when Buchholz left the ATP, Davies took over as executive director. The ATP was almost bankrupt at the time, and when Davies left after three years they had over $1 million in assets. He helped consolidate the players' pension plan and created more jobs for players with bigger draws and more tournaments and bigger prize money.\nMITPC.\nDavies also served on the Men's Pro Council and was chairman of this committee which administered the Men's Professional Circuit, before the ATP.\nITF.\nIn 1987 Davies joined the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and later moved back to London as general manager and marketing director. He was made a full member of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon in 1990–30 years after they had withdrawn his membership. During these years Davies almost tripled the Sponsorship and International Television revenue for the ITF, and created the Grand Slam Committee which now oversees the four Grand Slam events\nGrand Slam Cup.\nDavies also created the Grand Slam Cup which was first played in Munich Germany in 1990. This event was for the 16 players who had the best record in the four Grand Slam events. The prize money was $6 million, with $2 million going to the winner of the event. Still the highest prize money per player ever. In 1994 Davies negotiated the largest tennis Television contract which was between German TV, the German Tennis Federation and the ITF for a five-year deal for $200 million.\nRetirement and death.\nDavies retired in 1995 and moved back to the United States. In 1997, he and Butch Buchholz, took over control of the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament in Connecticut. The tournament is played the week before the US Open in August and is owned by the USTA.\nDavies has been inducted in 2012 to the International Tennis Hall of Fame for his role in the transformation of the sport into a world-wide concern. Davies died in Sarasota, Florida on 2 November 2015 from mesothelioma at the age of 79."

        "title": "Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball",
        "text": "The Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of Gonzaga University, located in Spokane, Washington, United States. The NCAA Division I program has been a member of the West Coast Conference since 1996 and its home venue is Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex, opened on Gonzaga's campus in 2007.\nMark Machtolf has been the program's head coach since 2004. Through 2013, Gonzaga has appeared in eight NCAA tournaments. It has won four conference championship series, seven regular season conference championships, and five regular season division titles. Gonzaga was formerly an affiliate member of the Pac-10 conference for baseball and previously played in the NorPac and Big Sky conferences.\nAs of the start of the 2013 season, 16 former Bulldogs have played in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nGonzaga College was founded in September 1887, and the first recorded game of the baseball program was held shortly thereafter, in 1890. On September 14, 1910, Dave Skeels became the first Gonzaga player to appear in the major leagues when he pitched in a game for the Detroit Tigers. In 1912, the college was recognized by the state of Washington as a university and was renamed Gonzaga University. Although the team competed in the first half of the 20th century, comprehensive records of its play do not exist prior to the 1960 season, when the team competed as an independent school in District VII of the NCAA's University Division.\nBig Sky.\nGonzaga was a charter member of the Big Sky Conference, which launched in the summer of 1963 with six schools. Its first baseball season was in 1964, and the Bulldogs won the conference title in 1965. Prior to the 1967 season, the program opened Pecarovich Field, named for former Gonzaga football head coach Mike Pecarovich.\nLarry Koentopp was named head coach prior to the 1970 season, and the Big Sky expanded to eight teams that summer. For baseball, the conference split into two-four team divisions for the 1971 season, and Gonzaga won all won four Northern division titles from 1971 through 1974. The Zags won the Big Sky championship series in three of those four seasons, which earned a berth in the NCAA tournament in 1971, 1973, and 1974. The 1972 team entered the Big Sky tournament on a winning streak, but was the first team eliminated. It was the only year the Big Sky used a four-team format; the other three seasons had a best-of-three series between the division winners.\nNorthern Pacific.\nFollowing the 1974 season, the Big Sky discontinued sponsorship of five of its ten sports, including baseball. Along with Idaho and Boise State, the program joined the new seven-team Northern Pacific Conference (NorPac) in June 1974. The Bulldogs were second in 1975, but won four conference championships in the next six seasons to advance to the NCAA tournament in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1981. After Idaho and Boise State dropped baseball following the 1980 season, the NorPac played a final season with five teams in 1981.\nPacific-10.\nThe four remaining NorPac programs (Gonzaga, Eastern Washington, Portland State, and Portland) moved to the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) for the 1982 season, into the Northern Division with Washington, Washington State, and Oregon State. (Oregon dropped baseball after the 1981 season; it returned in 2009.)\nGonzaga remained an affiliate member of the Pac-10 for baseball through the 1995 season, but never finished higher than runner-up in the North. The Bulldogs appeared in the division tournament six times (1986–1991) and hosted it from 1986 to 1989.\nWest Coast Conference.\nFollowing the 1995 season, the program moved to the West Coast Conference (WCC), which the majority of the school's athletic programs had joined in the summer of 1979. Also following the 1995 season, Pecarovich Field was renamed August/A.R.T. Stadium.\nGonzaga initially struggled in WCC baseball, finishing fifth, eighth, and sixth in its first three seasons. However, after the WCC split into two four-team divisions prior to the 1999 season, Gonzaga finished second in its division in 1999 and 2000 and won the Coast Division in 2001. In the best-of-three 2001 WCC Championship Series, Gonzaga lost to Pepperdine 2–1.\nDuring the 2003 season, August/A.R.T. Stadium was razed to allow for the construction of the McCarthey Athletic Center. The team used Spokane's Avista Stadium until its current venue, Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex, was completed prior to the 2007 season.\nFollowing the 2003 season, Steve Hertz retired after 24 seasons as the program's head coach, and was replaced by Mark Machtolf. Under Machtolf, the team qualified for three WCC Championship Series (2007, 2009, 2011). After losing to San Diego in 2007, Gonzaga defeated Loyola Marymount in 2009 to qualify for the program's first NCAA tournament since 1981. In the Fullerton Regional, the team defeated Georgia Southern in its first game, but it lost consecutive games to Cal State Fullerton and Utah and was eliminated. In the 2011 WCC Championship Series, Gonzaga lost to San Francisco.\nIn 2016, as a sophomore future major leaguer Eli Morgan was 10–3 with a 3.73 ERA in 16 starts, earning him a spot on the All-West Coast Conference (WCC) First Team. His 10 wins tied him for second-most in the WCC, and his 3 shutouts led the conference. In 2017, his junior season, Morgan compiled a 10–2 record with a 2.86 ERA in 14 starts, during which he struck out a conference-leading 138 batters (second-most in school history) in 100.2 innings (12.3 strikeouts/9 innings), and was once again named to the All-WCC First Team. His 10 wins again tied him for second-most in the WCC, and he tied for the conference lead with two shutouts. He was one of four pitchers in the country with more than one 15-strikeout games. He was also named Perfect Game/Rawlings First Team All-American, \"Collegiate Baseball\" Second Team All-American, three-time National Player of the Week, and five-time Rawlings WCC Pitcher of the Week.\nVenues.\nEarly venues.\nThe earliest known venue of the program is Underhill Park, located off-campus across the Spokane River. Underhill still functions as a municipal park in Spokane. The team moved from Underhill to its first on-campus home, located in Gonzaga's upper campus, where it played until after the 1966 season.\nAugust/A.R.T. Stadium.\nFrom 1967 into the 2003 season, the program played at August/A.R.T. Stadium, which had a capacity of The ballpark opened in 1967 as Pecarovich Field, named for former Gonzaga football player and coach Mike Pecarovich (1898–1965). Gonzaga swept a doubleheader against Central Washington on April 7 to open the field.\nPrior to the 1996 season, the venue was renamed August/A.R.T. Stadium, and Gonzaga used it into the 2003 season; it was demolished and the McCarthey Athletic Center was built on the site. In the stadium's last game on April 13, Gonzaga lost to San Francisco 8–3. The remainder of the home schedule in 2003 was played at Spokane Falls Community College.\nAvista Stadium.\nFor three seasons (2004–2006), Gonzaga played at Avista Stadium, the home venue of the minor league Spokane Indians. Opened in 1958 as a Triple-A ballpark, it has a capacity of 7,162 spectators.\nWashington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex.\nAt the start of the 2007 season, the program opened its current venue, Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex. In the home opener on March 15, Gonzaga defeated Rider 9–4. It was dedicated a month later on April 20, named for Washington Trust Bank, a donor to the field's construction, and Michael Patterson, a Gonzaga alumnus. It has a capacity of 1,500 spectators.\nHead coaches.\nSteve Hertz is the winningest and longest-tenured head coach in Gonzaga athletics history; in 24 seasons (1978, 1981–2003) at the helm, he recorded 637 wins.\nYearly records.\nBelow is a table of the program's yearly records.\nNotable former players.\nBelow is a list of notable former Bulldogs and the seasons in which they played for the program.\nRetired numbers.\nThe first retired number for the program was number 19 in 1982, worn by walk-on third baseman Mac Gebbers (1978–1982).\n2012 MLB Draft.\nTwo Bulldogs were selected in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft: OF Royce Bolinger by the Texas Rangers (6th round) and P Tyler Olson by the Oakland Athletics (17th round).

        "text": "For a cricketer to score a century (100 runs or more) on his Test match debut is considered a notable achievement, and as of 13 July 2023, it has been accomplished 115 times by 113 players. Two of those players, Lawrence Rowe and Yasir Hameed, have scored centuries in both innings of their debut match. Players representing 11 of the Test-playing nations (all except Afghanistan) have scored centuries on Test debut.\nIn the first Test match played, between Australia and England in March 1877, Charles Bannerman became the first player to score a century in Test cricket. In a match in which no other player scored more than 20 runs in either innings for Australia, Bannerman scored 165 not out. That score remained the highest on debut until R. E. Foster scored 287 for England against Australia in 1903. Foster's innings was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930, and remains the highest score amongst Test debutants. His double-century is one of seven made on Test debut, the other six were scored by Lawrence Rowe, Brendon Kuruppu, Mathew Sinclair, Jacques Rudolph, Kyle Mayers and Devon Conway. Nine players (Bill Ponsford, Doug Walters, Alvin Kallicharran, Mohammad Azharuddin, Greg Blewett, Sourav Ganguly, Rohit Sharma, James Neesham, and Abid Ali) went on to make centuries in the second Test as well. Mohammad Azharuddin is the only player to score centuries in his first three Tests.\nWhen he scored his debut hundred, Bangladesh's Mohammad Ashraful became the youngest player to score a century in Test cricket, at the age of 17 years and 61 days. Adam Voges is the oldest player to have done so on debut, aged 35 years and 243 days when he scored 130 not out for Australia against the West Indies in June 2015. The 100th century on Test debut was by South African Stiaan van Zyl, who scored 101* against the West Indies in Centurion in December 2014, whilst the 100th player to score a century on Test debut was his compatriot Stephen Cook, who scored 115 against England at the same ground in 2016.\nDavid Hopps asked \"Why is it that 100 Test batsmen, previously unchosen, have now trodden this path?\" He notes, \"There is often an advantage that bowlers have had no time to explore their deficiencies, but most influential of all must be the hunger that runs through their veins.\""

        "title": "List of centuries in women's One Day International cricket",
        "text": "A women's One Day International (WODI) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having WODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In a WODI match, the two teams play a single innings, each of which is restricted to a maximum of fifty overs. The first WODI matches were played as part of the Women's Cricket World Cup in 1973 held in England, two years after the first men's One Day International was contested between Australia and England in January 1971. A century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batsman in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. ,278 centuries have been scored by 102 different players from 1,359 WODI matches.\nThe first two centuries in WODIs were scored as part of the opening round in the 1973 Women's World Cup. England's Lynne Thomas and Enid Bakewell both achieved the feat as part of their team's victory over the International XI. Thomas and Bakewell are two of only seven players to score a century during their WODI debut, the others being Nicole Bolton of Australia, India's Reshma Gandhi and Mithali Raj, Natthakan Chantam of Thailand and Zimbabwe's Mary-Anne Musonda; Thomas, Bakewell, Chantam and Musonda's centuries all came in their teams' maiden WODIs. Raj and Gandhi centuries came in a match against Ireland in 1999 which saw Raj become the then youngest player to score a century, aged 16 years 205 days. This record stood for 22 years before it was broken by Ireland's Amy Hunter who scored hers on her 16th birthday against Zimbabwe in 2021. Raj and Gandhi's centuries are one of thirty-four occurrences where two or more centuries have been scored in a WODI. The oldest player to score a WODI century is New Zealand's Barbara Bevege who was aged 39 years and 48 days when she reached 101 against the International XI during the 1982 Women's World Cup.\nThe most recent century, , was scored by Phoebe Litchfield of Australia against India at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, in January 2024. Meg Lanning of Australia holds the record for the most centuries, having scored 15. She is followed by Suzie Bates, the former skipper of New Zealand, with Thirteen centuries and Charlotte Edwards of England, with nine. New Zealand's Amelia Kerr holds the record for the highest individual score in a WODI with 232 not out scored against Ireland in June 2018, eclipsing Belinda Clark's of Australia longstanding record of 229 not out scored against Denmark in 1997, becoming the youngest cricketer, male or female, to score a double century in One Day International cricket. As this was Kerr's first time reaching the milestone, the innings was also the highest maiden WODI century scored breaking Deepti Sharma of India's mark of 188 against Ireland during the 2017 South Africa Women's Quadrangular Series. Amy Satterthwaite of New Zealand has scored four consecutive WODI centuries, the sole player to do so. Twenty-six centuries have been scored by a player in a losing side, the highest score being 178 not out by Sri Lanka's Chamari Atapattu whose team lost to Australia during the 2017 Women's World Cup. A further four centuries have been scored in matches that have ended in a no result.\nAustralia and England lead the list with 63 centuries, followed by New Zealand with 47. Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln, New Zealand, leads the list of where the most centuries have been scored with fourteen, ahead of the Bristol County Ground with eight, and then the Bay Oval, Seddon Park and Senwes Park with seven each."

The St. Lawrence Laurentians and Holy Cross have traditionally dominated the competition, having won a combined total of 47 Cups out of the 55 times that it has been contested.\nCompetition format.\nThe Newfoundland Challenge Cup consists of Newfoundland and Labrador-based men's senior amateur soccer clubs. The teams first compete to qualify for a playoff round in a league format, usually a quadruple- or hextuple-round robin system, depending on the number of clubs competing. Normally teams play around 20 league matches in a single season. At the end of the league phase the 4 clubs with the most points qualify for the playoffs (3 points are awarded for a win, 1 point is awarded for a draw, and none for a loss). Clubs are ranked by total points, then head-to-head record, then goal differential and then goals scored. If two clubs are still tied for a playoff position then a penalty kick competition at a venue decided by the league will determine the ranking. If three or more clubs are still tied the ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots.\nThe playoff round of the NLCC uses a Page playoff format, which was reinstituted in 2015 after the league switched to a more typical two round format in 2011. The competition takes place at one location over Labour Day weekend each year.

        "text": "Henry Nicholson Lamar (January 26, 1906 – September 28, 1985) was an American college boxing coach, college football coach, and professional boxing executive. He served as the head football coach at Harvard University in 1943 and 1944. Lamar also served as the Harvard boxing coach and freshman football coach.\nEarly life.\nLamar was born in Oxford, Mississippi, and raised in Washington, D.C., by government employee Lucius Lamar and his wife Atala. He was a great-grandson of Mississippi jurist Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II and a relative of Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas. Lamar attended Western High School in Washington, where he began his successful career as a boxer. As a senior, he won the national amateur light heavyweight championship at the Boston Garden in 1925, and successfully defended the title the following year. He made his professional boxing debut in Boston in August 1926. Lamar also won the Pan-American light heavyweight championship.\nLamar attended the University of Virginia, from which he graduated in 1929. Around that time, he married his wife, Juanita (née Galvin), with whom he had two daughters. Lamar boxed professionally until 1930 when he lost a match to Jim Maloney at Braves Field. After the bout, he said, \"That's enough. I'm never going to be a champion ... this is a good time to get out.\" It was his only loss in 39 bouts as a professional fighter.\nCoaching career.\nLamar joined the athletic department at Harvard University in 1931, initially intending \"just to help out for a few weeks\", but he remained at the school as a boxing and football coach for four decades. He became the head boxing coach in 1932 after many students had successfully petitioned for the introduction of the sport in 1929 and 1930. He remained coach after the sport, which had been adopted on a trial basis, was reduced to intramural level in 1937. Fans and sportswriters called Lamar \"the gentleman coach of Harvard boxing\".\nIn 1934, Lamar was named the line coach of the Harvard football team. In a surprising selection the following season, head coach Dick Harlow selected Lamar as Crimson's ends coach. The \"Boston Globe\" noted Lamar was previously \"a very inconspicuous member of the Harvard Athletic Association's organization.\" During his tenure at the university, he coached the four Kennedy brothers: Joseph, John, Robert, and Edward, all of whom played as ends on the football team.\nDuring World War II, Harvard football coach Dick Harlow spent 30 months in the United States Navy, during which time Lamar served as the team's mentor for the 1943 and 1944 seasons. He compiled a 7–3–1 record. In the late 1940s, he coached Harvard's junior varsity football team.\nIn 1947, Lamar was appointed chairman of the Massachusetts Boxing Commission. In that post, he attempted to reform the sport in the state, including through a review of all licenses and the mandatory screening of fighters for brain damage. Lamar also courted controversy, for example, by suspending Sugar Ray Robinson for walking out on a fight and by withdrawing the state from the National Boxing Association.\nLamar retired from coaching at Harvard in June 1972. Following his retirement, Harvard created the Henry N. Lamar Award, for which a gold pocket watch is presented to \"that senior member of the Harvard football squad who, through his dedication to the program and concern for his fellow man, has made a unique contribution to Harvard football.\"\nAfter a brief illness, he died of cancer in a Marlboro, Massachusetts hospital on September 28, 1985. He was 79 years old."

        "title": "Cycling in Atlanta",
        "text": "Cycling in Atlanta has grown in popularity in recent years, from 0.33% of commutes in 2000 to 1.1% in 2009, aided by improving cycling infrastructure and community support. Although Atlanta has historically been a city defined by the automobile, its increasingly compact urban form and mild climate are encouraging residents to cycle to work, shopping, and recreational destinations. Though Atlanta's famed hilly topography can make cycling challenging, though fun, many parts of the city are relatively flat, including some of the more densely populated areas. However, heavy automobile traffic, the lack of bike lanes on many streets, and difficulty in crossing major streets deter most residents from cycling frequently in Atlanta.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2000, Atlanta's car-choked roads were rarely shared with cyclists. In fact, cycling was associated with those who couldn't afford automobile transportation. However, during the 2000s, due to Atlanta's increasing density, burgeoning intown population, and green ambitions, cycling boomed in popularity. Bike advocacy groups, including Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, began planning bike-centric social events and lobbying city leaders for more cycling infrastructure.\nCulture.\nAtlanta has an active and growing cycling culture organized around many different bike-related social events and clubs. Many of the well-known \"cycling cliques\" are represented in the city, including urban cyclists, road racing bicycle riders, messengers, and fixed-gear riders (\"fixie hipsters\").\nBicycle clubs.\nRecreational bicycling clubs in Atlanta include Metro Atlanta Cycling Club, Ladies on Spokes, Southern Bicycling League, Bike Emory, Dunwoody Cycling, Sorella Cycling, and Atlanta Cycling, Team Spindle (www.thespindleatl.com) The DopePedalers DopePedalers (@dopepedalers) • Instagram photos and videos.\nAtlanta Streets Alive.\nAtlanta Streets Alive is a ciclovía held throughout the year. It is a temporary closing of the street to automobiles for use by cyclists. The free event, organized by the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, takes place in Downtown Atlanta and the Old Fourth Ward, mostly on Edgewood Avenue. Sections of Auburn Avenue, Park Place, and Equitable Place are also closed to automobile traffic. The event kickoff is held at Woodruff Park. Around 6,000 people attend the event, usually held in the spring, summer, or autumn months to take advantage of Atlanta's mild climate.\nCritical Mass.\nThe first Critical Mass bicycle ride took place on in 1992 in San Francisco, and has since spread to hundreds of cities worldwide. Atlanta's version of the event, which draws around 300 participants, takes place on the last Friday of each month at 6:30 pm at Woodruff Park. The cyclists then ride through the city \"en masse\", re-claiming the normally auto-dominated streets for bicycle use.\nInfrastructure.\nAtlanta's cycling infrastructure, while improving, has a long way to go. However, in 2010, Atlanta built nearly 15 more miles of bike lanes, both dedicated and shared. There are a number of paved and unpaved trails within and near the city, that are open to cyclists as well as pedestrians.\nA \"Chief Bicycle Officer\" position (CBO) at the City of Atlanta was funded by a five-year $250,000 challenge grant to the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition by the Atlanta Falcons Youth Foundation (an affiliated fund of The Arthur M. Blank family Foundation), beginning in 2015. In October 2015, Becky Katz was hired as Atlanta's first Chief Bicycle Officer. Goals for the CBO position included gathering public input to update the Connect Atlanta plan, and advancing various bicycle infrastructure projects city-wide, as part of a larger push for Atlanta to seek the League of American Bicyclists’ top designation as a “Bicycle Friendly Community”. In April 2018, following Katz's departure from the position, the job was reposted. The City of Atlanta hired Cary Bearn as Chief Bicycle Officer in September 2018.\nPATH.\nFounded 1991, PATH is a nonprofit that has built more than 100 miles of bike trails throughout Atlanta. Over the next 20 years, the organization plans to construct a spider-like trail connecting Centennial Olympic Park, the Beltline, and the suburbs.\nBeltLine.\nThe Beltline, a planned 22-mile loop of transit circling Atlanta, will also have a bike trail component. Current bike trails include a two-and-a-half mile trail in southwest Atlanta, and a two-and-a-half mile trail connecting Piedmont Park to Inman Park.\nConnect Atlanta.\nConnect Atlanta, the city's comprehensive transportation plan, calls for the construction of more than 200 miles of bike lanes.\nStatistics.\nSource:\nAdvocacy.\nThe Atlanta Bicycle Coalition is a nonprofit public-benefit corporation established to \"create a healthier, more sustainable Atlanta by making it safer, easier, and more attractive to bicycle for fun, fitness, and transportation.\" Founded in 1991, the ABC has a dues-paying membership. The ABC organizes or promotes cycling-related events such as Atlanta Streets Alive and Bike Month."

It was introduced as a women's sport in 1974.

This building was a big accomplishment for the team, previously one of two national top 20 teams without an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The Aquatic and Fitness Center was built not only with a 50-meter Olympic-sized pool, but also with a warm-water pool, whirlpool and sauna, classrooms, fitness areas, locker rooms, a bookstore, and a dining area. The $18.5 million facility features a 50-meter pool that converts to a short course 25-yard pool, as well as state of the art lane lines and gutters.

        "title": "2011–12 PBA Tour season",
        "text": "This is a recap of the 2011–12 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It is the tour's 53rd season, and the third straight season in which all of the first half events were condensed into the PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB). The season consisted of 15 title events. This is also the final season in which the PBA is using an \"exempt\" player list. The \"exempt\" status for touring players will not be carried into the 2012–13 season.\nFollowing the retirement of PBA Commissioner &amp; CEO Fred Schreyer in October, 2011, the PBA named Geoff Reiss as PBA CEO and promoted Deputy Commissioner Tom Clark to the role of PBA Commissioner.\nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the third season in a row, the PBA condensed the first half of the season into the PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB). Preliminary rounds of the televised tournaments were November 5–16, with television tapings on November 17–20. All of the events were held at the South Point Casino's bowling center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThere were five \"open\" events at the World Series, meaning they were open to all PBA and World Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA) members around the world. (To earn a PBA title at an event, however, the winner must be a full-fledged PBA member by the time of the WSOB.) The open events included four stand-alone title tournaments (Viper Open, Chameleon Open, Scorpion Open and Shark Open), plus the PBA World Championship. Each stand-alone \"animal pattern\" event featured 8 games of qualifying in the morning of each day, with the top 16 returning that evening for a best-of-five elimination match play round to determine the top four for the TV finals. The bowlers with the top 53 pinfall totals from the 32 qualifying round games in the four stand-alone events were entered into the \"cashers' round\" for the PBA World Championship. These 53 players then rolled 8 more games to determine the final 16 bowlers for the televised match play round of the World Championship.\nThere were three \"exempt\" events added to the 2011 WSOB. The Carmen Salvino Classic started with a field of up to 49 Lumber Liquidators PBA Tour exempt players, plus at least 15 Tour Qualifying Round (TQR) participants. Two other events, the Pepsi PBA Elite Players Championship and PBA Exempt Players Baker Doubles Championship were for PBA exempt bowlers only. The combined totals from 12 games of Carmen Salvino Classic and 18 games of Elite Players Championship qualifying determined the 16-player match play semifinals participants for both the Elite singles and Exempt doubles events.\nAn additional TV taping took place at the WSOB: the WTBA World Bowling Tour Finals, presented by the PBA. Qualifying for this final round was based on multiple WTBA international events, and did not take place at the WSOB. The finals format was a three-man and three-woman stepladder.\nIn all, 14 TV programs were taped at the 2011 World Series of Bowling: four stand-alone \"animal pattern\" finals, Carmen Salvino Classic finals, Pepsi PBA Elite Players Championship finals, PBA Exempt Players Baker Doubles Championship finals, WTBA World Bowling Tour men's final, WTBA World Bowling Tour women's final, and five days of broadcasts for the PBA World Championship finals. The TV finals were contested on specially-built lanes placed inside the South Point Casino's Exhibition Center.\nThe second half of the PBA Tour season included the three remaining majors (USBC Masters, Lumber Liquidators U.S. Open and PBA Tournament of Champions), plus four more title events.\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a summary of the 2011–12 season. Total career PBA Tour titles for winners are shown in parentheses. All prize money is in US dollars ($), except where indicated.\nAn asterisk (*) indicates a tournament that was broadcast start-to-finish (including finals) on the PBA Xtra Frame webcast service. All other broadcasts were on ESPN television."

        "title": "1940–41 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season",
        "text": "The 1940–41 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the second season of the English rugby league’s Wartime Emergency League necessitated by the Second World War. After doubts that the season might not start, matches were played in a league organised in a similar way to the previous season with two regional leagues, Yorkshire and Lancashire, with the winners of each league meeting in a two-legged play-off final to determine the overall champions.\nThe Challenge Cup competition was re-introduced having been suspended in 1939–40 and the Yorkshire Cup was competed for but the Lancashire Cup competition was suspended.\nThe number of clubs participating in the league was down on the previous season, especially in Lancashire. The Yorkshire League was won by Bradford Northern who went on to retain their overall League Championship by beating Lancashire league winners Wigan in the play-off final. Leeds won the Challenge Cup while Bradford Northern won the Yorkshire Cup.\nBackground.\nThe 1939–40 season ended as the Battle of France was drawing to a close and the armed forces were planning the evacuation of British and French troops from Dunkirk. The Rugby Football League's (RFL) annual general meeting was held in Leeds on 12 June when the prospects of the war for the British were not good, the Dunkirk evacuation had finished, the German army was about to occupy Paris and the evacuation of the second British Expeditionary Force from Brittany was about to begin. At a very short RFL meeting the chairman, G. F. Hutchins, stated \"it would be futile for the Rugby League to-day to attempt to come to any decision. All they could do was to mark time and await events.\" A. A. Bonner added \"the Government may decide that it would be in the interests of the country for recreation to be provided for the people at home, but at the moment the prospects for football did not appear bright.\"\nThe league council met again in early August to review the situation and having been informed by the Ministry of Labour that sport to promote relaxation was encouraged, the decision was taken to play a league season on the same county lines as 1939–40. Each club had, prior to the meeting, been asked to decide if they would participate in the league. Two, Hull Kingston Rovers and Rochdale Hornets, gave notice that they would not be participating and several more had not yet made a decision by the date of the meeting. The meeting also deferred any decision on the playing of any cup competitions until 1941 and set payments for players at 25 shillings for a win or away draw and 15 shillings for a defeat or home draw. The clubs were given a deadline of 19 August to make a final decision on whether to compete in the league. At the next council meeting on 21 August all the Yorkshire clubs except Hull Kingston Rovers had confirmed their participation but two Lancashire clubs, Widnes and Barrow, joined Rochdale in withdrawing from the league. With only 23 clubs, 14 from Yorkshire and 9 from Lancashire, consideration was given to combining the two county leagues but the proposal was defeated. To add to the issues faced by the committee of the Lancashire county competition, Leigh confirmed that all their home games would have to be played away as their Mather Lane stadium was unavailable to the club. The playing of a nine-club Lancashire county league was agreed by the county committee on 28 August 1940 and preparations made for the new season to start on 7 September 1940.\nCounty competitions.\nYorkshire competition.\nEach of the 14 teams was scheduled to play 26 games but only two clubs, Hull F.C. and Keighley managed to complete their schedules. The remaining clubs played between 20 and 25 games. Most commonly this was due to inability to raise enough players to fill the team. On other occasions teams were filled up using players from the other club as the guest system introduced the previous year was retained; this allowed a player to turn out for another club as long as the original club gave permission. An extreme example occurred on only the second week of the season when Batley travelled to Hull with only half a squad and no less than seven Hull players played for Batley.\nThe competition was won by Bradford Northern, retaining the title they won in the previous season.\nLancashire competition.\nWith only nine teams competing the Lancashire competition was planned with each team playing 16 fixtures. When the competition ended in January 1941 only three teams, Oldham, Warrington and Wigan had played all their planned fixtures. The other six clubs had all failed to fulfil one or more fixtures. As in Yorkshire most unplayed games were due to the inability of one or other club to raise enough players; games were announced as not being played without comment, for example Broughton Rangers did not travel to Liverpool Stanley on 28 December, the local paper published the simple announcement \"Broughton Rangers are unable to fulfil their engagement with Stanley at Prescot\" on the morning of the game. Neither was the situation made any easier by problems with grounds, as well as Leigh having to play all their games away, Swinton were sharing the Willows with Salford, Broughton Rangers played all their home games as Stockport County's Edgeley Park and Liverpool Stanley were also playing at a soccer ground - Prescot Cables' Hope Street stadium.\nAnother factor in the number of games played were the decisions by Salford and Warrington to withdraw from the competition in January 1941. Salford announced on 1 January that the club was closing down until further notice while Warrington withdrew later the same month.\nThe competition was won by Wigan who went undefeated in the season, winning 15 games and drawing one. At the other end of the table and partly due to the unplayed fixtures both Broughton Rangers and Leigh failed to win a single game.\nChampionship play-off.\nThe Championship was decided by a two-leg play-off between Wigan and Bradford Northern over the Easter weekend of 1941. Bradford won 45–15 on aggregate.\nFirst leg.\nThe first leg of the play-off took place at Wigan's Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 12 April 1941. Both teams included guest players, Salford being represented on both teams. Bradford dominated the first half with tries from Higson, Risman and Best; Ward converting one of the tries. The halt-time score was 11–0.\nThe second half was more even with both teams scoring two tries, Walters with two for Bradford and Jones and Lawrenson scoring for Wigan, making the final score 17–6 in Bradford's favour. The game was watched by 11,245 people and generated gate receipts of £640.\nSecond leg.\nThe second leg was played 48 hours after the first leg, on Easter Monday 14 April at Bradford's Odsal Stadium. The first half of the game was a much closer encounter than at Central Park and Bradford went in with a half-time lead 8–6 courtesy of tries from Winnard and Risman with a Ward conversion; Wigan had replied with tries by Aspinall and Johnson.\nIn the second half both hookers, Carter and Egan, were sent off and the resultant changes in the scrummage tipped the game in Bradford's favour and they scored a further four tries through Winnard, Risman, Moore and Walters with Ward kicking four more goals including a penalty; Bowen scored a try for Wigan. The final score was 28–9 to Bradford giving them a 30-point aggregate victory over the two legs. 20,205 people watched the game; the gate receipts totalling £1,148.\nCup competitions.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was re-introduced after a season’s absence. At the August 1940 council meeting it was proposed the complete the league season, play the county cup competitions and then finish the season with the Challenge Cup. A decision on the structure of the Challenge Cup was deferred at the December meeting of the council but in January the dates for the competition were finalised. The competition was to be played on consecutive weekends commencing 12 April 1941, there would be three rounds then the four teams in the semi-finals would play on a home and away two-legged basis on the first two weekends in May 1941 with the final on a neutral venue on 17 May. Players were not allowed to play for more than one club in the competition and there were to be no replays. Extra time of 20 minutes was to be played and in the event of the scores still being level then the game would continue until one team scored. Medals would not be presented to the players in the final, instead war savings certificates were to be awarded, four to each player on the winning team and three to each player on the losing team.\nInvitations to all clubs, even those who had not played in the league, were distributed in February 1941 and by the date of the draw 21 clubs had entered. The clubs who had not participated in the league all declined to enter the cup together with Salford and Warrington. So that clubs could make the necessary travel arrangements the first three rounds were all drawn on 26 March 1941; the first round consisting of five ties involving 10 clubs. The remaining 11 clubs were given a bye into the second round of eight matches.\nThe four semi-finalists were Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield Trinity and Halifax. Leeds beat Bradford 22–12 over two legs and Halifax beat Wakefield 16–12 on aggregate.\nThe final was played at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 17 May where a crowd of 28,500 saw Leeds beat Halifax 19–2. Leeds led 5–2 at half-time through a penalty kicked by Eaton and a try by Jenkins with Halifax's Meek scoring a penalty. In the second half Leeds scored four more tries, two each by Hey and Lawrenson with Eaton converting one of the tries. The gate receipts totalled £1703, under the financial arrangements of the cup competition, after the deduction of match expenses and taxes the receipts were split with 50% going to the Rugby League and 25% each to the Leeds and Halifax clubs. Each club that took part in the competition received £42 10s 6d from the 20% of the pooled receipts of the earlier rounds of the competition.\nLancashire Cup.\nWhen planning for the season commenced the Lancashire committee had every intention of the Lancashire Cup competition being played, however when it came to make the draw for the first round in January 1941, the draw was deferred as only six clubs had confirmed their entry into the competition. On 4 February 1941 the committee cancelled the competition for the season as only three teams, Wigan, Leigh and Oldham were prepared to play.\nYorkshire Cup.\nIn Yorkshire the playing of the Yorkshire Cup competition was confirmed in December 1940 with the competition to be played in March and April 1941. Following the decision of the Lancashire committee to abandon the Lancashire Cup competition, Wigan and Oldham applied to the Yorkshire committee to play in the Yorkshire Cup instead. This application was accepted and the two Lancashire clubs joined the 14 Yorkshire teams who had participated in the league in the competition.\nNeither Lancashire team progressed past the first round as Wigan lost 9–3 to Leeds and Oldham went down 17–5 to Wakefield. The final was played between Bradford Northern and Dewsbury at Huddersfield's Fartown Ground on 5 April. Bradford won 15–5 in front of 13,316 spectators (gate receipts totalled £939) with two tries from Foster and one by Best and three kicked goals by Carmichael; Dewsbury's points came from a Sullivan penalty and a Tracey try.\nInternational match.\nA single international match was played when England beat Wales 8–5 at Oldham's Watersheddings ground on 9 November 1940. Although not reported at the time, the game was suspended during the first half due to an air raid warning; play did not continue until the all-clear was sounded."

        "title": "1941–42 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season",
        "text": "The 1941–42 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the third season of the rugby league’s Wartime Emergency League necessitated by the Second World War. With fewer clubs than the previous season the Rugby Football League (RFL) decided to amalgamate the two county leagues (Yorkshire and Lancashire) into one joint league. The season started with 18 clubs but finished with 17 after Broughton Rangers withdrew in January 1942. The single division championship was won by Dewsbury, who had finished the season in first position and then defeated Bradford Northern in the play-off final.\nThe Challenge Cup was won by Leeds while Bradford Northern won the Yorkshire Cup, the Lancashire Cup was not played.\nPre-season developments.\nThe RFL annual general meeting was held on 11 June 1941 and with four clubs confirming that they would not enter the league for 1941–42 and a further five unsure about participating, the RFL indicated that a single division championship would be played. The clubs confirming that they would not be playing were Salford, Warrington (both of whom had withdrawn from the league part way through the previous season), Widnes and Rochdale Hornets (neither of which had entered the previous season). The five unconfirmed teams were Hull Kingston Rovers, Barrow (neither of which had entered the previous season), Leigh, Liverpool Stanley and Broughton Rangers (who had filled the bottom three places in the previous season's Lancashire league).\nThe Rugby League Council confirmed the decision to have a single league at its meeting at the end of July. By the time of the council meeting on 31 July three of the five undecided teams confirmed that they would not be participating, Hull Kingston Rovers, Barrow and Liverpool Stanley. Broughton Rangers decided to play while Leigh were still undecided. Among the Yorkshire clubs, Hull F.C. and Castleford still had to confirm their places. While Hull and Castleford confirmed their continued entry, the RFL declined Leigh's application. Leigh had vacated their Mather Lane and moved into the ground of Hindsford AFC, the RFL did not consider that the Hindsford ground was good enough for first class matches. Leigh appealed the decision but the appeal was refused as the ground wasn't of the required standard and the club had not submitted their original application until after the fixtures for the season had already been arranged.\nThe league therefore comprised the 14 teams from Yorkshire who had competed in 1940-41 and four from Lancashire; Broughton Rangers, Wigan, Oldham and St Helens.\nIn other developments, the RFL announced that players of non-playing clubs were entitled to play for other teams under the guest rules introduced in the first season of the war, without any payment being paid to the parent club. Three representative games were also planned; an international between England and Wales, a Lancashire v Yorkshire game, and a Rugby League XIII against a Services XIII.\nLeague season.\nThe season began on 6 September 1941 with a full programme of fixtures.\nThe early part of the season passed smoothly although in October there were concerns that illegal payments were being made to players to induce them to make guest appearances for other clubs. The most notable of these involved former captain Jim Sullivan who was alleged to have received illegal payments from Dewsbury to play for the Yorkshire club rather than his registered club, Wigan. The investigation found no proof of such payments being made but did censure Sullivan for demanding more than the 25\"s\" maximum match fee from Wigan.\nUntil the end of October there were no problems but towards the beginning of the following month, Broughton Rangers, started cancelling matches and later the matter was referred to the RFL. With the club declining to play any matches over the Christmas period they RFL held further discussions and in early January 1942 Broughton resigned from the competition and their results to that date were expunged from the league table.\nIn December 1941 concerns began to be raised that teams would not all play the same number of games and suggestions appeared that the league table should be based on win percentages rather than competition points of two points for a win and one point for a draw. Changes in petrol rationing also imposed additional pressures on clubs in arranging travel to away games. The basic ration for non-essential travel was cut twice during 1941 and permits were required for long coach trips leading to players having to commit long hours to getting to and from matches. The \"Yorkshire Evening Post\" detailed the journeys of York and Hull travelling to St Helens and Wigan respectively on the opening day of the season, with the teams leaving their home towns at 9 am and not getting home until after midnight.\nOver the following weeks the discussion continued with the Dewsbury club, voicing their opposition to the suggestion on the grounds that it would cost them the title at that time; mid-January 1942. The RFL made no immediate decision but the weather at the end of January and into February saw numerous cancellations e.g. the entire programme on 31 January and 6 February was postponed, and by the end of February the backlog of postponed games totalled 150. It was in March 1942 that the RFL decided that league placing would be based on win percentages and that the title of champions would be decided after a two round play-off involving the top four teams.\nThe same meeting in March also decided that the final would be played on 18 April 1942 and that guest players would only be eligible to appear in the play-off games if they had played at least four matches during the season for the club they were guesting for.\nTo ensure the final was played on 18 April, the RFL announced that the four teams at the top of the league table on 6 April (Easter Monday) would be the four going forward to the play-off semi-finals although matches continued to be played until May, for example Huddersfield didn't play Dewsbury until 9 May. The number of games played by each club varied between 17 and 24 and while Dewsbury won 19 and drew 1 of their 24, luckless Bramley lost all 19 matches played.\nAfter the matches on 6 April, the top four teams (in order) were Dewsbury, Bradford Northern, Halifax and Hull. The semi-finals were played the following Saturday where Dewsbury beat Hull 32–18 while Bradford beat Halifax 15–8. The final was played at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 18 April saw Dewsbury crowned champions with a 13-0 win over Bradford Northern.\nDiscipline during the season was reasonable but there were exceptions. Mel De Lloyd, a Warrington player playing as a guest for Keighley was banned indefinitely for dissent towards and assaulting the referee during Keighley's game against Hull in January 1942.\nChampionship final.\nBefitting their league positions, the top two met at Headingley in the Championship Final on 18 April. Dewsbury, under manager-secretary Eddie Waring, had made wide use of the guest rules to build a strong team including several players currently in the army and based in West Yorkshire including Great Britain and Wales internationals Gus Risman and Roy Francis. Despite this strong team, the game was scoreless at the end of the first half. The first score was a drop goal from Dewsbury's Alan Edwards halfway into the second half and with the Dewsbury forwards dominating the scrums (the second half count was 30 to 6 in Dewsbury's favour), the Dewsbury backs including Risman and Francis took control and ran in three tries through Hudson, Francis and Kenny with Risman adding one goal. The final result of 13–0 was witnessed by over 18,000 spectators with the gate receipts totalling £1,121.\nCup competitions.\nLancashire Cup.\nWith so few Lancashire clubs in the league, the RFL decided to continue the format of the previous season with the Lancashire Cup not being played for and the Lancashire clubs being allowed to enter the Yorkshire Cup.\nYorkshire Cup.\nThe structure of the Yorkshire Cup was agreed upon at a meeting in September 1941. All 14 Yorkshire teams taking part in the league entered and they were joined by Lancashire teams, Oldham and Wigan. All ties were to be two legged except the final, with the competition being played over consecutive weekends starting on 25 October 1941.\nBradford Northern and Halifax won through to the final which was played at Fartown, Huddersfield on 6 December 1941. Bradford won the final, convincingly, 24–0 in front of a crowd of 6,100.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup was played in April and May 1942. All 17 clubs competing in the league competition entered the Challenge Cup and were joined by Swinton who entered the cup despite having not played in the league. All ties except the final were played over two legs. The first two rounds were drawn on 25 March, the first round only comprised four teams with the other 14 all being given a bye to the second round.\nBramley's defeats to Hull F.C. in both legs of the second round concluded a dismal season for the club as they finished without a victory in any competition.\nThe competition was played on consecutive Saturdays from 11 April (first round, first leg) to 6 June 1942 (final).\nThe final was a repeat of the previous season's final as Leeds faced Halifax at Odsal Stadium in Bradford. Leeds retained the cup beating Halifax 15–10 on 6 June 1942. Among the victorious Leeds team were Salford players Alan Edwards and Gus Risman who had therefore been part of the winning Championship and Challenge Cup teams but for different clubs.\nRepresentative matches.\nEngland v Wales.\nAn England v Wales match was played at Odsal, Bradford on 18 October 1941. A crowd of 4,339 saw the teams play out a 9-all draw with each side scoring a try and three goals. All the points were scored in the first half; England took an early lead with a Belshaw penalty but Wales scored a try through Edwards which Risman converted. A Risman penalty put Wales 7–2 ahead but England equalised with a try by Lawrensen which Belshaw converted. Wales regained their lead with another Rismen penalty but Belshaw kicked another penalty to square things up again. The \"Yorkshire Observer\" reporter, George Thompson, commented that by peace-time standards the game \"wasn't so good\" but \"on war-time estimations it was quite a good game\".\nNorthern Command v Rugby League XIII.\nRugby league was not recognised by the British armed services and rugby union was the only code approved, however the Northern Command sports board (NCSB) acknowledged the number of league players at their disposal and realised that there would be interest in fielding a rugby league team. A match between a Northern Command XIII and Bradford Northern was played at the beginning of the season following a suggestion made during the previous season. Bradford Northern won the match, played on 30 August, 24–21. On the back of this match the RFL had hoped to arrange a match between an Army XIII and a Rugby League XIII. The army declined the request as the fixture list for sports was too full, but the NCSB approached the RFL to play a match and one was fixed for 21 March 1942 and was played at Thrum Hall, Halifax.\nIn a match that was in the balance until the last minute, Northern Command took the lead with a try by Francis which Ward converted for a 5–0 lead. Penalties were traded then two League tries by Lawrensen and Chapman together with a Batten conversion gave the League team the lead 10–7. Northern Command struck back with a converted try by Pepperell to lead 12–10 at half time. Northern Command extended the lead to 14–10 early in the second half with a further Ward penalty but a second converted try by Chapman gave League the lead. A case try for Northern Command was matched by a second Lawrensen try to make the score 18–17 in the League's favour with time running out. In the last seconds of the game Northern scored a fifth try through Walsh which Ward converted to make the final score 22–18 to the army side.\nYorkshire League v Lancashire League.\nThe final representative match of the season was between players from Yorkshire clubs and players from Lancashire clubs. The match was played at Crown Flatts, Dewsbury on 28 March 1942. 4,000 attended a game that despite Lancashire taking the lead with a Belshaw penalty, Yorkshire dominated. Yorkshire scored three tries with Batten getting two and Irving one - this commentators agreed was the best of the three - and with Ward converting two of the tries, the game ended 13–2 to Yorkshire.\nFinancial performance.\nThe RFL annual general meeting was held on 1 July 1942. The accounts showed the RFL showed a profit of £72 with assets of £21,935. The accounts of the Northern Football League i.e. the championship administered by the RFL, which were presented separately showed that the championship made a loss of £133."

        "title": "2011–12 IRB Sevens World Series",
        "text": "The 2011–12 IRB Sevens World Series, known for sponsorship reasons as the HSBC Sevens World Series, was the 13th annual series of the IRB Sevens World Series tournaments for full national sides run by the International Rugby Board since 1999–2000.\nSevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. However, the most famous event, the Hong Kong Sevens, was played over three days, largely because it involves 24 teams instead of the usual 16. In addition, the USA Sevens were a three-day affair this season despite being a standard 16-team event.\nItinerary.\nThe IRB announced the schedule for the 2011–12 series on 18 August 2011. The most important development was the addition of a leg in Japan, expanding the circuit to nine legs. Two other significant scheduling changes were made. The Australian leg, which had previously followed the Hong Kong Sevens, was now the first event in the series. Also, the last two legs of the series, originally slated for Edinburgh and London, switched places on the schedule, making the London leg the last in the series.\nOn 13 April 2011, the Australian and South African unions (ARU and SARU, respectively) both announced that their countries' legs of the series would move to new sites effective this season. The ARU announced that its leg would move from Adelaide to the Gold Coast. Initially, the event was called the \"International Rugby Sevens Gold Coast\", but was later rebranded as simply the \"Gold Coast Sevens\". The SARU announced that Port Elizabeth would become the new host of the South Africa leg, replacing George.\nOn 9 December 2011, the IRB and the Scottish Rugby Union announced that the Scotland Sevens, also previously known as the Edinburgh Sevens, would move to Glasgow from the 2012 edition.\nWomen's sevens.\nThe 2011 Dubai Sevens saw the IRB organise its first officially sanctioned women's international sevens tournament apart from the Rugby World Cup Sevens. It involved eight teams—Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, South Africa, Spain, and the USA—and the semifinals and final were held on the main pitch at The Sevens. This was part of a plan to launch a full IRB International Women's Sevens Series for 2012–13.\nCore teams.\nBefore each season, the IRB announces the 12 \"core teams\" that received guaranteed berths in each event of that season's series. The core teams for 2011–12 were:\nThe core teams have been unchanged since the 2008–09 series.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship was determined by points earned in each tournament. A new points system, in which each participating team now receives Series points, was introduced shortly before the 2011–12 season kicked off:\nTournament structure.\nIn all tournaments except Hong Kong, 16 teams participated. Due to its place as the sport's most prestigious annual event, the Hong Kong tournament had 24 teams. In each 16-team tournament, the teams were divided into pools of four teams, who played a round-robin within the pool. Points were awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. In case of a tie on competition points, tiebreakers are applied in the following order:\nA tie between more than two teams is resolved in the same manner, but without considering head-to-head results.\nFour trophies were awarded in each tournament. In descending order of prestige, they were the Cup (overall tournament champion), Plate, Bowl and Shield. Each trophy was awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\nIn a 16-team tournament, the top two teams in each pool advanced to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers dropped into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl was contested by the third- and fourth-place finishers in each pool, with the losers in the Bowl quarterfinals dropping into the bracket for the Shield.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens used a similar structure, though adjusted for the larger number of teams involved. Its 24 teams were divided into six pools of four teams each, with the competition points system and tiebreakers identical to those for a 16-team event. The six pool winners and the two top second-place finishers advanced to the Cup competition.\nFinal standings.\nThe points awarded to teams at each event, as well as the overall season totals, are shown in the table below. Points for the event winners are indicated in bold. A zero (0) is recorded in the event column where a team competed in a tournament but did not gain any points. A dash (–) is recorded in the event column if a team did not compete at a tournament.\nNotes:\n\"Light blue line on the left indicates a core team eligible to participate in all events of the series.\""

        "text": "The CONMEBOL qualifiers for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup (natively in Spanish: Eliminatorias CONMEBOL al Mundial de la FIFA de Fútbol Playa), previously known as the South American Beach Soccer Championship (Spanish: Sudamericano de Fútbol Playa), was the main championship for beach soccer in South America, contested between the senior men's national teams of the members of CONMEBOL.\nThe tournament acted as the qualification route for South American nations to the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. The winners of the championship were also crowned continental champions. Coinciding with the annual staging of the World Cup, the competition took place yearly until 2009; the World Cup then became biennial, and as its supplementary qualification event, the championship followed suit.\nThe championship was established in 2006 after FIFA made it a requirement for all confederations to begin holding qualification tournaments to determine the best national team(s) in their region and hence those who would proceed to represent their continent in the upcoming World Cup (previously, nations were simply invited to play without having to earn their place). The first edition was proceeded by a joint qualification tournament between CONMEBOL and CONCACAF in 2005; a second and final joint event was held in 2007. FIFA currently allocate South America three berths at the World Cup and hence the top three teams (the winners, runners-up and third place play-off winner) qualify to the World Cup finals.\nBeach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) originally organized the competition under the title FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup CONMEBOL qualifier. In 2013, CONMEBOL began reporting on the event using the aforementioned \"Sudamericano\" title (which the tournament became informally known as) before taking organizational control under a new title in 2017.\nIn July 2022, CONMEBOL decided to interrupt the tournament since CONMEBOL's representatives in the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup would be determined via the Copa América de Beach Soccer, a tournament established by CONMEBOL in 2016 but which did not grant places for the World Cup.\nBrazil were the last champions and the most successful nation with eight titles. They also won the 2005 joint event.\nResults.\nFor every edition, the top three nations qualified to the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nPerformance.\nAll-time table.\n\"As of 2021\"\nKey:\nAppearances App / Won in normal time W = 3 points / Won in extra-time W+ = 2 points / Won on penalty shoot-out W = 1 point / Lost L = 0 points / Points per game PPG\nAppearances &amp; performance timeline.\nThe following is a performance timeline of the teams who have appeared in the CONMEBOL qualifiers and how many appearances they each have made.\nPerformance of qualifiers at the World Cup.\nThe following is a performance timeline of the CONMEBOL teams who have gone on to appear in the World Cup, having successfully qualified from the above events."

Despite this disappointing season, Wimbledon did enjoy some highlights, including a 5–0 win of London rivals Queens Park Rangers at home and a 5–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.\nWimbledon's struggle to return to the top flight was only made harder with the sale of the club's top scorer, Jason Euell, to South London rivals Charlton Athletic at the end of the season.\nKit.\nGerman company Puma became Wimbledon's kit manufacturers.

        "text": "The 2012 Women's Six Nations Championship, also known as the 2012 RBS Women's Six Nations due to the tournament's sponsorship by the Royal Bank of Scotland, was the 11th series of the Women's Six Nations Championship, an annual women's rugby union competition between six European rugby union national teams. Matches were held in February and March 2012, on the same weekends as the men's tournament, if not always the same day.\nThe championship was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. England were favourites to win the tournament, and did so – their victory being their seventh title in a row, winning without conceding a try – the first time this had been achieved in the Six Nations.\nThe tournament marked a significant step-forward in the broadcasting of matches. Three of England's five games were available to the armchair viewer – their home matches against Wales (broadcast live in the UK by the BBC), their game against Ireland (webcast by the RFU), and their away game against France (broadcast in France by France4 and in the UK by Sky – the first time any women's international had been shown on French national TV). Ireland v Scotland was also webcast by the IRFU – the first Irish women's home game ever broadcast. In addition Wales played at the Millennium Stadium for the first time, following the men's game between Wales and Italy, though this was not broadcast."

        "title": "Greg Lee (basketball)",
        "text": "Gregory Scott Lee (December 12, 1951September 21, 2022) was an American professional basketball and volleyball player. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning back-to-back national championships as their starting point guard in 1972 and 1973. He had short stints in the original American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) before playing four seasons in West Germany. As a volleyball player, Lee teamed with Jim Menges to set a record with 13 consecutive professional beach volleyball titles. He was inducted into the California Beach Volleyball Association's (CBVA) hall of fame.\nEarly life.\nLee was born in the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles on December 12, 1951. His father, Marvin, played center for the UCLA Bruins under coach Wilbur Johns. Lee attended Reseda Charter High School, where he was an All-American and named Los Angeles City Section player of the year in basketball.\nBasketball career.\nLee played point guard at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1971 to 1974. When he arrived, freshmen were not allowed to compete on the varsity team. He played on the freshman team with Bill Walton and Keith Wilkes (later known as Jamaal Wilkes), and they went undefeated with a 20–0 record. In his sophomore year, Lee became a starter on the varsity squad. He and his classmates went on the 1971–72 Bruins squad and had a record of 30–0, winning its games by an average margin of over 30 points. Lee averaged 8.7 points per game, while Wilkes averaged 13.5 points and Walton 21.1. UCLA won the national title in 1972 over Florida State 81–76.\nThe following year, the Bruins again went 30–0, and again won the NCAA tournament with an 87–66 win over Memphis State. Lee's 14 assists in the game set an NCAA championship game record. He had started the season as a reserve after coach John Wooden replaced him in the starting lineup with Tommy Curtis. However, Curtis became ill with the London flu after 10 games. Lee re-established himself as the starter, and Curtis became a key reserve. \nIn Lee's senior year in 1973–74, Curtis became a starter again, and Andre McCarter's improved play also cut into Lee's playing time. The school's 88-game winning streak ended with a 71–70 loss to Notre Dame. The streak remains an NCAA men's basketball record. Later that season, UCLA's stretch of consecutive national titles was stopped at seven after North Carolina State defeated the Bruins 80–77 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. In his 2016 autobiography, Walton blamed Curtis for both the tournament loss as well as earlier defeats in the season, and lamented Lee's lack of playing time.\nAfter his collegiate career ended, Lee was drafted by both the NBA and ABA. The Atlanta Hawks drafted him in the seventh round (115th pick overall) of the 1974 NBA draft and the San Diego Conquistadors drafted him in the fifth round of the ABA draft the same year. He chose the Conquistadors, averaging 3.6 points and 2.6 assists in five games. The next season, he moved to the NBA, joining Walton on the Portland Trail Blazers and averaging 1.2 points and 2.2 assists in five games.\nAt the urging of former UCLA player John Ecker, Lee then played in West Germany for four seasons with TuS 04 Leverkusen.\nBeach volleyball career.\nLee did not play volleyball for UCLA. However, his older brother Jon was an accomplished beach volleyball player with a \"AAA\" rating. Jon introduced him to the game. Lee began playing in the sand courts at Sorrento Beach in 1970.\nLee played in his first open at the Laguna Beach Open in 1972, finishing second with Ron Von Hagen. His first open victory was with Tom Chamales at the 1972 Santa Barbara Open. Lee reached the finals four times that year, winning twice. It was in Santa Monica in 1972 that Lee met what came to be his longtime beach partner Jim Menges. The pair of Lee and Menges won their first open tournament together at the 1973 Marine Street Open, defeating Ron Lang and Von Hagen in the finals. The two were partners on and off over the summers of the next two seasons while Menges completed his volleyball career at UCLA and Lee played professional basketball for a couple of years. Lee's best finish on the beach in 1974 was a second at the Manhattan Beach Open.\nStarting in 1975, Lee and Menges began playing together full-time, and the two had a dominant run. They reached the finals of 10 events, winning all but one. In the mid-1970s, the beach volleyball tour consisted of 12 tournaments, all played at beaches along the California coast, from Santa Cruz in the north to San Diego in the south. Lee and Menges dominated the events, winning the final seven matches of the 1975 season and the first six in 1976 to string together 13 tournament wins in a row. The record stood for 16 years until tied by the pairing of Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes. Lee and Menges had become the most dominant pairing in beach volleyball.\nOn the 1977 tour, Lee advanced to the finals three times, winning all of them. In 1978, he reached five finals, winning four times. Lee also won the 1981 Laguna Beach Open with Jay Hanseth. In 1981, Lee and Menges won their last open title, at the Mission Beach Open in San Diego. In total Lee won 25 tournaments with his partner Menges, which places the pair at No. 6 on the all-time list of wins for a team.\nLee's greatest success on the beach came when teaming with Menges. They were considered the kings of the beach in the mid- to late 1970s. From 1973–1982, Lee and Menges played in 30 tournaments together, winning 25, finishing second three times and third twice. They were never out of the top three. The pair also won pro beach volleyball's first World Championship in 1976. Following a loss that stopped Kiraly and Steffes from breaking the tour record of 13 tournament championships in a row set in 1975–76 by Lee and Menges, Kiraly said: \"I guess it's appropriate that Menges and Lee stay in the record book. They laid the foundation for the sport.\"\nLee scored additional victories with Hagen and Hanseth. In 1977, he left the sand to play professional basketball in Europe, returning to Southern California two years later. He entered a total of 62 opens, reaching the finals 39 times while collecting 29 tournament titles. He was inducted into the CBVA Beach Volleyball Hall of Fame in 1997.\nPersonal life.\nLee and wife Lisa were married for 48 years and had two children: Ethan and Jessamyn. Following his athletic career, Lee and his family settled in San Diego. He taught mathematics at Morse High School, and coached the girls' junior varsity team for two years and was an assistant coach on the boys' varsity team. In 1985, he became the varsity boys’ coach at Clairemont High, where he continued teaching math and also coached tennis.\nLee faced health problems after a failed back surgery in 1998. He died on September 21, 2022, at a hospital in San Diego. He was 70 and suffered from an infection linked to an immune disorder."

        "title": "University Ridge Golf Course",
        "text": "University Ridge Golf Course is a public golf course in the central United States, located in Verona and Madison, Wisconsin. It is the home course to both the men's and women's golf teams for the University of Wisconsin. Also, since 1994, it has been home to both the boys' and girls' WIAA state golf championships for all divisions. Beginning in 2016, Steve Stricker, a Wisconsin native, has hosted an event on the PGA Tour Champions every June at University Ridge. The Thomas Zimmer Championship Cross Country Course is also located on the property.\nHistory.\nUniversity Ridge was designed to be the home course of the men's and women's golf teams for the University of Wisconsin. Southwest of campus, the course was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. and opened in 1991. In 1994, it also became home to both the boys' and girls' WIAA state golf championships for all divisions.\nThrough 2008, the black tees (then the gold tees), measured only . Other than holes 1, 8, 13, and 18, all holes had new tee boxes built for the then gold tees. In many cases when the holes were extended, the blue tees were moved to where the former gold tees were, and the white tees moved to where the blue tees used to stand. In fact, the blue tees used to measure , and the white tees were , while the red tees have remained constant.\nIn 2012, University Ridge began its \"20-Year Tune Up\" project in August. All eighteen greens were burned and resurfaced, which temporarily closed the course, but the practice facility remained open during the project.\nA result of the Tune Up was the addition of a new set of tees; the green tees are set up between the blue and white tees.\nOn June 1, 2015, PGA Tour player and Wisconsin native Steve Stricker announced that he will be hosting the American Family Insurance Championship in 2016, a new event on the PGA Tour Champions, in late June at University Ridge. The first two days were a pro-am event, followed by the 54-hole event on Friday through Sunday, without a cut. Kirk Triplett was the event's inaugural winner in 2016; Fred Couples and Scott McCarron won in 2017 and 2018 respectively.\nGolf course.\nThe front nine is in a more open space with minimal trees, while the back nine is much more forested. Holes 10 through 15 are surrounded by trees, while holes 16 through 18 have trees, but not on all sides.\nCourse tour.\nThe first hole at University Ridge (named Verona) is a par 4 that measures 396 yards from the back tees. A relatively easy opening hole, the tee shot plays from a slightly elevated tee. The green is protected on the right side by a relatively deep bunker.\nThe second hole (named ZigZag) is a risk-reward par 5 playing to 555 yards. A carry over a rocky creek and bunkers leaves players with a great chance of reaching the green in two. The safe play is to the wider part of the fairway, followed by a layup, and then a downhill approach over a depression to a small green, protected by numerous bunkers and a large tree short left.\nThe third hole (Floodplain) is a long, downhill par 3, coming in at 242 yards. This large green is fronted by a deep bunker, leaving for a difficult up and down.\nThe fourth hole (Morse Pond) is one of the most demanding holes at University Ridge. This par 4 that plays 467 yards requires a carryover Morse Pond off of the tee. On the uphill approach to the long narrow green, a collection of deep bunkers short right of the green must be taken into account.\nThe fifth hole (Noer's View) is a par 3 playing to 198 yards. The tee shot on this hole plays over a ravine to a green surrounded by 5 bunkers.\nThe sixth hole (Kettle Pond) is another one of the most demanding holes on the course. This par 5 measures 623 yards from the back tees, making it the longest hole on the golf course. The tee shot plays over Kettle Pond. After laying up, players must avoid a deep bunker short and left of the green. This leaves players with a very difficult up and down. A bunker sits to the right of the green as well.\nThe seventh hole (Drumlin) plays to 429 yards. This par 4 is a dogleg left to an elevated green. On the uphill approach, players must account for 5 bunkers to the right and long of the green.\nThe eighth hole (On the Rocks) is a downhill par 3 that measures 207 yards. The large green is fronted by a rocky creek.\nThe ninth hole (Hedgerow) is an uphill, double dogleg par 5 playing to 587 yards from the back tees. The landing area is protected on the left side by a row of trees and on the right by 3 large bunkers. The fairway then doglegs left, as well as slightly uphill. The hole finally doglegs right. The elevated green has a long bunker left, and a deep bunker right.\nThe front nine plays to from the back tees.\nThe tenth hole (Elm Valley) is a long, difficult par 4. This hole plays to 483 yards from the back tees. Unlike the front nine, the next six holes play through a thick hardwood forest. After a tee shot from the elevated tee, players must negotiate with difficult bunkers on both sides of this long, narrow, two-tiered green.\nThe eleventh hole (Ridgeline) is an uphill par 5. Again, surrounded by trees, this dogleg right measures 569 yards. To the right of the landing area are deep bunkers. The green is surrounded by numerous bunkers, making for an accurate approach.\nThe twelfth hole (Dropshot) is a significantly downhill par 3, playing 200 yards from the back tees. The green is surrounded by 2 bunkers, both of which make for difficult up and downs.\nThe thirteenth hole (Halfpipe) is a short, but uphill, par 4, coming in at only 336 yards. In front of this large green is a large bunker, catching any shot coming in short.\nThe fourteenth hole (Hickory Hill) is a par 4 playing to 398 yards. A collection of bunkers surrounding the green demands an accurate approach.\nThe fifteenth hole (Lone Elm) is another short par 4, this one being 352 yards. On this dogleg right, longer hitters may attempt to cut off the dogleg and try to drive the green. However, a large elm tree between the tee and green will make many players think twice. A number of bunkers around the green require players to hit an accurate, slightly downhill, approach.\nThe sixteenth hole (Bunkered) is another risk-reward par 5. University Ridge's signature hole measures 554 yards from the back tees and begins a great three-hole finishing stretch. Players have two options off of the tee: play it safe down the left fairway or play down a line of trees to the right fairway, in hopes of reaching the green in two. This hole contains a total of 16 bunkers, making for accurate shots from tee to green.\nThe seventeenth hole (Reflections) is an extremely difficult par 3. This hole measures 250 yards from the back tees, the longest par 3 on the course. The tee shot plays over a pond to a narrow green. A bunker right of the green makes for an even more accurate tee shot, leaving nearly no place to put the ball except for the center of the green.\nThe eighteenth hole at University Ridge (Capitol Climb) is an uphill dogleg left par 4. This hole, which measures 440 yards from the back tees, is flanked by trees all along its right side, as well as thick grass to the left. A total of 3 bunkers borders the left side of the landing zone, giving players a difficult tee shot. On the uphill approach to the large green, players must account for a drop off left, as well as a large bunker right. The final three holes at University Ridge provide a great finish to a great round on a championship caliber golf course.\nThe back nine measures from the back tees.\nFrom the back tees, University Ridge measures , with a course rating of 75.8 and a slope rating of 142."

        "text": "During the 1987–88 English football season, Wimbledon F.C. competed in the Football League First Division. It was Wimbledon's second consecutive season in the top flight and eleventh consecutive season in the Football League. They ended the season as FA Cup winners and finished seventh in the league. It was their first season under the management of Bobby Gould, who had been appointed following the resignation of Dave Bassett at the end of the previous season.\nSeason summary.\nWimbledon continued to exceed expectations in the First Division, finishing in seventh in the final table, one place lower than their sixth place the previous season. However, Wimbledon's greatest success during the season, perhaps in their entire history, came in the FA Cup, defeating West Bromwich Albion (4–1, home), Mansfield Town (1-2, away), Newcastle United (1-3, away), Watford (2–1, home) and Luton Town (2-1, neutral) to reach their first ever FA Cup Final, against that season's champions Liverpool. Wimbledon took a lead in the 37th minute when Lawrie Sanchez scored a looping header from Dennis Wise's free kick on the left. Liverpool created many chances, with Peter Beardsley finding the net but his goal being disallowed, but failed to pull a goal back, with Dave Beasant saving a penalty from John Aldridge after Clive Goodyear was (incorrectly) adjudged to have fouled inside the box; Beasant was the first goalkeeper to ever save a penalty in an FA Cup final at Wembley. Wimbledon held on to win their first (and only) FA Cup. Due to the ban on English clubs competing in European competition as a result of the Heysel disaster, Wimbledon were denied the opportunity to compete in the Cup Winners' Cup.\nKit.\nWimbledon's kit was manufactured by Spall and sponsored by Truman.

Bryant was the 2009 West Coast Conference player of the year and an All-American as a senior at Santa Clara University.\nCollege career.\nBryant, a 6'11\" center from Pinole Valley High School in Pinole, California, played for the Santa Clara Broncos from 2005 to 2009. Bryant earned the Broncos starting center spot during his freshman year – averaging 6.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game and earning a spot on the West Coast Conference (WCC) all-freshman team. He followed this up with a solid sophomore campaign, raising his averages to 10.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game.\nBryant raised his game considerably as a junior. Bryant averaged 18 points per game and led the WCC in rebounding (9.6) and blocked shots (2.3). Bryant garnered first team All-WCC honors for the season.\nBryant showed a new dedication to conditioning the offseason before his senior campaign, but his hard work was nearly derailed as he was the victim of a stabbing attack just prior to the start of the 2008–09 season. However, he made a full recovery and had an outstanding senior year. Bryant led the nation in double-doubles and finished a close second to national player of the year Blake Griffin in rebounding nationally (14.2 to Griffin's 14.4). He was again named All-WCC, was the 2009 conference player of the year, and was named an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Bryant was not selected in the 2009 NBA draft. He played his first professional season with the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League (NBDL), where he averaged 13.4 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in 49 games.\nThe next season, Bryant moved to Germany, signing with ratiopharm Ulm of the Basketball Bundesliga. Bryant averaged 14.7 points and 10.9 rebounds in the 2010–11 season. He re-signed with Ulm for the 2011–12 season, and was subsequently named the Most Valuable Player of that season. He was named to the All-EuroCup First Team in 2013.\nIn July 2013, Bryant signed a two-year contract with Bayern Munich. In his first season with the Bavarians he helped the club reach the Top 16 of the EuroLeague and win the German championship.\nOn July 15, 2015, he signed a two-year extension with Bayern. On August 9, 2016, he parted ways with Bayern, and signed a one-year deal with Spanish club Valencia Basket.\nAfter only playing two league games with Valencia, the club rescinded his contract due to his poor performance.\nOn November 23, 2016, he signed a two-month deal with French club AS Monaco Basket. He moved back to Germany for the 2017–18 season, signing with Basketball Bundesliga side Gießen 46ers. After averaging 18.2 points and 10.7 rebounds per game in his first season, Bryant signed a two-year extension with the team on May 17, 2018. Bryant left Gießen at the end of the 2019–20 season. During his three years at the team, he averaged 18.2 points and 10.7 rebounds per contest in Bundesliga play.\nOn November 8, 2020, Bryant signed with Paderborn Baskets of the ProA.\nOn January 11, 2021, he has signed and return to Gießen 46ers of the Basketball Bundesliga.\nOn January 13, 2022, he has signed with Mitteldeutscher BC of the German Basketball Bundesliga."

The game was developed by Camelot, the company that produced most of the previous \"Mario Tennis\" titles. The game was first released on May 20, 2012 in North America and in other regions the same month. It was later released as a downloadable title on the Nintendo eShop in late 2012 and Nintendo Selects in 2015/2016.\nLike the earlier \"Mario Tennis\" titles, \"Mario Tennis Open\" incorporates characters, settings, and scenarios from the \"Mario\" franchise. Players can engage in standard tennis matches but also play special variants with different rules and objectives. Twenty-four distinct playable characters are available, each with special qualities that are used to the players' advantage. \"Mario Tennis Open\" is also the first \"Mario Tennis\" game to feature simultaneous online play, although region locked to the game's region.\n\"Mario Tennis Open\" received mixed to positive reviews, gaining aggregate scores of 69.54% on GameRankings and 69 on Metacritic.\nGameplay.\n\"Mario Tennis Open\" features variants of tennis matches, played either in singles or doubles. Different shots (lobs, slices, and dropshots) can be executed with different button combinations or by selecting them from the Nintendo 3DS touch screen. In addition, the player can use the 3DS gyroscope to turn the in-game camera by rotating the entire console during gameplay. \"Mario Tennis Open\" does not feature any RPG elements, unlike the previous handheld games \"Mario Tennis\" and \"\".\n\"Mario Tennis Open\" features twenty-four playable \"Mario\" characters, with four being unlocked by accomplishing specific tasks, and eight more being unlocked by scanning certain QR codes. Each character possesses a pre-determined skill, such as advantages in speed, offense, or defense. Mii characters saved in the Nintendo 3DS Mii Maker are also selectable. Unlike the \"Mario\" characters, Mii characters' skills vary and are customizable, determined by the tennis gear the player equips. The gear options are purchased using coins that are awarded after playing each game mode. However, costumes are obtained by completing certain objectives.\n\"Mario Tennis Open\" supports both region locked online and local wireless multiplayer, allowing up to four players to play simultaneously on separate Nintendo 3DS consoles. When a player's Nintendo 3DS console comes in contact with another via StreetPass, he will be able to play against a computer-controlled opponent whose play style mimics that of the other player, provided that the other console also contains \"Mario Tennis Open\" save data.\nReception.\n\"Mario Tennis Open\" has received mixed to positive reviews, with aggregate scores of 69.26 percent on GameRankings and 69 on Metacritic. \"Nintendo Power\" scored \"Mario Tennis Open\" 7.0 out of 10 in its May 2012 issue. \"Game Informer\" gave the game an 8 out of 10 while Nintendo World Report gave it a 7.5 out of 10.\nAs of August 12, 2012, the game has sold 280,000 copies in Japan. As of March 31, 2013, the game has worldwide sales of 1.11 million."

Auburn Community Baseball has been the parent organization of the Doubledays since the team's establishment in 1982 as the Auburn Astros. The company also operated predecessor teams in Auburn before the Doubledays, dating back to 1958. Every Auburn professional baseball team that was owned by Auburn Community Baseball including the current team, the Doubledays, have all played in the New York–Penn League.\nAuburn Community Baseball is based at Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park, which is located at 130 North Division Street in Auburn.\nBackground.\nUnlike most professional sports teams which are owned by one or more private individuals and/or companies, Auburn Community Baseball is owned by the City of Auburn, New York. In large part because of the team's rare community-owned status, Auburn was immune to the wave of team relocations that saw many communities lose their affiliated baseball teams during the new-stadium construction boom in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). As a result, Auburn — 2010 population: 27,700 — is one of the smallest communities in the United States with an affiliated minor league baseball team.\nHistory.\nAfter losing its last professional baseball team, the Auburn Falcons of the Border League, in 1951, Auburn went without professional baseball from 1952 to 1957. In the late 1950s, a group of Auburn residents undertook an effort to bring professional baseball back to Auburn. Among this group were Leo Pinckney, Ed Ward, and Dr. Thomas Stapleton. The group collected money by selling stock in the team, sometimes by going door to door.\nIn late 1957, they convinced New York Yankees executive Lee MacPhail to locate a Yankees farm team in Auburn, with games to be played at the original Falcon Park. The Auburn Yankees began play in 1958, which began a long run of New York–Penn League baseball in Auburn that, with the exception of a one-year absence from professional baseball in 1981, has continued almost uninterrupted to the present day.\nTeams.\nAuburn Community Baseball's entry in the New York–Penn League has operated under the following names:\nLeague champions.\nAuburn Community Baseball's entry in the New York–Penn League has won league championships in the following years:\nWall of Fame.\nThe Auburn Community Baseball Wall of Fame was created in 2006.

A State and national representative prop-forward he made thirteen Test appearances and forty-nine additional tour match appearances for the Wallabies, captaining the national side in six Tests matches from 1957-58.\nRugby career.\nDavidson attended Newcastle Technical High School and was school captain as well as rugby XV captain. He attended Sydney Teachers College from 1945–47 and played in the College's rugby team while training to become a science teacher. He joined the Gordon RFC in Sydney in 1947 making first-grade appearances from that year but cementing his place in the top-grade as a front-rower in 1949.\nHis representative debut came for NSW in 1952 when he selected to meet a touring Fijian side. His strong performance saw him elevated to the national side for the two Test series against those same visitors played in Sydney under captain John Solomon. For the next six years Davidson was a regular in the Australian pack. He made the 1952 tour to New Zealand playing in seven of the ten matches including the two Test matches against the All Blacks, the first of which the Wallabies won. He was selected for the 1953 tour to South Africa playing in fifteen games. He made only one Test appearance there of the four played, with selectors opting for Nick Shehadie and Colin Forbes up front.\nIn 1957 he was selected for two domestic Test matches against the visiting All Blacks and then later in the year was honoured with the captaincy of the touring squad for the epic eight month 1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France.\nCaptaincy.\nVersatile back Dick Tooth had made ten Test appearances for Australia before the tour and had captained the Wallabies well in two 1957 Tests against the All Blacks. Howell expresses a view that it was inexplicable that Tooth was not selected for the tour and not named as captain and partially blames this for the disappointing tour result. However Howell also writes that Davidson possessed outstanding qualities to make him a natural touring captain. He was a born leader of men, was immensely popular, he met people well, was highly intelligent and spoke well in public. He played in thirty-two of the forty-one tour games and did everything in his power to make the tour a success. The Wallabies won twenty-two, lost sixteen and drew three of the matches played. They lost all five Tests of the tour under Davidson's captaincy.\nOn his return to Australia Davidson captained both New South Wales and the Wallabies matches in 1958 against the New Zealand Māori rugby union team before retiring at the end of that year.\nOn the club front he captained the Gordon RFC to Shute Shield first-grade premierships in 1952, 1956 and 1958. He was the coach of the club from 1956 till 1961 and was Club President for a period from 1964.\nHe was Sports Master at North Sydney Technical High School from c1958 to (unknown)."

He previously played safety and quarterback for the Purdue Boilermakers.\nHenry attended Trinity Catholic High School in Ocala, Florida, where he played both football and baseball, and competed in track &amp; field. Henry led Trinity Catholic to two conference championships and a runner-up in the 2B State Championship game. He ended his high school football career with over 4,300 total yards and 39 touchdowns. After his senior season, he moved on to Purdue University where he redshirted in 2009.\nIn his first collegiate appearance, Henry ran for 16-yards against Notre Dame.

In the final game of the season against Indiana he had a career-high 252 yard passing and 3 touchdown passes. He became the first Purdue quarterback to lead the Boilermakers in both passing and rushing yardage in the same season, with 996 passing yards and 547 yards rushing.\nAfter a starting quarterback battle in the off season, Henry was named the Boilermakers' starting quarterback for the 2011 season and was voted co-captain, but he tore the ACL in his right knee. With backup Marve still recovering from his owen ACL injury, Caleb TerBush took over as the starting quarterback in their place.\nHenry returned in 2012, and was named the third-string quarterback behind TerBush and Marve. To get on the field, the Boilermakers used Henry as both a running back and wide receiver, in addition to quarterbacking.\nHenry was named the starting quarterback for the Boilermakers during 2013 fall camp. Henry beat out true freshman, Danny Etling, and redshirt freshman, Austin Appleby. Henry started the first 5 games of the season for the Boilermakers, before being replaced just before halftime during their 5 game of the season by Etling. The week following Henry's removal from quarterback, he was moved to safety.\nHigh school career.\nHenry went to Trinity Catholic High School in Ocala, Florida. There he was coached by John Brantley, and was a Mr. Football finalist and first team all-state after passing for 2,600 yards and 24 touchdowns as senior, while rushing for 350 yards and six touchdowns.

It wasn't clear if he would start as a junior, but he won the battle, and went on to pass for 1,100 yards and 10 touchdowns while also rushing for 250 yards and five scores, while missing some time with a knee injury.\nHe was a two-time all-county selection in football, and led his team to state finals his senior season. As a freshman and sophomore, he played free safety and wide receiver, while John Brantley was at quarterback. He was a first team all-division his freshman and sophomore seasons.

However, Hope said that Henry would see playing time even if the game was still undecided. Against Notre Dame, Henry only got three carries for 16 yards. After a win against Minnesota, he was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Week. He was named the team's Leonard Wilson Award winner (unselfishness and dedication). He was also the first Purdue quarterback in school history to lead the team in both rushing and passing yardage in a season. He completed 86 of 162 pass attempts (53.1 percent) for 996 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, while rushing for 547 yards and four touchdowns on 104 attempts (5.3 yards per carry). For the season, Henry appeared in 11 games, making seven starts in 2010.\n2011 season.\nAfter a starting quarterback battle in the off season, Henry was named the Boilermakers' starting quarterback for the 2011 season, but he tore the ACL in his right knee. With backup Marve still recovering from his own ACL injury, Caleb TerBush took over as the starting quarterback in their place.\n2012 season.\nHenry entered his junior season looking at splitting playing time with TerBush and Marve. With TerBush working mostly with the first team, he was expected to start the first game of the year, until it was announced (one hour prior to gametime) that he had been suspended and Marve was the starting quarterback. Henry was promoted to second string, seeing most of his action in the second half of play. Henry finished the day 7 for 9 passing for 1 touchdown and 1 interception. After not playing in the Notre Dame game, Henry was named the backup against Eastern Michigan, as Marve was sidelined with his third ACL tear. Henry played a few plays in the second quarter, before seeing increased playing time in the 3rd quarter due to the Boilermakers large lead. Most of his plays came throwing the ball, as Coach Hope felt that was his largest area in need of improvement.\n2013 season.\nWith Marve and TerBush out of the mix due to graduation, and new Purdue head coach Darrell Hazell, Henry entered fall camp with the Boilermakers competing with freshmen Danny Etling and Austin Appleby for Purdue's starting quarterback spot. Two weeks before the regular season opener at Cincinnati, Hazell named Henry Purdue's starting quarterback.\nStatistics.\nAs of the end of the 2013 regular season, Henry's statistics are as follows:\nHenry had a 3–9 career record as the starting quarterback for Purdue.\nProfessional career.\nPrior to the 2014 NFL Draft, Henry was projected to be undrafted by NFLDraftScout.com. He was rated as the thirty-fourth-best quarterback in the draft.\nOn May 10, 2014, Henry signed as an undrafted free agent with the Oakland Raiders.\nPlaying style.\nHenry is a dual-threat quarterback, known more for his ability to run the ball, than for his throwing arm."

        "text": "East Timor competed in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea, from September 29 to October 14, 2002. East Timor was the newest Asian country—it declared its independence four months before the Games on May 20, 2002—and participated in the Asian Games for the first time after the independence from Indonesia. Indonesia invaded the nation on December 7, 1975, and left in October 19, 1999 after the UN-supervised referendum.\nEast Timor sent a delegation of 15 competitors and 17 officials. The delegation included only one woman athlete, Mariana Diaz Ximenez, who participated in the marathon. The East Timorese delegation was one of the smallest among the participating nations and territories, only Laos had fewer athletes (13) than East Timor. East Timor was one of the five National Olympic Committees that won no medals at the Games.\nDelegation.\nThe delegation of East Timor for the 2002 Asian Games consisted 15 athletes and 17 officials. João Viegas Carrascalão accompanied the delegation as East Timor's Asian Games chef de mission. \nAthletics.\nThe sole woman athlete to represent the nation was Mariana Diaz Ximenez, who participated in the marathon. Ximenez finished ninth of the 11 women participants, in this event in which two athletes did not finish the race. The personal best of Ximenez before the event was 2:34:08, but she achieved a time of 3:22:03. \nXavier do Rego participated for East Timor in the marathon and finished 14th out of 15 athletes, with one athlete not finishing the race.\nBoxing.\nEast Timor's boxing squad for the Games included two boxers Felix Barreto and Victor Ramos, competing in the flyweight and lightweight classes respectively. Both failed to earn a single point in their respective bouts, and were eliminated in the first round of the event.\nCycling.\nJorge Pereira was the only cyclist from the East Timor to compete. He participated in the four different cycling events– road race, individual time trial, 1 km time trial and individual pursuit. Individual time trial (48.4 km) was the only event in which Pereira completed the race, with a 15th position.\nKarate.\nEast Timor entered two karateka—Antonio de Araújo and Filomeno Soares—into the karate competition in Busan. De Araújo got a bye in the 1st preliminary round and lost to Hussain Al-Qattan of Kuwait in the quarterfinals, without gaining a single point. Soares eliminated in the first round after losing to Farman Ahmed of Pakistan. \nTable tennis.\nAntonio Sales was the sole representative of East Timor in table tennis. Sales lost to Ko Lai Chak in round 32 without winning a single game. \nTaekwondo.\nGil Fernandes competed for East Timor in the −67 kg weight class. He got bye in the first round and lost the pre-quarterfinal match to Pavel Yugay of Uzbekistan after the referee stopped the contest (RSC). \nTennis.\nTwo competitors—Antonio Mendes and Matias de Souza—competed for the East Timor in two tennis events in the Geumjeong Tennis Stadium. Mendes lost his first match to Sergei Makashin of Tajikistan, while De Souza reached the second round but lost to Rohan Bopanna of India.\nWeightlifting.\nMartinho de Araújo was the sole competitor for East Timor in weightlifting, competing in the bantamweight class. De Araújo was the first East Timorese at the Olympics, he represented East Timor in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the same weight class. In the 2002 Asian Games, his highest successfully lifted weight in snatch was 67.5 kg, out of 65 and 67.5 kg, and in clean and jerk his best was 90 kg, he also tried two failed attempts for 95 and 100 kg. De Araújo finished in 13th place in the final standings with a total of 157.5 kg, least among all the ranked weightlifters."

South Africa made a triumphant return to international cricket with a win over Australia at the SCG in their first match. They and England had solid campaigns and easily qualified for the semis, despite upset losses to Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe respectively. India had a disappointing tournament and never looked likely to progress beyond the round robin. Sri Lanka were still establishing themselves at the highest level and beat only Zimbabwe (who did not yet have Test status) and South Africa. New Zealand were defeated only twice in the tournament, both times by Pakistan, in their final group match and in the semi-final. Pakistan had been lucky to be in the semi-finals at all: following only one victory in their first five matches, they were also fortunate to scrape a point from the washed-out match against England which appeared to be heading for a heavy English victory (Pak 74 all out, Eng 24/1): eventually they finished one point ahead of Australia with an inferior run-rate.\nAustralia vs South Africa.\nThis is South Africa first World Cup win"

It was built in 1988, with the clubhouse and facilities designed and delivered by Dubai architect BSBG (Brewer Smith Brewer Group), and, is the first grass golf course in the Middle East.\nHistory.\nThe idea of a completely grassed championship golf course in Dubai was brought about by American businessman Larry Trenary and, British businessman George Atkinson, both living in Dubai on a full-time basis. The actual golf course design was provided by Trenary's friend, the American architect Karl Litten, based in Boca Raton, Florida. Litten's first visit to Dubai was to evaluate and design a course for the property surrounding the Jebel Ali Beach Hotel, located to the south of Dubai. The hotel owner, Ahmed Baker was keen to develop the project but he needed permission from the then Ruler of Dubai, HHS Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who appeared to be in favor of the project going forward. Sheikh Rashid fell ill and was never able to give his legal support for the specific use of the land. With Sheikh Rashid's passing, the idea for a championship golf course in the Middle East was still just a dream. A few years later the project, along with another Litten design, which was much closer to the city, was presented to Sheikh Rashid's third son, HHS Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, by Steven Trutch, construction engineer to Sheikh Mohammed. During a hunting trip to Pakistan, Sheikh Mohammed discussed the idea of a grass golf course with his host, President Zia-ul-Haq, who was a keen golfer. President Zia told him it would be a good idea, making Dubai a center for the oil companies and other large companies with operations in the Middle East. Eventually Sheikh Mohammed, in order to get final approval, took the idea to his older brother, the new Ruler of Dubai, HHS Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Sheikh Maktoum gave his consent and Sheikh Mohammed immediately designated approximately of sand dunes for the proposed golf course, clubhouse, majlis and maintenance area set just a few miles out of the city center.\nThe golf course complex was finished and, open for business in 1988. President Zia attended the opening and, was presented with a solid golf tee and a golf club with a gold shaft in order for him to hit the very first ball, for the club's opening, in front of a large crowd. The drive traveled about down the middle of the driving range. The opening was one of the last personal appearances President Zia made, as he was assassinated that same year when his plane exploded on takeoff in Pakistan.\nEvents.\nThe Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event with a 3 million purse is an annual event played at by the club. The Omega Dubai Ladies Classic, a Ladies European Tour event, is also played at the club. The first Dubai Desert Classic event took place in 1989.\nLucas Herbert from Australia wins the final of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic at Emirates Golf Club on January 26, 2020. "

The Houston Astros, with the first overall pick, selected Carlos Correa from the Puerto Rico Baseball Academy and High School.\nDraft order.\nThe draft order was determined by the 2011 Major League Baseball season standings. With the worst record in 2011, the Houston Astros received the first pick.\nAlso, teams can lose draft picks for signing certain free agents, while teams losing free agents will receive draft picks as compensation. The Elias Sports Bureau ranks all players based on performance over the past two seasons, with the top 20% being considered \"Type A\" and the next 20% considered \"Type B\". If a team offers a Type A free agent arbitration and he signs with another club, the player's former team obtains the new team's first- or second-round pick, depending on whether the new team is in the top 15 or bottom 15 in won-loss records in 2011, as well as a supplemental pick after the first round. If a team offers a Type B free agent arbitration and he signs with another club, the former team gets a supplemental pick after the first round.\nThe new Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLB and the MLBPA announced on November 22, modified the compensation required for certain Type A players. Six Type A players became modified Type A free agents, meaning a team signing one of them was not required to forfeit a draft pick, but the team losing them will receive a draft pick in the slot immediately before the pick they would have received had the player actually had Type A status. Five further Type A players became modified Type B free agents, with compensation equivalent to other Type B free agents."

The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\").

The Spartans' head coach was Tom Izzo, who was in his 17th year at Michigan State. The team played its home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan, and were members of the Big Ten Conference. MSU finished with a record of 29–8, 13–5 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for first place. The Spartans also won the Big Ten tournament.

MSU started the season unranked and suffered a loss to No. 1 North Carolina in the Carrier Classic which was played on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in San Diego in the first game of the season. The teams wore special camouflage uniforms for the event. MSU followed that loss with a loss to No. 6 Duke in the Champions Classic. Starting the season 0–2, the Spartans refused to fold. MSU won the next 15 games in a row to jump into the top ten in the polls. The wins in the streak included a win at No. 23 Gonzaga. The Spartans finished the non-conference schedule at 11–2 and ranked No. 16 in the country.\nThe winning streak continued in Big Ten play with wins over No. 13 Indiana, and at No. 11 Wisconsin. MSU also beat No. 23 Michigan, No. 3 Ohio State, and No. 15 Wisconsin at Breslin Center. A loss in the regular season finale at home to No. 10 Ohio State meant the Spartans would share the Big Ten regular season championship with Ohio State and Michigan, all of which finished the Big Ten season with a 13–5 conference record. In that loss to Ohio State, key freshman reserve, Branden Dawson, tore his ACL, ending his season. The Spartans finished the season ranked No. 8 in the country. The Spartans, due to tiebreak rules, were the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament and beat Iowa, No. 14 Wisconsin, and No. 7 Ohio State to win the tournament championship. Draymond Green earned Big Ten Player of the Year honors, the fifth time a player had done so under Tom Izzo. Izzo was also named Big Ten Coach of the Year.\nMSU received a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, where they beat LIU–Brooklyn in the first round behind Green's triple-double.

        "text": "The 2012 Vuelta a España started on 18 August 2012 and was the 67th edition of the race. The race began in Pamplona with a team time trial and ended on 9 September, as traditional, in Madrid. The 2012 edition saw the return of the Bola del Mundo mountain top finish. It was the venue of an exciting battle between winner Vincenzo Nibali and runner-up Ezequiel Mosquera in the 2010 edition. It was the first time since 1994 that the race visited the region of Navarre. The previous time that Pamplona was visited by a Grand Tour in 1996, when the city hosted the finish of a memorable stage of the 1996 Tour de France. On that occasion, the race paid homage to Miguel Indurain by passing through his home village of Villava en route.\nThe race was won for the second time by Alberto Contador of , taking his first overall victory since returning from a doping suspension. Contador, who won the seventeenth stage of the race after a solo attack, won the general classification by 1' 16\" over runner-up Alejandro Valverde of the team. Two-time stage winner Valverde also won two sub-classifications on the final day; by taking a sixth-place finish on the stage into Madrid, he overhauled the points tally of Joaquim Rodríguez () in that classification, and their resultant switch of positions, allowed Valverde to take the combination classification – where the lowest cumulative score across the general, points and mountains classifications wins – as well.\nCompleting an all-Spanish podium, Rodríguez finished the race third overall, 21 seconds behind Valverde and 1' 37\" behind Contador, having led the race for 13 days between the fourth and sixteenth stages. Rodríguez also achieved three stage victories, a tally second only to sprinter John Degenkolb who won five stages, the most by a German at the Vuelta. 's Simon Clarke became the second Australian to win the mountains classification in a Grand Tour, while the comfortably won the teams classification.\nTeams.\nThe 18 UCI ProTour teams were automatically entitled to start the race and were joined by four teams that received a wildcard in April 2012.\nThe 18 ProTour teams:\nTeams receiving a wildcard:\nFor more details, see List of teams and cyclists in the 2012 Vuelta a España.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the 2008 edition of the race, Alberto Contador, made his first Grand Tour appearance since his ban after testing positive for a banned substance at the 2010 Tour de France, and was considered by many the top favourite for overall victory. Another favourite was Chris Froome, who had at the time finished second in the 2011 Vuelta and 2012 Tour de France, and he started the 2012 Vuelta as team leader of , having previously worked for Bradley Wiggins. The then winner of the 2011 edition, Juan José Cobo, was looking to replicate his previous year's form after a disappointing 2012 season, and he was co-leader of the alongside Alejandro Valverde.\nOther contenders for the podium included Joaquim Rodríguez of , who finished second in the 2012 Giro d'Italia, Igor Antón of , Jurgen Van den Broeck of , Damiano Cunego of and Robert Gesink of .\nRiders who could have made the top ten included Froome's Colombian teammates at , Rigoberto Urán and Sergio Henao, 's Bauke Mollema, 's Maxime Monfort, 's Thomas De Gendt and 's Nicolas Roche.\nRace overview.\nFor details see 2012 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2012 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21\nClassification leadership table.\nThere were four main classifications contested in the 2012 Vuelta a España, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the red jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Vuelta. In 2012, there were time bonuses given on mass-start stages; twelve seconds were awarded to the stage winner, with eight for second and four for third.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. The organisation categorised some climbs as either hors catégorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a blue polka dot jersey.\nThe fourth individual classification was the combination classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points and mountains classifications – a rider must have a score in all classifications possible to qualify for the combination classification – with the lowest cumulative total signifying the winner of this competition.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. For the combativity award, a jury gives points after each stage to the cyclists they considered most combative. The cyclist with the most votes in all stages leads the classification. For the daily combative winner, the rider in question donned a dossard with a red background, on the following stage."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle",
        "text": "In baseball, completing the cycle is the accomplishment of hitting a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game. In terms of frequency, the cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter; \"Baseball Digest\" calls it \"one of the rarest feats in baseball\". Collecting the hits in the listed order is known as a \"natural cycle\".\nThe cycle itself is semi-rare in Major League Baseball (MLB), having occurred a total of 344 times, starting with Curry Foley in 1882, through José Altuve on August 28, 2023. A natural cycle has been completed 14 times in modern MLB history, most recently by Gary Matthews Jr. of the Texas Rangers in 2006.\nNotable accomplishments.\nThe most cycles hit by a single player in MLB is three, accomplished by six players; John Reilly was the first to hit a third when he completed the cycle on August 6, 1890, after hitting his first two in a week (September 12 and 19, 1883) for the Cincinnati Reds. Bob Meusel became the second man to complete three cycles, playing for the New York Yankees; his first occurred on May 7, 1921, the next on July 3, 1922, and his final cycle on July 26, 1928. Babe Herman accomplished the feat for two different teams—the Brooklyn Robins (May 18 and July 24, 1931) and the Chicago Cubs (September 30, 1933). Adrián Beltré cycled first for the Seattle Mariners (September 1, 2008) before cycling twice as a member of the Texas Rangers (August 24, 2012 and August 3, 2015). Beltré is the only player to have completed all three cycles in the same ballpark, with the first occurring as an opponent of the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Trea Turner hit his third career cycle on June 30, 2021, against the Tampa Bay Rays; his first two cycles were hit against the Colorado Rockies. Christian Yelich hit his third cycle on May 11, 2022, against the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first player to have all three cycles come against one team.\nThe most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight, which has occurred twice: first in the 1933 season, and then again in the 2009 season; all eight cycles in each of those seasons were hit by different players. Cycles have occurred on the same day twice in MLB history: on September 17, 1920, hit by Bobby Veach of the Detroit Tigers and George Burns of the New York Giants; and again on September 1, 2008, when the Arizona Diamondbacks' Stephen Drew and the Seattle Mariners' Adrián Beltré each completed the four-hit group. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was five years, one month, and ten days, a drought lasting from Bill Joyce cycle in 1896 to Harry Davis in 1901. Three players—John Olerud, Bob Watson and Michael Cuddyer—have hit for the cycle in both the National and American Leagues. Three family pairs have hit for the cycle: father and son Gary and Daryle Ward, who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004, respectively; grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell, in 1951 and 2004; and father and son Craig and Cavan Biggio, in 2002 and 2019.\nMel Ott and Dave Winfield are the youngest and oldest players to hit for the cycle, at ages 20 and 39, respectively. Of multiple-cycle hitters, John Reilly holds the record for the shortest time between cycles (seven days), while Aaron Hill holds the record since the formation of the American League, with his two 2012 feats coming within an 11-day span. Conversely, George Brett's two cycles came 11 years and 58 days apart. Christian Yelich is the only player to hit for the cycle twice in one season against the same team, doing so 20 days apart against the Cincinnati Reds in 2018. On October 8, 2018, Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox hit for the cycle against the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series; it was the first cycle in MLB postseason history. In a regular-season game on September 19, 2021, Eddie Rosario of the Atlanta Braves collected his cycle on just five pitches, the smallest number since at least 1900.\nCycles by franchise.\nBold text indicates the current name of an active MLB franchise; normal text indicates prior team names or defunct franchises. Teams are listed only as major league squads; minor league teams promoted into MLB do not have minor league names or tenures listed. Table sorting is by larger number of cycles hit by each franchise, and then if tied, by smaller number of cycles allowed."

Each club played a differing number of fixtures, depending upon the closeness of neighbours, ease of travel etc., with York playing only 11 and Barrow 13 while Salford played 35 and Dewsbury 36.\nSeason summary.\nAlthough the war was starting its second year, the Rugby League decided to introduce a Wartime Emergency League. This arrangement, as in other sports, meant that the sport could continue, which in turn would boost the public’s moral. The fixtures were usually quite local, thus cutting down on travelling time and costs, whilst not wasting precious war resources.\nSeveral clubs did not participate during this season :-\nThree new clubs joined the league for this season :-\nDewsbury and Leeds finished the regular season joint top of the league, based on the % system, both having obtained an 83.33% success, but Dewsbury took the title due to them having gained an extra 5 points (from the 3 extra games played).\nThere were no other trophies to play for during this season.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the duration of the war.\nThe majority of the trophies, such as the County Leagues and County Cups were also suspended for the duration of the First World War.\nNotes and Comments.\n1 - A new team St Helens Recs who would continue in the League until 1939\n2 - A new team, Featherstone Rovers joined the league for this season only\n3 - A newly reformed Brighouse Rangers also joined for this season"

Each club played a differing number of fixtures, depending upon the closeness of neighbours, ease of travel etc., with Brighouse Rangers and Barrow playing 17 games each while Broughton Rangers played 35 and several other clubs 32.\nSeason summary.\nThe war was starting its third year and the Rugby League decided to continue with the Wartime Emergency League. This arrangement, as in other sports, meant that the sport could continue, which in turn would boost the public’s moral. The fixtures were usually quite local, thus cutting down on travelling time and costs, whilst not wasting precious war resources.\nSeveral clubs did not participate during this season :-\nSeveral of the clubs who had not participated in the competition in the previous season, now re-joined the League :-\nNo new clubs joined the league for this season.\nDewsbury (81.25%) again finished the regular season top of the league, with Leeds (80.65%) again second.\nDewsbury had played one game more, winning this and gaining two points more than Leeds, thus ending the season with a better win percentage.\nDewsbury again took the title.\nThere were no other trophies to play for during this season.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the duration of the war.\nThe majority of the trophies, such as the County Leagues and County Cups were also suspended for the duration of the First World War.\nNotes and Comments.\n1 - re-joined the League\nSee also.\nBritish rugby league system\n1915–16 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1917–18 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1918–1919 (January) Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1919 (Feb-May) Northern Rugby Football Union Victory season\nThe Great Schism – Rugby League View\nThe Great Schism – Rugby Union View\nList of defunct rugby league clubs"

Although they were from Cheshire, they, like several other Cheshire clubs and some Cumberland clubs, participated in the Lancashire Competitions.\nHistory.\nThey joined the ranks of the semi-professionals when they became members of the Northern Union for the 1901–02 season finishing in 12th position out of 13 clubs (with an unenviable record of only one win and one draw).\nAt the end of the 1901–02 season, the County Leagues elected 18 teams to join the new Division 2 (7 from Lancashire and 10 from Yorkshire and new member South Shields) with the existing second competition scrapped.\nAltrincham were one of the 4 Yorkshire (Goole, Heckmondwike, Liversedge and Sowerby Bridge) and 2 Lancashire clubs (the other being Radcliffe) not elected to the new Division 2, but it is unknown as to which route the club followed.\nClub League Record.\nIn the single season in which Altrincham played semi-professional rugby league, 1901–02, there are few records readily available. \nSome of the achievements are as follows:-\nHeading Abbreviations\nRL = Single division; Pl = Games played; W = Win; D = Draw; L = Lose; PF = Points for; PA = Points against; Diff = Points difference (+ or -); Pts = League points\n% Pts = A percentage system was used to determine league positions due to clubs playing varying number of fixtures and against different opponents \nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nSeveral fixtures &amp; results.\nThe following are just a few of Altrincham's fixtures during the sole season in which they played semi-professional rugby league \nNotes and Comments.\n1 - Folly Fields is the stadium used by Wigan at the time until 1901. They then became sub-tenants of Springfield Park See below - Note 2. \n2 - Wigan became sub-tenants of Springfield Park, which they shared with Wigan United AFC, playing their first game there on 14 September 1901 at which a crowd of 4,000 saw them beat Morecambe 12–0, and the last game on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. A temporary ground was necessary to span the period between moving from Folly Fields and the new ground at Central Park being constructed.\n3 - Lowerhouse Lane is the original site of the current ground used by Widnes. It was renamed Naughton Park in 1932 in honour of club secretary, Tom Naughton - and later renamed Halton Stadium after being completely rebuilt in 1997."

In 1893 Goole caused one of the biggest shocks in Rugby history when they knocked Leeds out of the Yorkshire Cup in the second round by 15 points to 2. Leeds had been finalists in T'Owd Tin Pot in the previous year and had their best team out against Goole. \nIn January 1898 Goole RUFC were ordered by the governing body of rugby union, the RFU, not to play a charity rugby match against a touring Little Red Riding Hood pantomime troupe; this was deemed to be an act of professionalism because earlier on its tour the troupe had played in a charity match with Batley, members of the Northern Union. Very shortly after that Goole RUFC changed code and joined the Northern Union. \nThe same year together with Eastmoor, Featherstone, Hull Kingston Rovers, Kinsley, Normanton, Outwood Parish Church, Ripon, Rothwell, and York, were among the founders of the Yorkshire Second Competition (Eastern Section).\nAfter two seasons in the Yorkshire Second Competition the club was elected into the Yorkshire Senior Competition for the 1901–02 season. Finishing third from bottom of the Yorkshire Senior Competition the club failed to be elected to the new Northern Rugby League Second Division. At the club's annual general meeting in August the members voted to disband the club as it would be too costly to continue as a professional team and raising an amateur team would be difficult, the resignation from the Northern Union being accepted on 28 August 1902.\nThroughout its history the club played at the Victoria Pleasure Grounds on Carter Street.\nSuccessor clubs.\nAn amateur team from the town played in the 1936–37 Challenge Cup losing 14–2 at home to Broughton Rangers. This team disbanded in 1938.\nOn 10 November 2018 a committee was formed at the Victoria Pleasure Grounds and rugby league was again brought back to go with the formation of a new team, The Goole Vikings Amateur Rugby League Football Club, who keet the historic nickname from the early 1900s \"The Seaporters\"\nThe Vikings play in the Yorkshire Men's League governed by York &amp; District Rugby League.

        "title": "Laws of rugby union",
        "text": "The laws of Rugby Union are defined by World Rugby (originally the International Rugby Football Board, and later International Rugby Board) and dictate how the game should be played. They are enforced by a referee, generally with the help of two assistant referees.\nWhen playing a game of Rugby Union the overall objective is to score more points than the opposition through tries and goals. A try worth five points is scored when a team grounds the ball in the opposition's in-goal. A conversion (kick at a goal) is then attempted by either place- or drop-kicking the ball between the H-shaped goal posts and above the crossbar. If successful this is worth two extra points.\nPenalties are awarded for major infringements such as offside or foul play and the team that is awarded them can choose to take a shot at goal in an attempt to score three points. They can also use the penalty to kick for territory or tap the ball and continue running it. Three points are awarded if a team member drop kicks a goal during general play.\nThe game of Rugby evolved at Rugby School from early folk football, with the rules of play being agreed upon before the start of each match. Some Rugby clubs were also early members of The Football Association, leaving after they left out rules for \"running with the ball\" and \"hacking\" when framing their code in 1863. The rugby laws were standardised in 1870 and the International Rugby Football Board (now World Rugby) was formed in 1886. In 1930 the IRFB was made responsible for developing any new laws. These laws have changed over time. The point value for scoring tries has increased from zero to five, penalties were initially worth just two points and drop goals four. The ball has changed too, going from a pig's bladder to a rubber bladder in first a leather and nowadays, a plastic case, and becoming more oval in shape. Player numbers were initially 20 each side, but reduced to 15 in 1877. The laws are always being tweaked in to early twenty-first century, with some of the biggest changes being introduced in 2009.\nThe game is usually played on a grass field approximately by . At each end of the field are the goal posts and an in-goal area. Games last for eighty minutes and are divided into two forty-minute halves. Each team defends one end and attempts to score points through tries and goals. One team kicks the ball towards the opposition starting play. At half time they swap ends, with the other team kicking off. After a successful kick-off the ball is in general play and can be passed, kicked, caught, picked up or grounded by any player. The ball can be kicked in any direction, but must be passed backwards. Players attempt to stop the opposition running the ball by tackling them. Rucks form when at least one player from each team is on their feet and the ball is on the ground. Mauls are formed when the ball carrier is held by at least one of the opposition and a teammate is also bound to them. Players can compete for the ball at tackles, rucks and mauls in accordance with the laws.\nScrums are used to start play after minor infringements (knock-ons and forward passes) and when the ball becomes unplayable. All eight members of the forwards must be involved in the scrum provided the team still has all fifteen players present. Players involved in the scrum stay bound to each other and the opposition until it is finished and the rest, except the scrum-half, must be positioned at least five metres back. The two teams push against each other and the hookers strike for the ball once the scrum half puts the ball into the \"tunnel\" (gap between the two front rows). The scrum half must put the ball straight down the centre of the tunnel, if the scrum half deliberately puts the ball in at an angle to his second rows feet, (feeding the ball), the opposition are awarded the 'put in'.\nLineouts are used to restart play when the ball has crossed the sidelines. Players form two parallel lines perpendicular to the sideline and the team that did not put the ball out throws it straight down the middle. Players in the line-out can be lifted by teammates as they attempt to win the ball.\nHistory.\nThe early rules of football were determined by pupils before the game, with the legality of carrying or running with the ball often agreed shortly before commencement. The first set of written rules were published by pupils at Rugby School in 1845 and while a number of other clubs based their games on these rules there were still many variations played. The Football Association intended to frame a universal code of laws in 1863, but several newspapers published the 1848 Cambridge rules before they were finalised. The Cambridge rules included rules for \"running with the ball\" and \"hacking\" (kicking an opponent in the shins) which were not part of the Football Association draft. They decided not to include those rules in their release, causing a number of rugby clubs to break away from the Football Association.\nThe rules for playing rugby still differed between clubs, so in 1870 twenty one clubs formed the England-based Rugby Football Union (RFU) and standardised the laws of the game. As the game spread internationally disagreements arose over interpretations of the laws. Scotland, Ireland and Wales formed the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) in 1886, with the RFU joining in 1890. The IRFB oversaw games between the four nations and in 1930 was made responsible for developing any new laws.\nThe balance in value between tries and conversions has changed greatly over the years. Historically, no points at all were awarded for a try, the reward being to \"try\" to score a goal (to kick the ball over the cross bar and between the posts). Scoring points from tries was not introduced until the late 1880s. Until 1891, a try scored one point and a conversion two. For the next two years tries scored two points and conversions three, until in 1893 when three points were awarded for a try and two for a kick. The number of points from a try increased to four in 1971 and five in 1992. In 1891 penalties were increased from two to three points, while drop goals were awarded four points (drop goals were subsequently reduced to three points in 1948). Before 1905 it was possible to score by kicking the ball through the posts from the ground in open play and in 1977 it was also possible to score three points by kicking a goal after taking a mark before both methods were banned in their respective years.\nThe defence was originally allowed to attempt to charge down a conversion kick from the moment the ball was placed on the ground, generally making it impossible for the kicker to place the ball himself and make any kind of a run-up. In 1958, the law governing conversions changed to allow the kicker to place the ball, prohibiting the defence from advancing toward the kicker until he begins his run-up.\nThe ball used until the 1860s was leather around a pigs bladder and it was almost spherical. In 1862 rubber bladders were introduced and balls began to be manufactured with a more pronounced oval shape. In 1892 the RFU developed compulsory dimensions for the ball in the Laws of the Game for the first time. In the 1980s leather-encased balls, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. In 1877 the number of players was reduced from 20 to 15 a side.\nThe IRB trialled 23 changes to the modern laws in 2006 and some competitions in Scotland and Australia adopted them in 2007. In 2008, 13 of the variations were trialled globally. Important changes included; no gain in ground if the ball is kicked directly into touch after it has been moved back into the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker, the offside lines for backs moved five metres from the scrum, allowing mauls to be legally pulled down and players to enter with their head lower than their hips, no restrictions on the number of players in a line-out, and allowing pregripping and lifting. In 2009 the IRB approved 10 of the laws, rejecting the laws relating to mauls, and numbers in a line-out.\nMore recently, New Zealand Rugby, in co-operation with World Rugby, is set to trial several significant changes in the 2016 Mitre 10 Cup:\nObjective.\nRugby union is a contact sport that consists of two teams of fifteen players. The objective is to obtain more points than the opposition through scoring tries or kicking goals over 80 minutes of playing time, divided into two 40-minute halves.\nPlay is started with one team drop kicking the ball from the halfway line towards the opposition. The rugby ball can be moved up the field by either carrying it or kicking it. However, when passing the ball it can not be thrown forward. The opposition can stop players moving up the field by tackling them. Only players carrying the ball can be tackled and once a tackle is completed the opposition can compete for the ball.\nPlay stops when a try is scored, the ball crosses the side line or dead ball line, or an infringement occurs. After a team scores points, the other team restarts the game at the halfway with a drop kick towards the opposition. The team with the most points at the end wins the game.\nField and equipment.\nRugby union is played on a field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws permit the use of artificial grass, clay, sand or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. The Laws do not say that the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must be safe to play on. If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.\nThe playing area consists of a \"field-of-play\", not exceeding in width and in length, and \"in-goal\" areas at each end of the field-of-play which should extend not more than but, \"where practicable\", at least beyond the field-of-play. Solid lines are painted on to the field to mark the sides of the pitch (touch-lines), the rear of the in-goal areas (dead-ball lines), the sides of the in-goal areas (touch-in-goal lines), the goal-lines (also called the try line), lines from each goal-line, and the half-way line. Broken lines are painted parallel to the half-way line and from it, in each half of the field, and parallel to the touch-lines and and infield from touch on each side of the field-of-play. Dash lines are also marked from (and parallel to) the goal-lines. In rugby union the edge of all lines nearest the centre of the field marks the actual boundary. Thus, touch-lines themselves are out of play, and a player standing on (or over) any part of the touch-line is regarded as being \"in touch\". Equally, if the ball is grounded on any part of the goal line it is regarded as having been grounded in goal (and a try is scored if grounded by an attacking player); and a ball that makes contact with the touch-line or dead-ball line is \"dead\".\nThere is a goal at each end of the field-of-play, positioned centrally on the goal-line, and consisting of a pair of vertical posts, each a minimum of high, placed apart and connected by a horizontal bar above the ground—giving each goal the shape of the letter 'H'. For the safety of the players, the lower portion of each goal post is usually encased in protective padding.\nFlag posts, at least high, are positioned at the four corners of the field-of-play and at the corners of each in-goal area. These flags are not considered part of the touch-in-goal. If the ball or a player carrying the ball touches them the ball is not out of play unless it is grounded against a flag post. There are a further six flag posts positioned outside the field-of-play and in line with the 22-metre and half-way lines on each side of the pitch. All flag posts play no part in the game and are there solely for indicative purposes.\nOfficials.\nGames are officiated by one referee who usually has two assistants, one on each side of the field. The referee is responsible for ensuring the game is played according to the laws, keeping the time and recording the score. Prior to the start of the match, the referee organises the team captains for a coin toss. The winner chooses to either kick-off or selects an end of the playing field to defend in the first half. If the decision is made to kick off, the loser of the coin toss chooses an end to defend, otherwise they must kick off. After half time the teams swap ends and the team that did not kick off in the first half starts play. The referee blows a whistle to begin each half, stop play or indicate a score. The assistant referees raise a flag if the ball has crossed the touch line or scored a goal. They can also signal foul play by holding the flag out horizontally and in some games are able to communicate with the referee using microphones. In higher level matches a fourth official is appointed who can replace an assistant if needed and is usually responsible for allowing the substitutions to enter the playing field. A television match official is also sometimes appointed and the referee can consult them if they are unsure of a score.\nScoring.\nTries and conversions.\nA try, worth five points, is scored when the ball is touched to the ground in the area between the opposition's try line and before the dead ball line (the \"in goal\"). A player can score a try by carrying the ball into the in goal and then touching it to the ground while holding on to it. No downward pressure is required, but the player must be holding the ball in at least one of their hands or at least one of their arms. If the ball lands in the opposition's in-goal, usually as a result of a kick or the opposition losing possession, a player can score by applying downward pressure with their hands, their arms, or the front of their body. In this situation, if the player is outside the field of play when they touch the ball, a try is still scored.\nA try is still scored if the ball is grounded on the try line or against one of the goal posts. If the ball touches the dead ball line or sidelines within the in goal it is considered to be \"dead\" (out of play) and a try cannot be scored. If a team is awarded a scrum near the try line they might attempt to push the opposition back into their own in goal. If the ball is kept in the scrum a player can dive on it as soon as it crosses the try line, scoring a \"pushover try\". Occasionally a team will infringe, possibly preventing a try being scored. If the referee believes a try would have been scored had the infringement not occurred they can award a \"penalty try\". Penalty tries are always awarded underneath the goalposts, no matter where the infringement occurred. Beginning in 2017, penalty tries are automatically worth seven points, negating the need to attempt a conversion. In the case of a jump ball from a cross-field kick, the ball cannot be punched out of play by a defender as you could in rugby league, it should be caught and grounded to get a 22m dropout instead.\nWhen a try is awarded by the referee, the team scoring the try has the right to attempt a conversion. A conversion is a kick at goal that passes between the two posts and above the crossbar. The ball has to be either place kicked or drop kicked, and if successful will earn the team two points. The conversion attempt is taken from a spot perpendicular to where the try was scored and must be completed within one minute from the time the player has indicated his intention to kick. The opposition must stand behind their goal line. When the kicker moves in any direction they may run at the kicker in an attempt to charge the ball down or put the kicker off. They cannot shout while doing this, but if the ball falls over after the kicker has started his approach they can continue with the charge.\nPenalty and drop goals.\nSuccessful shots at goal after a penalty or a drop kick score three points. Like conversions, penalty shots at goal must occur within one minute from the time the player has indicated his intention to kick, but they can only use a place kick. The opposition have to retire back (or to their goal line if it is closer) and stand still with their arms at their sides until after the ball is kicked. If the player does not indicate an intention to take a kick at goal and then scores a goal from a drop kick, the goal stands. However, if a drop goal is attempted from a free kick it will not count unless the ball has been first touched by an opposition player, been made dead or a tackle has been completed. The same laws apply if the team opts for a scrum in place of the free kick. In all other situations a drop kick can be attempted at any time during general play.\nAfter the try has been scored and conversion attempted, or after the goal has been scored via the penalty kick or drop goal, the scoring team will surrender the ball to the other team to restart play via a kick restart.\nGame structure.\nKick restarts.\nPlay is started at the beginning of each half, and after a score has been made by a kick-off. The kicking team takes a drop kick from the middle of the halfway line to begin play. The ball must travel beyond the line in the opposition half. None of the kicking team's players are allowed in front of the ball until after it has been kicked. Drop-outs are used to restart play when the attacking team puts the ball into the oppositions in-goal and it is grounded by a defender or if it goes over the dead-ball or touch-in-goal line. If the ball is kicked through the in goal they also have the option of taking a scrum from where the ball was kicked.\nGeneral play.\nAfter a successful kickoff the ball is in general play and can be passed, kicked, caught, picked up or grounded by any player. The player holding the ball can travel in any direction, providing he does not use teammates to obstruct defenders from making a tackle. He can pass the ball to another player as long as it does not leave his hands forward (momentum can carry the ball forward though). The ball cannot be dropped forward or travel forward after touching a player's hand or arm. If the ball is kicked, teammates are offside if they are in front of the kicker and can only begin moving forward when they are passed by the kicker or a player that began chasing from behind the kicker. If the ball lands within of players from the kicker's team, they must actively move backwards until they are from where the ball lands or put onside by a teammate. When the opposition carries the ball forward five metres, intentionally touches the ball, or passes or kicks the ball, all the chasing players are put onside.\nBreakdowns.\nTackle.\nTo stop a player running with the ball, the opposition will try to tackle them. Only players carrying the ball can be tackled.\nThe tackle is complete when the ball-carrier is brought to the ground; this is judged to be the case as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making the tackle. If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, then there is no tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player go and get to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in the tackle, but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making the tackle) and the tackled player, all other players must enter the tackle area from behind the ball. The tackle must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles are ones that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm (\"stiff arm\"), without using their arms (\"shoulder charge\"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air (\"spear tackle\"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.\nRuck.\nAfter a tackle, a ruck will sometimes form. This occurs when at least one player from each side bind onto each other with the ball on the ground between them. Additional players may join the ruck, but must do so from behind the rearmost foot of the hindmost teammate in the ruck (often referred to as \"coming through the gate\") and bind onto the body of a teammate. The offside line for uninvolved players is perpendicular to the last feet of the rearmost player on their side of the ruck and they must remain behind this line until the ball emerges. In a ruck, no player may use their hands to win the ball, except if they were on their feet and had their hands on the ball before the ruck formed. Teams try to win the ball by pushing the opposition off it or by using their feet to \"ruck\" it to their side. One player (in many cases the scrum-half) directly behind the ruck may reach in and retrieve the ball from the ruck provided they do not participate in the ruck (that is, they do not bind on to an opponent) and stay behind the offside line. A player doing so may not be tackled or grasped by an opponent in the ruck until he or she has played the ball, as this would violate the laws on tackling players without the ball. Players in a ruck must stay on their feet and not deliberately ruck or step on players lying on the ground. Players who are on the ground at a ruck must not impede the ball as it emerges from the ruck. The ruck ends when the ball emerges, a player commits an offence and is penalised or it becomes unplayable and a scrum is awarded. An amendment to the laws on this point is currently being trialled, under which a team which is able to retrieve the ball from the ruck must do so within five seconds. This is to prevent time-wasting; for instance by a team which is leading as the end of the game approaches.\nMaul.\nA maul is formed when a player carrying the ball is held by one or more opponents, and then one or more of the ball carrier's teammates bind onto the ball carrier. Players that join the maul must join from behind the hindmost foot of their most hindmost teammate. Players in the maul must try to stay on their feet, although the ball carriers may go to ground as long as they make the ball available immediately. Deliberately collapsing, jumping on or dragging players out of the maul is illegal. Players not in the maul or who leave the maul must retire behind the hindmost foot of the player at the back of the maul. The maul successfully ends when the ball or a player carrying the ball leaves the maul, the ball ends up on the ground (becomes a ruck), or the ball is carried over the sideline. If all the players of one team voluntarily leave the maul, the maul continues, with the offside line for the leaving players the front foot of the leading player still in the maul. If the maul stops, it must start again, or the ball must emerge, within five seconds, otherwise it has ended unsuccessfully. It can only restart once; the second time the ball must emerge in five seconds. If the maul collapses and it is not the result of illegal play, it is also an unsuccessful end. All unsuccessful endings result in a scrum being formed, with the defending team putting the ball into the scrum.\nSet pieces.\nScrum.\nA scrum may be formed if a team commits a minor infringement or play needs to be restarted. It consists of the eight forwards from both teams binding together in three rows, with the two front rows bound and pushing against each other. The two props (loosehead and tighthead) on either side of the hooker form the front row. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers, while the number 8 is the third row (back row). If an infringement occurs, the team that did not make the mistake is awarded the scrum. Infringements that result in a scrum are: knocking or passing the ball forward, a player being accidentally offside, a player being in front of the kicker during a kick-off or drop-out, delay (one minute) in taking a kick from a mark or taking a shot at goal from a penalty, or if a player incorrectly taps the ball at a penalty or free kick.\nA scrum is used to restart play if the ball becomes unplayable at a tackle, ruck or line-out and it is not due to a player offending. The team that was moving forward before the ball became unplayable is awarded the scrum; if no team was moving forward it is awarded to the attacking team. If the ball is stuck in a maul, the scrum is awarded against the team that had possession of the ball prior to the maul forming. An exception is if it forms directly after a player catches a kick during general play (not a kick-off or drop-out) on the full. In this case, the team of the player catching the ball feeds the scrum. If a defending player carries the ball into their own in-goal and grounds it or makes it dead, a scrum is awarded to the attacking team five metres out from the try-line. If an attacking player gets into his opponents in-goal, but is unable to ground the ball, or the referee is unsure if the ball was grounded, play restarts with an attacking scrum five metres from the try-line. Scrums are also used to restart play if the ball touches the referee during general play giving one team an advantage, play is stopped due to an injured player or if a team manages to legally prevent a player taking a free kick.\nIf a team makes a mistake when taking a kick-off or 22-metre drop-out, the opposition are given the option of either restarting play with a scrum or receiving the kick again. This applies if the ball is kicked using the wrong type of kick, from the incorrect place, into the in-goal area without being touched by the opposing team, or less than ten metres from a kick-off or not across the 22-metre line from a drop-out without being touched by the receiving team. If the ball is kicked from a \"restart\" across the sideline on the full, they also have the options of restarting play with a line-out at halfway or on the 22-metre line. If, during general play, the ball is kicked through the in-goal and over the dead ball line or into touch-in-goal (except for attempted drop goals) the defending team can either restart with a 22-metre drop-out or take a scrum from where the ball was kicked. If the ball is received in the in-goal, the player can either ground the ball (resulting in a goal line drop out, or to make the ball dead (resulting in a 5-metre scrum) If a line-out is taken incorrectly (ball not travelling 5 metres, player stepping into the field of play when throwing the ball in, ball not thrown straight – or forward if it is a quick throw in) the opposing team has the option to take a scrum fifteen metres in from the side line or to throw the ball in themselves. A team can also opt for a scrum in place of a \"mark\", free kick or penalty.\nA scrum is formed as near to where the infringement or stoppage occurred and at least five metres from either goal line. A normal scrum contains eight players from each team. If, for some reason, a team is reduced below fifteen men, the scrum numbers can also be reduced, although there can never be fewer than five. The hookers binds with their props, the locks bind each other and their front row, with all the other players in the scrum binding to the locks. The referee makes a mark where the scrum is to be formed and waits for both teams to bind together. The referee then calls \"Crouch\" (both front rows must crouch down) \"Bind\" (the props secure binds on each other's shoulders) and then \"Set\", at which point both packs' rows engage. When Set is called, the two front rows can come together and everyone in the scrum must stay bound until it is completed. Once the referee is happy with the engagement, the scrum-half from the team awarded the \"fee\" throws the ball into the \"tunnel\" (gap) between the two front rows.\nThe scrum must remain stationary and all the feet of both front rows must be on the ground until the scrum-half has put the ball in. The scrum-half must put the ball into the middle of the scrum, using both hands without delay or \"dummying\" (pretending to put the ball in). Front row players can only strike for the ball with a single foot once it is in the tunnel. Players cannot intentionally collapse the scrum or force players upwards out of the scrum at any time during a scrum. Both sides must try to push straight against one another, and deliberately pushing at an angle or pulling on an opponent to rotate (or \"wheel\") the scrum are penalised but if the contest between them results in the scrum rotating more than 90 degrees the scrum is reset with the ball going to the opposition. The opposition scrum half stands next to the feeding half and can follow the ball through the scrum as long as both feet remain behind the ball. The opposition scrum half can also move to the other side of the scrum or away from the scrum, but in this situation must stay behind the number eights feet.\nBefore a team begins a game they must have five players who are capable of playing in the front row in the team. If a front-row player gets sent off or suspended and no one on the field can play in the front row at the next scrum the team captain chooses another player to leave the field to be replaced by a reserve front rower. If, due to sendings-off or injury, there are no replacement front-row players available then the scrums become uncontested. Uncontested scrums are subject to the same laws as normal scrums, except there is no pushing and the team putting the ball into the scrum must win it. When a scrum is awarded close to the tryline, the attacking team can push the opposition back into the in-goal, controlling the ball in the scrum. If the ball crosses the tryline and a player grounds it, a \"pushover try\" is scored.\nLine out.\nWhen the ball crosses the sideline during general play a line-out is formed with the team that did not put the ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, in which case the team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the line-out is formed on the sideline perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, line-out, ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player can kick it directly into touch with the line-out forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the line-out is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a line-out can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.\nA line-out consists of at least two players from each team standing in two straight lines between five and fifteen metres from, and at right angles to, the scoring bay. The gap between the two teams must be 1 metre and the opposing team cannot have more players in the line-out than the team that was last in 'fluid possession'. One player from each team has to stand two metres back from the line-out to receive the ball and the opposing team must have a player standing at the front of the line-out two metres from the centre of the line-out. The player throwing the ball stands outside the field of play and must throw it at least five metres down the centre of the line-out. If the throw in is incorrect the opposing team has the choice of taking a scrum fifteen metres from the sideline or throwing the ball in themselves. The player throwing the ball in must not delay or pretend to throw the ball in. Players not taking part in the line-out must stand back ten metres or on the goal line if that is closer.\nOnce the ball has been thrown players from both sides can be lifted and supported in the air as they compete for the ball. They are not allowed to push, hold or support themselves on opposition players. When attempting to win the ball players, unless both hands are above their head, must use both hands or their inside hand. Players cannot leave the line-out until it ends and those not involved in the line-out must not move forward until it ends. The line-out ends when the ball is knocked, passed or kicked out of the line-out, when the ball goes beyond fifteen or within five metres from touch, when a ruck or maul moves beyond the centre of the line-out or a player with the ball detaches from a maul.\nThere are three main exceptions to the normal laws regarding line-outs. One is a line-out following a penalty and the other is the quick throw-in. If a team is awarded a penalty they have the option of kicking the ball into touch for a line-out. They can kick the ball directly into touch from anywhere on the field and the line-out will take place where the ball crossed the line. They also get to throw the ball in at the line-out. The second is a quick throw which occurs when a player throws the ball in before the line-out has had a chance to form. The ball can be thrown in anywhere from where the ball crossed the sideline to the players own goal line. The same ball that went into touch must be used and if the ball has touched another person (not including the person throwing it in, but including other players, replacements, spectators, coaching staff or anyone else not involved in the game) or a line-out has formed (two players from each team) then a quick throw in can not be taken. The ball must travel five metres before it touches the ground or a player and can only be thrown in straight or backwards. The third is a 50:22 kick, where a player kicks the ball from inside their own half (with the relevant phase having commenced in their own half) and the ball goes indirectly into touch (i.e: it bounces in field first) in the opponent's 22. In such a case, the attacking team will have the throw in to the line-out.\nPenalties and free kicks.\nIf a minor infringement occurs a scrum or free kick is awarded to the non-offending team. For more serious misdemeanors the referee awards a penalty. If the non-offending team gains an advantage the referee can allow play to continue. The referee has wide discretion on whether any advantage has occurred; with penalty advantages needing a greater gain than scrum advantages. If no advantage is gained play is taken back to where the infringement occurred. The penalty or free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, or moved out five metres if it is close to the goal line. The ball can be kicked in any direction and played at again by the person kicking it. The rest of the team must stay behind the kicker until the ball has been kicked. The opposition must retire ten metres or to their goal-line.\nPenalties are awarded if a player is caught offside, is involved in foul play, offends at the tackle, ruck or maul, or is involved in dangerous play at scrums and line-outs. Foul play includes intentionally or repeatedly offending, throwing the ball into touch, obstructing the opposition, or misconduct. Examples of misconduct are striking, stamping, kicking or tripping players, illegal tackles and contact with players after they have kicked the ball. Dangerous play at line-outs is pushing, charging, obstructing or levering on an opponent. Dangerous play at scrums is charging at opponents not correctly binding to opponents, the hooker swinging (using both feet to strike the ball), twisting, dipping or lifting an opponent collapsing. Other offences that result in penalties are if a team has too many players, wearing illegal clothing, throwing the ball deliberately into touch, intentionally knocking the ball on, not releasing the ball if taking into touch, incorrect numbers in a scrum, handling in the scrum and the scrum-half kicking the ball in the scrum.\nThe referee may punish a player's misconduct by using penalty cards. A yellow card indicates caution, a red card indicates a player has been sent off. Players may be cautioned for foul or dangerous conduct, for persistent breaches of the same rule, or for deliberate infringement to prevent their opponents from gaining a decisive advantage. A player receiving a caution is temporarily suspended from play for ten minutes. This has become known as the \"sin-bin\". If the same player subsequently commits a further cautionable offence, he is sent off for the rest of the game. A player can also be sent off permanently, without first being cautioned, for serious foul play.\nFree kicks are awarded for technical infringements that do not warrant a penalty. This includes indiscretions like players time wasting, charging over the 22-metre line during the oppositions drop-out, pushing in a ruck with their head lower than their hips, returning the ball to a ruck or maul, pretending to clear the ball from a ruck or maul and preventing the ball being thrown in at a quick line-out. Many infringements are penalised by free kicks during line-outs, including delaying or pretending to throw the ball in (balking), having less than two or more numbers than the opposition, leaving once the line-out has formed, failure to form a line-out, standing closer than five metres or over fifteen metres from the sideline, the receiver or opposition hooker (or equivalent player) standing in the incorrect position, not forming a straight line, not keeping a metre gap between the two lines, lifting a player below the shorts from behind or below the thighs from in front, jumping before the ball is thrown in, not lowering any lifted player, using only the outside arm to catch or deflect the ball or leaving the line-out before the ball is thrown, Free kicks awarded at scrums are for delay in forming a scrum, incorrect or early binding of the front rows, pushing before the ball is fed, front rows feet off the ground before the ball is fed, the scrumhalf not feeding the ball in correctly or straight, intentionally kicking the ball out of the tunnel, bringing the ball back into the scrum after it has emerged, a non-front row player hooking the ball from the tunnel or the scrum half pretending to clear the ball from the scrum.\nIf a team is awarded a penalty they can choose to take a shot at goal, kick the ball or tap the ball with their foot and run it. A successful shot at goal scores three points. The opposing team must stand still with their hands beside their sides until after the ball has been kicked at the goal. If the ball is kicked into touch the team that kicked it gets the throw in at the resulting line-out and it is always taken where the ball crosses the line. Free kicks are similar, except a shot at goal can not be taken and if the ball is kicked into touch the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing line-out. There is also no gain in ground from the free kick if kicked directly into touch, unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line. Opposition players can also try and charge down free kicks as soon as the kicker makes a move to kick. The captain can always choose to take a scrum from a penalty or free kick. A player can claim a mark by catching the ball directly from a kick (except a kick-off) inside their own 22 and shouting \"mark\" at the same time. The player that claimed the mark cannot be tackled and is awarded a free kick.\nVariations.\nUnder 19.\nThe laws are modified for younger age groups. The World Rugby enforced under 19 variations allow substituted players to replace anyone injured and if there are 22 in a team at least 6 must play in the front row. A game consists of two 35-minute halves and scrums can only be pushed 1.5 metres and must not be wheeled.\nRugby Sevens.\nRugby seven teams have seven players on the field and can nominate five substitutes, but only three may play any one game. Games last for 14 minutes (7-minute halves) except for finals which can consist of two ten-minute halves. In international competitions there are two ingoal touch judges (one at each end) that assist the referee in determining successful shots at goal, touch in-goal and tries. Conversions are drop goals that must be taken within 40 seconds and the opposition must wait near the halfway. A player temporarily suspended must leave the game for two minutes; two yellows risks a red card. The scoring team restarts play by kicking off from the halfway. Free kicks are awarded to the opposition at the halfway if the ball does not travel ten metres, goes directly into touch or into the in-goal, or the kickers team are in front. Scrums are formed with three players."

It has since gone on to establish itself as one of Kenya's most successful clubs.\nMen's team.\nThe men's team won the university's league (KUSA Handball League) in 2008, 2009,2010 and 2011. They are one of the better teams in the country having finished third in the Kenya Handball Federation national league for three seasons in a row from 2008-2010.\nHistory.\nIn 2003, The Technical University of Kenya registered their men's team to compete in the Kenya Handball Federation League, with Duncan Ayiemba, the former Aga Khan High School, Nairobi skipper, as the captain of the team. The club went on to register mixed results in the league as well as in the prestigious Joe Muigwa Cup that season. The team was maintained for the next seasons until 2007 when Peter Mwathi, who was the National Women's team coach, took over.\nHe kicked off his tenure by undertaking an aggressive recruitment drive with the aim of replacing the outgoing players with young, skilled and gifted players fresh from high school. This resulted in the signing of influential players such as Lewis Nyaga, Paul Mwangi and Adrian Emunye (Aga Khan High School, Nairobi), John Wekesa and Kevin Lukorito (Kimilili High School), Cyprian Maina (Mombasa Polytechnic), Mike Indasi, Clarence Oyule, Meshak Odero (Musingu High School, Francis Manuthu (Kiambu High School), Marin Ekode AND Eddie Kavai (Mukumu Boys High School), Alex Ndeto (Tala Boys High School) and Emmanuel Kidiga (Mangu High school).\nThese were added to the bulk of experienced players present at the club such as Evans Juma and Duncan Ayiemba resulted in a winning machine that challenged for honors on all fronts and in the 2008-2009 season, the team finished in third position of the KHF National League and Joe Muigwa Cup behind Cereals handball and Ulinzi Handball clubs.\nThe 2010-2011 season saw the arrival of Fibian Mathenge (Mangu High School) to a team that was about to witness the last term of Peter Mwathi as head coach, who has since gone on to take over at Strathmore University Handball. The team registered good results that season by winning the KUSA Handball league while finishing third in KHF National League and the Joe Muigwa Cup.\nHenry Savulane, a former Kenya International, has since taken over the reins at the club.\nHenry Savulane has made 2 more signings that includes Stephen Obanya and Kevin Kiarie to replace Victor Otwoma who went to Cereals handball club. The team average age is 24yrs"

London was officially awarded the championships on 11 November 2011.\nBidding process.\nWhen the seeking deadline passed on 1 September 2011, two candidate cities (London and Doha) had confirmed their candidatures. Barcelona, which investigated a bid, withdrew citing a lack of support from the local population and financial difficulties.\nOn 5 September 2011, Doha launched its marketing bid for the 2017 World Championships. The slogan of the bid was \"The RIGHT PARTNER for a stronger World Championships.\" The bid was led by Abdullah Al Zaini and Aphrodite Moschoudi. Moschoudi successfully led Qatar's bid for the 2015 Handball World Championships. Doha also brought in Brian Roe, a member of the IAAF Technical Committee. The bid was for the championships to be held in the renovated, climate-controlled Khalifa Stadium. The Corniche promenade was to hold the road races, with the committee proposing to hold the marathon at night after the opening ceremony.\nOn 6 September 2011, London unveiled its bid for the 2017 championships with the slogan \"Ready to break records.\" This was London's fourth bid in less than 15 years to host the event. The London bid team said that if their bid was successful they would introduce the \"Women in World Athletics\" programme.\nThe IAAF Evaluation Commission visited London on and Doha on . On 11 November 2011, the winner was officially announced as London.\nVenue.\nThe championships were held in the London Stadium in Stratford, London, which hosted the athletics events and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and has a capacity of 60,000.\nSix days before the events were due to begin, it was reported that more than 660,000 tickets had been sold, which was a record for the World Championships, surpassing the previous record of 417,156 tickets sold for Berlin 2009.\nMedia coverage.\nRights to televise the championships in the United Kingdom were held by the BBC. NBCUniversal was the rights holder in the United States. In Canada, rights to televise the championships belonged to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\nMascot.\nThe mascots for the IAAF Championships and World ParaAthletics Championships were unveiled in April 2017, and chosen through a children's design contest organised by the BBC programme \"Blue Peter\". The mascots represent \"everyday\" endangered species of the UK; the IAAF Championships mascot is an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Hero the Hedgehog, and for the ParaAthletics, Whizbee the Bee.\nEntry standards.\nThe qualification period for the 10,000 metres, marathon, race walks, relays, and combined events runs from 1 January 2016 to 23 July 2017. For all other events, the qualification period runs from 1 October 2016 to 23 July 2017.\nEvent schedule.\nThe Women's 50 kilometres walk was held for the first time.\n&lt;section begin=Schedule /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Schedule /&gt;\nMedal table.\n IAAF does not include the six medals (1 gold and 5 silver) won by athletes competing as Authorised Neutral Athletes in their official medal table.\nPlacing table.\nIn the \"IAAF placing table\" the total score is obtained from assigning eight points to the first place and so on to one point for the eight placed finalists. Points are shared in situations where a tie occurs. 65 IAAF members received points.\n Host nation\nParticipants.\nBelow is the list of countries and other neutral groupings who participated in the championships and the requested number of athlete places for each.\nRussian suspension.\nRussia is currently indefinitely suspended from international competition due to a doping scandal, and will therefore not be present at the Championships. Nevertheless, 19 Russian athletes have been allowed to participate in international competition included as \"authorised neutral athletes\" at London 2017 following a long process to show that they were not directly implicated in Russia's state doping program. These athletes include Mariya Lasitskene (high jump), Sergey Shubenkov (110 metres hurdles), Ilya Shkurenev (decathlon), Aleksandr Menkov (long jump) and Anzhelika Sidorova (pole vault) plus names from 2016 such as Darya Klishina (long jump) \nRefugees.\nFor the first time, an Athlete Refugee Team delegation was present at the competition, mirroring the efforts to include refugee athletes that had occurred at the athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics. A total of five athletes – all of them Kenya-based refugees – were entered as part of the Athlete Refugee Team, including Somalian Ahmed Bashir Farah, Ethiopian Kadar Omar Abdullahi, and South Sudanese middle-distance runners Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu, Rose Lokonyen and Anjelina Lohalith.\nQuarantine.\nAn outbreak of norovirus occurred at a local hotel affecting 30 athletes and officials.\nDoping.\nAn anti-doping programme was overseen at the championships for the first time by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) – an independent anti-doping board within the IAAF. A total of 1513 samples were collected at the competition and were sent to Ghent for analysis by a World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited laboratory . The samples comprised 596 urine sample (212 of which were tested for erythropoietin) and 917 blood samples. The blood samples were divided into two forms – 725 were taken to feed into the long-term athlete biological passport initiative and 192 were taken specifically to identify use of human growth hormone and erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The in-competition anti-doping scheme was complemented by a more extensive out-of-competition testing programme, which was intelligence and performance-led and amounted to over 2000 blood tests and over 3000 urine samples. An anti-doping education initiative also took place, led by the AIU and the IAAF Athletes' Commission, including an Athletes' Integrity Pledge which was taken by around 2500 athletes.\nTwo of Ukraine's foremost athletes, Olesya Povkh and Olha Zemlyak, were suspended for failed doping tests immediately before the championships in London.\nThe initial findings of the in-competition tests were that three athletes tested positive for doping, none of whom were medalists. The names of the athletes were not announced, allowing the athletes to contest the result and request a b-sample test."

Like all other equestrian events, the eventing competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division.\nFor the 1996 and 2000 Olympic competitions, the individual and team contests were separate events. A rider could compete in both competitions as long as it was on different horses. An example of this is individual winner David O'Connor who won his gold medal riding \"Custom Made\", while he earned his team bronze medal with the U.S riding \"Giltedge\".\nResults.\nThe total score for each horse and rider was the sum of the total penalty points earned in the various phases of competitions. The pair with the lowest number of penalty points was victorious.\nDressage.\nFor the dressage portion of the competition, horse and rider pairs performed series of movements that were evaluated by judges. Judges gave marks of 0 to 10 for each movement, subtracting points for errors. The score for each judge was represented the total marks gained. For every point less than a total of 240, 0.2 Penalty Points were assessed.\nCross country.\nIn the cross country phase, each pair had to traverse 14.3 kilometers of road and track, 3.1 kilometers of steeplechase, and an obstacle course spread over a track of approximately 7.4 kilometers. Pairs received .4 penalty points for every second beyond the optimal time, up to a limit. Any pair that had not finished in that time was eliminated.\nPenalty points were also assessed for disobedience faults at obstacles and for falls. Disobedience faults incurred 20 penalty points, rider falls incurred 65, and horse falls eliminated the pair. The total penalty points from cross country were added to those incurred in phase 1, dressage, for a two-round total.\nShow jumping.\nIn show jumping, pairs received 4 penalty points for each obstacle knocked down, 4 penalty points for the horse's first disobedience, and 8 penalty points for the rider's first fall. They also received 1 penalty point for each second over the optimum time.\nThey could be eliminated for a second disobedience, the rider's second fall, the horse's first fall, or taking more than twice the optimum time to finish the course. \nCross country.\nIn the cross country phase, each pair had to traverse 14.3 kilometers of road and track, 3.1 kilometers of steeplechase, and an obstacle course spread over a track of approximately 7.4 kilometers.

        "text": "The 2012 international cricket season was from April 2012 to August 2012. One year after gaining the number-one ranking in the ICC Test Championship, England lost the ranking to South Africa in August 2012 following a 0–2 Test series defeat at home. Also in August 2012, England rose to number one in the ICC ODI Championship following ten consecutive ODI victories and the annual update of the rankings. The update also put South Africa and India within one rankings point behind England.\nThe previous number one ODI team was Australia, who slipped to number four after holding the top spot from September 2009. Shortly before they lost the ranking, they lost 0–4 in an ODI series in England. It marked the end to their era of dominance in ODI cricket which included three consecutive World Cup wins, two ICC Champions Trophy wins and finishing nine of the past eleven years with the number-one ranking. The annual update also put South Africa at the top of the ICC T20I Championship rankings, replacing England. However, the T20I rankings would change significantly as a result of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 at the start of the following season.\nJune.\nZimbabwe Twenty20 Triangular Series.\nAlthough contested by three ICC full member nations, this tournament does not have Twenty20 International status, because it was organised outside of the ICC Future Tours Programme.

The ban was still in effect during the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, so Merritt was unable to compete. Ordinarily, since 1997, the defending champion is automatically invited to the championships, but the United States stipulates that the champion must compete in the national championships. It took a special decision by USATF to allow Merritt to enter. Merritt had minimal racing opportunities prior to the championships.\nIn qualifying, ordinarily athletes try to use the minimum effort to advance to the next round, but Merritt ran the year's world leading time of 44.35 in heat 3. The media focused on double amputee Oscar Pistorius, who ran 45.39 to qualify into the semi-finals.\nIn the semi-finals, Merritt ran a more controlled and relaxed 44.76 in semi 1, while Jermaine Gonzales controlled semi 3 in 44.99 and 18-year-old Kirani James ran an easy 45.20 to take semi 2. Rondell Bartholomew also qualified, placing two athletes from tiny Grenada in the final. Also twins Kévin and Jonathan Borlée placed two athletes from Belgium in the final. While his time from the trials would have made the final, Pistorius ran 46.19 in his semi and did not advance. Kirani James won the final beating LaShawn Merritt on the line with a time of 44.60. At 18 years, 363 days old, James became the youngest ever world medallist for the men's 400 m.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the established records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final."

The Berkeley Eagles are one of the eight major clubs in the Illawarra Baseball Association, and a part of the NSW Country Baseball Association, falling under the banner of New South Wales Baseball. The club was first initiated into the Illawarra Baseball League in 1973. Since introduction, the Berkeley Eagles club have been a notable competitor in the Illawarra Senior Baseball League with 12 First Grade Premierships, ranging from 1976 to the most current 2010.\nThe Eagles current home ground is Fred Finch Park in Berkeley and has been the home ground since 1982. Fred Finch is a highly renowned ground with the most impressive infield in the Illawarra, due to many face-lifts over its tenure. With its notoriety, the Fred Finch Complex was expanded to two major fields for the Claxton Shield 2008 clash between Perth Heath and New South Wales Patriots.\nThe club has produced a high stock of representative juniors throughout its history with many juniors representing Australia and the Australia Provincial teams. The most notable representatives that the Eagles have produced include; Aaron Tritton, Nathan March, Stuart Thompson, Andrew Coad, Patrick Booth, James Toomey, Jamie Peel and Dennis Grubb.\nThe most recent Australian representative, Aaron Tritton represented Australia at the Cal Ripken World Series in 2004 played in Aberdeen, Maryland in the United States of America. Aaron also represented NSW Country and Illawarra on numerous occasions throughout his junior years, and is currently a member of the 1st Grade 2010 Premiers defending their title in the 2011 Illawarra Senior Baseball Major League Final Series. Nathan March toured Europe in 1999 representing the Australian Provincial Team, playing in Prague and Munich. He was a member of the 2nd Grade 2010 Minor Premiers and Premiership winning team, catching the winning catch against the Dapto Chiefs. Fellow previous juniors Mick Shipp and Shannon Crilly also were members of the Illawarra Flame Squad that toured in Seattle in 2005, in the Trans-Pacific Challenge. Not only did the Berkeley Eagles produce Australian representatives, a member of the 2010 Premiership winning first grade squad, Tim Atherton was selected as a train on member of the Major League Baseball Minnesota Twins feeder club, the Elizabethton Twins, in 2011.\nThe Berkeley Eagles have a renowned historical rivalry between two major clubs; the Dapto Chiefs and Western Suburbs Cardinals. This spite and \"hatred\" between Berkeley and Dapto came to fruition in the infamous 2009 final series bench-clearing brawl between the first grade squads. A congregation of flying fists and bone crunching tackles were evident in the day leading to an all in brawl. An incident occurred at home plate, with catcher Mick Shipp being ejected from the game."

There were twenty entrants, with nineteen athletes from twelve countries starting the race.\nMo Farah had been undefeated over the distance that year and his European record of 26:46.57 minutes topped the season's rankings. Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese and Ethiopians Imane Merga and Sileshi Sihine were other entrants ranked in the top six. Kenenisa Bekele, the unbeaten world champion since 2003, decided to defend his title, but his form was unknown as injuries had meant that he had not raced since early 2010. Kenya, typically strong in the event, sent a team of 2007 bronze medallist Martin Mathathi, Peter Cheruiyot Kirui, and World Cross Country runner-up Paul Kipngetich Tanui.\nZersenay Tadese set a fast pace for much of the race, a decision which soon reduced the leading pack to the Ethiopian and Kenyan teams, with the additions of the Eritrean, Mo Farah, and Galen Rupp. Kenenisa Bekele dropped out at the halfway point, unable to match the leading pace. The final 500 metres saw Farah take the lead with an injection of speed, with Imane Merga and Ibrahim Jeilan the only runners to follow him. Farah appeared to have judged the race well, having led at the bell for the final 400 m and completing his last lap in 53.36 seconds. However, Ibrahim Jeilan was even faster and overtook Farah in the final metres of the straight, taking the gold by a margin of less than 0.3 seconds. Imane Merga claimed the bronze five seconds later and Zersenay Tadese and Martin Mathathi came fourth and fifth.\nIbrahim Jeilan, the 2006 World Junior Champion, was an unexpected winner and Farah later remarked that he had never heard of him. Having felt overlooked for the Ethiopian team for the 2008 Olympics and 2009 World Championships, Ibrahim had moved to Japan to prepare himself away from the major circuit. It was the fifth consecutive time that an Ethiopian athlete had won the world title. Although Farah was the runner-up, he ran the second fastest time ever by a British athlete and became the country's first ever men's medallist in the event. Imane Merga's bronze was his first ever world medal on the track.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following world and championship records were as follows."

        "text": " \nThe 2011–12 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2011–12 college basketball season, the 91st season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by head coach Josh Pastner. Pastner was assisted by Jack Murphy and Damon Stoudamire. From the summer of 2011 until December 2011, NBA player Luke Walton was also an assistant coach, though he departed from the position with the end of the NBA lockout. Jimmy Williams was brought in to replace Walton for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. The Tigers played their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee and were members of Conference USA.\nPre-season.\nThe 2010–11 Memphis Tigers finished the season with a record of 25–10 (10–6 C-USA). The Tigers finished in fourth place in C-USA, but won the 2011 Conference USA men's basketball tournament to secure a berth in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they lost in the second round to Arizona.\nDepartures.\n\"Statistics accurate as of June 3, 2011.\"\nSeason summary.\nThe Tigers began the season ranked in the top 15 of the AP and Coaches polls and the consensus pre-season favorite to win the Conference USA championship. The Tigers had scheduled aggressively, with their out of conference schedule ranking as one of the toughest in the country among division 1 teams.\nThe Tigers, with a roster dominated by a large sophomore class and freshman blue chip recruit Adonis Thomas, struggled somewhat with their difficult out of conference schedule. Despite not taking any bad losses prior to the start of conference play, the Tigers did not defeat a ranked opponent during their non-conference slate. Sophomore Will Barton, however, quickly became a favorite to win CUSA player of the year honors, ranking in the top 50 in both rebounds per game and points per game in division 1 for the 2011–12 season.\nOn January 16, 2012, the \"Commercial Appeal\" reported that talented freshman Adonis Thomas would miss the remainder of the regular season due to ankle surgery. Senior guard and starter Charles Carmouche would also miss all but the first few games of the Tigers' season with knee problems. Thomas, however, returned to the court for the Tigers' first CUSA tournament game.\nWith a victory at Tulsa on March 3, the Tigers clinched the CUSA regular season championship. The Tigers finished the regular season with an overall record of 23 wins and 8 losses, and a conference record of 13 wins and 3 losses. On March 7, 2012, Will Barton was named Conference USA Player of the Year.\nIn the CUSA tournament, the Tigers defeated their three opponents by an average of 25 points and ultimately won the championship over Marshall on March 10 in Memphis. For the second consecutive year, Tigers' point guard Joe Jackson was named the tournament's most valuable player. Will Barton and Tarik Black were also named to the all-tournament team.\nThe Tigers received an 8 seed in the West Region of the 2012 NCAA tournament, a seed which was widely considered to be too low given the Tigers' resume. Memphis lost to 9 seed St. Louis in the second round on March 16, ending their season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| 2012 Conference USA tournament\n!colspan=9| 2012 NCAA tournament\nSource:"

This is a change in schedule from previous years when all the relays were at the end of the program. This might necessitate a change in strategy to allow for team members involved in other events.\nThis was the fastest qualifying round in the history of the World Championships. All eight qualifying teams were faster than the fastest qualifier two years before. All but final qualifier Kenya were faster than the Bronze medal team at that championship. United States ran the world leading time, which sounds more impressive than it really was since the previous leading time was by an American collegiate team (though only seven of these national teams were better than that mark in this entire competition). The South African team set their National Record, led off by double amputee Oscar Pistorius. After the heat, South Africa elected not to include Pistorius in the final.\nIn the finals, none of the medal winning teams matched their times from the qualifying heats. Jonathan Borlée put Belgium in the early lead. After the first handoff, they were passed quickly by Ofentse Mogawane putting South Africa into the lead followed by Jermaine Gonzales of Jamaica. Five time defending champion United States, running hurdlers Bershawn Jackson and Angelo Taylor, was a slow third place behind South Africa's Willem de Beer watching Jamaican Riker Hylton separate from the field, but Hylton tied up on the home stretch and the race tightened going into the final handoff. Taking the baton in the unfamiliar third place, Silver medalist LaShawn Merritt ran a controlled race in lane one moving into position for one final surge on the home stretch. Merritt was actually too close to the runners ahead of him and had to dart to the right to go around to pass the two teams in green and yellow to the finish. South Africa anchor, hurdler L. J. van Zyl, held off Jamaica's Leford Green for the silver medal.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 of each heat (Q) plus the 2 fastest times (q) advance to the final."

He played briefly in Major League Baseball, for the Chicago Cubs in 1948.\nBiography.\nA native of Dallas, Texas, Lynch was a paratrooper in the United States Army during World War II. After the war, he attended Southern Methodist University (SMU), where he played both baseball and basketball. The 1947 edition of \"The Rotunda\", SMU's yearbook, includes a baseball team photo with both Lynch and future Heisman Trophy winner Doak Walker.\nLynch's father, who shared the same name, had played in the minor leagues for a decade as a middle infielder. The younger Lynch was originally signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in June 1948, and played 91 games for the minor league Waco Pirates. However, in September 1948, Lynch was declared a free agent after Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler ruled that the Pirates had hired the elder Lynch as a scout as a way to hide a bonus payment. Lynch was then signed by the Chicago Cubs on September 7, and married on September 8.\nA week after being signed, Lynch played in Major League Baseball for the Cubs, appearing in seven games through the end of the 1948 season; one as a second baseman, one as a pinch runner, and five as a pinch hitter. In seven major league at bats, he had two hits, including a home run off of Johnny Sain, for a .286 batting average and a .714 slugging percentage. Lynch did not return to the major leagues, but he played in the minor leagues through 1954, including over 300 games at the Triple-A level.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Lynch became a lawyer in Texas. He died in an automobile accident in June 1978 in Plano, Texas."

Adams, with four straight wins on the Diamond League circuit, entered the competition as the defending champion and reigning Olympic champion.

Other in-form throwers included Americans Jillian Camarena-Williams and Michelle Carter, and Chinese athletes Gong Lijiao and Li Ling. The 2009 silver medallist Nadine Kleinert and 2008 Olympic runner-up Natallia Mikhnevich were present, but neither had performed to a high standard that year.\nHaving already clearly won the final, Adams relaxed and let loose a put of 21.24 on her final throw. While it only elevated her to 22nd on the all-time list, it was the best throw since Larisa Peleshenko in 2000. It was obviously her personal best and annual world leader, it was also the New Zealand national record and Oceana area record. It also equalled the championship record from 1987.

The overall titles were won by Marcel Hirscher of Austria and Tina Maze of Slovenia.\nA break in the schedule was for the biennial World Championships, held 4–17 February in Schladming, Austria. Changes for the 2013 season included the awarding of World Cup points for the slalom crystal globe for the limited field city events (parallel slalom), not just in the overall standings. Also, a crystal globe trophy was no longer awarded for the combined event, as many organizers considered the event difficult to market, but its results still counted in the overall rankings.\nMaze became the first Slovenian to win an overall World Cup title; she clinched it on 24 February after her eighth victory of the season, a super-combined race at Méribel, France. Her victory in a downhill race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany on 2 March gave her wins in all five disciplines for the season, and she became the first racer in World Cup history to score more than 2,000 points in a single season. The previous record of 2,000 points was held by Hermann Maier, set during the 2000 season.\nMaze broke various statistical records in this season, including the highest number of podiums in a season (24, record previously held by Maier (22) and by Hanni Wenzel and Pernilla Wiberg for ladies (18)), highest number of top 5 finishes (31, previously Maier and Wiberg (24)), highest number of points after first 10 races (677, previously Katja Seizinger, 643), largest percent of possible points won (69%, previously 61% by Wiberg), and the highest margin over the runner-up (1313, compared to 743 for Maier and 578 for Lindsey Vonn). Maze finished on podium in all giant slalom events, previously achieved only by Vreni Schneider in 1989. She is also the first woman to remain at the top of the overall standings throughout the season - a feat previously achieved only by Bode Miller in 2005. In addition to the overall title, Maze won the super-G and giant slalom titles, finished at the top of the combined list by winning both races in the season, and finished second in the downhill and slalom. Those titles went respectively to two Americans, Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin. Vonn's season ended with a knee injury on 5 February at the World Championships, but she held on to win the downhill title by a single point after the final race was cancelled. Three days after turning 18, Shiffrin won the final slalom race at Lenzerheide on 16 March to overtake Maze and win that discipline's season title by 33 points.\nThe men's overall title wasn't decided until the World Cup finals at Lenzerheide. A runner-up finish in the giant slalom on 16 March gave Hirscher his second consecutive overall title, the first male to achieve this feat since Stephan Eberharter in 2002 and 2003. Hirscher also won the slalom title, while the downhill and super-G titles went to Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, the sixth and seventh discipline titles for the former two-time overall champion. The giant slalom title went to American Ted Ligety, who won six of the eight GS races for his fourth season title in that discipline."

The second semi-final was won by Trinidad and Tobago, setting their national record, with Ukraine following them into the final. Russia also qualified on time. In the third semi-final, the USA, running in lane 2 ran the world leader to qualify, along with Nigeria. In lane 3, Bahamas' Anthonique Strachan fell as the modern version of the golden girls tried to qualify. Bahamas eventually finished while Germany was unable to complete their first handoff.\nIn the final, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce put Jamaica into the lead, but strong legs from Allyson Felix and Marshevet Myers brought the United States back into contention. Despite their recent history of poor handoffs, the United States executed their final baton exchange perfectly, gaining a couple of metres on Jamaica. Given the lead, Carmelita Jeter was able to hold off a closing Veronica Campbell-Brown for the win. Jamaica set their national record in second.

The 2009 silver medallist Jennifer Oeser was also in good form while Nataliya Dobrynska and Hyleas Fountain (first and second at the 2008 Olympics) were the other high-profile competitors. Tatyana Chernova won the gold medal finishing 129 points ahead of Jessica Ennis.\nHyleas Fountain started the event powerfully, looking like she was in it to win it. She squeezed out a .02 victory in the 100 metres hurdles and added a 3 cm advantage in the high jump, just a centimeter below her personal best, to give her a 39-point lead. Then things began to unravel. She gave up over 2 metres in the Shot put, where defending champion Jessica Ennis and returning silver medalist Tatyana Chernova powered through. Chernova was gaining from the beginning of the second day with a 10 cm advantage in the long jump. But the real break occurred when Chernova gained exactly 13 metres on Ennis in the javelin, a 250-point swing. Jennifer Oeser used her strong javelin throw to place herself firmly in third. Karolina Tyminska in fourth and Ennis tried to run themselves into an advanced position in the 800 metres. While Tyminska won the 800, Oeser was able to stay close enough to her to hold on to the bronze. Ennis was just 2.6 seconds behind Tyminska, but Chernova would not let Ennis gain even a quarter of a second, much less the gold medal. On 29 November 2016 the IAAF stripped Chernova of the title, as well as many of her others, due to doping and the results were adjusted accordingly.\nWith only two non-finishers, this edition of the women's heptathlon is notable for having the lowest fraction of athletes not finishing the competition in the World Championships history.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the established records were as follows.\nResults.\n100 metres hurdles.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: +0.4 m/s, Heat 2: +0.9 m/s, Heat 3: +1.6 m/s, Heat 4: +1.7 m/s\n200 metres.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: -1.5 m/s, Heat 2: -1.2 m/s, Heat 3: -1.1 m/s, Heat 4: -1.3 m/s"

This is a change in schedule from previous years when all the relays were at the end of the program. This might necessitate a change in strategy to allow for team members involved in other events.\nThe United States held the two fastest relay times before the championships and had won the 2007 and 2009 world titles, as well as the 2008 Olympic gold medals. Jamaica and Russia – the only other nations to have won a world title since 2000 – were the other primary contenders. A Brazilian team had broken the South American record a month before the championships and was the third fastest qualifying nation. Great Britain, Ukraine and Germany comprised the other major nations at the competition.\nTwenty teams, instead of the normal sixteen, started this event, necessitating three heats instead of two. United States was an easy winner in heat one, with Ukraine edging out neighboring Belarus for the second automatic qualifying spot, but Belarus qualified on time. Russia, with the fastest time, was an easy winner in heat two with Nigeria taking the second automatic spot and Czech Republic taking the second time qualifier. Jamaica and Great Britain separated cleanly from their competitors in heat three.\nIn the final, the United States led off with previous world champion Sanya Richards-Ross, who handed off to silver medalist Allyson Felix in the lead. Felix extended the lead with Russian Natalya Antyukh and then Jamaica 's Davita Prendergast chasing about 5 metres back. Prendergast passed a fading Antyukh, who had charged after Felix and was slowing, just before the handoff. Novlene Williams-Mills solidified Jamaica's hold on second place during the third leg. On the anchor leg, Francena McCorory burst away from the handoff, extending the lead to 10 metres and discouraging a challenge. McCorory paid for that burst on the home stretch, but still maintained the 5 metre lead at the finish. Jamaica knocked a second off their National record.\nOn 21 June 2017, Russia forfeited the bronze medal following the disqualification of Kapachinskaya.

        "text": "The women's long jump event at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Daegu Stadium on August 27 and 28.\nReigning world champion Brittney Reese was the pre-event favourite as she held the best mark that year (7.19 m) and led on the Diamond League circuit. Russia's Darya Klishina and Olga Zaytseva were the only ones to have cleared seven metres that season, while Americans Funmi Jimoh and Janay DeLoach were the only jumpers to have defeated Reese on the circuit. Veronika Shutkova and Maurren Maggi (the 2008 Olympic gold medallist) were other highly ranked entrants.\nMaggi produced the best jump of the qualifying rounds, followed by Belarusian Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova. Brittney Reese needed the last of her three jumps to achieve the qualifying mark. Zaytseva was the most prominent jumper to be eliminated at the first stage. Maggi, Jimoh and Naide Gomes were high-profile eliminations in the first half of the final round. Reese took the lead with her first jump of 6.82 m and, despite having had five no-jumps, she remained in first place to take the gold. It was Olga Kucherenko, Ineta Radēviča and Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova who fought for the minor medals. Mironchyk-Ivanova jumped 6.74 m in round three, only to be overtaken by Kucherenko (6.77 m) the following round. Radēviča produced her best (6.76 m) with her final jump to edge into the bronze medal position.\nReese's mark of 6.82 m was the shortest winning distance in the history of the event at the World Championships. Nevertheless, she became only the second woman to ever win two consecutive long jump world titles, matching the feat of her fellow American Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Kucherenko and Radēviča gained their first ever medals on the world stage, although both had been medallists at the 2010 European Athletics Championships.\nMironchyk-Ivanova was fourth. She had a jump which seemed to be the longest of all, about 6.90 m. Her ponytail swang and left the mark behind at 6.74 m and she lost the win and all the other medals as a result.\nA retest of silver medallist Kucherenko's sample in 2016 came back positive for doping and she was stripped of her medal. As a result Radēviča was promoted to silver medal and Mironchyk-Ivanova moved into the medals with a bronze.\nMedalists.\n\"Revised\"\n\"Original\"\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the established records were as follows.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 6.75 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\n\"Format: Each athlete has three attempts, then the eight best performers have three further attempts\""

        "text": "Raymond Lincoln Kennedy (May 19, 1895 – January 18, 1969) was an American professional baseball player, scout and front office executive. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nPlaying career: One MLB at-bat.\nKennedy's professional playing career came almost exclusively at the minor league level. A catcher and second baseman, he played from 1915 to 1917 and in 1919–27, largely in the original Sally League. He made one appearance as a player in Major League Baseball as a pinch hitter for the St. Louis Browns on September 8, and went hitless in his only at bat against the Detroit Tigers. He had spent most of that season in the Class D Illinois State League.\nExecutive career: First GM of Pirates (1946).\nKennedy was the first person to hold the title of general manager in the history of the Pittsburgh Pirates, spending one season, , in the post. He had been hired from the New York Yankees organization, where he had previously been secretary and business manager of the Newark Bears, one of the Bombers' two top-level farm clubs. However, the Bucs were in the process of being sold after 46 years of ownership by the Barney Dreyfuss family. On August 8, 1946, the team was purchased by a consortium led by Indianapolis businessman Frank McKinney, Columbus, Ohio-based real estate developer John W. Galbreath, Pittsburgh attorney Thomas P. Johnson, and entertainer Bing Crosby.\nThe Pirates' new owners brought in their own general manager at the end of the season: Roy Hamey, who had been president of the Triple-A American Association. Ironically, Hamey had previously been Kennedy's peer as the business manager of the Yankees' other top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. In the front-office transition that followed, Kennedy remained with the Pirates as director of minor league clubs from 1947 to 1948. In 1949, Kennedy became minor league director of the Detroit Tigers, serving through 1951. In 1955, Kennedy was player personnel director of the Kansas City Athletics and was working as a scout for the New York Mets at the time of his death, at age 73, in Casselberry, Florida."

He was eventually advanced by the referees to the semi-finals, where he qualified for the final.\nThe first semi-final went out slowly and was a strategic race with a bunch finish. Defending champion Yusuf Saad Kamel finished 6th in that semi and failed to make the time qualifier. The second semi went out on a decidedly faster pace bringing the time qualifiers along with the automatic qualifiers. Previous silver medalist Deresse Mekonnen was left behind in the final kick. With Bernard Lagat opting to run the 5,000 metres, no returning medalists made the final, though all current Olympic medalists did make the final.\nThe final went out at 4 minute mile pace, with Nick Willis leading Matthew Centrowitz and the pack through a 60-second 400, slowing to almost 2:02 by 800. Shortly after that, the Kenyans Asbel Kiprop and Silas Kiplagat moved to the front, chased by Mekonnen Gebremedhin and much of the pack swallowed the early leaders. Centrowitz stepped to the side and followed. As the pack tried to jockey for position, Kiprop refused to relinquish the lead along the rail, even as teammate Kiplagat took the lead on the outside during the backstretch. Kiprop and then Kiplagat continued that way to the finish. Abdalaati Iguider stayed a step behind Kiprop and was in third coming down the home stretch. As he faded, Centrowitz, who had come around the outside followed by Manuel Olmedo moved back up to finish third.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 6 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final."

The World Cup is organised by the Union Cycliste Internationale. In this edition the World Cup consists of four rounds in Pietermaritburg, Papendal, London and Chula Vista.\nSeries.\nThe 2011 World Cup series was made up of five events. The series featured rounds in Pietermaritzburg, Papaendal, London, Sarasota and Chula Vista. However, in July Sarasota had to pull out of hosting a round leaving the series with just four stops in 2011.\nLondon.\n160 riders signed up to tackle the challenging Olympic course. The event was one of the first events to take place in the Olympic Park and is part of the London Prepares series. The track is 470 metres long for men and features a berm jump, an S-bend transfer, a box jump and a rhythm section in the final straight. The women's course is 430 metres long featuring three jumps in the opening straight and a tunnel, before like the men's course, including a rhythm section in the final straight. It has been called one of the most challenging BMX tracks to date. The track also features an starting ramp and was designed by the UCI with the aim of pushing the boundaries of the sport. 14,000 cubic metres of soil was used to build the track.\nHome favourite Shanaze Reade and New Zealander Marc Willers took the win in London after a long delay for rain. Rain fell for three hours, meaning that the racing did not get under way until 17:00 local time. However the crowd remained and due to the rain, racing was an elimination, do or die, one run, one chance with the top four from each heat qualifying into the next round. In the final Willers did battle with Sam Willoughby and World Champion Joris Daudet with the pair of them passing him on the Red Bull (box) jump before Willers fought back down the rhythm section to pass the pair of them and to take the London round."

        "title": "2003 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2003 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding match of the 2003 NRL season. In what was a contest of Sydney's east versus west, defending premiers the Sydney Roosters played against minor premiers the Penrith Panthers. The first grand final since 1996 to feature two Sydney-based teams was played on the night of Sunday, 5 October at Telstra Stadium in the inner western suburb of Sydney Olympic Park. Domestically, live free-to-air television coverage was provided by Nine's Wide World of Sports. The match was also broadcast live in the United States by Fox Soccer.\nBackground.\nThe 2003 NRL season was the 96th season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the sixth run by the National Rugby League. Fifteen teams (14 from Australia and 1 from New Zealand) competed for the Telstra Premiership, with the top eight teams entering a play-off finals series to determine the grand finalists.\nPenrith Panthers.\nThe 2003 Penrith Panthers season was the 37th in the club's history. Coached by John Lang and captained by Craig Gower, they finished the regular season in 1st place.\nSydney Roosters.\nThe 2003 Sydney Roosters season was the 96th in the club's history. Coached by Ricky Stuart and captained by Brad Fittler, they finished the regular season in 2nd place.\nTeams.\nOf all the Penrith players, only Luke Priddis had grand final experience, having played for the Brisbane Broncos in the 2000 NRL season's decider. It was Scott Sattler's last game with Penrith, having signed with the Wests Tigers for the following season.\nMatch details.\nThe Roosters were seen as favourites. 81,166 spectators turned out at Telstra Stadium for the game. Pre-match entertainment featured performances by Meat Loaf, the Hoodoo Gurus and \"American Idol\" winner Kelly Clarkson. Troy Cassar-Daley then sang the Australian national anthem just before Bill Harrigan, refereeing his 7th consecutive grand final and 10th overall, blew time-on and the Roosters kicked off.\nFirst half.\nRain started falling only a few minutes into the match and continued throughout. After thirty minutes of play, the Roosters' defence was the first to give when Penrith hooker Luke Priddis, still within his team's side of the field, ran from dummy half and into open space, finally passing to winger Luke Rooney coming through in support to cross untouched on the left for the opening try. Ryan Girdler kicked the conversion so the Penrith side were leading 6–0. No more points were scored for the rest of the half so this remained the score at the break.\nSecond half.\nIn the eighth minute, and after repeat sets of six had brought the Sydney Roosters close to Penrith's try-line, forward Jason Cayless crossed it beneath the uprights, but the ball was held up by the defence. On the very next play, the ball went through the hands out to Shannon Hegarty to score on the left hand side of the field. Craig Fitzgibbon's conversion, which bounced through off an upright, evened the scores at 6–6. Eight minutes later Sydney winger Todd Byrne received the ball on his own forty-metre line and ran into open space along the left edge of the field. Penrith lock forward Scott Sattler was chasing and twenty metres from the try-line tackled Byrne, pulling him out of the field in what would become one of the most famous plays in grand final history. In the sixty-sixth minute the Penrith side had made their way up to within five metres of the Roosters' try line where Luke Priddis again ran from dummy half and scored, stretching out of the tackle to touch down beside the uprights. Preston Campbell kicked the extra two points so Penrith were now leading 12–6. In the seventy-third minute, Penrith halfback Craig Gower attempted a field goal but it was charged down. Penrith re-gathered the ball and continued towards the Sydney Roosters line and four tackles later had reached perfect field-goal kicking position. Priddis, at dummy half again, instead decided to dummy and run left, throwing a long cut-out pass to Rooney on the wing to score untouched in the corner. Campbell converted the try and Penrith lead 18–6 with six minutes left to play, but no further points ensued so this remained the score at full-time.\nLuke Priddis was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as man-of-the-match before the Prime Minister of Australia John Howard presented Panthers captain Craig Gower with the premiership trophy. At the Penrith Leagues club approximately 10,000 people celebrated the victory with the Panthers. The grand final attracted a bigger audience in Melbourne than the AFL grand final did in Sydney the previous weekend.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nAftermath.\nFour members of Penrith's premiership winning team subsequently went on to play in other premiership teams – Paul Whatuira was part of the Wests Tigers team that triumphed just two years later in 2005, Joe Galuvao and Shane Rodney won a second premiership together as part of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles team that won in 2011, and Luke Lewis was part of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks team that won their first premiership in 2016, winning the Clive Churchill Medal as the best-on-ground.\nWorld Club Challenge.\nHaving won the premiership, the Penrith Panthers travelled to England the following February to play the Bradford Bulls, winners of the 2003 Super League Grand Final in the World Club Challenge. The Bradford Bulls won 22 to 4."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1974–75",
        "text": "The 1974–75 Australians beat the touring England team 4–1 in the 1974-75 Ashes series. Labelled the \"Ugly Australians\" for their hard-nosed cricket, sledging, and hostile fast bowling, they are regarded as one of the toughest teams in cricket history. Don Bradman ranked them just after his powerful teams of the late 1940s, and Tom Graveney third amongst post-war cricket teams after the 1948 Australians and 1984 West Indians. The spearhead of the team was the fast-bowling duo of Dennis Lillee, whose hatred of English batsmen was well known, and Jeff Thomson, who outraged old fashioned cricketers by saying he liked to see \"blood on the wicket\". \"Wisden\" reported that \"never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls\". \"Behind the batsmen, Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity\", but the predatory wicketkeeper and Australian slip cordon snapped up most chances that came their way. Their batting line up was also impressive with the opener Ian Redpath spending over 32 hours at the crease in the series, followed by Rick McCosker, Ian and Greg Chappell, Doug Walters and Ross Edwards. In the last Test of the series Lillee and Thomson were injured, the out of form England captain Mike Denness made 188 and England won by an innings.\nThe captain.\nThere have been few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, who knew how to squeeze the last drop out of any situation that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition with just the right run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce ... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.\nIan Chappell came from a South Australian cricket dynasty, his maternal grandfather Vic Richardson had been captain of Australia and his younger brothers Greg and Trevor Chappell also played for Australia. In the 1960s the young Ian Chappell had been noted as an aggressive batsman and gifted slip fielder who played for South Australia when only 18 and Australia when 21. He was not an immediate success with the bat, he made only one century in his first 17 Tests, but kept his place due to some extraordinary slip catches and his ability as a part-time leg-spinner. He ended his run-drought with 548 runs (68.50) against the West Indies in 1968–69. He was known as a man who could make runs when Australia were under pressure, and some thought he was a better batsman than his gifted brother Greg for this reason. Despite a poor tour of South Africa in 1969–70 Chappell was made Bill Lawry's vice-captain in the 1970–71 Ashes series. Lawry's defensive tactics earned him few friends and when Australia went into the last Test needing a victory to retain the Ashes he was controversially replaced by the aggressive Chappell, who had already made two centuries in the series. Chappell won the toss, put England in to bat and Australia had a 100 run lead in the first innings, but Ray Illingworth's team fought back to win the Test and the series. Nevertheless, Chappell was made captain for the 1972 Ashes series and his young team surprised Illingworth's veterans by halving the series 2–2. He now had young talent in the shape of Rod Marsh, Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Bob Massie, Ross Edwards, Max Walker and Jeff Thomson and moulded them into a tough, combative team that dominated the mid-1970s; they beat Pakistan 3–0 and the West Indies 2–0 in 1972–73, New Zealand 2–0 in 1973–74, England 4–1 in 1974–75 and 1–0 in 1975. This success was not without its price as the \"Ugly Australians\" won few prizes for sportsmanship, with Chappell demanding 100% commitment from his players, and winning at all costs. In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Australia made 328/5 against Sri Lanka and Chappell told his team to go easy as the newcomers could not possibly win and he wanted to improve their image, but he reversed his decision when they reached 70/1. As a result, Sidath Wettimuny was carried off the field after being hit three times by Jeff Thomson, the 5'2\" Duleep Mendis retired hurt after being hit between the eyes by a bouncer and Australia won by 52 runs. In 1975–76 he passed on the Australian captaincy to his brother Greg, but stayed in the team as they beat Clive Lloyd's West Indians 5–1. He was instrumental in the creation of Kerry Packer's professional World Series Cricket to rival the Australian Board of Control and improve the financial lot of Australian cricketers and captained the WSC Australia XI. When Packer and the ABC came to a deal Chappell returned to Test cricket against England the West Indies in 1979–80 before finally retiring.\nBatting.\nIn essence the Australian batting revolved around Ian and Greg Chappell and the new stability of Doug Walters. The Chappell combination was probably the strongest fraternal Test-match pair since the era of the Graces. In the First Test against New Zealand in Wellington in March 1974, they struck new coinage in cricket records by both scoring centuries in each innings. Greg's unbeaten 247 stamped him as probably one of the best players in the world; correct, upright and unrelenting. But brother Ian, with pugnacity and shuffling, hooking savagery, was virtually his equal in scoring terms. Walters also proved that he could now be ranked with the greats by scoring a peerless, unbeaten 104 in the levelling Third Test at Auckland, when all climatic and wicket conditions favoured the medium-pace of the Hadlees and Collinge.\nAustralia had a sound batting line up with Ian Redpath replacing Bill Lawry as the country's premier opening batsmen. He spent 32 hours at the crease in the six Tests while compiling 472 runs (42.95) at his own pace. Never a pretty or flashy batsmen he was the backbone of the team and the England fast bowler John Snow wrote \"I liked bowling to him least of all...a real nuisance batsman\". Greg Chappell said Redpath was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team, the other being Rod Marsh. Initially his opening partner was Wally Edwards, but this attacking left-hander failed and was dropped after making a duck in the Third Test. He was replaced by Rick McCosker, a gutsy batsmen best remembered for batting in the Centenary Test despite having his jaw broken by Bob Willis, but who made 80 on his Test debut in the Fourth Test. Greg Chappell had emerged as Australia's best batsman, making 247 not out and 133 against New Zealand the previous season. This was the most runs made by a batsman in a Test until Brian Lara made his record 400 not out thirty years later, his elder brother Ian Chappell made 145 and 121, a unique occurrence of two brothers each making two centuries in the same Test. Greg was an imperious batsman, full of class and his Test average of 53.86 is superior to that of any Australian batsman since Bradman. Doug Walters was a great entertainer who delighted his home crowd, who labelled the famous Sydney Hill \"the Doug Walters Stand\". His shots were often unorthodox and his 103 in the Second Test at Perth was the first time a hundred runs had been made by a batsman in one session in an Ashes Test for decades, with a six off Bob Willis bringing up the hundred off the last ball of the day. Ross Edwards was a sound batsmen who started life as Rod Marsh's understudy as Western Australia's wicketkeeper. He worked on his batting and made 170 not out in the 1972 Ashes series when used as a makeshift opener. Lower in the order Rod Marsh was hard-hitting left-handed batsmen who first made the Australian team for his batting skills, Max Walker was a big hitter of the ball and he and Terry Jenner verged on all-rounder status.\nBowling.\nIn this past series Lillee and Thomson were probably ... the fastest and most lethal opening pair in Australia's history. They possessed remarkable physique, strength and stamina, and ability and (may I add in the confines of diplomacy) a willingness to exploit the short-pitched ball to an extent that would have unnerved any side.\nStrange as it may seem England had few qualms about the Australian bowling at the start of the series. Dennis Lillee and Bob Massie had been overbowled in 1972 and 1973 and had both broken down with crippling injuries, while Jeff Thomson – if they had heard of him – had taken 0/110 in his only Test. However, Lillee returned to Test cricket after considerable determination to overcome his injuries and though he lost a yard or two of pace he had lost none of his old venom and \"bowled with a hostility that bordered on savagery\". His new bowling action was a text-book model and his straight arm gave him movement through the air and off the pitch that made him more dangerous than ever. But the real revelation was Thomson, whose javelin throw action gave him enormous pace and \"slung the ball down at sizzling pace, getting dangerous lift off a length, and not worrying overmuch where the ball landed\" In 1975–76 his bowling was clocked at 99.6 mph compared to Lillee's 86.4 and his very inaccuracy made him dangerous, the batsmen never knew where the ball was going to land next. They were given wholehearted support by Max Walker, as fast-medium bowler whose awkward whirlwind bowling action gave him the nickname of Tangles. 6'4\" tall and as strong as a bull Walker was an accurate swing bowler and took 8/143 in the last Test when Lillee and Thomson were injured. Geoff Dymock was a left-arm swing bowler who struggled to keep his pace in a strong Australian team, but became the first Australian to dismiss all 11 opposition batsmen in a Test when he took 12/166 at Kanpur in 1979–80. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced \"Golden Arm\" was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and came second in the averages after Thomson. Historically Australian selectors preferred a leg-spinner, but Terry Jenner failed to hold his place and as fast-bowling rose in prominence the Australian 'leggie' became almost extinct.\nFielding.\nIn one department however the 1974–75 combination excelled any other that I have seen. They were the best fielding combination I have ever witnessed on the cricket field ... everyone chased like demons, caught like angels, and, unfortunately, occasionally swore like troopers. Looking back at the Perth Test , I still find it difficult to believe that some of the catches that were taken were even in the bounds of possibility.\nIan Chappell drove his team to excel themselves on the field and the Australian bowlers were backed up by some superb catches. Rod Marsh had thrown off his 'Iron Gloves' tag and was beginning to rival Alan Knott as the best keeper in the world. The Chappell brothers were both excellent slip fielders, taking 227 catches between them in Test cricket, with Greg took 7 catches in the Second Test at Perth – setting a record for a fieldsman – and 14 in the series, another record. Ashley Mallett a specialist in the gully, Ross Edwards a gifted cover fieldsman and Ian Redpath a remarkable close fielder anywhere.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Perth.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nFirst One Day International – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\"\nSixth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1974–75 Ashes series\""

In the early 1990s the club was renamed the Royal Belgrade Rugby Club (KBRK) with the patronage of Prince Alexander II Karađorđević. The team's colours became yellow, brown, and white and the sparrow was replaced by a crown. As KBRK, the club was successful in the nineties and noughties.\nIn 2012 the club's executive committee decided to return to the name of BRK. The word Royal was removed from the club's name, the colours were reverted to blue and white and a re-styled sparrow replaced the crown. In 2014, the Belgrade Rugby Club (BRK) became Belgrade Rugby Club Red Star (BRK Crvena Zvezda) or BRK Red Star, and the colours were changed to red and white.\nA group of former BRK-KBRK members and players were unhappy with these changes and, led by Danijem Stricevicem, decided to split away. A new club was formed under the Royal Belgrade Rugby Club (KBRK) name in 2014.\nClub honours.\nThe new KBRK does not claim the history of the previous BRK-KBRK, as listed below. — \"For details on the original Belgrade Rugby Club, see: Belgrade Rugby Club Red Star.\"\nROYAL BELGRADE RUGBY CLUB (2014–):\nROYAL BELGRADE RUGBY CLUB (1994–2012):\nRecords.\nROYAL BELGRADE RUGBY CLUB (2014–):\nROYAL BELGRADE RUGBY CLUB (1994–2012):\nSquad.\nSenior Squad: | "

        "text": "Night climbing is a term used, principally at the Oxford and Cambridge universities in England, to describe the sport of climbing up the walls of colleges and public buildings, and exploring the rooftops. This activity is frowned on by college authorities, so it is mainly done under cover of darkness, to avoid detection.\nThe sport is a subset of buildering, or urban climbing, and is distinguished by the fact that it is usually carried out nocturnally by university students.\nThe original term for this activity was \"roof climbing\". The alternative term \"night climbing\" was introduced in the late 1930s, and has become the standard term.\nHistory.\nIn 1895, the alpinist Geoffrey Winthrop Young started to climb the roofs of Cambridge University. Students had been scrambling up the university buildings for years, but Young was the first to document this activity. He wrote and published a night climbing guide to Trinity College.\nIn 1905, while a master at Eton College, Young produced his second book, a small volume on buildering, entitled \"Wall and Roof Climbing\". This was a very erudite work, containing a rich variety of quotations from writers of many different periods and cultures.\nIn 1921, inspired by Young's guide to Trinity, a group of undergraduates, including Hartley, Grag and Darlington, published a night climbing guide to St John's College.\nIn 1930, John Hurst wrote the second edition of the guide to Trinity.\nIn 1937, \"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\", a more comprehensive, though still light-hearted, account of Cambridge undergraduate night climbing appeared in popular print, written by Noël Howard Symington, under the pseudonym \"Whipplesnaith\".\nNight climbing remained popular in Cambridge after World War II. In 1960, Richard Williams wrote the third edition of the Trinity guide. In 1970, a book entitled \"Cambridge Nightclimbing\" was published under the pseudonym \"Hederatus\". Night climbing also featured prominently in a book by F A Reeve, entitled \"Varsity Rags and Hoaxes\", published in 1977, in the detective novel \"The Bad Quarto\" by Jill Paton Walsh, published in 2007 and in Michael Ondaatje's \"Warlight\", which cites this book.\nPopular culture.\nIn recent years, a number of books on night climbing in Cambridge have been published by Oleander Press, of Cambridge, as follows:\nIn 2007, Corpus Christi alumnus Ivo Stourton published the novel \"The Night Climbers\" which is based on a group of students who engage in the practice.\nFamous night climbers.\nIn the 1930s, Whipplesnaith (Noël Symington) climbed many buildings in Cambridge, England.\nIn 1895, Geoffrey Winthrop Young pioneered the sport of night climbing in Cambridge, England. The identification of the first Cambridge night climber remains an open question, but Young is generally regarded as the original pioneer.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, a group of Nocturnal climbers began posting images to anonymous confession Facebook pages, detailing climbs conducted at Christ Church, Corpus Christi College, Pembroke College, Westgate, Cornmarket Street, and several other high-profile locations. Each public post contained content of a political or philosophical nature, with advice given sometimes in the form of an Agony Aunt. The local media dubbed the group \"The Night Climbers of Oxford\", for their identities remained unknown. Despite some back lash, the public showed support for the group and their controversial acts. As a result, they quickly became part of Oxford's urban and night-life culture.\nDuring his time studying mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, Freeman Dyson was known to have practiced night climbing."

The only faster athlete that year was Russian champion Anastasiya Kapachinskaya, who had run a personal best of 49.35 sec. Three-time 200 m world champion, Allyson Felix, was also challenging for the 400 m title, while Amantle Montsho (ranked third that year) had five straight wins on the Diamond League circuit. Jamaica's Rosemarie Whyte, Novlene Williams-Mills and Shericka Williams were also contenders, as was 2009 third placer Antonina Krivoshapka.\nThe event started in controversy when reigning Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu was disqualified in her preliminary race for a false start. 2011 was the first year of a new IAAF rule allowing no leniency for a false start.\nIn the final, Montsho was a clear leader off of the turn, with Felix closing fast at the end to make the race close. This was Felix's personal best. Not only was this Montsho's personal best, but also the national record for Botswana. For the bronze medal, Anastasia Kapachinskaya was faster down the final 80 metres to pull away from Francena McCorory, who had run her personal best in the semi-finals.\nAfter the championships, Kapachinskaya was disqualified for a doping violation for having stanozol and turinabol in tests held during the 2008 Olympics. She received a lifetime ban. In 2017, McCorory was advanced to the bronze medal.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final."

He then transferred to Willingboro High School in Willingboro Township, New Jersey for his senior year. When it came time to choose which college to attend, Davis wanted to stay relatively close to home and not \"get lost in the shuffle\" of a big time athletics program. He and his friend (and fellow high school teammate) Paul Newman decided to attend whichever NCAA Division I program recruited both of them first, and that ended up being Delaware State.\nA power forward, Davis became the most statistically accomplished player in program history by the time he graduated in 1991. He scored a then-Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 2,275 points (surpassed in 2019–20) and also grabbed 1,013 rebounds. The list of those who achieved both 2000 points and 1000 rebounds is a small one. As a sophomore in 1988–89, Davis was named the MEAC Player of the Year, and he was twice selected to the all-conference team. Davis once scored 47 points in a game against UTEP and had a 29-point, 13-rebound performance against Ohio State.\nDespite his lauded collegiate career, Davis did not get selected in the 1991 NBA draft, nor was he ever signed by an NBA team."

        "title": "Farm Neck Golf Club",
        "text": "Farm Neck Golf Club is a semi-private golf club located in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, United States. In the 1970s, a real estate company named Strock Enterprises intended to create a golf course and housing developments on a peninsula within the town but locals felt they were not maintaining a conservationist ethic. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled against Strock which soon thereafter went bankrupt. Farm Neck Associates then bought the territory and created a golf course with the intent to preserve the environment. The 18-hole course has earned plaudits from notable publications and hosted President Clinton and President Obama while on vacation.\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s, a real estate company named Strock Enterprises began development plans to create a golf course and several hundred housing lots. The plans were approved by the Oak Bluffs Planning Board in 1974. However, there was resistance from locals, especially lawyers Charles Harff and Bob Fullem, who thought the developers did not intend to preserve the natural environment. According to Mr. Harff and Mr. Fullem, the goal was \"to save a pristine corner of Martha's Vineyard from over-development.\" The Martha's Vineyard Commission (MVC) reacted and \"froze the plans.\" The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld MVC's decision. Strock Enterprises then soon went bankrupt.\nIn 1978, a group of investors known as Farm Neck Associates purchased the territory with the intent to marry development with a conservationist ethic. The following year, construction of the course began. Farm Neck was designed by \"prominent New England golf course architect\" Geoffrey S. Cornish. On July 3, 1980, the course opened. The course was created out of a territory that used to be a farm and is located on a peninsula, or \"neck,\" which is how the club got its name. Shortly after the course was completed, 85 acres were donated to Felix Neck sanctuary. The club has also collaborated with the National Audubon Society over the course of its history.\nThe course has received much media attention for hosting presidents of the United States on their summer vacation. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton played the course several times over the course of the decade. During his presidency, while on vacation on the Vineyard, President Barack Obama played the course.\nThe popularity of Farm Neck has exploded since President Clinton's first visit. Due to this surge in popularity, however, it is now very difficult for a non-member to earn a tee time. By the early 21st century, Farm Neck offered \"restricted public play.\" It is also very difficult to earn membership. During this era, there were over 850 people on a waiting list. According to Lisa Reagan, the co-owner, \"Right now, the only way to get a Farm Neck membership is to put your name on a list.\"\nAccording to \"Boston Magazine\", the course was the top public course in the state of Massachusetts in 2003. Farm Neck has also earned good reviews from \"Golf Digest\". The magazine has regularly awarded the course 4.5 out of 5 stars and has labeled it one of the top \"Places to Play\" in the northeastern United States."

However, Kenia Sinclair of Jamaica and Britain's Jenny Meadows had been the leading athletes on the Diamond League circuit. Caster Semenya, the 2009 champion, was among the fastest that year, but had been affected by injury and an 11-month career break due to gender verification tests. Moroccan Halima Hachlaf and American champion Alysia Johnson Montano were highly ranked, while reigning Olympic and World silver medallist Janeth Jepkosgei was another prominent competitor.\nIt took under 1:59 just to make the final. Led by defending champion, Semenya, the three Russians all qualified, along with two Americans, returning silver medalist Jepkosgei and Kenia Sinclair, leaving previous bronze medalist Jenny Meadows as the fastest non-qualifier.\nIn the final, Jepkosgei led through a fast 55.86-second first lap, followed by Sinclair and Alysia Johnson Montaño. On the backstretch, defending champion Semenya cruised past the field taking the lead with about 180 metres to go. She continued to pull away, but not emphatically.

The leading pack reached the halfway point in 15:47.04 minutes and the pace became increasingly quicker at this point – a fact which saw Tigist Kiros fall away from the pack. Flanagan and Eshete were the next to trail away, then Meseret Defar dropped out entirely with stomach pains, reducing the leading pack to the four Kenyans (Masai, Cheruiyot, Kipyego and Priscah Jepleting Cherono) and Meselech Melkamu. In the final lap, it was Cheruiyot and Kipyego who surged away into the lead.

        "text": "The women's 100 metres hurdles at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Daegu Stadium on September 2 and 3.\nPrior to the competition, Australian Sally Pearson led the season's rankings with a time of 12.48 seconds and was undefeated on the Diamond League circuit. The United States team provided the next fastest athletes that year in the form of Kellie Wells, Danielle Carruthers and the 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper. The defending champion Brigitte Foster-Hylton of Jamaica was in poor form, while the other 2009 medalists (Priscilla Lopes-Schliep and Delloreen Ennis-London) were absent. Tiffany Porter, Lisa Urech and Perdita Felicien were the only other top-ten-ranked athletes to compete.\nPearson won her semi final in 12.36, equal to the number 5 performer in history. The time improved on her own Oceanian area record and Australian national record. Wells had a large lead in her semi final, but clipped the ninth hurdle and struggled to maintain her balance as she finished in second.\nIn the final Pearson led from the gun and was not challenged, running 12.28, the fastest time in nearly two decades and moving her to fourth on the all-time list. The time is a new Championship record and again improved her Oceanian area record and Australian national record. Behind her, Carruthers outleaned Harper for the silver medal, both athletes finishing in the same time. Wells hit the seventh hurdle and did not finish.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: +1.0 m/s, Heat 2: -0.6 m/s, Heat 3: -1.6 m/s, Heat 4: 0.0 m/s, Heat 5: +1.3 m/s\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: -0.1 m/s, Heat 2: +0.3 m/s, Heat 3: +0.7 m/s\nFinal.\nWind\" +1.1 m/s"

        "text": "Matt Donovan (born May 9, 1990) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman currently playing for the Chicago Wolves in the American Hockey League (AHL). Donovan was selected by the New York Islanders in the fourth round (96th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nDonovan grew up playing in Oklahoma City's youth hockey program where he initially attended Edmond North High School until the age of 15 before moving to John F. Kennedy High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While in Iowa, Donovan played for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders of the United States Hockey League (USHL). As a RoughRider, he was named to the USHL All-Rookie Team in his first season (2007–08), and the league's First All-Star Team in the following season.\nDonovan made his University of Denver debut on October 9, 2009, and completed his first season as a Pioneer with seven goals and 14 assists for a total of 21 points in 36 games to lead all Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) defenseman in goals. For his efforts he was rewarded by being named to the Inside College Hockey Freshman All-American team, All-College Hockey News Rookie Team, and All-WCHA Rookie Team.\nDonovan was drafted 96th overall in the fourth round of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2008 draft by the New York Islanders. Upon completing his sophomore season at the University of Denver, he was quickly signed to a professional contract by the Islanders, who assigned him to play for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Donovan scored a goal and four assists during the final six games of 2010–11 AHL season. For the 2012–13 season, Donovan tied Justin Schultz for the most points among AHL defensemen with 48.\nDonovan made his NHL debut on April 3, 2012, against the New Jersey Devils, making him the first Oklahoman born, raised, and trained in the state to play in the NHL. Donovan wore uniform number 46 in honor of Oklahoma being the 46th state. After making the Islanders' roster to start the 2013–14 season, he scored his first NHL goal on October 8, 2013, against Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes.\nWith the Islanders declining to give Donovan a qualifying offer, on July 1, 2015, the Buffalo Sabres signed Donovan as a free agent to a one-year contract.\nAfter spending the 2015–16 season exclusively within the Sabres' AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans, Donovan left the NHL as a free agent to sign a one-year contract abroad with Swedish club, Frölunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL), on July 21, 2016.\nDonovan enjoyed two productive seasons in Sweden, before opting to return to North America for the 2018–19 season, securing a one-year AHL contract with the Milwaukee Admirals on June 7, 2018. Donovan instantly made an impact with the Admirals, leading the club in scoring with 12 points through his first 13 games before he was signed by NHL affiliate, the Nashville Predators, on a two-year, two-way contract on November 4, 2018.\nNearing the conclusion of his contract with the Predators, Donovan opted to continue his tenure with the Milwaukee Admirals by signing a two-year AHL contract extension on March 23, 2020.\nWith the Admirals opting out of playing in the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, Donovan made a return to Sweden and the SHL, belatedly signing for the remainder of the season with HV71 on January 20, 2021. He posted 2 goals and 7 points in 12 regular season games, unable to help prevent HV71 suffering relegation to the HockeyAllsvenskan (Allsv).\nReturning to the Admirals for the following 2021–22 season, Donovan as an alternate captain, contributed with 8 goals and 40 points from the blueline in all 76 regular season games.\nOn June 17, 2022, Donovan again left the AHL and signed a one-year contract with German club, Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). In the 2022–23 season, Donovan as an alternate captain contributed offensively on the blueline with 8 goals and 23 points through 47 regular season games. He also added 8 assists in 12 playoff contests.\nAs a free agent, Donovan returned to North America after securing a one-year AHL contract with the Chicago Wolves on June 14, 2023.\nInternational play.\nDonovan was a member of the United States junior hockey team that captured the gold medal in January 2010 at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with a 6–5 overtime victory against Team Canada. Throughout the seven games Donovan gained three goals and two assists with a plus-6 rating."

        "text": "Shane Warne, a late Australian international cricketer, had taken 37 five-wicket hauls during his career playing for the Australia national cricket team. In cricket, a five-wicket haul – also known as a five-for or fifer – refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only five bowlers have taken more than 30 five-wicket hauls in their Test cricket careers. Warne has the second most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket, behind Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan. Despite this, he has only taken a single five-wicket haul in One Day Internationals (ODI). He was one of the most experienced Australian cricketers, and the second leading wicket taker in Test cricket history, with 708 wickets, again behind Muralitharan. He is twelfth on the all-time list of ODI wicket takers. In 2000, Warne was named the fourth of five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Century, behind Don Bradman, Garfield Sobers and Jack Hobbs.\nWarne made his Test debut against the Indian team at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in January 1992, and took his first five-wicket haul later that year, against the West Indies team at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He has taken ten or more wickets in a match 10 times in his career, and is second in the all-time list behind Muralitharan, with 22. Warne's career-best bowling figures in an innings is 8 wickets for 71 runs, which he accomplished in 1994 against the English team at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, while his best match figures are 12 wickets for 128 runs, achieved in 1994 against the South Africa team in Sydney. Warne has been most successful against England, taking 11 five-wicket hauls against them, the first in 1993 and the last in 2006, and was most prolific at the SCG, where 5 of his 38 five-wicket hauls were taken. Warne retired from international cricket in January 2007, having taken 708 Test and 293 ODI wickets in his career. He announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in May 2011."

        "text": "Competitive Rugby League () was established in Cornwall in 2010 by Joe Catcheside, who working on behalf of the Rugby Football League, organised and established an annual fixture between Devon and Cornwall. Until this time all rugby league played in Cornwall had been exhibition matches and featured teams from outside Cornwall. The first match between Devon and Cornwall was played in August 2010. The match is now played annually and is regularly billed as the \"County Clash\" or the \"County of Origin\" game and the teams play for the Martin Roddy MBE Trophy.\nThe Cornwall Rugby League Association currently has only one member; Cornish Rebels RLFC who were established in 2013 and play in the South West Premier Division. They will be joined by Cornwall R.L.F.C. in 2022, playing in the third tier of the professional game RFL League 1.\nHistory.\nThe first rugby league matches to take place in Cornwall were a series of exhibition matches between Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers which took place on three consecutive evenings in June 1962. The first match was at the Mennaye Field (a rugby union ground); the home of Penzance–Newlyn RFC and the former club of Hull Kingston Rovers player Graham Paul. Two more matches took place at Camborne and Falmouth. There was an earlier attempt to introduce rugby league via a Western League in 1912.\nThe next matches to be played in Cornwall were in 1985 when Mansfield Marksman beat Carlisle in a challenge match at Penlee Park, Penzance and two Doncaster teams played each other at Looe in a second challenge match. The formation of the South West League in 1984−85 saw two amateur teams from Cheltenham and Bristol play at Ludgvan.\nMartin Roddy MBE Trophy.\nOn 16 September 2010 the first team to represent Cornwall took to the field to play Devon at the Rectory Ground, Devonport.\n In 2012 the match was renamed from the Tamar Cup to the Martin Roddy MBE Trophy. \nCornish Rebels.\nIn March 2013 the first ever rugby league club was established in Cornwall. Cornish Rebels RLFC currently play in the South West Rugby League against Devon Sharks, Exeter Centurions, North Devon Raiders, Plymouth Titans and Somerset Vikings A. Their home matches are played at The Recreation Ground, home of rugby union club Redruth RFC.\nSemi-professional club.\nCornwall R.L.F.C. will join the professional league system in 2022, playing in the third tier RFL League 1."

The race was held on Monday, July 27 at the Velòdrom d'Horta. Adler Capelli rode a bike that allowed for a single gear change, a first for an Olympic track event. There were 32 competitors from 32 nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist. The event was won by José Manuel Moreno of Spain, the nation's first medal in the men's track time trial. The United States also earned its first medal in the event, with Erin Hartwell's bronze. Shane Kelly took Australia's second consecutive silver medal in the track time trial.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The returning cyclists from 1988 were gold medalist Aleksandr Kirichenko of the Soviet Union (now competing for the Unified Team), seventeenth-place finisher Mika Hämäläinen of Finland, nineteenth-place finisher Nelson Mario Pons of Ecuador, and thirtieth-place finisher Neil Lloyd of Antigua and Barbuda. Host nation Spain had the reigning world champion, José Manuel Moreno.\nIndonesia and Latvia each made their debut in the men's track time trial; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. France made its 16th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition."

        "title": "Cycling in Denmark",
        "text": "Cycling in Denmark is both a common and popular recreational and utilitarian activity. Bicycling infrastructure is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure with segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes in many places and the network of 11 Danish National Cycle Routes (along with many regional routes) extends more than nationwide. Often bicycling and bicycle culture in Denmark is compared to the Netherlands as a bicycle-nation.\nInfrastructure.\nCycle paths and lanes.\nThere are an estimated of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes in Denmark and the four biggest cities alone account for more than with in Aalborg, in Odense, in Aarhus and in Copenhagen.\nCycle paths are often raised above the shoulder of the road and separated by a curb, but on older roads it is more common to have a cycle lane separated by a thick white line and sometimes the lane may be marked by coloured asphalt. Massive infrastructure investments are taking place to create more cycle ways and thus increase safety. At intersections, the continuation of the cycle way or lane is often highlighted by a broad blue band to increase its visibility and cyclists may find that they have their own set of traffic lights. In general both paths and lanes are designed for the more slow pace of utility cycling as opposed to more speedy designs in other countries. The Danish Roads Directorate acknowledges that the Danish cycle track system \"functions best when cyclists travel at relatively low speeds\".\nIn Copenhagen a system of interconnected green cycle routes, \"greenways\", is under development, with the aim of facilitating fast, safe and pleasant cycle transport across the city. The network will cover more than and consist of 22 routes. As of 2011, there were of greenways in Copenhagen.\nDanish National Cycle Routes.\nThe 11 Danish National Cycle Routes form a network of cycling routes throughout the country. They are important routes enabling bicycle tourism and showing off Denmark's natural beauty as well as its regional towns and villages.\nIntegration with other means of transportation.\nCycling is integrated into both the national, the regional and the local train services in Denmark. Cycles are permitted on trains to facilitate mixed-mode commuting. This is most visible in the urban and suburban rail network of Metropolitan Copenhagen, the S-trains, where cycles can be transported in specified carriages found at the front and rear of each train. As of 2011 there is no charge for taking cycles on any S-train. A number of Movia bus lines in Region Zealand allow the carriage of cycles for an extra charge (no charge on Copenhagen Harbour Buses) unless the bus driver deems the bus too crowded.\nCycle parking.\nAlthough there appear to be a large number of cycle parking facilities in Denmark, there is actually a severe lack of available cycle stands. Those that do exist are often poorly positioned, particularly in the bigger cities. In 2008, with a view to remedying the situation, the Danish Cyclists Federation published a \"Bicycle Parking Manual\" with a number of guidelines. They aim to be of immediate practical use to users but also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future.\nUtility cycling.\nMost children start bicycling to school from age 8-10 and continue to do so until at least 18 (the minimum age for acquiring a drivers license in Denmark), but in the bigger cities some people will rely on the cycle as the primary transportation throughout life. Most Danish public schools also educate 10–12 years in traffic rules, behaviour and regulations as a part of their regular curriculum. Utility bicycles which require little maintenance and are suited to load carrying are very popular. However, all other types of cycles are accommodated on the bicycle paths/ways, from racing bicycles with tri-bars through streamlined velomobiles. Two- and three-wheeled cargo bicycles are also becoming increasingly popular, with the trend starting in Copenhagen and spreading out through the country.\nThe common use of cycles and the growing support infrastructure for utility cycling, has encouraged Denmark to brand itself as a leading nation in everyday cycling. It has also led to the reinvention of the term \"Copenhagenization\" as a concept in urban planning and design relating to the implementation of better pedestrian facilities and cycling infrastructure for utility cycling in cities, and been an inspiration for an increasing number of cycle chic blogs spawning from \"Copenhagen Cycle Chic\".\nDanish postal workers have been using cycles for transport in towns and cities to deliver mail for several generations. Likewise small shop delivery services used cycles until the mid-1960s. As a result of a move to supermarket shopping, delivery by bicycles declined, though the growth of messenger services sparked a new life for delivery by bike in the mid 80's.\nSince the mid-2000s cycle rickshaws (velotaxis) have operated in the bigger cities and offer short distance journeys (usually up to ) - primarily during summer. Around the same period small enterprises started selling coffee or soup from mobile tricycle stalls around city centres.\nSince March 1, 2009 the police in Copenhagen have been patrolling on cycles. Besides being a quick and efficient means of transportation, it has been found to increase visibility and to improve contact with citizens.\nDanish cycle VIN-system.\nThe Danish cycle VIN-system is a system introduced in 1942 by the Danish government, providing all cycles in Denmark with a unique code. The code is a combination of letters and digits embedded into the bicycle frame and made up of a manufacturer-code, a serial-number and construction year.\nBy law it has been illegal since 1948 to sell cycle frames in Denmark without an embedded VIN and, as a result, insurance companies in Denmark do not pay indemnities for stolen cycles without a VIN.\nTourists.\nIt is quite common in Denmark to rent a cycle for riding around the countryside or the city. Most cities have a form of a bicycle sharing system. The method and pricing varies from location to location: the Copenhagen City Bikes in Copenhagen, for example, required a deposit of DKK 20 and restricted the use of the cycle to a defined area in the city centre, whereas other companies require documentation and a higher deposit. Bycykel in Aalborg is similar to the system that was in Copenhagen, for DKK 20 you can drive around in the city. Cycle rental shops are quite common and many different types of cycles are available. In Denmark, like the Netherlands, bicycle helmets are rarely worn by adults. A parliamentary proposal in 2009 to introduce a mandatory helmet law for children in Denmark was defeated.\nCars and cycles.\nIn general cycles and cars coexist quite well in Denmark and, unlike the Netherlands, Denmark does not have strict liability for car-drivers, but instead has a system that partially resembles it. There are two forms of liability that comes into action: liability in regards to the Danish traffic law (Danish: \"Færdselsloven\") and liability in damages in regards to the insurance companies. In an accident where a car going the right way in a one-way street and hits a cyclist going the wrong way, there will be a liability for both the car's owner (who will not necessarily be the driver) and the cyclist. This is due to a requirement for liability insurance (Danish: \"ansvarsforsikring\") for vehicle owners; the insurance companies will always apply this and thus make the vehicle's owner liable for damages. However the cyclist may be deemed liable by the Danish legal system for violating the one-way restriction while the driver may escape charges. In that case the car owner's insurance company may seek reimbursement (Danish: \"regres\") from the cyclist. However, in the majority of the accidents the car driver is found liable in both regards; in 1999, in 90% of the accidents involving cars and cyclists the car-drivers were found fully liable. \nRules.\n, cyclists in Denmark can receive a fine for cycling without lights after a certain time of day; using a hand-held mobile phone while cycling; having defective brakes, reflectors, etc.; cycling against a red light; cycling against the direction of traffic; cycling on a pedestrian crossing; cycling on the left side of a bicycle path; not respecting traffic signs or arrows; breaking the unconditional right of way; not signaling; cycling with no hands on the handlebars; cycling on the sidewalk or footpath; holding onto another vehicle; cycling with two people on a bicycle that only has one seat (both persons will receive a fine); or positioning oneself in the wrong place before or while making a turn. Cyclists can also receive a warning if their bell does not work. Even though there is no fixed blood alcohol level above which it is illegal to ride a bicycle, cyclists can receive a fine for cycling under the influence if the police assess that doing so would be irresponsible.\nIn intersections, cyclists wanting to turn left are not allowed to use the left-turn lanes that are meant for cars, but must cross the intersection first and turn left from there. If separate bike lanes are available, cyclists must use them. Bike lights must be lit after sunset until sunrise, or in case of bad visibility also during day time. Blinking lights are allowed with a minimum frequency of 120 flashes per minute (2 Hz). Blinking orange front-facing lights are not allowed (due to possible confusion with vehicle turn signals). All bikes sold since 1988 must have brakes on both front and back wheels.\nOwnership.\nIt's estimated over 70% of Danes own a bicycle."

        "text": "The men's sprint (track cycling) at the 1992 Summer Olympics (Cycling) was an event that consisted of cyclists making three laps around the track. Only the time for the last 200 metres of the 750 metres covered was counted as official time. The races were held on Tuesday, July 28, Wednesday, July 29, Thursday, July 30 and Friday, July 31, 1992, at the Velòdrom d'Horta. There were 23 competitors from 23 nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist. The event was won by Jens Fiedler of Germany, the first victory in the men's sprint for Germany as a unified nation since 1936 (though East Germany had won two gold medals since). Gary Neiwand of Australia took silver, the third time that nation had a runner-up in the event; Neiwand was only the fourth man to win multiple medals in the sprint (adding to his 1988 bronze). Canada earned its first medal in the men's sprint with Curt Harnett's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Four of the quarterfinalists from 1988 returned: silver medalist Nikolai Kovsh of the Soviet Union (now representing the Unified Team), bronze medalist Gary Neiwand of Australia, sixth-place finisher Erik Schoefs of Belgium, and eighth-place finisher Maxwell Cheeseman of Trinidad and Tobago. East Germany had been dominant through reunification of Germany; Bill Huck and Jens Fiedler had won the last three world championships, and the last time anyone not from East Germany had won was 1982. With only one cyclist per nation allowed, Fiedler was selected for the German team and was the heavy favorite.\nIndonesia made its debut in the men's sprint; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. France made its 20th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches along with the new qualifying round of time trials. There were five main match rounds, with two repechages. The first repechage had two rounds.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nThree men broke the Olympic record in the qualifying round, in sequence: Curt Harnett clocked in at 10.368 seconds, Gary Neiwand at 10.330 seconds, and Jens Fiedler at 10.252 seconds.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nHeld Tuesday, July 28. &lt;br&gt;\nTimes and average speeds are listed.\nRound 1.\nHeld Tuesday, July 28.

        "text": "The men's 100 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Daegu Stadium on August 27 and August 28. The event was won by Yohan Blake of Jamaica, who became the youngest ever world champion in the 100 metres at . The highly favored defending champion and world record holder Usain Bolt was disqualified from the final for making a false start. Seventy four athletes started the competition, with 61 nations being represented (18 of them in the preliminaries only). It was the first global final to be held following the introduction of the no-false start rule.\nThe four fastest 100-metre runners of 2011 were absent: Mike Rodgers (9.85 sec) and Steve Mullings (9.80 sec) had been banned for doping offences, while Tyson Gay (9.79 sec) and 2011 world leader Asafa Powell (9.78 sec) could not compete due to injuries.\nA preliminary round was introduced, where those entrants who had not obtained the 100 m qualification standard had to compete in a further qualifying stage before making it into the first round proper. This reduced the event to a three-round competition, as opposed to the traditional four, for qualified runners. Kim Kuk-Young (the host nation's sole entrant) was disqualified in this round for a false start. Abdouraim Haroun was the fastest preliminary runner, Keiron Rogers broke the Anguillian record, and while the slowest of the round was Sogelau Tuvalu, his time of 15.66 seconds was a personal best for the shot put specialist.\nUsain Bolt had the fastest time of the first day (10.10) while his Jamaican compatriots won three of the other seven heats. Christophe Lemaitre, Kim Collins and Walter Dix were the other winners. In the first of the semi-finals, Yohan Blake became the first man under ten seconds. Bolt won the second race as the second-fastest qualifier (10.05) and Collins won the third to become the oldest ever 100 m finalist. Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut became only the second junior athlete ever to qualify for the 100 m final, after Darrel Brown in 2003. The most prominent eliminations were Olympic silver medallist Richard Thompson (the fastest entrant that year with 9.85 sec) and 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin. Dwain Chambers (a 2009 finalist) false-started, while sub-9.9 sec runners Michael Frater and Ngonidzashe Makusha also failed to progress.\nIn the 100 m final defending champion Usain Bolt caused an upset by false starting – Yohan Blake had made a slight movement but Bolt was the one who left his blocks, being immediately disqualified. In his absence, it was quick starter Kim Collins who led for the first half of the race. However, Blake was strongest in the second half, taking the lead and sprinting to win the gold medal with a time of 9.92 seconds into the −1.4 m/s headwind. Walter Dix made up ground on Collins, with the American edging into the silver medal position at the line by a margin of 0.01 seconds. At old, bronze medallist Collins became the oldest ever world medallist for the men's 100 m.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 1 fastest (q) advance to the heats.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: +1.7 m/s, Heat 2: +1.2 m/s, Heat 3: -1.3 m/s, Heat 4: -0.9 m/s\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 3 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: −1.7 m/s, Heat 2: −1.7 m/s, Heat 3: −1.0 m/s, Heat 4: −1.3 m/s, Heat 5: −1.2 m/s, Heat 6: −0.7 m/s, Heat 7: −1.2 m/s\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the Final.\nWind:&lt;br&gt;Heat 1: −0.4 m/s, Heat 2: −1.0 m/s, Heat 3: −0.8 m/s\nFinal.\nWind: −1.4 m/s"

He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nMurphy attended Ohio University, where he was an All-American as an outfielder. He signed with his hometown Redlegs on June 12, 1954, and made his Major League debut the following day against the Brooklyn Dodgers at Crosley Field. In his only MLB plate appearance, he pinch hit for Cincinnati relief pitcher Jackie Collum against Brooklyn lefthander Johnny Podres and struck out. After a short tenure in minor league baseball, Murphy returned to the Redlegs that September and served as a pinch runner in five more games, scoring his only Major League run in his last appearance on September 13. He then spent two seasons in military service before resuming his minor league career in the Redleg farm system in 1957 and 1958. He retired after the latter campaign with a .192 career batting average and four home runs."

It is located in the heart of Ghazi Amanullah Town, a new suburb of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province.\nConstruction of the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal. The project was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing Ghazi Amanullah Town. The first phase of construction, which took a year to complete, cost $1.8 million, and included the completion of the basic stadium. A pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings were constructed later.\nIt is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, which is now a Full Member of the International Cricket Council."

It has been held since 1988 in four canoe and kayak disciplines for men and women. The four original disciplines were men's single canoe (C1), men's double canoe (C2), men's kayak (K1) and women's kayak. A women's single canoe discipline (C1) has been added to the world cup in 2010. The men's C2 event was removed from the world cup series in 2018 and it was replaced by the mixed C2 event. The mixed C2 event only lasted for one season, however. 2018 was also the first time that world cup points were awarded for the kayak cross (called extreme K1 at the time).\nCompetition format.\nThe world cup is a series of individual races usually taking place during the summer months of June, July and August. The athlete (or boat) that accumulates the highest number of points from all world cup races in the given discipline becomes the overall world cup champion. The scoring system as well as the number of world cup races have changed multiple times over the years. Currently the winner of a world cup race gets 60 points (120 points in the World Cup Final). The points for lower positions vary by discipline.\nVenues.\nWorld Cup races take place mostly in Europe, with the most common stops in Augsburg, Prague, Tacen and La Seu d'Urgell. On rare occasions there were World Cup events on other continents with Penrith being the most visited venue outside of Europe.

        "text": "The Indiana Hoosiers women's basketball team is the intercollegiate women's basketball program representing Indiana University Bloomington. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in NCAA Division I. The Hoosiers play home basketball games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on the university campus in Bloomington, Indiana.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nMaxwell era (1891–1928).\nThe Maxwell Era of Women's Basketball at Indiana University saw the expansion of athletic opportunities and acceptance of women as athletes. Basketball was integrated into the physical education curriculum followed by interclass competition and intramurals. Juliette Maxwell dedicated her career to the advancement of athletics for the women at Indiana University.\nThe 1922 Arbutus reported women's athletics had taken hold of the co-ed especially basketball: \"Basketball, the most popular sport of the Indiana coed, attracted more attention this year than ever before. More than two hundred from the freshman class alone tried out for team membership. Closely matched teams from all classes played a hotly contested tournament, which was won by the freshman without a single defeat.\"\nIn 1927–1928, the program was expanded to include within the Department of Physical Education for Women an Intramural Association, with a program geared to encourage participation in sports by the less highly skilled women students.\nDepartmental era (1928–1949).\nThe Departmental Era concentrated on the expansion of athletics by increasing the sports offered, hiring more faculty, and expanding the interclass and intramural programs sponsored by the department. Edna Munro oversaw the expansion of the intramural program, Collegiate and High School Play Days, Women's Athletic Association, Women's Recreational Association, and basketball interest groups.\nAround 1928–1930, the national \"Play Day\" program of non-coached intercollegiate sports competition for women was initiated as part of the National Women's Athletic Association's program. Indiana University's WAA supported the program and created opportunities for Play Days to occur for the next several decades. It entered its contestants in the annual state-limited gatherings which rotated yearly from one campus to another. These programs provided the opportunity for women to experience competition in a wholesome healthy atmosphere, devoid of bias and strong emotion. The success of the college-sponsored competitions influenced the Indiana University faculty to initiate \"Play Days\" for high school girls under their Girls’ Athletic Association organizations.\nWomen's Recreational Association era (1949–1961).\nDuring the Women's Recreational Association Era in women's basketball, the intramural program was changed to incorporate more women into athletics on campus. By the end of this era, 70% of women on Indiana University – Bloomington's campus were active in the WRA and athletics.\nExtramural era (1961–1971).\nThe Extramural Era saw regional competition grow. Teams representing Indiana University began playing in tournaments and series with other universities in the region including Butler University, Marion College, Purdue University, and Indiana Central College. A small budget helped keep these budding basketball teams afloat during this time.\nThe Indiana University Nurse's Team competes in regional competition. \"In spite of their busy schedules of classes and ward duty, student nurses take time out for basketball. The Nurses Basketball Team this year aspired to regain the championship of the Indianapolis Schools of Nursing Basketball Tourney. The team lost the championship in 1959 for the first time since the beginning of the tournament. The players compete with other girls’ teams in the area in addition to participating in the tournament.\"\nBy 1961, the extramural women's basketball team had begun to travel throughout the state to play in competitions. The basketball team was coached by Dr. Kay Burrus who helped expand the extramural sport system at Indiana University. The funding for women's basketball or women's athletics in general was meager at Indiana. This forced Burrus's teams to sleep in teammates homes and be responsible for their own transportation and food. Additionally, the women had to share uniforms among sports teams.\nBy 1969–1970 basketball season, the Hoosier women began to play by the \"men's rules\" for the first. In order to keep the basketball program within the budget, faculty served as game officials, referees, seamstresses, manages, and coaches without additional compensation for their time.\nVarsity basketball.\nIn 1971, Bea Gorton became the first head basketball coach for the Indiana University women's basketball team. Like other faculty members, Gorton did not receive compensation for her coaching position. It was considered part of her graduate assistantship while she worked towards her degree. In their inaugural season, they went 14–2, winning their first 12 games of the season before losing at Nationals to Immaculata University. In 1982, Indiana joined the Big Ten Conference for women's basketball, and the Hoosiers won the conference title with a 15–3 conference record, under Maryalyce Jeremiah (who was later named Big Ten Coach of the Year). Their season ended with a second round loss in the NCAA tournament to #8 Georgia.\nTeri Moren was hired as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers women's basketball team on August 9, 2014.\nThe 2015–2016 season was a historic one, despite having only one senior and a second year coach. The Hoosiers finished with a 21–12 record with a 12–6 record in conference play under Moren in her second year as head coach. She was named Big Ten Coach of the Year, the first Indiana women's basketball coach to do so since Maryalyce Jeremiah in 1982. Sophomore Tyra Buss was named to the All-Big Ten first team, with fellow sophomore Amanda Cahill receiving honorable mention. The Hoosiers finished a perfect 14–0 at home and finished fourth in the Big Ten conference, behind #5 Maryland, #9 Ohio State, and #16 Michigan State. After regular season play was over, the Hoosiers received a #9 seed and were able to participate in the NCAA tournament for the first time in 14 years. Indiana defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 62–58 for their first NCAA tournament win in 33 years before falling to #1 seed Notre Dame Fighting Irish.\nThe Hoosiers' 2017–18 season proved to be another historic season. Led by seniors Tyra Buss and Amanda Cahill, the Hoosiers compiled a 23–14 record and won the 2018 WNIT in front of a program record-breaking crowd of 13,007 at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. Considered to be one of the greatest basketball players to ever come through IU, Buss holds programs records for points, assists, steals, and free throws made, along with ranking third in Hoosiers history with 2,204 points behind only Steve Alford and Calbert Cheaney.\nFor the 2020–21 season, the Hoosiers advanced to their first ever Elite Eight of the 2021 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament before being eliminated in a 66–53 loss to Arizona. The Hoosiers finished the season with a 21–6 record.\nSeason-by-season records.\n\"For the entire season-by-season results, see List of Indiana Hoosiers women's basketball seasons\"\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Women's Basketball tournament.\nThe Hoosiers have competed in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament ten times. Their combined record is 11–10.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Hoosiers made three appearances in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 6–4. \nFacilities.\nWylie Hall (1890–1896).\nIn the beginning of Women's Gymnasium the basement of Wylie Hall was used. Beginning in 1890, physical training for women occurred in the room pictured above. This space proved to be difficult in regards to playing basketball. Six support pillars proved a safety hazard which caused the women to play basketball more cautiously than desired. In addition, Wylie Hall housed the chemistry laboratories so the fumes in the basement at times were almost unbearable. Other difficulties with this space included the fact that the hall and stairway remained unheated and became very cold in the winter months and the ceiling was very low in the women could almost touch the basketball rim. However, the women proved to be crafty in their method of accessing the gym.\nMitchell Hall (1896–1906).\nMitchell Hall was used after the women's gymnasium was moved from Wylie Hall and before the completion of the Student Building. From 1886 to 1906, Mitchell Hall was the physical activity center for the coed athlete. The women were permitted to use the men's gymnasium for their spring championship game which became an annual tradition and was opened to the public for a small fee in 1899 marking the first time at Indiana University women were seen performing athletic activities.\nFrances Morgan Swain Student Building(1906-1960s).\nFormerly known as the Student Building, the women used this building as the athletic hub of campus for several decades. Mrs. Joseph Swain proposed the Student Building as the Woman's Building and believed it should serve as a social center for the students at the university and proved an adequate gymnasium. After the completion of the building, the Women's Gymnasium took over the north wing of the Student Building which had an exercising room that was 80 feet long by 50 feet wide. It had a gallery overlooking the room for viewing the athletics. In this building, the athletic program for women continued to expand. In 1906, the inaugural year of the Student Building, the Senior girls organized a team. Their ignition of creating an interclass competition added much excitement among the classes. There were enough girls interested in basketball that two freshman teams were organized. They held a scrimmage between the \"Reds\" and \"Whites\" to determine which would represent the Freshman class in the interclass tournament. Juliette Maxwell and Mary Roddy acted as coaches for the teams. This form of interclass rivalry continued throughout the early decades of the 20th century.\nThe interclass competition created a system for women to organize themselves into teams. However, the best athletes in the program were selected for the honorary varsity team. The basketball photo in the 1922 Arbutus labeled the interclass competition \"As Thrilling as the Men's Game\". Basketball held the hearts of coed athletes as year after year a surplus of women tried out to represent their respective class teams. The development of the program led to more drills and practices for women to improve their skills.\nIt is unclear the exact date the Student Building ceased to be the main arena of women's athletics at Indiana University. It is known that in 1940 additions were made to Student Building which was still used as the headquarters for athletics. Sometime after this the women's athletics moved to the Wildermuth center which would have occurred after the Men's Gymnasium moved to its new facilities.\nWildermuth Field house (1960s–1972).\nThe Wildermuth Fieldhouse was used for the Men's Gymnasium and IU Men's Basketball Team starting in the 1928–1929 season. The Men's Basketball team relocated to the \"New Fieldhouse\" in the 1960 season and then to Assembly Hall in 1971. While documentation is unclear on the exact transition of Women's Gymnasium to the School of Public Health, it is known the facilities were used by coed athletes by the 1960s.\nAssembly Hall (1972–present).\nWomen's Basketball was played at Assembly Hall starting in 1972, but their program was not integrated into the Athletic Department until 1974. It was in 1974 that the university acknowledged the presence and included women's athletics as part of the Athletic Department and gave full support in the development of the program. This occurs two years after Title IX was passed. Assembly Hall has continued to be the home of Women's Athletics and especially women's basketball since the early 1970s."

He most recently played under contract with ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He has formerly played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Columbus Blue Jackets, New Jersey Devils, Anaheim Ducks, Ottawa Senators and Carolina Hurricanes.\nPlaying career.\nPrior to turning professional, Gibbons attended the Boston College where he played four seasons with the Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team which competes in NCAA's Division I in the Hockey East conference.\nOn April 4, 2011 Gibbons signed a two-year, entry level contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins worth $1.8 million at the NHL level.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Gibbons received his first recall by Pittsburgh and scored his first NHL goal in his debut game on his first shot on November 18, 2013, against Viktor Fasth of the Anaheim Ducks. He scored his first power play goal on February 3, 2014, off a deflection from Olli Määttä against Craig Anderson of the Ottawa Senators.\nOn July 4, 2014, Gibbons left the Penguins organization as a free agent and signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nOn July 1, 2015, Gibbons signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the New York Rangers. He was assigned by the Rangers to AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, for the duration of the 2015–16 season, compiling 23 points in 63 games.\nUnable to feature with the Rangers, Gibbons left as a free agent in the off-season. Unable to secure an NHL contract, he signed a Professional Try-out deal to attend training camp with the New Jersey Devils on September 15, 2016. He later signed a one-year AHL deal with affiliate, the Albany Devils on October 4, 2016.\nOn July 1, 2017, Gibbons after a successful tenure in the AHL, finally was offered and agreed to a one-year, two-way contract with the New Jersey Devils for the following 2017–18 season. In the 2017–18 season, Gibbons made a return to the NHL in surprisingly making the Devils opening night roster.

In the 2018–19 season, he recorded two goals and five points in 44 games for Ducks before he was placed on waivers on February 15, 2019. Unable to replicate his previous offensive totals Gibbons was then assigned to AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, however, before reporting he was traded by the Ducks at the trade deadline to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Patrick Sieloff on February 25, 2019. Gibbons made an instant impact with the cellar-dwelling Senators, recording 6 goals and 14 points in 20 games to end the regular season.\nOn July 4, 2019, Gibbons signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way $725,000 contract with the Carolina Hurricanes. Gibbons split the 2019–20 season, between the Hurricanes and AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers, going scoreless in 15 games in the NHL.\nLeft off the Hurricanes Return to Play roster, Gibbons as a free agent joined Swiss club, Lausanne HC of the National League (NL), on a one-year deal on July 28, 2020.\nLimited to just 17 games through his solitary season in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) with Linköping HC in 2021–22, Gibbons lefts as a free agent and continued his European career by signing a one-year deal with German outfit, ERC Ingolstadt of the DEL, on August 1, 2022.

        "text": "The 2011–12 Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball team represented Vanderbilt University during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Commodores, members of the Southeastern Conference, were coached by Kevin Stallings, and celebrated their 60th season in their current home arena, Memorial Gymnasium. After a 21–10 regular season that fell short of lofty preseason expectations, the Commodores captured their first SEC Tournament Championship in 61 seasons on March 11, 2012, by defeating Georgia, Ole Miss, and top-ranked Kentucky in consecutive days. In the 2012 NCAA tournament they defeated Harvard in the second round before falling in the third round to Wisconsin to finish the season 25–11.\nBefore the season.\nThe Commodores came off a 2010–11 season that ended with a second-round (first game) upset by Richmond in the NCAA tournament. This continued a recent history of tournament disappointments for Vanderbilt, whose last three NCAA appearances had all ended with a first-game loss to a double-digit seed.\nDuring the offseason, the coaching staff saw one change when assistant King Rice was hired as head coach at Monmouth. Rice was replaced by David Cason, a former player under Stallings at Illinois State who had spent the previous six seasons as an assistant with Tulsa.\n2011–12 outlook.\nIn a major offseason development, three of the Commodores' most important players—Festus Ezeli, John Jenkins, and Jeffery Taylor—all spurned the NBA draft and announced they would return for the 2011–12 season. Jenkins, the SEC's leading scorer in 2010–11 at 19.5 points per game, was chosen for the All-SEC first team. Ezeli, who averaged 13 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks in a breakout season, was named to the All-SEC second team, and was also named by multiple sources as one of the most improved players in the country. Taylor averaged 14.7 points while being named to the All-SEC second team, as well as the SEC All-Defensive Team. Ezeli, Jenkins, and Taylor were all named by \"Basketball Prospectus\" in its 2011–12 preseason outlook as among the top 20 players in college basketball, making Vanderbilt the only Division I men's team with three top-20 performers.\nThese decisions meant that Vanderbilt would return all five of its starters from last season, all of them seniors except for Jenkins, a junior. Another returning starter, point guard Brad Tinsley, led the SEC in assists in 2010–11 with 4.6 per game.\nThe Commodores thus were widely projected as a preseason top-10 team, with ESPN's Hall of Fame commentator Dick Vitale going so far as to rank them #5 in his preseason top 40.\nLess than a month before the start of the season, the NCAA suspended Ezeli 6 games after accepting a meal and hotel room from a Vanderbilt alumnus during a summer trip. He was able to practice with the team during the suspension, and was also eligible to play in the team's preseason exhibition game (but was unable to play in that game). Ezeli came off his suspension for the Xavier game on November 28; however, he suffered a sprained knee during a late-October practice, and did not return until the Davidson game on December 7.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12| Exhibition\n!colspan=12| Regular season\n!colspan=12| 2012 SEC tournament\n!colspan=12|2012 NCAA tournament"

Some of the world's most important golf trophies have been on display in the golf shop: the US Amateur, the British Amateur, the team NCAA Championship, the individual NCAA Championship, the Walker Cup, Western Amateur, PGA Championship, American Cup, and World Cups have occupied positions of prominence on the modest mantel alongside less imposing trophies from tournaments such as the Oklahoma Open and Oklahoma Amateur. \nIn 1998, architect Tripp Davis renovated Lakeside to its current layout. The golf course stretches over 6,756 yards, with SR 1020 bentgrass putting surfaces, Tifway 419 bermuda fairways, and tee boxes with a mixture of zoysia and Tifway 419 bermuda. The golf course wanders through mature blackjack oaks in the gentle rolling hills of north central Oklahoma.

As a player, he won two national championships playing college basketball with the UCLA Bruins and represented the United States national team in the 1970 FIBA World Championship. He was also the first head coach in UCLA women's basketball history.\nWashington, a guard out of Robert Smalls High School in Beaufort, South Carolina, played for coach John Wooden at UCLA from 1963 to 1966, where he was a key member of Wooden's first two NCAA championship teams in 1964 and 1965. As the sixth man of those teams, Washington helped the Bruins establish what is now known as a storied tradition. Washington was particularly effective in his two championship appearances, netting 26 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the final of the 1964 NCAA tournament and scoring 17 in the 1965 championship and earning a spot on the All-Final Four team.\nAfter graduation, Washington was drafted by the San Francisco Warriors in the eighth round (71st pick overall) of the 1966 NBA draft, but he never played in the league.\nIn 1970, Washington was a member of the U.S. team that played in the 1970 FIBA World Championship in Yugoslavia, finishing fifth. He was the second-leading scorer on the team, averaging 12.4 points per game and playing in all 9 contests.\nIn 1974, Washington was named the first intercollegiate head coach in UCLA women's basketball history. He coached one season, leading the Bruins to an 18-4 record behind star Ann Meyers.\nHe is the uncle of Major League Baseball player Jason Heyward."

On the left internal wall of the church, it is next to the earlier fresco \"Equestrian Statue of John Hawkwood\" by Paolo Uccello (1436).\nDescription.\nThe work is a fresco painted in monochrome to emulate a marble equestrian statue. The condottiero, the Italian Niccolò da Tolentino is depicted riding his horse, standing on a classical pedestal painted in geometrical perspective, and flanked by two nude men with coat of arms. The horse and the rider are painted in a different perspective than the pedestal. The horse (differently from the species' walking pattern) is portrayed while raising both left legs. It is a large and massive animal, inspired by the head of the ancient \"Riccardi Horse\" and to Donatello's \"Equestrian statue of Gattamelata\", a prototype of Renaissance equestrian statues. Andrea del Castagno had studied this earlier statue through drawings, never visiting its location in the city of Padua in Veneto.\nAs in Donatello's sculpture, the condottiero stares down the onlooker, to emphasize his power, command and determination in battle. The elegant hat and the flittering cloak area examples of the increasing taste for fine decorative elements in Florentine art, in contrast with the more austere fresco of John Hawkwood by Uccello completed some 30 years earlier.\nThe Latin inscriptions reads: "

        "text": "James Alston Paxton (born November 6, 1988), nicknamed \"Big Maple\", is a Canadian professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox.\nPaxton played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2010 MLB draft by the Mariners and made his MLB debut for them in 2013. On May 8, 2018, Paxton pitched a no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the first Canadian major league pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Canada. Following the 2018 season, Paxton was traded to the Yankees.\nAmateur career.\nNorth Delta Blue Jays.\nPaxton attended Delta Secondary School in Ladner, British Columbia. He played for the North Delta Blue Jays of the British Columbia Premier Baseball League (PBL) and for Team Canada at the Junior National level, earning a bronze medal at the 2006 World Junior Baseball Championship in Sancti Spíritus, Cuba. In his junior year, Paxton won 10 games and had a 1.51 earned run average (ERA) to go along with 100 strikeouts in 78 innings pitched. This led to him being named the top pitcher of the PBL and a first-team All-Star. After starting his senior year injured, Paxton finished the year with a 7–1 win–loss record and 65 strikeouts and 32 walks in 50 innings pitched. Both years Paxton's team won the league title and the B.C.'s Best Tournament.\nUniversity of Kentucky.\nAfter graduating from high school in 2006, Paxton attended the University of Kentucky, where he played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats baseball team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). As a freshman, he led the Wildcats in appearances with 25 and had a 2–0 record in relief with one save.\nIn 2008 as a sophomore, Paxton worked his way into the starting rotation midway through the season and earned 11 starts while making 17 appearances. He finished the year 4–2 with a 2.92 ERA. That same year he pitched a complete-game shutout over Ole Miss to clinch a spot in the SEC Tournament and earn SEC Pitcher of the Week honors. However, he did not participate in the NCAA Tournament due to injury. That summer Paxton was invited to play collegiate summer baseball in the Alaska Baseball League where he pitched in four games with three starts, finishing with a 1–0 record and a 2.25 ERA in 16 innings. He struck out 12 batters and allowed opponents to hit just .179 against him.\nPaxton started 13 games in 2009, finishing 5–3 with 115 strikeouts (5th best in school history) in innings. He drew the attention of Major League Baseball scouts as he was considered a possible first-round draft pick. Paxton was named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll every year he was at Kentucky. He held a 3.3 GPA heading into his senior year as an accounting major.\nPaxton was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the first round (37th overall) of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. However, negotiations with the Blue Jays broke down over a dispute about his signing bonus and he did not sign by the deadline. Paxton had intended to return to Kentucky for his senior season, however the Blue Jays president Paul Beeston had told the press that he had been negotiating with agent Scott Boras instead of Paxton's family, which violated the NCAA rules and Paxton was subsequently ruled ineligible after an investigation. He sued the NCAA in an attempt to be reinstated, but he lost the lawsuit in January 2010 and withdrew from school one semester shy of graduation.\nProfessional career.\nGrand Prairie AirHogs.\nAfter being ruled ineligible to return to Kentucky, Paxton signed with the Grand Prairie AirHogs in the independent American Association in 2010. There, he went 1–2 with a 4.08 ERA and 18 strikeouts in innings.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Paxton in the fourth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft but due to a lengthy negotiation, did not sign with the Mariners until March 4, 2011 for a $942,500 signing bonus. He began his professional career in 2011 with the Clinton LumberKings of the Class-A Midwest League, before earning a June promotion to the Double A Jackson Generals of the Southern League. He finished with a combined 6–3 win–loss record, 2.37 ERA, 131 strikeouts, and 43 walks in 95 innings pitched, while allowing an opposing batting average of .215 in 17 games. Paxton, along with Alex Liddi, represented the Mariners at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game.\nPaxton was invited to attend the Mariners' main spring training camp in 2012, but did not make the opening day roster and returned to Jackson, where he made 21 starts with a 9–4 record and 3.64 ERA. He played for the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League after the minor league season ended. For 2013, Paxton was promoted to the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he made 26 starts and was 8–11 with a 4.45 ERA. He worked with the coaching staff to change his pitching mechanics to mirror that of Clayton Kershaw, resulting in an improvement in his performance. \nOn September 3, 2013, Paxton was promoted to the major leagues for the first time and debuted on September 7 when he started against the Tampa Bay Rays. He allowed two runs on four hits and one walk in six innings to earn the win. His first major league strikeout was of Desmond Jennings in the third inning. Paxton made three more starts and finished with a 3–0 record and 1.50 ERA.\nPaxton began the 2014 season in the Mariners rotation, but after his second start of the season, he was placed on the disabled list with a left LAT strain. After a difficult rehab he finally rejoined the Mariners on August 2 and finished the season with 13 starts, a 3–4 record and a 3.04 ERA. Paxton's injury woes would continue into the 2015 season, hurting himself during agility drills in spring training and then was shut down on May 29 with a strained tendon on the middle finger of his pitching hand. After another long rehab he didn't rejoin the Mariners until September 13. Paxton made 13 starts for the second straight year, with a 3–4 record and 3.90 ERA.\nIn 2016, Paxton had a poor spring training, allowing five homeruns and a 10.80 ERA in 15 innings, causing him to be optioned to Triple-A Tacoma to begin the season. He made 11 starts in the minors, with a 3.73 ERA and was recalled on June 1 when Félix Hernández landed on the disabled list. He made 20 starts for the Mariners the rest of the season, with a 6–7 record and 3.79 ERA.\nPaxton started the 2017 season for the Mariners by not allowing a run over his first three starts, winning the American League Player of the Week Award for April 10–16. On May 5, he was placed on the disabled list due to a left forearm strain, returning on May 31. He pitched exceedingly well in July, going 6–0 and earning a share of the American League Player of the Week Award for July 24–30 and the AL Pitcher of the Month for July. However, on August 10, Paxton strained his left pectoral muscle pitching against the Los Angeles Angels, putting him on the disabled list once again. He returned on September 15 and finished the season with a 12–5 record and 2.98 ERA in 24 starts while tying for the major league lead in wild pitches, with 15.\nOn May 8, 2018, Paxton threw a no-hitter against the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. He threw 99 pitches while issuing three walks in a 5–0 victory, becoming the second Canadian to throw a no-hitter (the first was Dick Fowler of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1945). He was also the first Canadian Major League pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Canada, and the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to throw a no-hitter in a road game. He finished the season 11–6 with a 3.76 ERA in 28 starts.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn November 19, 2018, the Mariners traded Paxton to the New York Yankees for Justus Sheffield, Dom Thompson-Williams, and Erik Swanson. On April 21, 2019, Paxton became only the second Yankees pitcher (after David Cone in 1998) to strike out 12 or more batters in consecutive starts. In 2019 he was 15–6 with a 3.82 ERA in 29 starts, in which he struck out 186 batters in innings (11.1 strikeouts per 9 innings).\nOn February 5, 2020, Paxton underwent spinal surgery but due to the season being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic made it back for opening day. He made five starts, pitching to a 1–1 record with a 6.64 ERA and 26 strikeouts over innings pitched. He was shutdown after his August 20 start because of a strain of his left flexor tendon, causing him to miss the rest of the season. His contract expired after the season, making him a free agent.\nSeattle Mariners (second stint).\nOn February 18, 2021, Paxton agreed to a one-year, $8.5 million contract to return to the Mariners. In his first start of the season on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox, Paxton threw only 24 pitches before being removed from the game with left elbow discomfort. Two days later, it was announced that he would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending his season after only one game.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn December 1, 2021, Paxton signed a one-year, $10 million contract with the Boston Red Sox that included a two-year club option. On March 16, he was placed on the 60-day injured list, as he continued his recovery from surgery. He made one rehab start in the Florida Complex League on August 18, but suffered a LAT tear and was shut down for the season. Following the season, Paxton exercised his $4 million player option to remain a member of the Red Sox for the 2023 season. \nPaxton began the 2023 season on the injured list with a right hamstring strain and made his season debut on May 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He was named the AL Pitcher of the Month for June after posting a 1.74 ERA and a 3–0 record in five starts during the month. Paxton's success and contract situation allowed rumors to swirl that the Red Sox might trade him prior to the trade deadline. However, pushing for a wild card spot, as well as having injuries within the starting rotation, the Red Sox ultimately held onto Paxton. After the trade deadline, Paxton began to struggle, posting a 1–3 record and 7.62 ERA after the deadline, in sharp contrast to his 6–2 record and 3.34 ERA prior. On September 10, he was placed on the injured list due to right knee inflammation, ending his season. Overall, Paxton had a 7–5 record with a 4.50 ERA in 96 innings pitched. He became a free agent following the season.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn January 29, 2024, Paxton signed a one-year, $7 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, that also contained performance bonuses based on number of starts. The original deal was for $11 million but was reworked due to unspecified health issues.\nPitching style.\nA power pitcher with a long stride and a release from a closed position that hides most of his deliveries, comparable to a faster version of Andy Petitte, Paxton relies on a four-seam fastball that ranges in velocities in the high 90s miles per hour (MPH). He also complements his four-seam fastball with a cutter (high 80s MPH) and a knuckle curve (low 80s MPH). He has decreased the use of his sinker/changeup. His strikeout pitches are high fastballs and a low inside knuckle curve against right-handers. His increased usage of knuckle curves on the first pitch of at bats limited the number of hits and runs that he allowed during the end of the 2019 season.\nPersonal.\nPaxton and his wife, Katie, reside in Kirkland, Washington during the offseason."

        "title": "The Masters of Solitude",
        "text": "The Masters of Solitude is a 1978 science fiction novel written by Marvin Kaye and Parke Godwin. It initially appeared as a four-part serial in October 1977-May 1978 issues of the magazine \"Galileo\", and was first published in book form in hardcover by Doubleday in July 1978. A Science Fiction Book Club edition followed from the same publisher in November of the same year. The first paperback edition was from Avon Books in July 1979. The first British edition was from Magnum, also in 1979. Later paperback editions were issued by Bantam Books in 1985 (U.S.) and Orbit/Futura in 1986 (U.K.).\nThe book is the first novel in what was apparently intended to be a trilogy of the same name. The second novel in the series is \"Wintermind\", published in 1982. A third book by the same two authors, \"A Cold Blue Light\", in 1983, is sometimes listed as the third novel of the trilogy, but is unrelated. Unattributed comments indicate that the authors wrote a conclusion which their publisher declined to publish.\nPlot summary.\nIn the millennium after a global war, society in the former United States has splintered into groups. The main group in the story, the Coven, live in a pre-industrial Native American lifestyle, but one of growing population and power. Many members have mild telepathic powers, which opens the corridors of power to those capable of \"lep\". Lep allows the Coven to form larger social groups, but isolation from these groups drives one mad.\nThe other primary group, The City, retains their former technological lifestyle in the remains of the east coast megapolis. They spend their lives involved in immortal solitary scientific research, meeting rarely and communicating only when their research overlaps. The few thousand remaining City dwellers separate themselves from the \"dirty\" Coven through the use of the Self Gate, an electronic barrier that drives lesser minds insane. To protect idle attempts to breach it, the City also employs a small mercenary army to act as a police force outside the Gate.\nAlthough the Self Gate is designed to allow City folk to cross without issue, there is only one known example of this having happened. Judith Singer, a historian, learns that an ancient weapon known as the Girdle of Solitude is available in the ruins of a weapons laboratory in what was once Pennsylvania. She leaves the City in order to retrieve it, but soon after leaving she meets and falls in love with a young Coven man, Garrick. Garrick, heir to a wealthy apple-growing family of the Shando tribe, takes her as his wife. \nSome years later Garrick is hit by lightning, and gains lep for the first time. Looking to marry political power with his family's fortune, Garrick leaves Judith to remarry into a powerful family. His combination of wealth and power quickly makes the Shando powerful among the Coven, and rapidly improves their style of life to that of the late 19th century. Judith is heartbroken and eventually dies years later, alone and embittered. She leaves behind their son, known simply as Singer, who lives a self-imposed life of solitude.\nWhen rumours of the return of the plague reach the Shando, Garrick refuses to flee from the forests. Instead, he decides the era of isolation should end, and wants to open communications with the City. Standing between him is the mercenary army and the Self Gate. Garrick relies on two ideas to overcome the Gate. To approach the gate he will need to defeat the mercenary army protecting it, and decides to rally the disparate tribes of the Coven to build an army of his own. To attempt the Gate itself, he places his hope in the Girdle of Solitude that Judith told him about. And to achieve both of these goals he turns to Singer, who is rumored to have telepathic ability well beyond that of any Covener.\nSinger is captured and returned to Garrick, after briefly displaying a terrifyingly powerful lep ability. He refuses to take part in the plans, and Garrick is forced to turn to his second son, Arin, in whom he places little faith and generally dismisses. Arin assembles a party and sets off on his mission of alliance building. The party eventually reaches a non-Covener group, the isolationist Kriss, a fundamentalist Christian sect who live in and around the coal mines of Pennsylvania. Trapped in the Kriss town over winter by bad weather, the party slowly goes mad due to isolation from the larger group, culture shock, and Arin being forced to poison one of his group to prevent her from being stoned to death for her fornication with a young male Kriss.\nIn the spring the survivors set out on the final leg of their journey, traveling to the abandoned city of Lishin. Here they are attacked by \"the formless terror\", diseased rats. They bite Arin's best friend, who dies a horrible death. His death and resulting complete isolation drives Arin insane. In the aftermath, Arin wanders Lishin and encounters a member of the Kriss using a syringe to collect plague from the glands of dead rats. Using his own lep he drives the man insane, and learns through him that the Kriss leader is herding the plague in order to kill the Covens using biological warfare. Moreover, the mercenary army is actually paid for and led by the Kriss, and the army is only nominally involved with City.\nArin returns to Shando and relates his story. Garrick responds by gathering his army and attacking the Kriss at night, sealing the men in the mines and murdering all the women and children. He buys off most of the mercenaries by giving them the Kriss coal mines. He then turns his army on the remaining group, led by the son of the Kriss leader. They initially divide his forces and send them reeling after using a number of ancient flame throwers found outside the city. Garrick regroups, and is aided by a turncoat mercenary general who helps carry the day.\nMeanwhile, the Girdle has finally been retrieved by another Coven member and handed over to Arin, who turns it on and finds it to be a sort of invisibility device. He confronts the Gate and manages to make it through. Inside the City he is discovered and led to meet Judith's mother. He reveals that he is not Arin, but Singer. Singer had planted his own personality in Arin when they first met months earlier. It was the combination of the two personalities, Singer's self-loathing and Arin's youthful grandiosity evening each other out, that prevented the Gate from stopping him.\nThe story ends with the City providing a cure for the plague, meeting with Garrick, and ending the era of solitude. Garrick, unaware of his role in the events, gives up on Singer and banishes him. Arin and Singer meet some time later, and Arin asks why he refuses to take credit. Singer relates his hatred for Garrick, including the way that he ignored Arin, his little brother, simply for being the second son. He chose to make Arin the hero to correct this. He returns to his solitary life, the true Master of Solitude."

        "title": "1974–75 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1974–75 Ashes series consisted of six cricket Test matches, each match lasted five days with six hours of play each day and eight ball overs. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1974–75 and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Ian Chappell's Australians won the series 4–1 and \"brutally and unceremoniously wrenched the Ashes\" from Mike Denness's England team. It was Australia's first series victory over England for ten years and the experience proved popular as 777,563 spectators came through the gates and paid nearly a million Australian dollars for the privilege. For the first time the first day of the Third Test at Melbourne was held on Boxing Day in an Ashes series, now a cricketing tradition.\nChappell's team was labelled the \"ugly Australians\" thanks to his hard-nosed captaincy, intimidatory fast bowling and constant sledging as \"Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity\". Dennis Lillee had injured his back in 1973, but now returned to Test cricket with 25 wickets at an average of 23.94, but the real surprise was Jeff Thomson whose javelin throw bowling action generated exceptional pace and rearing bouncers that gave him 33 wickets (17.93). \"Wisden\" reported that \"never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls\". They received generous support from the fast-medium bowler Max Walker with 23 wickets (29.73) and the off-spinner Ashley Mallett with 17 wickets (19.94) as Australia won four of the first five Tests. Greg Chappell had already established himself as a world class batsman and cemented his reputation with 608 runs at an average of 55.27 and a record 14 catches. The opener Ian Redpath spent over 32 hours at the crease for his 472 runs (42.90) and Doug Walters became the first batsman to make an Ashes century in a single session since Don Bradman. The Australian fielding was exceptional as \"almost everything that left the ground was caught and ... had a swallow flown within reach of the Australian fieldsmen ... it would have done so at its own risk\".\nThe England batsmen were battered and bruised to such an extent that in one game a local player was used to make up an XI. The 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey was sent to reinforce the team on his record sixth tour of Australia and opened the England innings in the second Test at Perth a few days after his arrival and without any match practice. Denness's form deserted him for most of the tour and he became the first captain to drop himself from a Test match, but he returned to make 188 and win the Sixth Test by an innings, the highest score by an England captain in Australia.\nUmpiring.\nIan Chappell ... made it clear more than once that he regarded the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! I wonder what Ian thought might have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances it was hard to blame them.\nThe umpires in all six Tests were Tom Brooks, who had made his debut four years previously in 1970–71, and Robin Bailhache, who made his debut in the First Test at Brisbane. Brooks had been a fast-medium bowler for New South Wales and was forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but not in 1974–75. The only real point of contention in the series was the intimidatory bowling, particularly by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson of Australia, but also Bob Willis, Tony Greig and Peter Lever of England. As the series progressed the touring team and English press thought that the Australian umpires failed to apply Law 46; 'The persistent bowling of fast short-pitched balls at the batsman is unfair if, in the opinion of the umpire at the bowler's end, it constitutes a systematic attempt at intimidation'. Traditionally it was the job of the captain to restrain his bowlers if they became too aggressive, but Ian Chappell refused to do so and the Australian umpires were loath to give them official warnings. To be fair Chappell \"employed almost the identical tactics used by Illingworth and Snow in 1970–71\". Keith Fletcher and John Edrich (twice each), Dennis Amiss, David Lloyd, Colin Cowdrey and Fred Titmus of England and Wally Edwards, Dennis Lillee, Ashley Mallett and Greg Chappell of Australia were all injured while batting in the series. However, the umpires were willing to give the batsmen the benefit of bad light several times, particularly if Lillee, Thomson or Willis were bowling. In the First Test at Brisbane Bailhache told Lillee and Thomson to stop bowling short, but they did not and he offered the England openers the benefit of the bad light. As a result, Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's interference as it was not his job to tell his team how to bowl, Frank Tyson agreeing.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\nPreliminaries.\nFor when Mike Denness and his side went to the ground on the Wednesday morning, two days before the First Test, the pitch to their astonishment was a morass of black mud. They left the acting-curator and reigning Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones, clad in a yellow safety-helmet flattening it, roughly speaking, with a heavy motor-roller...Clem Jones is a regular Pooh-Bah whose energies are said to have accomplished much for the city of Brisbane; but as Michael Melford put it in \"The Daily Telegraph\" 'civic duties and curatorship do not easily blend.'\nBrisbane Tests were traditionally hit by torrential rain and in 1974–75 it fell heavily in the week before the match. The Lord-Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Clem Jones, sacked the curator at the Gabba so that he could prepare the Test wicket himself. Jones had recently been dethroned as Queensland's representative in the Australian Board of Control, but was still influential in the Queensland Cricket Association. He was a hands-on manager who even manned the turnstiles when he saw the need and had prepared wickets before, but not at Test level. His efforts were not helped by the downpour which turned the ground into sludge, and he admitted that the Test wicket \"was a bit crook at one end\". However, the scorching Queensland sun and an army of staff working day and night dried out the ground and Jones discarded the muddy wicket for the one used in the Queensland-Western Australia state game. E.W. Swanton thought that over use of the heavy roller on the soft ground had created a ridge at the Vulture Street end, producing uneven bounce, but Frank Tyson noted that only Lillee and Thomson were able to get the ball to rise above stump height and that it only became unpredictable on the last day.\nAustralia had several series wins behind them and the selectors Sam Loxton, Neil Harvey and Phil Ridings picked the regulars; the batsmen Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell (despite recovering from influenza), Ian Redpath and Doug Walters, wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, fast bowler Max Walker and leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe. The fast bowler Dennis Lillee had demonstrated his fitness after his crippling back injury of 1973 and was brought back into the team along with the surprise choice of Jeff Thomson, an inaccurate fast bowler with a slinging, javelin throw action. His sheer pace would be the deciding factor in the series, though many pundits thought the left-arm Geoff Dymock would have been the better bet. The leg-spinner Terry Jenner was another surprise as Brisbane was not conductive to spin, but in the end the regular spinner Kerry O'Keeffe was made twelfth man and Jenner played in his stead. Wally Edwards and Ross Edwards were brought over from Western Australia. Wally was an angular opening batsman in the style of Bill Lawry and Ross had made his name by scoring 170 not out at Trent Bridge in the 1972 Ashes series.\nEngland had left their best batsman Geoff Boycott and best bowler John Snow at home, but were still able to present a professional-looking team which had lost only one of its last eleven Tests. The tour selectors Alec Bedser, Alan Smith, Mike Denness, John Edrich and Tony Greig were slightly hampered by rain-affected practice matches and a line of niggling injuries; David Lloyd was out with a broken finger, Geoff Arnold with a strained shoulder and Chris Old with an injured hand. The captain Denness had just recovered from a mystery virus, Edrich from a back injury and Dennis Amiss and Bob Willis had thrown off groin strains. However, they had beaten New South Wales and were the first MCC team to beat Queensland since the war. Boycott's replacement Brian Luckhurst was chosen to open with Amiss, followed by the batsmen Edrich, Denness, Keith Fletcher, Greig, the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, the spinner Derek Underwood and the fast bowlers Willis, Mike Hendrick and Peter Lever.\nIan Chappell won the toss and elected to bat on the suspect surface. Though it is a brave captain who puts the opposition in to bat Chappell had a difficult decision as the wicket could dry out into a good batting surface later in the match, though the prevailing opinion was that it would be better not to bat last on an under-prepared wicket.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nA retrospective analysis of the Australian batting performance revealed that the recognised bats, other than the two Chappells and Edwards had reduced the art to technical absurdity; whereas the tail-enders has distilled it to simplicity. The scoresheet disclosed that no fewer than six batsmen lost their wickets hooking and pulling.\nBob Willis opened the bowling with a stiff breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) replaced him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In the end it was Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's block mark. Greig kept scuffing the block mark to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and in real trouble when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4\" Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.\nEngland – First Innings.\nI hadn't witnessed the full, frightening pace of Jeff Thomson until the First Test of the 1974–75 series against England. Rod Marsh, playing for W.A., had. 'He's bloody quick!' was Rod's verdict...There was a stiff breeze and I thought Max might use the new ball better. Maybe curiosity influenced me, but I gave the ball to Thommo. His first over was quick...I was standing beside Marsh as the ball thudded into his gloves. He tossed the ball to Greg Chappell at second slip – and wrung his hands. 'Something wrong, pal?' I asked. 'Christ, that hurt,' said Marsh. 'But I love it.'\nDennis Lillee opened the Australian bowling with the help of the wind and was a yard faster than Willis, but Jeff Thomson bowling into the wind was faster still and made the opening batsmen Brian Luckhurst and Dennis Amiss flinch from the ball leaping off the pitch towards their bodies. Luckhurst edged a catch behind to Rod Marsh and Amiss to Terry Jenner in the gully and England were 10/2 just as Australia had been, with Thomson (3/59) receiving enthusiastic applause from his new home crowd. The England vice-captain John Edrich dug himself in and fought off the short-pitched deliveries which battered his body and hands. His captain Mike Denness padded up to a ball that landed outside his off-stump and cut back under the new leg before wicket law which meant he could be out if the umpire was satisfied that the ball would hit the wicket even if it pitched outside the line of the stumps. Keith Fletcher was severely bruised on his forearm and fended off a couple of balls that landed just beyond the reach of Ian Redpath at short-leg. Thomson had now switched ends and with the wind behind him was bowling at extraordinary speed, Fletcher once edging the ball over the slips that almost went for six. After Doug Walters and Jenner had given him a rest Lillee (2/73) returned to bowl Fletcher, who cut the ball onto his stumps and England were 57/4. The Edrich family were well known for their tenacity and Tony Greig used his long reach to slash the short stuff over the head of the Australian slip and gully fieldsmen. As a result, they saw out the day with the score on 114/4. Strangely Ian Chappell did not ask for the wicket to be rolled at the start of the second day and neither did Denness at the start of the third. Edrich started the day making 2,000 runs against Australia, the seventh man to do so after Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond, Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington. Immediately afterwards Greig was dropped by Jenner off Lillee and Edrich, whose hand was so swollen from a bone broken on the previous day that he could barely hold his bat, edged Thomson to Ian Chappell at first slip for 48. Max Walker (4/73) was now bowling into the wind with the new ball and dismissed Alan Knott and Peter Lever, but \"Greig started slashing the ball all over the place on his way to a century and Underwood's nagging straight bat was defying everything we threw at him. Lillee, Thomson, Walker, Jenner...then through them all again.\" Greig (110) and Derek Underwood (25) added 58 for the eighth wicket when Chappell called on Doug Walters to break the partnership. The ball slipped from Walters hand and wafted towards Underwood, who was so used to the pace of Lillee and Thomson that he mistimed his stroke and gave a simple catch to Redpath in the covers for 228/8. Greig hit his 17th boundary then gave a fine edge to Marsh from Lillee at 248/9, the first England batsmen to make a century in Brisbane since Maurice Leyland in 1936–37, also the last time England had won at the venue. Bob Willis and Mike Hendrick added 17 runs for the last wicket until the latter gave a catch to Redpath off Walker and England were out for 265, 44 runs behind Australia.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nTo watch every ball of the 1974/75 Ashes battle was to see excitement and controversy at its height in the game of cricket: an Australian fast-bowling pair to rank with the greatest ever to pull on a pair of boots, catching the equal or better of anything I have seen in Test cricket, batting and captaincy to match anything Australian sides have produced since the war.\nThere was a considerable difference between the two Australian innings: six batsmen had lost their wicket hooking the ball in the first innings and this stroke was ignored in the second as Ian Chappell told his men to stay in. This cost them the initiative as it took 150 minutes to reach 51/2, with only 8 runs scored off the last 12 8-ball overs. The batsmen to fall were Wally Edwards, who was caught by Alan Knott off Bob Willis (3/45), and Ian Chappell who prodded a ball to Keith Fletcher off Derek Underwood (2/60). On the fourth day Ian Redpath was bowled again by Willis to leave Australia 59/3, but after this Greg Chappell (71), Ross Edwards (53), Doug Walters (63 not out) and Rod Marsh (46 not out) set about extending the lead. Chappell and Edwards added 114, without getting away from the tight bowling and defensive fields and Knott took his 174th Test catch off Willis to dismiss Edwards, thus breaking Godfrey Evans's 15-year-old record. It took some robust strokeplay from Walters and Marsh to bring the score to 288/5 in under 8 hours, Marsh hitting Underwood for a four and a six off successive balls before being dropped by the substitute Chris Old in the outfield and Walters hitting the 100,000th run for Australia against England on 199/5. Chappell declared 45 minutes before stumps to give England 335 minutes to make 333 runs to win, carefully timed to prevent a repeat of their shock win over the West Indies after a sporting declaration by Gary Sobers in 1967–68.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nLindsay Hassett ... said he thought an over bowled by Thomson at Brisbane was the \"best\" he had ever seen from a fast bowler.\nThough there was 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps they survived with 10/0 as a stormcloud loomed over the ground. Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over and umpire Bailhache told them they should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thomson bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen the benefit of the bad light. Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's interference as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. Brian Luckhurst edged Lillee (2/25) to Ian Chappell early the next morning leaving Dennis Amiss and John Edrich to bat, both of whom had broken bones in their hands from the first innings. Edrich took pain-killing injections in the drinks break, but was plainly out of sorts and was bowled by Thomson (6/46). Amiss received a brute of a ball from Thomson that he sent to Doug Walters at third slip. This brought Mike Denness and Keith Fletcher together at 40/3 and they resisted for an hour when the captain was taken by Walters off another Thomson thunderbolt, soon followed by Fletcher, caught by Greg Chappell off Terry Jenner (2/45). Tony Greig had come to the crease at 92/4, and much depended on a repeat of his first innings heroics, but he was dismissed for just two runs, by a yorker from Thomson. There was little hope of England lasting the day, but Alan Knott held out for two hours making 19, adding 29 with Peter Lever and 47 with the top-scorer Derek Underwood (30). When Underwood fell at 162/8, Knott and Hendrick soon followed and England were all out for 166 to lose by 166 runs, 84 minutes short of saving the game.\nThomson took 6/46, which remained the best Test figures of his career. \"Bowling at ferocious speed he claimed 6 for 46 - the highlight a searing yorker that removed first innings century-maker Tony Greig for 2.\"\nResult.\nThe unpleasant truth for England after Brisbane was that every curator at every Test ground would be seeking to quicken their pitches. There would be no respite from pace. There was no running to the medium pace end for a breather. We had seen the birth of a new pace partnership which can be as effective as Lindwall and Miller. The past demonstrated that these are the types of bowlers who win Test matches.\nAustralia won the First Test by 166 runs to take a 1–0 lead in the series. Worse for them Dennis Amiss, John Edrich and David Lloyd had broken hands, Keith Fletcher a badly bruised arm, Bob Willis a groin strain and Peter Lever had injured a side muscle. Before they left Brisbane the tour selectors sent back to London for a replacement batsmen and asked for the 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the fast bowling of Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Neil Adcock and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to have a man with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. The attendance over the five days was a record 62,000, easily beating the old one of 42,000 as the facilities at the Gabba had been greatly improved over the wooden stands and barbed wire 'concentration camp' of yesteryears.\nSecond Test – Perth.\nPreliminaries.\nMy father toured Australia six times (in 1954/5, 1958/9, 1962/3, 1965/6, 1970/1 and 1974/5) with immense success, winning friends everywhere. You have probably seen a photograph of the banner hung at the MCG, that tribute to him from his Australian fans. People still talk of his hundred in Melbourne on his first tour, and his highest first-class score, 307 at Adelaide. Six times he toured, being good enough at 20 and good enough at 40.\nColin Cowdrey arrived in Perth with the wives of the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a practice match and he was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching the record of the Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Frank Tyson, who had played with Cowdrey in the 1954–55 Ashes series and now commentating for the ABC was jokingly asked by fans if he would be recalled as well. The tour selectors were limited by the hand injuries to John Edrich and Dennis Amiss, but David Lloyd's finger had mended and he was called up to open the innings. Fletcher had a numb forearm after being hit by a Lillee bouncer in Brisbane and again by Alan Smith in the nets and was 'absent hurt' in the match against Western Australia, but had now recovered and kept his place. Peter Lever had a side strain and Mike Hendrick a fever and they were replaced by Chris Old and Geoff Arnold. More surprisingly Derek Underwood was replaced by the veteran Fred Titmus. Underwood had bowled some excellent balls in the First Test, but the WACA was a fast, true pitch with little turn and Titmus's ability to flight the ball was seen as an advantage, and his all-round ability would strengthen the fragile batting line up. The task of the Australian selectors was easier as they kept the same XI from Brisbane, but exchanged the twelfth man Kerry O'Keeffe for the off-spinner Ashley Mallett. Like Titmus Mallett was able to flight the ball, so Terry Jenner was made twelfth man and Mallett played. Ian Chappell won the toss and took the extraordinary decision to field, believing that the England batsmen were still demoralised from their experience at Brisbane and that a dose of fast bowling on the quickest pitch in Australia might break them. Also there was some moisture in the air which would help his swing bowlers. Only twice had a captain put the opposition into bat and won in Australia, Johnny Douglas in the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series and Richie Benaud in the Fifth Test of the 1958–59 Ashes series, both at the MCG.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"Mr Thomson, I believe? How good to meet you.\"\n\"That's not going to help you fatso, piss off.\"\nInitially it looked like Ian Chappell's plan to put England in to bat had backfired. Though Jeff Thomson made the ball bounce over Brian Luckhurst's head on several occasions, the Kent batsmen was 'smitten hip and thigh' and had a bone broken in his hand, but he and David Lloyd saw off the new ball and added 44 for the first wicket. Luckhurst now decided to make some runs and was caught in the gully by Ashley Mallett trying to drive Max Walker (2/49). Colin Cowdrey now walked to the crease to an ovation from the 16,000 crowd at the WACA, but not from Thomson when he arrived at the crease. He showed that he has lost none of his timing and that his bat was as straight as ever. Lloyd (44) took 10 runs off Mallett's first over and England were 99/1 when he slashed a ball off Thomson into the gully where Greg Chappell took a sharp catch. England now collapsed to 132/6; Cowdrey was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22, Keith Fletcher was beaten by Dennis Lillee and edged the ball to Ian Redpath in the slips, Mike Denness edged another ball off Lillee (2/48) to Greg Chappell also in the slips, Tony Greig repeated his slashing tactics of Brisbane, but smashed the ball into Mallett's stomach off Walker and was out. Alan Knott set about restoring the decision, making 51 out of 62 added with Fred Titmus in 70 minutes. Doug Walters (2/13) broke the partnership by having both batsmen caught by Redpath and the tail folded. Greg Chappell dived to knock a well struck ball from Chris Old off Ian Chappell's leg-spin and caught it on the second try and Geoff Arnold was run out by Walters and Marsh. England were dismissed for 208 a few minutes before stumps and Australia were on top.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nDoug Walters went to the wicket when Australia's total stood at 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of congratulations from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, was alone in the room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What the hell are you doing back here? I told you not to get out tonight'...\nIan Redpath and Wally Edwards saw off the new ball and were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was declined by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs in less than an hour when Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans as he left the field, as well they might as he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out first thing the next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed in to make 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared things up with 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nTruthfully, I enjoy hitting a batsman more than getting him out. It doesn't worry me in the least to see the batsman hurt, rolling around screaming and blood on the pitch.\nWith Brian Luckhurst injured Colin Cowdrey volunteered to open the innings with David Lloyd and withstood the wild first overs of Dennis Lillee (2/59) and Jeff Thomson (5/93). So many of the balls were short that only two or three had to be played each over and runmaking came slowly as the batsmen concentrated on survival. Lloyd was caught in the box by a bouncer from Thomson that failed to rise, doubled up in pain for five minutes and was helped off by the England physiotherapist Bernie Thomas. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, the bowler's 50th first class wicket, with the score 62/1. Mike Denness had replaced Lloyd and despite Doug Walters' low expectations, \"Oh Christ, don't tell me we have to put up with that Mike Denness for a couple of balls again\", he and Tony Greig lasted the day with his team on 102/1. After a rest day the innings resumed in 37 °C heat on the fourth day, but the game was effectively over when four wickets fell in the first hour. Greig repeated his slashing policy of the First Test until he was caught by Greg Chappell off Thomson. He was replaced by Lloyd who saw Denness edge the same bowler to Redpath, then Fletcher to Marsh to give him 3/8 in three overs. Greg Chappell caught Knott and Lloyd, Luckhurst came out to bat with his broken hand, but was caught by Mallett off Lillee after a stand of 63 with the gallant Fred Titmus (61). With nothing to lose Chris Old thrashed 2 sixes and 5 fours, taking 20 runs off one over from Max Walker and making 43 of the 64 runs added with Titmus for the eight wicket, which ensured that Australia would have to bat again. Geoff Arnold was Thomson's fifth victim and Greg Chappell took Titmus off Mallett (2/32) to give him a seven catches in a Test, breaking the record for a fielder held by his grandfather Vic Richardson amongst others. England made 293, forcing Australia to make 21 runs for victory.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nIronically, England whose fielding had been so lacklustre in the Australian first innings pulled out all the stops in the second, when they had no chance of winning. Geoff Arnold appealed for lbw against Wally Edwards on his first two balls, and was successful the second time round, but Ian Chappell and Ian Redpath made the necessary runs to end the match with 23/1.\nResult.\nAustralia won the Second Test by 9 wickets to take a 2–0 lead in the series. It was the first time that Australia had won two Tests in a series against England since 1961 and the first time that they had been 2–0 up against the old enemy since 1958–59.\nThird Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nColin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve – mainly because of the drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two-hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.\nBy long tradition the Victoria–New South Wales Sheffield Shield match began on Boxing Day at the MCG, much to the chagrin of the NSW players who missed Christmas with their families as a result. But with six Tests to fit into the season this game was moved and the Third Test was held instead, thus beginning the current tradition of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Australia kept an unchanged team from Perth, but the England team had a few changes. Dennis Amiss and John Edrich had recovered enough to play again after having their hands broken in the First Test at Brisbane, though Edrich's hand was still sore. The out of form Brian Luckhurst and Keith Fletcher were dropped to make room. Geoff Arnold and Chris Old were also dropped as the now fit Mike Hendrick and the spinner Derek Underwood returned to the team, Old somewhat unfairly as he had played well at Perth. This gave England only two fast bowlers, Bob Willis and Arnold, the medium pace and off-cutters of Tony Greig and the spin of Fred Titmus and Underwood. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was slower than it had ever been, with low bounce that would limit the effectiveness of the Australian fast bowling attack. Ian Chappell won the toss for the third time in a row and became the first captain in history to put the opposition in to bat in successive Tests. The day was overcast and as good for bowling as it would ever be at the MCG and Chappell was confident in the strength of his bowling attack and the fragility of the English batting.\nEngland – First innings.\nThe deterioration of crowd behaviour in Australia has been marked and easily observable over the last few years...Exhibitionists, generally in drunken stupor, invaded the pitches...attempted to run the gauntlet of policemen patrolling the perimeter. When they intruded upon the playing area to congratulate their heroes, their sincerity extended to trying to steal their caps or snitching a bail or stump whilst the umpire was distracted by his concern for the pitch...umpire Brooks and an intruder clashed physically in the centre of the Test pitch. The invader was sent sprawling in the centre of the wicket by an exasperated umpire, who was no doubt unwise to intrude into the domain of law and order.\nDennis Lillee (2/70) showed what could be done by swinging the ball like a boomerang in the first over and with his eighth ball turned Dennis Amiss around and clipped the shoulder of his bat to give Doug Walters a difficult catch at third slip. Jeff Thomson did not like bowling into the wind and was replaced after one over by Max Walker, who bowled three maiden overs, but had David Lloyd dropped by Walters as he and Colin Cowdrey slowly advanced the score. Thomson was brought in at Lillee's end with the wind behind him and gave Lloyd a rearing ball that moved on the leg stump, struck his hand and lobbed to Ashley Mallett in the gully to leave England 34/2. 40/2 at lunch. John Edrich came in with his still sore hand and for two hours the veteran partnership added 76 runs between lunch and tea. The 50 was brought up in 160 minutes by a Thomson bouncer that leaped over Rod Marsh's head for four byes and he struck Cowdrey on the chest and elbow with successive balls. Edrich snicked Lillee to Ian Chappell, who dropped the catch and split his hand between his thumb and forefinger, so had to leave the field for treatment. Just before tea two supporters climbed the picket fence and reached the wicket before Umpire Brooks removed them and the interlude spoiled Cowdrey's concentration. He misjudged a Thomson inswinger which he thought was passing him, but rapped his pads and he was given out leg before wicket for 35. In the next over, Edrich tried to glance a ball from Mallett (2/37) and was caught by Marsh for 49, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads he was given out by Umpire Bailhache and England were 110/4. Tea was taken when the wicket fell and Mike Denness and Tony Greig resumed after the break. As at Brisbane and Perth, Greig slashed away at everything and was dropped by both Ian and Greg Chappell. Thomson pulled up with a leg-strain and left the field, but Denness cut Mallett into the hands of Marsh and Greig was controversially run out and England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown the ball in from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7\" South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed that he had just made his ground, but Umpire Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. The innings now depended on Alan Knott, who made 52, and Fred Titmus who batted until stumps, which were pulled when Lillee bowled round the wicket to the Cockney spinner and Mallett took a catch off his bat-handle. Resuming at 176/7, Thomson returned despite the advice of the team physiotherapist as Knott and Derek Underwood made 39 runs in 38 minutes, the England wicketkeeper cutting with abandon. Thomson was bowling carefully to avoid further injury and was replaced by Walker (1/35) who an overconfident Underwood tried to drive only to give Marsh his third catch of the innings. Bob Willis slashed a ball from Thomson into the covers and Walters took a running catch over his left shoulder. Mike Hendrick hit two boundaries in his 8 not out and the innings ended when Thomson (4/72) yorked Knott with the score on 242 to give him 20 wickets in five innings.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nAt 3:30pm two umpires emerged from the players' race leading from the dressing rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed there was going to be more play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks does not have a beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. He hurried from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skilful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.\nThe second day had 54,000 spectators, but was affected by rain and bad light. Mike Hendrick took the second over and pulled a hamstring muscle with his fifth ball, tried a sixth and then left, injured beyond help for the rest of the series. England were left with only one fast bowler and Bob Willis gave an extended spell of seven overs and Derek Underwood was given the ball after only six overs, but strangely Fred Titmus was not brought on until after lunch, and then replaced Underwood instead of forming a spin twin partnership. Though Wally Edwards was clearly struggling Ian Redpath was happily playing the depleted attack, but when the umpires gave them the light at 3:13 pm the Australian batsmen walked off. At 3:30 pm a couple of hoaxers dressed up as umpires and \"sold the crowd a pup\" before they were chased off. Play resumed for two overs at 4:00 pm until a Willis bouncer and light rain convinced the umpires to stop play and the day ended with Australia 63/0. Willis stormed in the next morning and Edwards attempted a forehand smash against a rising ball straight to Denness at mid-off. Ian Chappell's hand was still smarting so Greg Chappell came in and tried to cut Willis through the gully, but the ball lifted and moved in and the ball was taken by the telescopic arm of Tony Greig at second slip. At the other end Titmus (2/43) floated a ball up to Ross Edwards that he edged to Colin Cowdrey at first slip and Australia were 68/3. Doug Walters hit a chancy 36 with the stationary Redpath, whose 55 took 242 minutes to make when Greig (2/63) dismissed them both to bring Ian Chappell and Rod Marsh together at a precarious 126/5. These two added 47 runs when Willis took the new ball and caught the captain lbw for 36, 173/6. Marsh (44) and the free swinging Max Walker (30) pulled Australia up to 237 when they were both caught by Alan Knott, a leaping dive to dismiss Marsh off Titmus and a simple snick to take Walker off Willis. Lillee survived a lbw appeal from Titmus, Ashley Mallett was run out by substitute Chris Old for a duck and Willis bowled Thomson and Australia were all out for 241, one run behind England. Willis took 5/61, his first 5 wicket haul in Tests.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nThis was the one occasion when Australia saw the vintage Amiss. There was no better batting on either side in the series than the 70 he made before lunch, chiefly with Lloyd in their opening stand of 115. For once Lillee and Thomson were hit and hit hard, and naturally their control faltered.\nAfter one Thomson over on the third day the gloom made the umpires pull stumps with England 1/0. Dennis Amiss had made his name as a heavy scoring batsman with tallies of 663 runs (82.87) in the West Indies in 1973–74 and 370 runs (92.50) against India and 220 runs (55.00) against Pakistan in 1974 with five big centuries to his credit. He needed only 93 runs to make 1381 runs in 1974 and equal the record made by Bobby Simpson in 1964. Here, on a flat wicket at Melbourne he showed his talent in Australia by making 70 runs in an opening stand of 115 in the first session against Lillee, Thomson and Walker. David Lloyd looked less certain and gave several chances, including a catch by Ian Chappell which the Australian captain indicated had hit the ground before he took it, much to everyone's surprise. Ashley Mallett (4/60) slowed the run rate and just before lunch tricked LLoyd (44) and had him caught and bowled when the left-hander tried to drive a turning ball. With the pitch taking spin Dennis Lillee slowed his pace and concentrated on swing and after swearing at the gentlemanly Colin Cowdrey was hit through mid-wicket where Greg Chappell leapt across his brother at first slip to take a catch. Jeff Thomson (4/71) took a spell of 3/13 in six overs, having John Edrich caught behind, Denness caught by Ian Chappell and Knott was caught behind. He hit Fred Titmus painfully on the back of his knee, which held up the match until he could struggle back to his feet. Ian Chappell caught Amiss off Mallett ten runs short of his century and 3 runs short of Simpson's record. Mallet also bowled Titmus for a 31-minute duck and had Underwood caught by the captain as England collapsed from 152/2 to 182/8. As at Brisbane Tony Greig restored the situation thrashing 5 fours and a six in his 60 and adding 66 runs with Bob Willis (15) for the ninth wicket before Greg Chappell snatched a catch off a ball heading to the third man boundary. The limping Hendrick came out to help add a few runs, but Willis was bowled trying to drive Thomson, who had now taken 24 wickets in three Tests, an average of four wickets in each England innings. The total of 244 left Australia 365 minutes to make 246 runs to win their third Test in succession.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nIn seven overs by Titmus and Underwood, bowling to normal containing fields, Australia added only seven runs...a protest against Titmus bowling to six leg-side fielders and Underwood operating without a slip. But what did they want – England to serve up the Ashes on a plate with, as Neville Cardus once observed, parsley around them?\nThere was only time for one over before stumps on the fourth day and Bob Willis conceded 4 extras, reducing the target to 242. The next morning Tony Greig (4/56) got Wally Edwards lbw for a duck as he shuffled across the wicket and in the following over Ian Chappell was lbw to Bob Willis (1/56) and Australia were 5/2. Ian Redpath (39) and Greg Chappell (61) resurrected the Australian innings with a stand of 101, but scored runs a crawl – 68 runs in the morning session – and Redpath survived two lbw appeals and was dropped by the normally reliable Denness. Derek Underwood (0/43) and Fred Titmus (2/62) were brought on, but found little turn and Chappell was the third man in the innings to be leg before wicket when a Titmus shooter hit him on the ankle. Redpath had been almost run out, but John Edrich's poor return allowed him to get home. Ross Edwards was caught by Titmus's spin as the ball kicked up, clipped the edge of the bat and was caught by David Lloyd, then Redpath's luck ran out and he was run out by Underwood and Knott when he crossed the crease without grounding his bat and Australia was 121/5. The spinners were now bowling with two slips, a short-leg and short mid-wicket, tied up Doug Walters (32) and Rod Marsh (40) and reduced the 40,000 crowd to silence. By tea Australia were 145/5, needing 101 runs to win in two hours, or about 28 overs. Greig replaced Underwood and appealed for lbw against Walters when a shooter got through, then had him caught by Denness at 171/6, but by 5 pm Australia needed 55 runs in the mandatory 15 overs in the last hour of the game. After some discussion between Denness, Edrich, Cowdrey and Greig the new ball was not taken and Titmus and Underwood – nicknamed \"Steptoe and Son\" – carried on with defensive fields to a displeased Marsh who refused to make runs in protest. After six overs Willis and Greig took the new ball and the latter had Marsh caught by a diving Knott on the leg-side. Marsh was reluctant to go and when Grieg theatrically pointed the way to the pavilion he was booed by the crowd. Max Walker (23 not out) and Dennis Lillee (14) thumped 22 runs off three overs from Willis and Underwood was brought back on to bowl the penultimate over with the England team spread around the outfield, which was a maiden. Greig bowled the last over with 14 runs or 3 wickets needed for victory. Greig's fifth delivery was no-balled as he had three fieldsmen behind square-leg – the rule introduced to prevent Bodyline. With three balls left and 9 runs needed Lillee drove Greig into the hands of Denness in the covers. Walker had crossed ends and his single off the penultimate ball ensured a draw and the final ball was a bouncer to Ashley Mallett. Australia ended on 238/8, 8 runs short of victory.\nResult.\nOn the whole the result was fair enough – the closest-fought draw in my experience in Tests between England and Australia.\nAustralia and England drew the Third Test, leaving Australia with its 2–0 lead in the series. Though England had yet to pass 300 runs in an innings in the series they had shown that they could reduce Australia to their level and it was a considerable improvement over the defeats at Brisbane and Perth.\nOne Day International – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nThe first ever One Day International had been played at the MCG to replace the washed out Third Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series. Four years later a match was organised for New Year's Day instead of the Melbourne Test usually played on that day, the Test being moved to Boxing Day.\nAustralian Innings.\nMike Denness won the toss and put Australia in to bat with immediate results as Wally Edwards and Ian Redpath were sent back to the pavilion with the score on 11/2. Ian Chappell hit 42 off 49 balls before Peter Lever caught him in the outfield off Chris Old (4/57) with the score on 65/3. Greg Chappell made 44 off 50 balls until Old bowled him, Ross Edwards and Doug Walters to leave Australia 139/6. Wickets now fell regularly as the lower order tried to add a few runs, but they were bowled out for 190 after 34.5 overs, leaving England to make 191 off their full 40 overs.\nEngland Innings.\nDennis Amiss had made the first two one-day international centuries and hit 47 off 54 balls out of the 70 run opening stand with David Lloyd (49). Amiss was bowled by Max Walker and Lloyd was run out, but more controversially the bowler Greg Chappell ran out Brian Luckhurst when he was backing up and England were 124/3. The big hitting Chris Old was promoted up the order and struck 12 runs off 10 balls before be was bowled by Alan Hurst (2/27), who was playing instead of Dennis Lillee. Off the only ball he faced Tony Greig ran three and was then run out, followed by Denness and Keith Fletcher who both fell nine runs short of victory. Alan Knott and Derek Underwood made the winning runs with the help of a few extras and 191/7 was reached with 23 balls to spare.\nResult.\nEngland won by 3 wickets and Ian Chappell and Dennis Amiss were made the two men of the match for their entertaining innings, even though they were not the top scorers. Oddly, the result was almost a mirror image of the first One Day International, when England had made 190 and Australia 191/5.\nFourth Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nIf Denness did not warrant selection from amongst seventeen players on the eve of the Fourth Test, the chances are that he was not good enough in the first place to have been in the touring party. It required courage to drop himself at Sydney. It would have been far more judicious act of courage to have refused the captaincy of the touring side to Australia when it was first offered to him.\nThe great shock of the Fourth Test was that Mike Denness became the first Test captain to drop himself for poor form. Percy Chapman had dropped himself for the Fifth Test in 1928–29 because of flu and Wally Hammond in 1946–47 due to fibrositis, but in both these cases the series had already been decided. England could still win the series by winning the last three Tests, or hold onto the Ashes by winning two and drawing the other. Denness had made only 65 runs (10.83) so far in the series and was desperately out of form, but his replacement Keith Fletcher was hardly a better bet with 45 runs (11.25) and had been dropped for the Third Test. The vice-captain John Edrich was put in charge, an old pro who had captained Surrey since 1973, but was unlikely to fire up the team or take any chances. Geoff Arnold replaced the injured Mike Hendrick, but Chris Old was made twelfth man and England went into the match with just two fast bowlers on a lively green wicket that made Frank Tyson \"worry about the safety of the English batsmen\". Australia made a change to their line up with the opener Wally Edwards being dropped after making 68 runs (11.33) in the first three Tests. He was replaced by the tall, athletic Rick McCosker who had made four consecutive first class centuries that season and 52 and 56 for NSW against the tourists. Unfortunately, this left Australia with only one opening batsman and McCosker was sent in with Ian Redpath on his debut, though admittedly on his home ground. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fourth time in a row (Edrich called heads, while Denness had always called tails) and chose to bat regardless of the help the wicket was due to give the bowlers.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nWhether or not Walter's misfortune put The Hill in bad way I can't say, but what with the beer and the overcrowding and the heat the denizens thereof had one of their noisiest, most refractory days.\nThe first ball was a leg bye to bring Rick McCosker on strike and he glanced the ball off his legs to bring up his first Test runs to the applause of the 52,164 strong crowd. He made 80 on debut and added 96 with Redpath as the England fast bowlers missed their chance with the new ball and the pitch proved to be truer than expected. McCosker edged a ball that fell short of Alan Knott, slashed another that was missed by Edrich in the gully and Redpath nearly ran himself out off a no-ball (photographs later showed that he should have been out). The England captain set defensive fields from the outset, with a third man and fine leg and only three close fielders and Australia were in little trouble. Redpath was hit on the hand by Bob Willis and finally out when he trod on his stumps off Titmus for 33, but McCosker made 80 when he was disturbed by the rumpus from the Sydney Hill. Fans were throwing beer cans at Tony Greig, one hitting him on the back, and Umpire Brooks had to intervene to calm them down and have the field cleared of rubbish before play could resume. McCosker's concentration was disturbed and he was caught by Knott off Greig (4/104) Ian Chappell was almost run out by David Lloyd for a duck, but made 53 before he was caught by Knott off Geoff Arnold (5/86). Ross Edwards came out at 199/3 to the disappointment of his local fans, who wanted their hero Doug Walters to come out and score a century as he had at Perth and had erected the famous \"Doug Walters Stand\" banner on the Hill. Edwards made only 15 in a stand of 52 with Greg Chappell when he played over a yorker from Greig two balls short of stumps and play was ended early at 251/4. This soon became 255/5 when Arnold took the new ball and nipped it back to catch Walters lbw, but Chappell and Marsh added 50 runs in 56 minutes. They were removed by the ever-combative Grieg, who removed Marsh's middle stump with a yorker and caught Chappell off Arnold when he looked set for a hundred to leave them 310/7. The Australian lower order made runs quickly enough despite being repeatedly bounced by Arnold and Grieg, who hit Lillee on the elbow and bruised Ashley Mallett's bowling hand. Fletcher told Lillee that he had been asking for bouncers the way he bowled and the fast bowler's reply made him complain to Umpire Brooks about his use of language. Two bouncers in one over resulted in Greig being warned for intimatory bowling, who asked if Lillee was restricted to one bouncer per over to him as well. Brooks saying that as Lillee was a tailender and Greig was a batsman the same standard did not apply. In the end Arnold dismissed Lillee and Walker, but Thomson hit 24 not out off 23 balls before Mallet was lbw to Grieg with the score on 405.\nEngland – First Innings.\nChappell, the grandson of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, one of the few Australian batsmen to fight it out with Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, and it was time to pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.\nThe England innings began with 10 extras from Jeff Thomson with Rod Marsh leaping behind the stumps in vain as one ball lifted over the heads of the batsman and wicketkeeper for four. Thereafter wickets fell regularly with the Hillites cheering on the fast bowlers, but it was Max Walker (2/77) who made the breakthrough when he swung the ball to the edge of Dennis Amiss's bat to see it superbly caught by Mallett in the gully. Thomson took a surprisingly good catch to dismiss Lloyd off a Lillee bouncer and then beat Cowdrey three balls in a row before the master was caught by McCosker at short leg. This left England 69/3, but Edrich and Fletcher saw the day out safely enough. One ball from the captain was driven full into McCosker's face, knocking him unconscious for five minutes and he was helped off the field. Mallet was brought on at the end of the day, but asked to be taken off after one over because of his bruised hand from that morning. Returning on the third day Thomson was bowling at his fastest and took 1/12 off five overs, having Edrich missed by Redpath in the slips, Greig caught by Greg Chappell and almost having Alan Knott out on the second, third and fourth balls he faced, dropped by Marsh, a caught behind not given and almost bowled by an inswinger. Fletcher was hit on the head by a bouncer and was caught by Redpath off Walker to leave England at 123/5, their top order failing again. After his escape Knott rode his luck and sliced 11 fours in an innings of 82, adding 57 with Edrich (50), 60 with Fred Titmus (22) and 33 with Derek Underwood (27). Knott and Underwood took 14 runs off one Lillee over and Ian Chappell had to set a defensive field for the first time in the series. The wicketkeeper was finally dismissed leaning back ready to cut the short ball and had his stumps flattened by a Thomson half-volley, but Lillee repeatedly bounced the tailenders and gave Bob Willis a beamer which fortunately missed his head. Willis was bowled by Thomson (4/74) and Lillee took the last wicket, having Underwood caught by Walker when he drove high into the covers. England were out for 295, having saved the follow on, which looked unlikely at one point, but still 110 runs behind.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nHis batting was disdainfully untroubled and his strength on the on-drive caused the English bowlers to revise their policy of pitching constrainingly close to the batsman's pads. Reaching a contemptuous fifty in eighty minutes, Chappell depressed the accelerator of attack and Australia cruised past the century mark in four minutes under two hours.\nEngland were dismissed just before tea, so the interval was taken early and Ian Redpath and Ian Chappell came out to open as Rick McCoster was still dazed from his injury, having fielded for only a few overs in the morning before he had to retire again. Chappell was caught by David Lloyd close to the ground off Willis, but there was no immediate appeal as Lloyd had hurt his bruised fingers and left to have them tended to when the Australian captain was given out. This brought in his brother Greg Chappell at 15/1 and he added 108 runs with Redpath by the end of the day, with 100 runs coming in 110 minutes. Resuming on 123/1 Redpath and Chappell took their partnership to 220 runs, a record for Australia against England in Australia, beating the 216 made by Bill Woodfull and Hunter Hendry back in 1928–29. These came slowly at first as Edrich set a defensive field and Arnold and Willis bowled accurately for the first 90 minutes. However, when they were replaced by Underwood, Titmus and Greig, Chappell increased the run-rate and when Willis returned the Queensland captain took 13 runs off one over. He made his first century of the series, 1,000th run of the season and was dropped on 136 by Underwood at deep fine-leg with The Hill braying behind him. He was out for 144 trying to hit Arnold for six and skying the ball to Lloyd at mid-wicket. Chappell had now made 122, 51, 58, 71, 62, 2, 61, 44, 84 and 144 against the tourists in the season, including the Queensland vs MCC match and the One Day International. Walters came in and tried to impress his fans with another Perth-like run feast, but tried to hit Underwood across the line and was bowled for 5. With the sluggish Redpath now setting the pace and England trying to delay the declaration the game drifted, but the opener was out for 105 in 344 minutes when he uncharacteristically hit out at Underwood (2/65) and was caught by the substitute Chris Old. A few runs later Marsh was nearly run out and hurried off to the pavilion as Australia declared at 289/4, leaving England 400 runs to win in 500 minutes.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nIn his recent book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a purposeful bouncer and I want it to hurt so much that the batsman doesn't want to face me any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere on and off the field was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.\nThe declaration became just before tea, which was taken early again, but storm clouds gathered over the ground and many of the 35,900 crowd left for home. The Umpire made a brief inspection, but declined to resume play due to the gloom and the rain promptly came down a few minutes later. However, the clouds passed over and the ground was cleared up quickly enough for play to resume at five minutes past five. Dennis Amiss and David Lloyd survived, making 33/0 by stumps even though they each gave an easy chance, Amiss hitting a full-toss in the still dazed McCosker's midriff, where he fumbled the catch and Walters dropping Lloyd in the slips. England began the last day needing 367 runs in 360 minutes and to everyone's surprise Amiss and Lloyd set about the bowling as if they meant to win. The wicket was now brown, slow and even without any spin and they reached 68/0 off 86 minutes. At this point Lloyd edged the ball off Thomson (2/74) to Greg Chappell, who took his twelfth catch of the series. Amiss gloved an unplayable, rearing ball from Lillee (2/65) to the predatory Marsh. John Edrich came in and ducked a Lillee bouncer that stayed low and gave him a sickening blow to his ribs. He was helped off the field by the England physiotherapist Bernie Thomas and taken to hospital for an X-ray. Colin Cowdrey steered an awkwardly lifting ball from Walker (2/46) to Ian Chappell and England were 74/3, effectively 74/4. Keith Fletcher was joined by Tony Greig who took the score past 100, but the Essex captain, having fended off a sharp bouncer the ball before, played back to a fuller delivery and was caught by Ashley Mallett in the gully. Mallett's hand had recovered enough for him to bowl and he took 2/3 after lunch, Knott caught by Redpath glancing the ball off his legs and Titmus was caught sweeping. To everyone's surprise Edrich returned to the wicket at 156/6; he had been told that his ribs were only badly bruised, but he moved with obvious pain (later tests revealed that they were broken). Ian Chappell promptly brought Lillee back into the attack even though he was not fully rested and the fast bowler gave the England captain two overs of short-pitched bowling. At the other end Greig had made a confident 54, but was stumped trying to drive Mallet (4/21). Underwood was caught and bowled by Walker and England went in to tea on 184/8. On their return Edrich played a captain's innings against Lillee and Thomson, controlling the strike and bringing up the 200. Lillee ironically bowled Willis with a yorker just after being warned for the third or fourth time about his short-pitched bowling to the tailender. By this time England were 211/9, but only needed to survive 10 overs for a draw. Arnold held out for 35 minutes and made 14 when he misread Mallet's spin and edged him to Greg Chappell. Edrich had batted for 155 minutes for his 33 not out, but it was not enough. England were dismissed for 228 and lost the Test by 171 runs and with it the Ashes. The crowd flooded the field as the players walked off and Australia started their celebrations.\nResult.\nI suspected that even the Australian administrators were praying for rain and the delaying of the final outcome of a series that was proving a financial bonanza. A draw in Sydney would do wonders for the Adelaide gate and takings; whereas an Australian win and the resolution of the rubber might cause a loss of interest in the remaining Tests.\nAustralia won by 171 runs to win the series 3–0 with two Tests to play. They recovered the Ashes having lost them four years before on the same ground in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Greg Chappell equalled Bobby Simpson's record of 13 catches by a fielder in a Test series.\nFifth Test – Adelaide.\nPreliminaries.\nA fresh pocket of black clay soil was discovered in the preceding winter and the whole Adelaide wicket area had been re-laid. A dispute between the cricket authorities and the local football players also meant that little of the Australian game was played on its undisturbed surface during the winter of 1974. The question about the Adelaide surface for the Fifth Test was whether it would be a pitch in the old tradition of batting excellence or a wicket whose unsettled nature would lead to bowling supremacy throughout the game.\nEngland had a good time between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness returned to form with 157 not out in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads and for the first time England won the toss. With the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nDoug Walters is not a creature of habit nor indeed the perfect cricket technician. He is a batsman who depends on his natural aggressive flair and his superb eye...While Jenner top-scored in Australia's first innings it was Walters who not only bore the brunt of the worst of the wicket but also scored freely in spite of the pitch.\nIan Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) upset the England plans by adding 52 in 83 minutes for the first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis struggled and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to have the advantage of the wind behind him. \"Deadly Derek\" (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – and he was able to make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions tailor-made for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damp patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skied it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball to Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not been out in the morning on such a poor wicket.\nEngland – First Innings.\nThe South Australia Test always coincides with the Australia Day week-end. Without fail the South Australian Cricket Association celebrates 26 January with a stirring flag-raising ceremony before the start of play. The flag-pole before the member's enclosure is erected and both teams, together with the officials and umpires, troop out to form a guard of honour on each flank of the President of the Cricket Association as he raises the flag. To a man, and woman, the crowd rise to their feet to sing the national song...the men placing their hats and hands over their hearts. Equally there was no doubting the sincere determination of the Australian team as they took the field with their caps set in a resolute angle over their eyes.\nAmiss and Lloyd lasted the few balls left on the first day and a couple of byes gave the 2/0. On the third day Lillee for once looked better than Thomson, who was working hard digging the ball into the soft pitch. Throughout the series Lillee had peppered batsmen with bouncers, but on this occasion he had Amiss caught by Ian Chappell off the third ball of the day, bowled at medium-fast pace and well up. Encouraged by this the Western Australian bowled with much greater skill and even when he crowded Cowdrey with off and leg side slips in Bodyline fashion he kept the ball up and was rewarded with 4/49, his best figures of the series. Lloyd was playing so far back that he was in danger of stepping on his stumps, but ended when he glanced Lillee straight behind to Marsh with England 19/2. The River Torrens Stand had a banner \"Denness' Last Stand\" and a trumpeter in the crowd played the Last Post when the England captain came to the wicket. Buoyed by his recent innings against Tasmania and NSW he struck 51 off 66 balls with 7 fours, using the square cut with effect. At noon the concentration of the batsmen was disturbed by the 21 gun salute from the barracks behind the Victor Richardson Stand, which held up play for five minutes. When play resumed Cowdrey was dismissed off a Thomson bouncer that swung in and flew off his bat high above Walker's head, only for the 6'4\" Victorian to leap up Aussie Rules style to take an 'impossible' catch. Thomson (3/58) also accounted for Denness a few minutes before lunch when an attempted cut went to Marsh, having made most of England's 90/4. Thus the Queenslander set a new Australian record for the most wickets in a series by a fast bowler, beating Lillee's 31 in the 1972 Ashes series. Terry Jenner's leg-spin was brought in after lunch, but Keith Fletcher hit him for 12 runs off one over and he was replaced by Ashley Mallett's off-spin. At the other end Tony Greig became Lillee's third victim when he slashed a ball behind for Marsh's third catch of the day at 130/5. The last five wickets fell in a daze as first Fletcher tried to cut Thomson two feet off the off-stump and was caught by Ian Chappell and Knott, Titmus and Underwood gave Mallett figures of 3/14 by trying to sweep him out of the ground, giving two catches to Lillee in the deep and Greg Chappell a record 14 catches by a fielder in a Test series. Lillee bowled Arnold for a duck and England collapsed from 155/5 to 172 all out, a deficit of 132 runs. It was a poor performance, the tourists were dismissed on a flat wicket inside two sessions and threw away the rain-given chance of winning the Test on the second day.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nAs in the First and Fourth Tests Australia were left to improve a large first innings lead and set England a target with a declaration. Rick McCosker was caught by the wicketkeeper off Arnold on 16/1, but there were few other problems for the home side who ended the day on 111/2. England could have taken more wickets as Fletcher and Cowdrey both dropped Ian Chappell, who hit Underwood for six, then made an indecisive drive-sweep that skied the ball to Knott for 41. In the intervening rest day the players were invited to the Barossa Valley vineyard of 'Windy' Hill-Smith, where Jeff Thomson sprained his shoulder playing tennis. The following day he found that he could not raise his bowling arm and that he was out of cricket for the rest of the series, having taken a remarkable 33 wickets (17.93) in four and a half Tests. To balance the books Bob Willis was also out for the rest of the series with his recurring knee cap injury. Redpath and Greg Chappell lasted the day, but were both out in the morning to Underwood (4/102) to leave Australia 133/4 as only 24 runs were scored in the first 12 overs of the day. Doug Walters (71 not out) and Rod Marsh (55) were more aggressive and took 10 runs off one Underwood over. Marsh swept the spinner, once for six, twice to see Knott spill a running catch and third to be caught by Greig. Chappell waited for a few more overs before declaring at 272/5, 404 runs ahead with 500 minutes of play left, very similar to the situation at Sydney.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nThe excitement and interest of the dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival was more than just occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed his nose at the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots even though he knew that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.\nThere were hopes that England could make the 405 runs for victory on the now flat pitch, but these were soon dispelled when Amiss, Lloyd and Cowdrey were out with 10 runs on the board and Lillee 2/0. Lillee (4/69) and Walker (3/83) were able to swing the ball and Amiss picked up his second pair against Australia, having done this before at Old Trafford in 1968. Cowdrey was taken by a low left-handed catch by Mallett in the gully \"that those who were not present would not believe\". Ian Chappell decided to feed Denness's favourite cut and stationed Jenner at fly-slip while Lillee bowled outside off-stump, the captain duly cut and was out for 14. The lanky Greig played over a low ball from Walker and by the end of the day England were 94/5, thanks mainly to Fletcher's 39. The following day Fletcher and Knott took 15 runs off Lillee's first over and their fifty partnership came up in 51 minutes against the spin of Jenner and Mallett. Lillee had Fletcher lbw on his return when a yorker hit the Essex-man's toe and he was reluctantly out for 63 at 144/6. Knott made his fourth fifty of the series and he and Titmus made 50 runs in even time. Jenner went round the wicket and bowled googlies at Titmus as if he were an off-spinner and rapped him on the pads three times in a row without playing a stroke, the third producing a lbw decision from the umpire. Mallett bowled a spell of 2/1 off 8 overs; Underwood caught at grass level by Ian Chappell and Arnold bowled, both making pairs like Amiss. This left England 217/9 and Knott quickly cut his way to a century, the first by an England keeper against Australia since Les Ames at Lords in 1934, Ames being at Adelaide to congratulate his fellow Man of Kent. He made an unbeaten 106 when Willis was out and England were dismissed for 241.\nResult.\nThere was no doubt in my mind that Adelaide represent the very nadir of the Australian tour...The reasons behind the ease of their successful loss were fourfold: unenterprising captaincy, bad England batting, a good Lillee bowling performance and a lack of penetration in the depleted touring attack.\nAustralia beat England by 163 runs to take a 4–0 lead in the series. Greg Chappell had taken a then record 14 catches in a Test series and Jeff Thomson 33 wickets (17.93), a record for an Australian fast bowler.\nSixth Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nThe North Melbourne Cricket Club, inspired by their president, the former Test 'keeper, Len Maddocks, launched the first morning of the game with a champagne breakfast in the sumptuous ballroom of the Melbourne Hilton Hotel. The five hundred breakfasters were a motley crew. They included state and federal parliamentarians such as Dick Hamer and Billy Snedden, trade union leaders of the calibre of Bob Hawke, former players like Neil Harvey, Bob Cowper, Richie Benaud and Sam Loxton and members of the cricket and business communities. The proceedings were compered in humorous vein by football commentator Lou Richards and the programme was televised live in colour with the proceeds going to charity. Tony Greig and Dennis Lillee each received awards as the main personalities of the series...\nInjuries affected the selection of the two sides for the final Test. Mike Hendrick was still suffering from his hamstring, Bob Willis from his troubled knees, so Peter Lever was brought in for Willis and Chris Old's good form was finally rewarded with a Test place instead of the veteran Fred Titmus. David Lloyd had an old football injury to his neck flare up and Colin Cowdrey took his place as makeshift opener. John Edrich had now recovered from his broken ribs and was recalled to the team in place of the out of form Brian Luckhurst. Jeff Thomson was out with his tennis shoulder and Australia brought in Geoff Dymock, a fast-medium left-arm bowler who had taken a wicket with his second ball the previous year at Adelaide. After top-scoring at Sydney the leg-spinner Terry Jenner was dropped for the return of batsman Ross Edwards. Despite the hot weather a thunderstorm wet the covers before the match and the groundsmen spilled water on the wicket when removing them in the morning, which would drastically affect play. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fifth time in the series and chose to bat, probably as he underestimated the amount of water on the wicket which was otherwise excellent for batting.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nWalker stole a single to mid-off and with his eye fixed exclusively on the swooping fieldsman, Denness, hurtled blindly towards the bowler's wicket. Umpire Brooks, too, was concentrating on the ball and fieldsman whilst moving towards the off side and was skittled by the batsman who flung himself in the direction of safety with little or no consideration for the safety of others. Walker beat Denness's return to the wicket, but at the cost of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force. Umpire Brooks, having been a first class bowler in his day was a man of some substance, and pound for pound was a good match for the burly Walker. Umpire and bowler toppled slowly to the ground and...resumed their upright position slowly...\nIan Redpath and Rick McCosker came out to open for Australia on another wet wicket, but this time failed to make the stand that saved Australia at Adelaide. They were not even able to claim that their wickets fell because of the damp patch on a fast bowler's length. Lever had increased his pace with age and was thought to be faster than Willis, but had dropped the ball short at Brisbane for figures of 0/111. Back in the England team he pitched the ball up and moved it in the heavy atmosphere to have both men caught by Greig at second slip. The English fielding perked up, Mike Denness set aggressive fields and it took 25 minutes for Australia to score their first run. In the Melbourne heat Geoff Arnold was replaced by Old after four overs, but Lever stayed on for seven overs and was rewarded with figures of 4/13 as Greg Chappell was caught in the covers by Denness, Ross Edwards was taken by Dennis Amiss at leg-slip for 0 and Australia were 23/4. The ball was now leaping dangerously, Ian Chappell had to fend a ball off his head and Greg had been hit on the chin. The captain decided that attack was the best form of defence and made 43 of his team's 66/5 by lunch, with Doug Walters popping the ball off Old to Edrich in gully with a frightful stroke. The exhausted Lever only managed two overs after lunch and Chappell and Rod Marsh hit 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Chris Old (3/50) had Chappell (65) caught behind after making a too fine a glance and bowled Marsh (29) for 115/7. Max Walker and Lillee hit out a few more runs, even turning down bad light so that they could continue play and get England in. The burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out they were both sent to the ground. Lever returned to remove Lillee and Mallett and Greig ended the innings by having Dymock out for a duck, with Walker 20 not out. Lever's 6/38 was his best bowling in Tests and Australia were out four minutes before tea for 152, easily their lowest score of the series.\nEngland – First Innings.\nDenness's 188 beat by 15 runs the next best score by an England captain in Australia. A.E. Stoddart's great innings on this ground just eighty years before. It was also the highest Test score made by an English batsmen in Australia since the war – a fact which escaped general notice at the time.\nThe gloom increased during tea and play was delayed regardless of the vocal protests of the 32,000 strong crowd, with some being arrested as they tried to invade the ground. When play resumed Amiss and Cowdrey – his 114th and final Test – came out to open. They stayed out long enough for Amiss to be out lbw to a Lillee swinger for his third successive duck and stumps were drawn at 15/1. In the morning Walker had Cowdrey caught behind off a ball that bounced surprisingly, but Lillee pulled up with a trapped nerve in his foot and was unable to play for the rest of the Test. With their two strike bowlers removed and the damp spot drying out Australia struggled and Denness and Edrich took full advantage, taking the score from 18/2 to 167/3 with a third wicket stand of 149 and overtaking the home side's total with ease. There were some difficult chances off the England captain, but it was the otherwise impeccable Edrich who was out for 70 edging Walker to Ian Chappell at first slip. The vice-captain was replaced by Keith Fletcher who had suffered so much in the series with Denness, but now proved that they were attractive batsmen when not faced by blistering pace and England were 273/3 by the end of the day. Walker bowled manfully and Mallett tried to stop the flow of runs, but when Walters and Chappell were brought on for long spells the game was up. Denness was almost run out on 94 and bought up his hundred with a leg-glance that just missed Marsh's gloves, but rode his luck well. He was only the fourth England captain to make a Test hundred in Australia after Andrew Stoddart's 173 in 1894–95, Archie MacLaren's 116 in 1901–02 and Peter May's 113 in 1958–59. When Walker finally had him out caught and bowled the next day he had made 188 in 492 minutes with 17 fours, still the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia. Denness and Fletcher had added 192 for the fourth wicket took take the score to 359/4, the first time England had passed 300 in the series. Fletcher made his first Ashes century in 333 minutes with only seven fours, though he and Greig added 100 runs in 71 minutes as the big South African started thumping the tired bowlers around the deserted ground. By tea the third new ball had been seen off and England were 496/4, a lead of 344. Discussion of when Denness would declare were rendered null and void when the bullish Walker ran through the England batting as the tourists lost 6 wickets for 33 runs after tea. The tall Tasmanian had already taken 3/131, but produced a spell of 5/12 as Greig was caught off a mistimed drive for 89 off 94 balls, followed later in the over by Fletcher for 146. Old was bowled by a shooter from Dymock, who bowled just as long and as well, but with no luck. Alan Knott and Geoff Arnold were caught behind glancing the ball and Underwood was bowled to dismiss England for 529, only their second score over 500 in Australia since Bodyline in 1932–33. Walker returned to the pavilion with figures of 8/143 off 42.2 overs, his best analysis in Tests.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nEvery Greg Chappell score is compiled with the maximum of timing, a straight elegance of backlift and an unassuming mastery of the bowlers. it makes the observer wonder whether the bowlers pose any problems of flight, spin and swerve to the younger Chappell. Throughout the series it was maintained that Chappell was never fully fit because of a tonsil infection. if that were the case one can only feel sorry for the bowlers when he returns to full health.\nWith Australia needing 377 runs to avoid an innings defeat Denness could afford to set an aggressive field, but to no avail as Redpath and McCosker made 32/0 when bad light stopped play. Peter Lever had caught a fever on the rest day and retired after three overs, to be replaced by Old and Greig. Though much of the pitch was flat the area around the damp patch of the first day was pock-marked and made the odd ball fly up and hit the hands of the batsmen, who were surrounded by slips, gullies and short-legs. McCosker took to hooking the ball over their heads and outscored Redpath so that when he edged Arnold (3/83) to Cowdrey for his 120th and last Test catch he had made 76 of their 111 in 108 minutes. Redpath (83) added another century stand with Ian Chappell (50) until the captain glanced another catch to Knott off Grieg (4/88), but was unsatisfied with the decision and stayed to argue with the bowler and losing his temper in the process before leaving at 215/2. Greig caught Redpath at close short-leg, but the England appeals were turned down and in his next over the South African saw 12 runs scored while Greg Chappell gave three half-chances. After 335 minutes Redpath was out for 83, hitting the ball to Amiss at short-leg, who took a 'golden catch'. Soon after Ross Edwards appeared to be lbw, but much to the surprise of the commentary box was given not out, having caught a tiny edge as he moved across the ball. Denness delayed the taking of the new ball as he hoped to use it in the morning when Lever was better, but was forced to take it in the evening to no avail as Australia reached 273/3 with the local press proclaiming \"WE SAVED IT\". Lever was back on the field, but it was Arnold who made the breakthrough, feeding Edwards his favourite leg-glance until he edged it behind to Knott. The Surrey bowler then made the ball cut from leg to hit Walter's off stump. When Denness caught Marsh off a Lever out-swinger Australia were 306/6 and struggling, but Chappell made his seventh half-century of the series and with Walker took Australia to 360/6 by lunch. After the break the tail collapsed, Walker got above himself and drove the ball into the hands of the bowler Greig, Lever moved the ball back nine inches to bowl Chappell (102) just after he reached his second century of the series and Mallett, Dymock and the injured Lillee failed to make any runs and Australia were suddenly out for 373 with three hours to spare.\nResult.\nMy last sight of Melbourne Cricket Ground was an impromptu little gathering on the outfield in front of the banner reading 'M.C.G. Fans Thank Colin – Six Tours.' The central figure, wearing a large straw sun-hat, was signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia.\nEngland beat Australia by an innings and 4 runs, but still lost the series 4–1 and with it the Ashes. It was the first time that Australia had beaten England since the 1964 Ashes series and the first at home since 1958–59. Mike Denness's 188 was the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia and, until Alastair Cook made 235 not out in 2010–11, the highest century by an England batsman in Australia since Wally Hammond's 231 not out in 1936–37. Alan Knott took six catches in the match and made his 200th dismissal in Tests, only the second wicketkeeper to achieve this feat after Godfrey Evans (219).\n1974–75 Test Series Averages.\nsource"

        "text": "Louise Erickson [Sauer] (June 2, 1929 – May 27, 2016) was a pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Listed at , 162 lb. (73 kg), she batted and threw right-handed. She was nicknamed Lou by her teammates.\nErickson had a brief but fruitful career as a member of the AAGPBL. In a three-year stint, she was a member of two champion teams and landed on the All-Star team two times. While showing an array of pitches and not being prone to walks, she relied on a fastball, curveball and changeup combination, mixing speeds in her curve sparingly, with an impeccable control over location.\nBorn in Arcadia, Wisconsin, Erickson used to play baseball with her father, uncles and five brothers at an early age. \"I had no previous formal or informal training in softball or baseball. Two of my uncles played weekend baseball and I was the tomboy shagging balls in the outfield\", she recalled in an interview.\nAfterward she was allowed to shag balls for a neighboring town team, which drew the attention of the manager, who recommended her to the league. She was invited to a tryout and immediately was assigned to the Racine Belles in the 1948 season, which was already underway. She was used in relief duties and collected a 1–0 record with a 5.74 earned run average and 11 innings of work in three appearances.\nErickson opened 1949 with the Rockford Peaches. She was added to the pitching rotation, becoming the third starter on an excellent staff behind Lois Florreich and Helen Fox. Erickson responded to more mound time with a 17–6 record and a 1.76 ERA in 216 innings, including seven shutouts, while ranking fourth in the league in wins and winning percentage (.739), gaining selection to the All-Star team.\nMeanwhile, the Peaches played a best-of-seven series with the South Bend Blue Sox, which Rockford swept, with Erickson defeating Jean Faut and South Bend in a two-hit, 1–0 shutout in Game 4. Then, the Grand Rapids Chicks and Rockford hooked up for a best-of-five series to determine the league championship, which was won by Rockford in four contests. In Game 3, Erickson beat Mildred Earp and Grand Rapids by a 5–2 score.\nIn the 1950 season Erickson went 16–10 with a 2.52 ERA, ending sixth in complete games (23), ninth in strikeouts (88) and eleventh in innings pitched (221), tying South Bend's Dorothy Mueller for seventh in wins, and also joined the All-Star team for the second consecutive year. She contributed at the plate as well, going 21-for-88 for a .239 batting average, more than three of the Rockford starting position players.\nIn the best-of-five first round, Rockford eliminated the Kenosha Comets in four games, with Erickson winning Game 3 while limiting Kenosha to four hits in an 8–3 victory. In the final series Rockford claimed its second title in a row, four games to three, over the Fort Wayne Daisies. In Game 2, Erickson limited the Daisies to five hits in a 5–2 victory, but lost a pitching duel against Maxine Kline in Game 6. Rockford wound up winning last game thanks to a 3–1 pitching performance by her teammate Fox. It would be the last season for Erickson. Overall, she posted a 34–16 record with a 2.13 ERA in three seasons, while going 4–1 with a 2.60 ERA in five playoff appearances.\nErickson retired from baseball for personal reasons. \"Everything was great, except the bus rides to the four state destinations. I could never sleep on the bus, so those trips got boring after a 126 game schedule – all night games\", she explained.\nLou married Burton Sauer in 1950 and became a housewife. Her husband was a postmaster and they produced a daughter and a son and two grandsons. In addition, she coached girls' softball in her hometown of Arcadia, Wisconsin.\nLou Erickson is part of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual personality."

        "title": "1998 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 1998 NRL Grand Final (also known as the 1998 Sydney SportsTAB NRL Grand Final due to sponsorship) was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 1998 NRL season. It was the first grand final of the re-unified National Rugby League and featured minor premiers and the previous year's Super League premiers, the Brisbane Broncos against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, who had finished the regular season ninth (out of 20) to make a top-ten play-off grouping. It was to be the first grand final under the National Rugby League partnership's administration and the last to be played at the Sydney Football Stadium. It was also the first time these two sides had met in a grand final. \nBrisbane scored first but by half time trailed Canterbury 10–12. However, the Brisbane side scored 28 unanswered points in the second half, winning 38–12 and equaling the second highest score for a team in grand final history.\nBackground.\nThe 1998 NRL season was the 91st season of professional rugby league football in Australia, and the inaugural season of the newly formed National Rugby League (NRL). The 1998 Grand Final's teams had played each other twice during the regular season, the Broncos winning both times. Also having won three of the past six grand finals compared with Canterbury's one meant Brisbane went into the match as unbackable favourites.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nThe 1998 Brisbane Broncos season was the eleventh in the club's history. Coached by Wayne Bennett and captained by Allan Langer, they started the season as defending Super League (Australia) premiers and posted their three biggest-ever wins in Rounds 5, 7 and 15 before finishing the regular season as minor premiers. After losing their first finals match, the Broncos won the next two to qualify for the grand final.\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nThe 1998 Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs season was the 64th in the club's history. Coached by Steve Folkes and captained by Darren Britt, they finished the regular season ninth (out of 20) before winning all four of their finals matches to reach the grand final. Canterbury's run through the finals was particularly impressive, coming from behind to defeat the Parramatta Eels in extra time in the grand final qualifier.\nTeams.\nBrisbane forward Peter Ryan missed the match for Brisbane through suspension. Ryan had been found guilty and suspended for three matches by the NRL Judiciary for a high tackle in the Broncos' semi final victory against Melbourne.\nOfficials.\nReferee Bill Harrigan was appointed to referee his fifth grand final, with Steve Betts and John McCormack appointed as touch judges. The video referee was Ian Parnaby.\nPre-match.\nAustralian musician Jimmy Barnes performed the pre-match entertainment with his son, fellow musician David Campbell. Julie Anthony sang Advance Australia Fair as she previously did before the 1987 NSWRL Grand Final.\nThe curtain raiser match on grand final day, saw Canterbury defeat Parramatta 26–22 in the President's Cup grand final, after falling behind 22–0 inside the opening 30 minutes of the match.\nMatch summary.\nWith the Canterbury side having last won a premiership in 1995 and the Broncos in 1997, most players in both sides had grand final experience.\nDespite good weather, the attendance of 40,857 was the lowest seen at the Sydney Football Stadium for a grand final since 1989. \nFirst half.\nThe Broncos kicked off and in only the third minute of the match, a tackle on Willie Talau twenty metres out from Canterbury's line saw the ball come loose. It was kicked ahead by Brisbane winger and last-minute inclusion (due to Michael Hancock's finger injury) Michael De Vere, who won the chase into the left side of the in-goal where he dived on it for the game's first points. Darren Lockyer converted to give Brisbane a 6-0 lead. A few minutes later the Broncos were denied a try in the same corner when Renouf caught a stray Kevin Walters pass to dive over, with video re-plays showing that the ball only appeared to travel forward because it was struck by a Canterbury defender. \nBy the eleventh minute, the Canterbury side had made it down to Brisbane's line and got a penalty in front of the goal posts. They opted to go for the kick and Daryl Halligan brought the score back to 6-2. Brisbane withstood further pressure on their line until Tony Grimaldi forced his way over under the posts in the twenty-second minute. Daryl Halligan converted Grimaldi's try to give Canterbury an 8-6 lead. Canterbury prop Troy Stone had to leave the field at this point with a broken arm, but would return ten minutes later with a guard on it to play the rest of the match. \nFive minutes later, the Brisbane side had the ball down at the other end of the field and after moving it quickly through the hands from the left hand side of the field out to the right, Kevin Campion forced his way over in the corner. Lockyer's attempted conversion from the sideline missed but the Broncos were back in front 10-8. Canterbury struck back a few minutes later when Steve Price stepped through an opening twenty-five metres out and gave the ball to Willie Talau to dive over on the right side, regaining the lead. Halligan missed his kick so the score was 12-10 in favour of the Canterbury side. \nNo more points were scored before the break.\nSecond half.\nLess than two minutes into the second half, Brisbane's Tonie Carroll crossed under the posts for Brisbane's third try, with Darren Lockyer converting to give Brisbane back the lead at 16-12. Eight minutes later Brisbane were in the centre of the field when Allan Langer threw a short pass inside to Steve Renouf who raced through into open space. He was tackled on the twenty-metre line but as the Canterbury defence scrambled to get back, the Broncos kept it moving, the ball going out to Wendell Sailor who dived over in the right corner. Lockyer's kick from the sideline missed so Brisbane led 20-12. \nIn the fifty-seventh minute, Allan Langer put a kick down field and Daryl Halligan picked the ball up in his own in-goal and he made it five metres into the field of play only to be forced back into goal by the Broncos chasers. Shortly after that, Brisbane seemed to have the game wrapped up when Gorden Tallis at dummy-half feigned passing and from close range forced his way over the try line under the posts. With Darren Lockyer converting, this gave Brisbane a 26-12 lead with twenty minutes of the match remaining. The Broncos' next try came in the sixty-ninth minute after getting a penalty down close to Canterbury's line near the left corner, taking the tap and passing it quickly through the hands out to the right side where Phillip Lee, the only Brisbane player to be playing in his first Grand Final, ran through a gap to crash over. Lockyer kicked the extras so Brisbane led 32-12. \nIn the seventy-fifth minute Brisbane, after playing the ball on their own twenty-metre line, got the ball to Langer who put a charging Tonie Carroll through a gap and into open space. Carroll ran forty metres before passing back in for Darren Smith, bound for Canterbury the following season, to run the remaining thirty-five to the try-line. Lockyer converted so the final score was 38-12.\nThe Clive Churchill Medal for man-of-the-match was awarded to Gorden Tallis. The victory also kept intact Brisbane's winning record in grand finals with four from four. It was the second time that the Broncos had won back-to-back premierships, having done so in 1992-93 as well. \nNo World Club Challenge match was played between the 1998 NRL and Super League champions.\nScoreboard.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;"

        "text": "The Hale America National Open Golf Tournament was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour that played for a single year, 1942.\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor and America's entry into World War II, the United States Golf Association's Executive Committee decided that it would be improper to play the 1942 U.S. Open. Additionally, the original site chosen for the event, Interlachen Country Club in Edina, Minnesota, opted not to serve as the host course. The USGA together with the PGA of America and the Chicago District Golf Association sponsored the Hale America Open in response to calls for a series of local tournaments to be played. It was intended to be a war-time substitute for the U.S. Open.\nThe event was held at Ridgemoor Country Club in Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois from June 18–21, 1942. The proceeds raised by the event benefitted the Navy Relief Society and the USO.\nThe tournament was won by Ben Hogan with a total score of 17-under-par 271, with rounds of 72-62-69-68. The runners-up, Jimmy Demaret and Mike Turnesa, were three strokes behind. Hogan received a gold medal and $1,200 in War Bonds for his win.\nControversy.\nSupporters of Ben Hogan and some golf historians maintain that this tournament should count as one of Hogan's major championships, since it was run just like the U.S. Open with more than 1,500 entries, local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities. Additionally, all of the big names in golf who were not fighting the war were in the field."

        "text": "Wang Qiang (; ; born 14 January 1992) is a Chinese tennis player. She has won two singles titles on the WTA Tour, one WTA 125 singles title, and 13 singles titles and one doubles title on the ITF Circuit. Her best performance at a major tournament came at the 2019 US Open where she reached the quarterfinals. On 9 September 2019, Wang reached her highest singles ranking of world No. 12, becoming the second-highest ranked Chinese tennis player in history after Li Na. Alongside Li Na, Zheng Jie, Peng Shuai, Zhang Shuai and Zheng Qinwen, Wang is one of only six Chinese tennis players to have reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament.\nCareer.\nWang was born in Tianjin. At age nine, she started playing tennis. That year, she became the promotion player for the Tianjin National Tennis Center. For two years consecutively (2006, 2007), she won the Junior's Tennis Championship in China. She officially started touring the ITF Women's Circuit in Japan as of 2007.\nIn February 2010, she was a main-draw player at the AOAO Sports charity themed 'Fiji Tennis Invitation Classis' [FTIC] created by Ademola Oduwole on Denarau Island in Fiji aimed at promoting girls sports. She defeated Christina Visico of the Philippines in the finals to win her $2,000 purse and a $4,000 Chris Aire watch donated by the Hollywood Luxury watch designer\nWang achieved her first big WTA Tour win at the 2013 Malaysian Open where, after qualifying, she beat top seed and world No. 10, Caroline Wozniacki in the first round.\nShe made her Grand Slam main-draw debut at the 2014 US Open from the qualifying tournament, and defeated Paula Kania from Poland in the first round 6–2, 6–0, before losing to Australian Casey Dellacqua in the second round.\nIn 2016, Wang's best results came at the major tournaments, reaching the second round of the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open. She also competed in singles at the 2016 Summer Olympics, but lost in the first round to two-time major champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.\nIn 2017, Wang reached her first quarterfinal at a Premier-level tournament, winning three straight set matches in Dubai (a Premier 5 tournament) before losing to Anastasija Sevastova. She finished the year ranked inside the top 50 for the first time, at No. 45 in the world.\n2018: Asian Games gold medalist, two WTA Tour titles, world No. 20.\nWang got off to a very slow start in the 2018 season, winning just one main draw match in her first four tournaments. She then reached the fourth round in Indian Wells, defeating former top-10 players Timea Bacsinszky and Kristina Mladenovic en route, before falling to world No. 1, Simona Halep. Wang struggled in her next tournaments, and her ranking dropped to No. 91 in the world.\nShe then reached her first quarterfinal of the year in Strasbourg, losing to top seed Ashleigh Barty. At the French Open, Wang upset the ninth seed and seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams in the first round, then defeated Petra Martić to advance to the third round of a Grand Slam event for the first time. However, she was then beaten by Yulia Putintseva. The only grass-court tournament she played was in Wimbledon, where she lost in the opening round to Zheng Saisai.\nWang won the golden medal in singles at the Asian Games defeating Jeong Su-nam, Gozal Ainitdinova, Aldila Sutjiadi, Liang En-shuo, and finally compatriot Zhang Shuai in the final.\nWang also had a great run in the Asian Swing. She won her first WTA Tour tile in July at Jiangxi, where she defeated Zheng Saisai in the final. After reaching the third round at the US Open before falling to Elina Svitolina, Wang won her second title of the year (and career) in Guangzhou, where she didn't drop more than four games in each match throughout the tournament. As a result of her Guangzhou triumph, she reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 34 and replaced Zhang Shuai as the highest-ranked Chinese player.\nThe next week, she competed at the Premier-5 tournament in Wuhan, where she defeated Maria Sakkari, eighth seed Karolína Plíšková, and Daria Gavrilova in the first three matches. In the quarterfinals, she defeated 2016 Olympic gold medalist Monica Puig in straight sets to reach the semifinals, but was forced to retire from the match against Anett Kontaveit due to injury. She became the first ever Chinese player to reach the semifinals at the tournament, and reached another new career-high ranking of No. 28.\nWang received a wildcard into the China Open in Beijing. As a Wuhan Open semifinalist, she received a first-round bye. She defeated the 2017 French Open champion Jeļena Ostapenko in the second round by 6–0, 6–0. In the third round, she beat Karolína Plíšková for the second time in consecutive weeks in straight sets. In the quarterfinal, she defeated Wuhan champion Aryna Sabalenka in two very tight sets. Her run ended in the semifinal, at the hands of former world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. However, her first ever Premier Mandatory semifinal earned her a new career-high ranking of No. 24.\nWang was seeded sixth at the Hong Kong Open. She defeated Zhang Ling and Christina McHale to reach the quarterfinals, where she faced top seed Elina Svitolina. Wang took a decisive lead quickly, taking the first set 6–2 and was leading 5–2 in the second when the match was suspended for the night due to a sudden downpour. She closed out the set 6–4 the next day, advancing to the semifinals; she defeated fourth seed Garbiñe Muguruza in three sets, coming back from a 1–4 deficit in the third to win 7–5. In her third final of the year, Wang was defeated by 18-year-old Dayana Yastremska in straight sets. On 22 October, she reached a new career-high ranking of No. 22.\nShe was awarded a wildcard to enter the Elite Trophy, but with withdrawals from both Serena Williams and Jeļena Ostapenko, she qualified for the main draw with her ranking. In her first round-robin match, she lost to Daria Kasatkina in three sets. She then played Madison Keys, winning the match in three sets. Later, Keys, as the winner of the group, announced her withdrawal due to a knee injury, allowing the second-placed Wang to play the semifinal match against Muguruza, where she won in straight sets. In the final, she was defeated by Ashleigh Barty. Her performance in Zhuhai saw her break the top 20 for the first time, and ensured she would end the year as world No. 20.\n2019: First Grand Slam quarterfinal, top 15 debut and career-high ranking.\nSeeded 21st at the Australian Open (her first ever seeding at a Grand Slam tournament), Wang defeated Fiona Ferro and Aleksandra Krunić, and then lost to 13th seed Anastasija Sevastova. This was her best performance to date at the tournament. At Indian Wells, she defeated 16th seed Elise Mertens and reached the fourth round, losing to the Canadian wildcard (and eventual champion) Bianca Andreescu. In Miami, she reached the quarterfinals, where she lost to second seed Simona Halep. At the Prague Open, she was seeded third, reaching the quarterfinals and then lost to Bernarda Pera. Wang failed to advance past the second round at any tournament during the clay-court season, losing in the first round at Madrid and Rome, and losing in the second round at Strasbourg and the French Open.\nAt the Birmingham Classic, she defeated Lauren Davis and then lost to Venus Williams in the second round. Wang subsequently withdrew from the Eastbourne International. Seeded 15th at the Wimbledon Championships, she defeated Vera Lapko and Tamara Zidanšek, before losing to Elise Mertens in the third round. This was her best performance at this major tournament to date.\nShe achieved a series of new career-high rankings over the course of the year, achieving the world No. 15 position prior to Wimbledon.\nSeeded 18th at the US Open, Wang defeated Caroline Dolehide, Alison Van Uytvanck, and Fiona Ferro to advance to the second week of a major event for the first time. She then upset tournament favorite and world No. 2, Ash Barty, in the fourth round, her first victory over a top-three player, to advance to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. She became just the fifth Chinese player in history, after Li Na, Zheng Jie, Peng Shuai, and Zhang Shuai, to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal, and the third to do so at the US Open, after Li and Peng. However, she heavily lost to eventual runner-up Serena Williams in straight sets, winning just one game. After the tournament, she rose six places to reach another new career high of world No. 12, becoming the second-highest ranked Chinese singles player in history.\nWang struggled following the US Open though, managing just two match wins on the Asian hard courts, one in Wuhan and the other in Tianjin. After failing to qualify or receive a wildcard for the Elite Trophy, she finished the year ranked No. 29, her second consecutive year inside the top 30.\n2020: Australian Open win over Serena Williams.\nWang opened her new season with a quarterfinal appearance at the Shenzhen Open and a first-round loss to Angelique Kerber at Adelaide. Seeded 27th at the Australian Open, she defeated Pauline Parmentier and Fiona Ferro to reach the third round, where she pulled off a major upset by defeating eighth seed Serena Williams in three sets, avenging her lopsided loss to the American at the previous US Open. However, she was upset herself in the fourth round by the unseeded Ons Jabeur. After the Australian Open, Wang played three more events, losing in the quarterfinals of the Hua Hin Championships, and the first round of both the Dubai Open and Qatar Ladies Open.\n2021: Rough start, first clay final, return to top 40, hiatus, out of top 100.\nWang returned to action on the WTA Tour in the Abu Dhabi Open but lost to Daria Kasatkina in the first round. This was followed by another two opening-match losses in the Gippsland Trophy and the Australian Open. Wang finally won her first match of the season against Maddison Inglis in the Phillip Island Trophy, but lost in the next round to Irina-Camelia Begu. Wang's next event was in Adelaide, where again she was able to get a round of 32 win, this time against Olivia Gadecki, before falling to Jil Teichmann in her fifth three-set loss of the season. Wang failed to get a win in the Middle East swing, losing to Jessica Pegula and Svetlana Kuznetsova, despite serving for the match against the latter. Wang played at Miami, where she managed to win a deciding set for the first time in the season, beating Aliona Bolsova, but fell in two tight sets to Markéta Vondroušová in the next round. Following this event, due to Wang defending a large number of ranking points, Wang fell to world No. 50, as the China No. 2.\nWang opened her clay-court season with a win over Anastasia Gasanova in the İstanbul Cup, however she suffered three consecutive losses after this; against Ana Konjuh in that same tournament, then Karolína Muchová in Madrid and Amanda Anisimova in Rome. However, Wang rebounded for the next event, the Emilia-Romagna Open, where she beat a top 100 player for the first time that season, defeating Misaki Doi, followed by victories over Martina di Giuseppe, Petra Martić, and Sloane Stephens to reach her first ever clay final and first final outside of China in three years. However, she ended up losing in a lopsided final, winning only four games against Coco Gauff. This tournament brought Wang back into the top 40 of the WTA rankings, and she regained the spot as the top ranked Chinese tennis player. She left the French Open with a second-round finish, again with a straight-sets loss to Coco Gauff.\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, she reached the second round defeating Verónica Cepede Royg. Her win over the Paraguayan bettered her Rio 2016 debut where she lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the first round.\n2022: Australian Open third round.\nFor the first time since the 2020 Australian Open, Wang won consecutive matches in a Grand Slam championship at the 2022 Australian Open by upsetting 18th seed Coco Gauff in the first round, and then defeating Alison Van Uytvanck. Wang backed this result up with a semifinal appearance at the Abierto Zapopan, when she fell in straight sets to Marie Bouzková, then a quarterfinal appearance in the Monterrey Open, where she was also beaten in straight sets, this time by Leylah Fernandez.\nAt Wimbledon, she defeated 14th seed Belinda Bencic in three sets in the first round, but lost in the next round to the unseeded Heather Watson. Wang headed into the Prague Open as the second seed in the qualifying draw, getting into the main draw in straight sets. She advanced to the semifinals, before losing to the seventh seed, Anastasia Potapova.\nPerformance timelines.\n\"Only main-draw results in WTA Tour, Grand Slam tournaments, Fed Cup/Billie Jean King Cup and Olympic Games are included in win–loss records.\"\nSingles.\n\"Current through the 2022 Pan Pacific Open.\"\nDoubles.\n\"Current through the 2021 Italian Open.\"\nWTA Tour career earnings.\n\"Current after the 2022 Abierto Zapopan\"\nCareer Grand Slam statistics.\nSeedings.\nThe tournaments won by Wang are in boldface, and advanced into finals by Wang are in \"italics\".\nHead-to-head records.\nRecord against top 10 players.\n\"Wang's record against players who have been ranked in the top 10.

        "title": "John Roderick (American football)",
        "text": "John Roderick (born \"John William Roderick\"; August 21, 1944) is a former professional American football wide receiver.\nCareer.\nRoderick played three seasons in the American Football League (AFL), playing two with the Miami Dolphins and one with the Oakland Raiders. Previously, he had been drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1966 NFL Draft and by the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the Redshirt phase of the 1966 AFL Draft.\nHe played at the collegiate level at Southern Methodist University.\n1963 SMU Mustangs • The 1963 season provided the SMU football program with one of its most memorable games when the Mustangs hosted fourth-ranked Navy and its heralded quarterback, Roger Staubach, on October 11, 1963, at the Cotton Bowl. On its way to a 4–7 season, SMU was given little chance to beat the Midshipmen. Little-known sophomore John Roderick rushed for 146 yards on 11 carries and scored on touchdown runs of 45 and two yards for the Mustangs. The SMU defense, led by Bob Oyler, Martin Cude, Bill Harlan, Harold Magers and Doug January, sent Staubach to the bench twice with a dislocated left shoulder. Trailing 28–26 with 2:52 remaining in the game, SMU had one last chance to pull off the upset. Quarterback Danny Thomas threw to Billy Gannon, who ran to the Navy 46. On the next play, Roderick took a pitch-out 23 yards to the 23. After a pass interference penalty against Navy put the ball on the one-yard line, Gannon plowed over right tackle for the winning touchdown with 2:05 left. The SMU defense held off Staubach's valiant effort to rally his team for one last score, as the Mustangs pulled off the 32–28 upset. Despite a 4–6 regular season record, SMU parlayed the victory over Navy earlier that season into a Sun Bowl berth against Oregon. Oregon defeated SMU, 21–14.\nSon sold his 1966 Dolphins playbook on an episode of \"Pawn Stars\" in 2012: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5rB0SvVfeM&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=PawnStars"

        "title": "Algerian Basketball Championship",
        "text": "The Algerian Basketball Championship, now called the Super Division and formally known as the ABC Super Division, is the pre-eminent men's basketball league in Algeria. National 1 is contested by 16 teams, with the two lowest-placed teams relegated to the Second Division and replaced by the two playoff winners. From 1963 onwards, MC Alger (21 titles) and WA Boufarik (9 titles) both dominated. Darak El-Watani won 11 titles but no longer exists.\nPlay history.\nBefore Algeria's independence, there were several regional leagues led by the French federation. The Algerian Basketball Championship was founded in 1962 when the country achieved independence. The first, second, and third championships were won by ASM Oran in 1963, 1964, and 1965, respectively. Capital clubs began dominating the championship starting in the 1965-66 season. USM Alger won three titles (1966, 1967, and 1969) over the next few years, with RAM Alger breaking their win streak by winning in 1968. Darak El-Watani pulled ahead with 11 titles, including six consecutive wins between 1977 and 1982. MP Alger won four times in the mid-1980s, and again in 1988-1989 under the name MC Alger. WA Boufarik won five consecutive titles between 1990 and 1994 and an additional three between 1997 and 1999. IRB Alger (later renamed OC Alger) broke the first streak by winning the championships in 1994-95 and 1995-96. WA Boufarik also won four Algerian Basketball Cups in the 1990s.\nThe GS Pétroliers dominated the first 20 years of the 2000s, first as MC Alger with titles in the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons; four consecutive wins between 2003 and 2006; and one in 2007-08. The team started its run under its new name, MC Alger, with three consecutive wins (2009 to 2012), punctuated by a loss to CSM Constantine, and another six consecutive wins (2013 to 2019) before the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted play. \nIn the 2006-07 season, there were six teams: WA Boufarik, CRB Dar El-Beida, WB Aïn Bénian, AS PTT Alger, MC Alger, and NB Staouéli. In the sixth minute of the second quarter of a mini-championship playoff game against DRB Staouéli, MC Alger left the court while the score was 28-21 in favor of DRB Staouéli. International referee Noureddine Chachoua awarded MC Alger a loss by penalty, allowing DRB Staouéli to win the championship for the first time. Two seasons later, AS PPT Alger also won the title after defeating GS Pétroliers in a mini-championship 2nd tournament playoff in Hydra. At halftime, the score was 45-31 and increased to 81-81 by the end of the game with three seconds left. Faycal Belkhodja was able to score three points, taking the win for GS Pétroliers. \nThe final match (best of three) system, which had been absent for most of the early 2000s, returned in the 2010–11 season. The GS Pétroliers swept CRB Dar Beida in the finals. The competition system changed again; now, a tournament of 16 clubs would play 30 matches each. The club that came first in points was crowned champion. The GS Pétroliers beat US Sétif (107–65) to win their second consecutive title. They also won the Algerian Basketball Cup for the second consecutive time. \nThe 2012-13 season brought another competition system change. Twenty clubs returned and four new ones joined. They were divided into groups A and B, with each group playing 18 matches as part of phase one. In phase two, the first four teams of each group moved on to the playoffs. The remaining teams were up for relegation. CSM Constantine beat GS Pétroliers 2-1 and won the title for the first time. The team went on to represent Algeria at the 2013 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup. By the start of the next season, CSM Constantine had lost most of its star players and GS Pétroliers returned to win the title for four consecutive seasons, in addition to four consecutive cup wins. Due to its winning streak and sponsorship from Sonatrach, GS Pétroliers was the only club not to struggle with financial issues in the early 2010s.\nClubs.\nThe following is a list of clubs that participated in the 2023-24 season:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTitle holders.\nBelow is the list of the champions since the first edition in 1962-63. MC Alger and WA Boufarik have historically been rivals due to both teams' high win count."

        "text": "South Shields was a semi-professional rugby league club. The club was based in South Shields then in County Durham at the mouth of the River Tyne, England.\nThe club played semi-professional rugby league for a total of two seasons, 1902–03 and 1903–04, joining direct from foundation. They were voted out of the league at the end of season 1903–04.\nHistory.\nEarly Days.\nThere had already been rugby league teams based on Tyneside just after the rugby schism that resulted in the formation of rugby league, Wallsend RFC, but they had not had great success.\nSouth Shields were founded in 1902. They had not played in any league when elected to the Rugby Football League 2nd Division for the 1902–03 season.\nNorthern Union.\nAt the end of the 1901–02 season, the County Leagues elected 18 teams to join the new Division 2 (7 from Lancashire and 10 from Yorkshire and new member South Shields) with the existing second competition scrapped.\nIn their first season of 1902–03 South Shields finished a lowly 14th out of 18 clubs.\nIn their second and last season, 1903–04, they again had a poor season and finished 15th out of 17 clubs.\nAlthough there is virtually no evidence, it is suspected that South Shields Rugby League Club had failed to attract any reasonable attendances or generate sufficient income, due probably to apathy on behalf of the population. The same apathy had resulted in the same two problems affecting the several Association football clubs who had gone both before and after them, and all of which had gone into liquidation, administration or bankruptcy. South Shields Rugby Club were voted out of the league at the end of season 1903–04.\nStadium.\nSouth Shields played at Horsley Hill in North East South Shields, quite near the sea front.\nAfter the demise of South Shields Rugby Club, the newly formed South Shields Adelaide AFC. took over the former rugby ground, early in 1905 for an annual rental of £30. This action almost caused the demise of Adelaide as well, as a promised loan for this purpose failed to materialise. It was left to a local solicitor, Victor Grunhut, to loan the money to the club, a simple loan of £35 on a simple IOU, payable within three months.\nA third South Shield FC emerged in 1936, also playing initially at Horsley Hill, which by this time had become a greyhound stadium.\nThe stadium closed to Greyhound Racing in 1966, remaining as ‘The Dog’s Bowl’ bowling alley until it was demolished in the late 70's. A jet filling station had been built on the car park at the junction of Horsley Hill Road and Westcott Avenue.\nAfter demolition, the area was redeveloped for housing.\nClub League Record.\nThe league positions for South Shields for the 3 years in which they played semi-professional rugby league are given in the following table:-\nHeading Abbreviations\nRL = Single Division; Pl = Games played; W = Win; D = Draw; L = Lose; PF = Points for; PA = Points against; Diff = Points difference (+ or -); Pts = League points\n% Pts = A percentage system was used to determine league positions due to clubs playing varying number of fixtures and against different opponents \nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nSeveral fixtures &amp; results.\nThe following are just a few of South Shields fixtures during the two seasons in which they played (semi) professional Rugby League."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni",
        "text": "The Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni is a Renaissance sculpture in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, Italy, created by Andrea del Verrocchio in 1480–1488. Portraying the condottiero Bartolomeo Colleoni (who served for a long time under the Republic of Venice), it has a height of 395 cm excluding the pedestal. It is the second major equestrian statue of the Italian Renaissance, after Donatello's equestrian statue of Gattamelata (1453).\nHistory.\nIn 1475, the Condottiero Colleoni, a former Captain General of the Republic of Venice, died and by his will left a substantial part of his estate to the Republic on condition that a statue of himself should be commissioned and set up in the Piazza San Marco. In 1479 the Republic announced that it would accept the legacy, but that (as statues were not permitted in the Piazza) the statue would be placed in the open space in front of the \"Scuola\" of San Marco. A competition was arranged to enable a sculptor to be selected. Three sculptors competed for the contract, Verrocchio from Florence, Alessandro Leopardi from Venice and Bartolomeo Vellano from Padua. Verrocchio made a model of his proposed sculpture using wood and black leather, while the others made models of wax and terracotta. The three models were exhibited in Venice in 1483 and the contract was awarded to Verrocchio. He then opened a workshop in Venice and made the final wax model which was ready to be cast in bronze, but he died in 1488, before this was done. \nHe had asked that his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who was then in charge of his workshop in Florence, should be entrusted with the finishing of the statue, but the Venetian state after considerable delay commissioned Alessandro Leopardi to do this. In 1496, the statue was erected on a pedestal made by Leopardi in the Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo, where it stands today.\nDescription.\nVerrocchio based the sculpture on Donatello's statue of Gattamelata, as well as on the ancient statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, the St. Mark's Horses in Venice, the Regisole (a late antiquity work in Pavia, now lost), and the frescoes of the \"Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood\" by Paolo Uccello and of the \"Equestrian Monument of Niccolò da Tolentino\" by Andrea del Castagno.\nThe main problem he had to face was of statics: representing the horse while moving, with a raised leg, could cause stability problems due to the excessive weight of the bronze being supported only by three relatively thin legs. Donatello, in his monument at Padua, had partially solved the problem by putting the raised leg on a sphere. Verrocchio was the first to solve the problem in having the horse supported by three legs.\nAlthough it was not placed where Colleoni had intended, art historian Passavent emphasised how fine it looks in its actual position, writing that \"the magnificent sense of movement in this figure is shown to superb advantage in its present setting\" and that, as sculpture, \"it far surpasses anything the century had yet aspired to or thought possible\". He points out that both man and horse are equally fine and together are inseparable parts of the sculpture.\nVerrocchio is unlikely to have ever seen Colleoni and the statue is not a portrait of the man but of the idea of a strong and ruthless military commander \"bursting with titanic power and energy\". This is in contrast to Donatello's statue at Padua of the condottiere known as Gattamelata with its \"air of calm command\" and all Verrocchio's effort \"has been devoted to the rendering of movement and of a sense of strain and energy\".\nCopies.\nIn 1909 an electrotype copy of the statue was made for the cast and copy sculpture collection of what would become the National Museum in Szczecin, Poland. That copy was moved to Warsaw in 1948, where it was eventually installed outside the Academy of Fine Arts as an inspiration to students. In 1992 the City of Szczecin petitioned for the return of the copy, which was granted in 2001, and in 2002 it was installed in Szczecin's \"Plac Lotników\" (Airmen's Square) and unveiled by the President of Szczecin and Colleoni's descendant, lawyer Guardo Colleoni. A condition of the return of the copy to Szczecin was that a copy of that copy be made to remain outside the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where a bronze copy of the electrotype copy stands today.\nAnother copy of the statue stands in Montevideo, Uruguay, in front of the School of Architecture of the University of the Republic."

        "title": "Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles",
        "text": "Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles is a public golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California with a course designed by Pete Dye and Donald J. Trump Signature Design. It is owned by The Trump Organization.\nTrump National Golf Club Los Angeles was formerly known as Ocean Trails Golf Club, an 18–hole course designed by Pete Dye, which was about to open when a landslide occurred in June 1999, and the 18th hole slid toward the Pacific Ocean. The Ocean Trails Golf Club subsequently went into bankruptcy, and on November 26, 2002, Trump bought the property for $27 million, intending to redesign the course. It includes a clubhouse.\nIt is ranked among the \"Top 100 Courses You Can Play\" by \"Golf Magazine\".\nThe club is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. The course featured three artificial waterfalls until they were removed during the 2011–2017 drought. The Michael Douglas Pro-Celebrity and Friends Golf Tournament takes place there annually, in April.\nAt a total cost of $264 million, it would be the most expensive golf course ever constructed. Trump's representatives claimed the course was worth $10 million in dealing with the L.A. County property tax assessor two years after the course opened.\nHistory.\nTrump National's predecessor, the Ocean Trails Golf Club, was part of a property owned by developer Edward Zuckerman and a partner. Prior to the Zuckerman purchase, the property was used as a farm. The golf course is on the Palos Verdes Peninsula known for its landslides. The height of the peninsula of above sea level and the action of the waves are two main contributing factors for the landslides. The stratification of the sedimentary rock below the course is visible in the high cliffs of the area as it gradually slopes seaward. The sloping and stratification create favorable conditions for the generation of landslides. As a result, homes and roads have been lost to the ocean in that area. In the area occupied by the golf course and its vicinity, there are three ancient landslides which have been named by geologists as A, B and C respectively. The green of the Ocean Trails golf course 18th hole and half of its fairway were on top of ancient landslide C.\nOn June 2, 1999 the construction on the $126 million Ocean Trails golf course was almost complete and the course was close to its scheduled opening when a landslide unexpectedly occurred, caused by the sudden reactivation of ancient landslide C, and of the 18th hole fairway disappeared under the ocean when a fissure parallel to the cliff appeared and subsequently collapsed. A long island was created due to the landslide, temporarily trapping a local resident. The landslide caused most of the 496 yard par 4 18th hole to slide toward the ocean, including the fairway and green.\nAlso due to the slide, bike paths, walking paths, the edge of the bluffs and a segment of an LA County sewer line disappeared. It is believed that fluid discharge from the sewer line, probably leaking before the slide, acted as a lubricant on the thin underlying layer of bentonite, which became saturated with liquid sewage in turn, and this acted as a facilitator for the stratified geological accumulations to slide relative to each other. Bentonite, a form of clay, exhibits a low frictional coefficient when wet, i.e. it becomes slippery. The golf course opened with only 15 holes because of the landslide.\nThe landslide caused the Ocean Trails Golf Course construction project to go into bankruptcy. Covered by insurance funds, a massive geotechnical project was launched to reconstruct the 18th hole using 1,250,000 cubic yards of earth to fill it. The stabilization work and the slide caused cosmetic damage to the course. At the time, golf course historian Geoff Shackelford said that at the then projected cost of repair of more than $20 million, the 18th hole would have been \"the most expensive single hole in history\".\nAfter three years, legal issues between the involved banks and developers caused the geological stabilization work to stop. In 2002 Donald Trump stepped in and bought the property, including the golf course, with the intention of finalizing construction and repairs by the summer of 2003. On January 20, 2006 the 18-hole Trump National Golf Club opened in Los Angeles. The reinforcement fill designed to stabilize the area affected by the slide is located under holes 17 and 18. During the massive geological stabilization process the golf course was open for business.\nThe geological stabilization process was based on a geotechnical design involving the use of geosynthetic materials designed to enhance the cohesion and strength of the landslide fill. Asked about the safety of the work, Trump said: \"If I'm ever in California for an earthquake, this is where I want to be standing\".\nIn 2008 Trump sued the city of Rancho Palos Verdes for $100 million, alleging that the city did not allow him to make the improvements needed to maintain the Trump image. The lawsuit was settled in 2012 for undisclosed terms.\nIn 2015, the course was to have become the host of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf. The tournament was cancelled due to Trump's comments about illegal immigrants. Sports teams and charities continued to move their charity-golf tournaments to other venues during his presidency."

        "title": "2007 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2007 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive, premiership-deciding match of the 2007 NRL season. It was played between the first-placed Melbourne Storm and second-placed Manly Warringah Sea Eagles at Telstra Stadium on 30 September, in front of 81,392 spectators. The 2007 Grand final was the fourth to be played between the first and second placed teams, and the first in three years. The match was the last Grand Final played at night until 2013; each Grand Final in the intervention switched to a 5:00pm AEST kick-off. This match was also the most-watched television program on Australian TV for 2007.\nOn 22 April 2010, Melbourne were stripped of this premiership, among other team honours, due to salary cap breaches exposed during the 2006–10 seasons.\nBackground.\nThe 2007 NRL season was the one hundredth season of professional rugby league football club competition in Australia, and the tenth run by the National Rugby League. Sixteen teams contested the NRL's 2007 Telstra Premiership, and with the inclusion of a new team, the Gold Coast Titans, the competition was the largest run since the 1999 NRL season.\nManly Warringah Sea Eagles.\nThe 2007 Manly Warringah Sea Eagles season was the 58th in the club's history. Coached by Des Hasler and captained by Matt Orford, they finished the regular season in 2nd (out of 16) place.\nMelbourne Storm.\nThe 2007 Melbourne Storm season was the 10th in the club's history. Coached by Craig Bellamy and captained by Cameron Smith, they finished the regular season in 1st place to claim the minor premiership before going on to reach their third ever and second consecutive grand final.\nTeams.\nMatt Geyer was the only remaining Melbourne player from the club's 1999 NRL grand final-winning team. \nMatch details.\nThe pre-match entertainment included performances from Hoodoo Gurus and Shannon Noll. Player, coach and commentator Frank Hyde was honoured during the half-time break with a video-tribute as well as a minute's silence prior to the Premier League Grand Final. \nFirst half.\nMelbourne crossed early in the first half with a try to winger Anthony Quinn via a slick back-line movement that involved 3 decoy runners to lead 6–0. Another set play midway through the first half saw Melbourne extend the scoreline to 10–0 with a barging try to five-eighth Greg Inglis. Seconds before halftime, Manly centre Steve Matai crossed in the corner to take the deficit back to six points. The half-time score read 10–4 to Melbourne, with many surprised at how the scoreline was so close considering Melbourne's dominance.\nSecond half.\nThe second half started with major controversy after Manly fullback Brett Stewart was knocked unconscious by a massive hit from Melbourne players Michael Crocker and Billy Slater attempting to catch a bomb. Stewart failed to return following the hit, and it proved to be the turning point in the match as Melbourne immediately extended their lead to 14–4 with a try to Crocker. Two quick tries soon after by Melbourne players Matt King and Greg Inglis took the score out to 22–4 and the game looked set for a Melbourne victory. King barged over with a trademark Melbourne decoy play, while Inglis scored the try of the match with a vintage long range 60m run and powerful fend to post his second.\nManly soon pegged the score back to 22–8 with a nice try to winger Chris Hicks but it seemed too little too late for the Manly side. Melbourne then scored two late tries to second-rower Clint Newton and another for Anthony Quinn to take the scoreline to 34–8. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith was inaccurate with the boot, kicking only three goals from eight attempts (including a missed penalty goal).\nInglis was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for best on field. The 34–8 Grand Final score was the third highest grand final margin in Australian rugby league history.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nWorld Club Challenge.\nHaving won the NRL grand final, Melbourne had earned the right to then travel to England for the following February's World Club Challenge match against the winners of the 2007 Super League Grand Final, Leeds Rhinos."

        "text": " \nThe 2011–12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan at Crisler Center for the 45th consecutive year. It had a seating capacity of 12,721. It was also the team's 95th straight season as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Fifth-year head coach John Beilein led the team, alongside All-Big Ten players Trey Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Zack Novak. Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and was Michigan's first Associated Press All-American honoree since 1998.\nThe team's season began with a preseason media day and practices in October 2011. In February 2012, Michigan hosted ESPN's \"College GameDay\" for the first time in a game against Ohio State. It was the eighth time a Big Ten team hosted the show, which began in 2005.\nThe team was in the national rankings all season and ended as the 2011–12 Big Ten co-champion with Michigan State and Ohio State. It had three victories over teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the meeting (eighth-ranked Memphis, ninth-ranked Michigan State and sixth-ranked Ohio State). The team was undefeated at home until its last home game of the season. Michigan lost in the semifinals of the 2012 Big Ten Conference tournament and bowed out in the second round of the 2012 NCAA tournament to end the season with a 24–10 record. The team won the school's first Big Ten Conference Championship since the 1985–86 season and had the school's best Big Ten record (13–5) since the 1993–94 season.\nPreseason.\n2011–12 incoming team members.\nBefore the season began, point guard Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists leader in the 2010–11 season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. The incoming class included Carlton Brundidge and 2011 Ohio Mr. Basketball point guard Trey Burke. Both Brundidge and Burke were among Scout.com's top 100 players of the 2011 class; Brundidge ranked 98th and Burke ranked 94th. Max Bielfeldt committed to Michigan in April despite his family's ties to the Illinois Fighting Illini. Illinois University's Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. Sai Tummala, who along with Bielfeldt was recruited by Ivy League schools, rounded out the incoming class. Tummala earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk-on candidate for the basketball team.\nTim Hardaway Jr., son of former NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway, returned to the team. He was coming off a freshman season in which he was a unanimous Big Ten All-Freshman, All-Big Ten honorable mention, Collegeinsider.com Freshmen All-America and Team USA FIBA U19 honoree. Jordan Dumars, the son of Detroit Pistons All-Star Joe Dumars, left the team, citing nagging knee issues.\nRoster.\nFormer team captains Travis Conlan (1996–97 and 1997–98) and C.J. Lee (2008–09) served as director of basketball operations and administrative specialist, respectively. Peter Kahler was the team's video coordinator.\nSchedule.\nMichigan announced its 14-game non-conference schedule on August 1, 2011. The team began the season in a renovated Crisler Arena: new seats and a high-definition scoreboard were added, but seating capacity was reduced to 12,721 from 13,751 in the previous 10 seasons.\nMichigan came in third place in the three-game 2011 Maui Invitational Tournament between November 21–23. The team defeated the eighth-ranked Memphis Tigers 73–61, lost to the sixth-ranked Duke Blue Devils 82–75, and defeated the Pac-12 favorite UCLA Bruins 79–63. Tim Hardaway Jr. was named the Big Ten Player of the Week, and Trey Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week. In an ACC–Big Ten Challenge game in late November, Michigan lost to Virginia 70–58. In its next game, Michigan defeated Iowa State 76–66. On December 10, 2011, Michigan beat Oakland 90–80, its highest-scoring game since beating 97–50 on November 14, 2009. It was also Michigan's first game since 2002 with three 20-point scorers (Hardaway, Burke and Evan Smotrycz). Burke earned his second Freshman of the Week honor on December 12 after scoring a season-high 20 points and nine assists in the game. On the same day, Michigan was the highest-rated Big Ten team in the Ratings Percentage Index, although the team trailed several schools in the national polls. In the final two non-conference games of the season, Smotrycz scored his first two double-doubles against and on December 17 and 22.\nHeading into the Big Ten Conference schedule, both of the teams Michigan had lost to were ranked (Duke was 7th and 5th in the AP and Coaches' polls and Virginia was 23rd and 24th). On December 29, Michigan won its first Big Ten Conference opener since 2006–07, beating Penn State as Smotrycz extended his double-double streak to three games. On January 2, Burke earned his first Big Ten Conference Player of the Week honor and his third Freshman of the Week honor for his 40 points in Michigan's first two conference games. On December 29 against Penn State he posted 13 points, seven assists, five rebounds and no turnovers. On January 1, 2012, he added a career-high 27 points on 8-for-11 shooting with three rebounds and three assists against Minnesota to earn Big Ten Conference Player of the Week the following day.\nOn January 19, Michigan became the leader in the conference with a 5–2 record, thanks to conference wins over ranked Wisconsin and Michigan State teams. Michigan remained in first place until losing to Ohio State ten days later. The team went 5–2 in conference in February, including wins over ranked Indiana and Ohio State teams. Michigan lost its final home game of the season to Purdue on February 25 to finish with a 15–1 home record. On March 1, the team defeated Illinois for their first road win in Illinois since 1995. During the game, Michigan's 30th of the season, Trey Burke broke Gary Grant's school freshman assists record, set over the course of 30 games in the 1984–85 season, by pushing his total to 143. The March 4 victory over Penn State clinched a share of the 2011–12 Big Ten Conference season regular season championship.\nIn the first game of the 2012 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament against Minnesota, Burke led the team to victory with a career-high 30 points. Burke's total was a school record for the Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament. In the semifinal contest, however, Michigan was eliminated by Ohio State for the third year in a row. Michigan entered the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament seeded fourth, but lost to the thirteenth-seeded Ohio Bobcats 65–60. Burke became Michigan's first Associated Press All-American honoree since Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock in 1998.\nStu Douglass concluded the season as the school's all-time leader in games played, with 136. He surpassed Loy Vaught, who played in 135 games. Novak set the school record in career minutes played with 4,357, surpassing Louis Bullock, who played 4,356 minutes. Burke had a school record-setting freshman season in assists, ending the year with 156.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Non-conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten tournament \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| NCAA tournament\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nWatchlists and awards.\nPreseason.\nFive of the 30 nominees for the men's basketball Lowe's Senior CLASS Award were from the Big Ten, including Michigan's Zack Novak.\nIn-season.\nTrey Burke was one of nearly 60 Bob Cousy Award candidates named in December 2011. On January 4, Burke was one of 20 finalists. On January 25, Novak was named one of ten finalists for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award along with three other Big Ten athletes. He was also one of four Big Ten men's basketball players named Academic All-District, putting him among the 40 finalists for the 15-man Academic All-America team. Novak was named a third team Academic All-American.\nRoster changes.\nThe team lost senior captains Stu Douglass and Zack Novak as well as senior reserve Corey Person to graduation following the season. Person was later granted an extra year of eligibility to return to the team. At the end of the season, three players (Evan Smotrycz, Carlton Brundidge and Colton Christian) decided to leave the program. Smotrycz, who had started in 42 of the 69 games he played in during his first two years, left the program as the program's fifth all-time three-point shooter with a percentage of 40.5. Smotrycz transferred to Maryland, Brundidge transferred to Detroit and Christian transferred to Florida International.\nFollowing the season, Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the 2012 NBA draft. A few days later, however, the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his family: \"When you have a season as a freshman like he did, the NBA, they like them young,\" Trey's father, Benji Burke said. \"They think their ceiling is higher when they're young. Trey had ... a solid season for a freshman. It's going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years.\" Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential. Eventually, he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year.\n2012–13 team recruits.\nThe team announced in September 2010 that Glenn Robinson III, son of former first overall NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson, verbally agreed to attend Michigan, making him the first commitment in the school's class of 2012. Canadian wing guard Nik Stauskas gave Michigan its second verbal commitment for the class of 2012 on March 26, 2011. On November 3, Mitch McGary, who was ranked as the number-two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. Within hours of the commitment, ESPN said that Michigan's ranked as the fifth-best class in the nation. All three signed a National Letter of Intent with the team on November 9. After several other schools announced their commitments, the McGary's commitment moved Michigan from outside the top 25 to the seventh-best class in the nation, according to ESPN. Michael \"Spike\" Albrecht committed to Michigan on April 6, 2012."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers.\nAnil Kumble is a former Test and One Day International (ODI) cricketer who represented India. He is a right-arm leg spin (legbreak googly) bowler. Kumble has taken 619 wickets in Test cricket and 337 wickets in ODI cricket. With 37 five-wicket hauls, Kumble has the highest number of Test and combined international five-wicket hauls among Indian cricketers and fourth highest among all players, after Muttiah Muralitharan, Richard Hadlee, and Shane Warne.\nKumble made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka and his Test debut against England, both in 1990. His first five-wicket haul was against South Africa at Johannesburg (November, 1992) in the second Test of India's tour. He has claimed the most of his five-wicket hauls against Australia, ten of them, all in Test matches. His best performance was against Pakistan at the Feroz Shah Kotla in 1999; Kumble took all ten wickets during the second innings, just the second person to do so, after Jim Laker, and in the process ensured India of their first Test victory against Pakistan in twenty years. The feat also ranks as the second best bowling figures in Test history. Twenty of Kumble's Test cricket five-wicket hauls have come in victory for India, while five have been in defeats. Kumble has also taken two five-wicket hauls in ODIs. His first ODI five-wicket haul was against the West Indies during the final of the 1993 Hero Cup when he took six wickets for twelve runs, a record for India in One Day Internationals. The performance ensured India's victory and Kumble was adjudged man of the match. His other ODI five-wicket haul was against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in 1994."

New Zealand have failed to reach the final since then, whilst England have qualified for the final in 2022 but lost to India. Matches were held at venues around the country, though primarily in the interior, with the main final held at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.

        "title": "Longue Vue Club and Golf Course",
        "text": "Longue Vue Club and Golf Course is a historic golf course and clubhouse in Penn Hills Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. It was founded in the 1920s. It was added to the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 1985, and the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 2005.\nHistory.\nIn 1920, Pittsburgh businessman Edward W. Mudge spoke with a group of his peers about wanting to establish a golf course of their own.  These were men of power and great wealth, and among their ranks were Edward V. Babcock, mayor of Pittsburgh and president of Babcock Lumber Company; Ernest T. Weir, president of Weirton Steel Company; A.L. Humphrey, president of Westinghouse Air Brake Company; J. Morrison Hansen, president of Standard Steel Car Company; as well as 13 other corporate executives who enjoyed the game of golf, which was just beginning to sweep the country. They were also men of action, because one week later they acquired a farm and adjacent lots for $150,000. These 370 acres were dramatically sited atop the highest point in Penn Hills Township and commanded a sweeping panorama of the Allegheny River Valley. The founding fathers named it Longue Vue (French for \"long view\") Club. Legend has it that when Longue Vue couldn't meet expenses during the depression, the gents rolled dice or cut cards to see who would cover the shortfall that year. Not surprisingly, Longue Vue became known as \"The Millionaires Club.\"\nIn addition to golf, the Longue Vue stables were erected in 1922, and equestrians trotted along six miles of bridle paths. While relatively short-lived, the club’s first recreational activity is memorialized by the riding saddle in Longue Vue’s crest.\nCourse Design.\nCourse Architect Robert White.\nThe golf course at the Longue Vue Club was designed by a man who is sometimes forgotten, yet greatly recognized as being one of the forefathers of golf in America. Robert White, whom the Club still honors through a yearly golf event, was commissioned to build the golf course by Longue Vue’s Board of Governors in April 1922. Robert White was born in 1874 in St. Andrews, Scotland and immigrated to the United States in 1894. White began laying out courses from the time he arrived in the United States. In these years, it would typically only take him only one morning to walk the land and decide on nine tee and green locations.\nIn 1902, Robert White helped found the Illinois Professional Golf Association and was appointed their president. This society was only the second of its kind in the world, due to the fact that the British PGA was only founded in 1901. When the United States PGA was founded in 1916, White was elected its first president due to his close relationship to nearly a third of the pros in the United States, and he held the position until 1920.\nWhite was the first to use agronomic methods to maintain grass, which was essential to the success of the golf in the United States due to the drastic differences in terrain and weather patterns cross-country. A true pioneer, Robert White was the first to build a putting green on the White House lawn, one of the first designers and manufacturers of golf clubs in America, designer and builder of over 100 golf courses, and responsible for bringing golf to the Grand Strand in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\nA.W. Tillinghast.\nProlific golf architect Albert Warren Tillinghast renovated the course in 1935, making several recommendations to improve on the original layout. Tillinghast's contributions left a lasting mark, and truly made Longue Vue’s course what it is today. He is often remembered as the first designer who consciously set out to create golf holes that were visually attractive, helping to transform golf course architecture from its roots in nature to a greater art form. Tillinghast drew on the principles of landscape design, engineering and art to transform a property into a spectacular playing field. During the torpor of the Great Depression, Tillinghast offered to help clubs such as Longue Vue economize on their maintenance. His suggestions can be noted in a letter that was sent by him to the PGA President on October 18, 1935. The following excerpt is from that letter:\n\"“As directed by your telegram, I left here on the afternoon of the 15th by train, arriving at New Haven the next morning. On the morning of the 15th, at the request of P.G.A member Will McKay, I inspected the course at Longue Vue (note corrected spelling of previous report) Club at Pittsburgh. I was accompanied by McKay, J.H. Baily (Chairman of the Green Committee) and W.H. Key (Greenskeeper). Their chief problem has been the first hole with a blind drive to a side hill fairway. I gave them full instructions for a rather extensive grading operation, which they requested. Their next problem centered about the 10th and 11th holes, where a stiff climb to the former was most objectionable. I corrected this with a new site for the 9th green (a better one than originally) a new green for the shortened tenth and a new teeing ground for a shortened eleventh. In this manner the hill climb is eliminated completely.”\"\nClubhouse Architects.\nBenno Janssen.\nThe founders commissioned renowned architect Benno Janssen to design a clubhouse with the old world charm of an English Country estate. Janssen’s trademark style is evident throughout the clubhouse with his use of multiple high-pitched gables, slate roof, large groupings of rectangular windows, unusually wide chimneys, and intricately carved stone detail. He designed Longue Vue to have a 1:1 ratio of indoor to outdoor space by providing spacious terraces around the circumference of the building.\nJanssen’s work can be found throughout the Pittsburgh area, both commercially and residentially. His work includes the William Penn Hotel, the Mellon Institute, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and Rolling Rock Club. Janssen is also renowned for more than three dozen homes in the Pittsburgh area, including La Tourelle and the Ingersoll House, both in Fox Chapel.\nBenno Janssen was born in 1874 in St. Louis, Missouri. He studied architecture at the University of Kansas, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. Settling in Pittsburgh in 1905, he eventually partnered with William York Cockren, the firm that was commissioned to prepare the plans for Longue Vue’s clubhouse. The building became in use in 1924.\nJanssen’s design was primarily based upon the English Norman vernacular. Architectural historian James D. Van Trump notes Janssen’s “easy and clever handling of the picturesque, vernacular forms of the English Country house school of the early 20th century. Here we have the manner of the Surrey houses of Lutyens gracefully adapted to the requirements of the 20th century America. This adaptation is most apparent in the graceful arched automobile portals.”\nThe Longue Vue Club has honored Benno Janssen through the naming of its informal dining room, “The Janssen Room.”\nLongue Vue’s Clubhouse was designated as a National Historic District in 2006.\nThe Inaugural Round.\nThe first official round of golf was played at Longue Vue in May 1923. Although very little information is known regarding the teams, scores, or winners, the players were a very interesting bunch.\nThe first of these players was Glenna Collett Vare. Mrs. Vare was a six time U.S. Women’s Amateur Champion between 1922 and 1935. She was known for her strength and even had drives measured to be over 300 yards long. She is also known for the role she played in originating the Curtis Cup, a professional women’s golf tournament where the United States plays against Great Britain and Ireland, as well as for her participation as a player-captain for several years.\nMs. Edith Cummings was also a player in the club’s inaugural round. She was the first female athlete to appear on the cover of TIME Magazine, and was featured on the issue of August 25, 1924. She was given this honor less than one year after winning the 1923 U.S. Women’s Amateur Championships. A fascinating fact about Edith Cummings is that the character Jordan, in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s \"The Great Gatsby\", was based solely off of her.\nThe third player in the match was Mr. “Jock” Hutchinson. In his golf career, Mr. Hutchinson was won two major events, the 1920 PGA Championship and the 1921 Open Championship at St. Andrew’s. Coincidentally, he was born in St. Andrews, Scotland, but he left home and became a U.S. citizen. This made him the first U.S.-based player to win an event of this magnitude. Mr. Hutchinson also won the inaugural PGA Seniors’ Championship in 1937 at Augusta National Golf Club and won the event a second time in 1947.\nThe fourth and final player to play in the inaugural round at Longue Vue was Mr. Joseph Kirkwood. Mr. Kirkwood was a professional player and one of the most prominent trick shot golfers of the time."

        "text": "Birkenhead Wanderers was a semi-professional rugby league club in Birkenhead, England. They became members of the Northern Rugby Football Union and played for three full seasons from 1901–02 to 1903–04\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nBirkenhead Wanderers FC was formed as a rugby union club some time before 1895.\nDuring the early years (during the period playing under RFU rules), the club had a prominent player who gained international caps. Samuel \"Sam\" Houghton, while playing for Birkenhead Wanderers, was picked to play for England in the first of the 1896 Home Nations Championship games on 4 January 1896 and was then picked to play in the second match of the tournament on 1 February. By this time he had re-signed for his old club Runcorn, who had now changed codes to Northern Union.\nNorthern Union.\nSometime after the Schism, Birkenhead Wanderers decided to change codes and joined the Northern Union.\nThey entered the Challenge Cup Competition in 1900–01 and lost 2–10 at home to Widnes on 23 March 1901 in the 3rd round.\nThey joined the ranks of the semi-professionals when they became members of the Northern Union in 1901–02 and played for one season in the Lancashire Senior Competition, which was effectively Division 2 (West). Although they were from Cheshire, they, like several other Cheshire clubs and some Cumberland clubs, participated in the Lancashire Competitions. The club managed a mid-table position of 7th out of 13 clubs.\nAt the end of the 1901–02 season, the County Leagues elected 18 teams to join the new Division 2 (7 from Lancashire and 10 from Yorkshire and new member South Shields) with the existing second competition scrapped. This meant that teams were excluded from the senior competitions.\nIn season 1902–03 Birkenhead Wanderers joined the new 2nd Division, where they would stay for the remainder of their professional existence. The club again managed a mid-table position of 9th out of 18 clubs.\nBefore the start of their third and final season 1903–04 the club dropped the \"Wanderers\" suffix, becoming plain Birkenhead. They ended the season in 14th position out of the 17 clubs.\nThe following season, 1904–05 Birkenhead started off, lost their first four matches failing to score even one solitary point, and resigned from the league. No further history is known for the club.\nThey are mentioned again in a conflicting report about Prenton (the district) that states – \"\"The\" Tranmere Rovers\" came to the Prenton Park Stadium in 1912, after taking the grounds back from the Birkenhead Wanderers Rugby League to whom they had leased it in 1902\"\"\nStadium.\nTranmere Rovers was founded in 1884 and played the first games at Steele's Field. This was just a field with no facilities, named after the landlord of the adjacent Beekeepers' pub.\nAt the end of the 1886/87 season, Tranmere Rovers bought Ravenshaw's Field next door to Tranmere Rugby Club, and relocated. The new ground was quickly enclosed so that gate money could be taken and later improvements included dressing rooms, a small stand and turnstiles. In 1895, what had previously been known as the \"Borough-road enclosure\" was renamed Prenton Park even though it was outside the Prenton area boundaries. It is on this ground that Birkenhead Wanderers played rugby.\nIn 1912 Prenton Park was sold off to make way for housing and Tranmere Rovers moved into their 3rd home taking the Prenton Park name with them.\nClub league record.\nThe league positions for Birkenhead Wanderers for the 3 years in which they played semi-professional rugby league are given in the following table:-\nHeading Abbreviations\nRL = Single division; Pl = Games played; W = Win; D = Draw; L = Lose; PF = Points for; PA = Points against; Diff = Points difference (+ or -); Pts = League points\n% Pts = A percentage system was used to determine league positions due to clubs playing varying number of fixtures and against different opponents \nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nSeveral fixtures and results.\nThe following are just a few of Birkenhead Wanderers fixtures during the three seasons (and other times) in which they played semi-professional rugby league :-\nNotes and comments.\n1 – Folly Fields is the stadium used by Wigan at the time until 1901. They then became sub-tenants of Springfield Park See below – Note 3. \n2 – Lowerhouse Lane is the original site of the current ground used by Widnes. It was renamed Naughton Park in 1932 in honour of club secretary, Tom Naughton – and later renamed Halton Stadium after being completely rebuilt in 1997.\n3 – Wigan became sub-tenants of Springfield Park, which they shared with Wigan United AFC, playing their first game there on 14 September 1901 at which a crowd of 4,000 saw them beat Morecambe 12–0, and the last game on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. A temporary ground was necessary to span the period between moving from Folly Fields and the new ground at Central Park being constructed.\n4 – Prenton Park (or 'New' Prenton Park) is still the home of Tranmere Rovers F C."

        "text": "Thomas Acheson \"Attie\" Howard (January 5, 1871 – November 18, 1945) was a Canadian amateur ice hockey player in the era before professional ice hockey. He was a member of the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias Stanley Cup championship team. He later played in the American Amateur Hockey League (AAHL) and in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL) in the United States of America.\nPlaying and coaching career.\nTom Howard joined the Winnipeg Victorias in 1890 and during the 1890–91 season the team played non-league games against the city-rival Winnipeg Hockey Club. He was one of the charter members of the Winnipeg Victorias alongside fellow players Jack Armytage, George \"Whitey\" Merritt, Fred Higginbotham and multi-athlete Jack McCulloch. He played nine seasons for the club, winning the Stanley Cup in 1896 (against the Montreal Victorias) and playing in a Stanley Cup challenge series in 1899 (also against the Montreal Victorias).\nIn 1899–1900, Howard moved to New York City with his wife and two sons and played four seasons with the New York Athletic Club. He played two seasons with the New York Wanderers (1903–1905) and one game with the Brooklyn Skating Club in 1905–06 to end his career. He scored 105 goals in 100 games during his career.\nPlaying manager.\nDuring his last active season as a player, in 1905–06, Howard acted as a playing manager of the Brooklyn Skating Club. At the onset of the season Howard tried to acquire a group of Canadian players, mostly from Montreal, among them Frank \"Pud\" Glass of the Montreal Wanderers and Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson of the Montreal Hockey Club. The AAHL rules committee ruled the Canadian players ineligible to play with the American club on counts of professionalism, and the Brooklyn Skating Club team ceased its operations two games into the season.\nAfter 1910, Howard joined A.G. Spalding &amp; Co. of New York. He endorsed a hockey stick model and edited the Spalding Ice Hockey Guides. He also coached several different hockey teams, both in the AAHL (New York Hockey Club) and within the American intercollegiate ice hockey circuit (Yale and Columbia).\nPlaying style.\nHoward played the predominant bulk of his ice hockey career as a right winger. He was a speedy skater prone to quick dashes down his side of the rink, and he also possessed a good and hard shot. During his time with the New York Wanderers in the AAHL (1903–1905) he played on the cover point position (equivalent to an offensive defenseman in today's hockey).\n\" ... Howard had coaxed back the form which has made him famous. His frequent journeys down the rink side were as brilliant as chain-lightning over a dark sky. He had the speed of a schoolboy and the cleverness of a master. His skating, criss-cross dribbling and shots which seemed to fairly leap for the net were beautiful to look upon.\"\nFamily.\nTom Howard had two sons, Tom Howard Jr. (b. 1894) and Jack Howard (b. 1896), with his wife Kathleen Howard (née Cronn). Tom Jr. and Jack both played with the New York Hockey Club in the AAHL during the 1916–17 season. Kathleen Howard was a hockey player and manager herself and managed a girls team branch of the St. Nicholas Hockey Club.\nJack Howard died in an automobile crash on December 21, 1919 at an age of 23. The car was driven by his older brother Tom.\nTom Howard eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he died at the age of 74 in 1945.\nCareer statistics.\nStanley Cup challenges.\nStatistics from \"Society for International Hockey Research\" (sihrhockey.org)"

He can play as a fly-half or fullback.\nCareer.\nFree State / Shimlas.\nBorn in Bloemfontein, he attended Grey College. Whitehead represented Free State in several youth competitions; he played for them at the under-16 Grant Khomo Week competition in 2005 and at the under-18 Craven Week competition in 2006.\nAfter finishing high school, he joined their Academy and played for the side in the 2008 under-19 Provincial Championship. The following season, he was part of the squad that played in the 2009 under-21 Provincial Championship. He also made his first class debut for their senior side, the during the 2009 Currie Cup Premier Division, coming on as a late replacement in their match against the , but finishing on the wrong end of a 24–13 result.\nIn 2010, Whitehead played Varsity Cup rugby for the . He started five of their matches during the 2010 Varsity Cup and ended the competition as Shimlas' top scorer, contributing 45 points with the boot. He was heavily involved in the' 2010 Vodacom Cup campaign, starting eight of their ten matches in the competition to help them reach the final for the third time in their history. He scored his first senior points in their opening match of the season, a conversion in the third minute of a 22–13 victory over in George. His first try came in their third match, a 17–26 defeat to the in Empangeni He started their semi-final match, helping them beat 22–14 in Wellington and also played all 80 minutes of the final, but could not prevent them falling to a 29–31 defeat to hosts .\nLater in 2010, Whitehead played a crucial rule in the run to the semi-finals of the 2010 Under-21 Provincial Championship, scoring three tries and kicking 120 points with the boot to end the season as Free State's top points scorer.\nWhitehead then played on six occasions for in the 2011 Varsity Cup competition, contributing 26 points.\nEastern Province Kings.\nAfter the 2011 Varsity Cup competition, Whitehead moved to Port Elizabeth to join the for the 2011 Currie Cup First Division. He made his EP Kings debut in their first round home match against the ; he came on with just 20 minutes left in the match, but kicked three penalties to help his side to a 28–20 victory. He started their next three matches of the competition, but then found himself behind Louis Strydom in the pecking order. Nevertheless, he still played a crucial part in their season, scoring a total of 56 points – second only to Strydom for the Kings – to help them finish in second spot in the log. He kicked a conversion in their comprehensive 48–17 semi-final victory over the in the semi-final, but could not help them to victory in the final, where they lost 12–43 to the .\nWhitehead was involved in a car accident at the start of 2012, sustaining injuries that kept him out of the entire 2012 Vodacom Cup. He returned to fitness in time for the kick-off of the 2012 Currie Cup First Division season and scored the EP Kings' first try of the season in the 12th minute of their 25–20 victory over defending champions in Wellington. He played in a total of fifteen matches during the season, top-scoring for the Kings with 142 points to help them reach their third consecutive final in the competition. His kicking boot proved crucial as he contributed eleven points in the Kings' 26–25 victory over rivals, the newly-relegated , to help the Kings clinch their second First Division title in three seasons. He played in both legs of their promotion play-off matches against former side the and scored ten points in the two matches, but could not prevent them losing 20–69 on aggregate to remain in the First Division.\nWith the being granted entry to play in the 2013 Super Rugby season, Whitehead was named in their 35-man squad. The Kings signed Demetri Catrakilis to be their first-choice fly-half and kicker, which meant that Whitehead was mainly used as backup to him and fullback SP Marais. He was an unused substitute in the Kings' historic first-ever Super Rugby match, which they won 22–10 against Australian side the , but made his debut the following week as he came on as a late replacement in their 12–21 loss to the . After another appearance off the bench against the , Whitehead made his starting debut in their 20–55 loss to the in Christchurch and marked the occasion by scoring his first Super Rugby try, which he also subsequently converted. He also started in their loss to the , as well as their match against the in Canberra, where an injury-time Cornell du Preez try and subsequent conversion from Demetri Catrakilis earned the Kings a 28–all draw to secure their first log points outside of South Africa. He again started their next match where they went one better, securing their first ever victory on foreign soil by beating the 30–27 in Melbourne. He eventually made ten starts in the competition and appeared as a substitute a further five times. He scored one more try in the competition, in their final match against the , but could not prevent the Kings finishing the season bottom of the log. That meant they had to play in a relegation play-off series against the . He played in both legs as the Kings lost 42–44 on aggregate to lose their Super Rugby status for 2014.\nWhitehead appeared nine times for the in the 2013 Currie Cup First Division season, scoring two tries and kicking five conversions and they once again qualified for the final. The final was a repeat of the 2012 final, but this time the ran out as winners of the competition, beating the EP Kings 53–30 in a match in Nelspruit. A decision from the South African Rugby Union to expand the Premier Division of the Currie Cup from six teams to eight teams meant that both sides that played in the final were promoted to the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division.\nWith the Kings not playing Super Rugby in 2014, Whitehead – along with prop Lizo Gqoboka – joined the for pre-season training prior to the 2014 Super Rugby season, but he later returned to the Kings without any involvement at the Durban-based franchise. He made just one appearance in the 2014 Vodacom Cup, scoring the EP Kings' only points in a 3–31 defeat to in Cradock.\nIn June 2014, Whitehead was selected in the starting line-up for the side to face during a tour match during a 2014 incoming tour. He played the entire match and scored a last-minute conversion as the Kings suffered a 12–34 defeat.\nWhitehead made four appearances in the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division – the first time he played in this competition for five seasons – and scored five points as the Kings finished bottom of the log, with their only win of the season coming in their final match against the . Despite additional competition for the fly-half starting berth with the signings of Gary van Aswegen and Tony Jantjies, Whitehead was still named in their training squad for 2015 and he appeared in their opening match of the 2015 Vodacom Cup competition, a 19–27 loss to .\nGriffons.\nWhitehead joined Welkom-based side the for the 2016 season."

        "text": "Robert Jay Brady (November 8, 1922 – April 22, 1996) was an American professional baseball player who was a catcher in Major League Baseball. He appeared in four total games played over two seasons with the 1946–47 Boston Braves, and spent 13 seasons (1940–52) in minor league baseball. Born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, Brady threw right-handed, batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nBrady made seven plate appearances in the big leagues, and collected one hit and one base on balls. His hit—a pinch single—came on September 8, 1946, against Tommy Hughes of the Philadelphia Phillies at Braves Field in the second game of a doubleheader. Hughes pitched a 4–0 shutout victory against Boston.\nOne thing many people did not know was that at a young age Brady suffered from a bout of Scarlet Fever robbing him of his hearing in his left ear and minimal hearing in his right. Bob played just one year of high school baseball, his junior season. This was due to the fact that the high school had not sponsored a baseball program since 1936 and Bob left high school in the spring of his senior year to play minor league ball for Williamsport. Brady, along with his team, had an outstanding 1940 campaign as the Panthers went 9 – 1 under coach Jay M. Riden. A 2 – 0 loss to Juniata Joint was the only blemish of the season. In 10 games, Bob had 17 hits in 38 at – bats for a .447 average. He drove – in 10 runs and scored nine. The left – handed hitter also stroked four doubles and had three triples. He played mostly first base but also saw time in the outfield and caught in one game. On August 24, 1946 Bob played in his first major league game for the Boston Braves, now known as the Atlanta Braves. Brady appeared in two more games that season, going 1 – for – 5 at the plate. He also drew a walk. In 1947 Brady appeared in just one game, that coming on April 17, going hitless in just one at – bat. That game was to be Bob’s final one on the major league level.\nDuring his professional career Brady was pretty much a catcher, spending 12 seasons in the minors mostly on the AAA level. In 1944, his second with the Hartford Chiefs of the old Eastern League, his team won the league championship and he was the league’s all – star catcher. He also saw time with Minneapolis of the American Association League where in one game he hit three home runs against Toledo. After his baseball career ended, Brady settled in Manchester, Connecticut and was employed by the State of Connecticut, in their purchasing department, retiring in 1983.\nBrady suffered a stroke in 1996 and passed in a matter of months.\nBrady lived most of his life in Manchester, Connecticut, married to Virginia K. Brady. He loved fishing and playing golf. He had one child, a daughter, named Patricia."

        "title": "English cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011–12",
        "text": "The England and Pakistan national cricket teams toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 7 January to 27 February 2012. The tour included three Tests, four One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) between England and Pakistan. The matches were meant to be held in Pakistan, but ongoing security problems in the country meant that the series was moved to the UAE.\nEngland, captained by Andrew Strauss, entered the Test series as the top-ranked team in the world, while Pakistan, led by Misbah-ul-Haq, had won their last three Test series and were ranked fifth.\nPakistan won the Test series after whitewashing England by a 3–0 margin. Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal was named the player of the series, having taken 24 wickets. England gained some form of revenge by whitewashing Pakistan 4–0 in the subsequent one day series, with notable performances from Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen with the bat, they both hit centuries in successive games, and Steven Finn with the ball who was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 13 wickets.\nEngland then completed the tour with a 2–1 success in the T20 series, coming back after losing the first match to take the third by 5 runs. That match was notable for Kevin Pietersen becoming only the second batsmen to carry his bat through a T20 international scoring 62, including what proved to be the winning runs by hitting a six off the last ball of England's innings.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nPakistan and England adopted different strategies in selecting their teams for the match. Pakistan selected two full-time spin bowlers—Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman—while England chose only one (Graeme Swann) leaving out Monty Panesar and selecting three pace bowlers. England won the toss, decided to bat, and suffered a top-order collapse at the hands of Pakistan's spinners. Part-time bowler Mohammad Hafeez took the wicket of Alastair Cook, before Ajmal ran through England's batting lineup, taking a career-best 7/55. Five of Ajmal's dismissals were leg before wicket, a record achieved by only five others in Test history. England's only real resistance came from a 57-run partnership between Matt Prior and Graeme Swann. Prior finished the innings on 70 not out, with his team all out for 192.\nIn response, Pakistan finished the first day of the Test at 0/42. Their innings remained on foot at the end of the second day, after their top order batsmen accumulated runs at a slow pace. They were all out on the third day for 338: a lead of 146. Four batsmen scored half-centuries: Hafeez (88 off 164 balls), Taufeeq Umar (58 off 113), Misbah-ul-Haq (52 off 154) and Adnan Akmal (61 off 129).\nChasing 147 to make Pakistan bat again, England were all out for 160 in the 58th over of their second innings. Umar Gul took four wickets, while Ajmal took another three, taking his match figures to 10/97 and securing the man of the match award. Jonathan Trott top-scored for England with 49. Pakistan's openers chased down their victory target of 15 runs within four overs on the third day, wrapping up a win that their interim coach Mohsin Khan described as a \"boost to the nation\" after the spot-fixing scandal that had affected Pakistan cricket over the previous two years.\n2nd Test.\nPakistan won the toss and opted to bat first. They made one change to their team, Junaid Khan replacing fellow pace bowler Aizaz Cheema. England captain Andrew Strauss said that he too would have batted first. England's only change was to replace the injured and homeward-bound Chris Tremlett with spinner Monty Panesar. Panesar came on as early as the 10th over; Graeme Swann joined him three overs later. Both Pakistan openers fell to balls that slid on without turning. Pakistan finished the first day of the Test at 7/256. Misbah's resistance stabilised Pakistan after they lost 4 for 103. By the close, Misbah had batted 220 minutes for an unbeaten 83. \nEngland began the second day, needing only 16 balls to wrap up Pakistan's last three wickets. Pakistan added only a single from Misbah to their overnight total. England lost 3 for 9 in the last 10 overs of the day, all of them to Saeed Ajmal, Pakistan's 10-wicket destroyer in the first Test in Dubai. Cook fell six runs short of a century, leg before wicket to a doosra from Ajmal. By the end of the day England were 207 for 5. Stuart Broad's 58 from 62 balls helped England to a 70-run first-innings lead.\nPakistan suffered the loss of early wickets before Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq came together at 54 for 4. The pair took the score to 125 for 4 by the end of the third day. Pakistan ultimately made 214 in their 2nd innings. Monty Panesar took 6 for 62, the second best bowling figures of his Test career, leaving England chasing 145 for victory. England did not even reach the half-way mark, dismissed for 72 in only 36.1 overs, their lowest total since being bowled out for 51 against the West Indies three years previously. Spinner Abdur Rehman took 6 for 25, the first five-wicket haul of his Test career.\nAndrew Strauss described England's defeat against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi as among the most painful of his career: \"It is a struggle to think of a loss that has hurt more than this,\" Strauss said. Saeed Ajmal's seven wickets for the match saw him become the fastest Pakistan bowler to 100 Test wickets.\n3rd Test.\nPakistan won the toss and elected to bat. Pakistan made one change, Aizaz Cheema back in for Junaid Khan. Pakistan side bundled out for 99 runs in first innings avoiding their lowest Test score against England thanks only to 45 from Asad Shafiq. It was 14th time, Pakistan were bowled out for a score under 100. Stuart Broad and James Anderson, made full use of encouraging conditions and shared 7 wickets. By the close, England were 104 for 6. \nEngland, resuming on 104 for 6, lasted 12 overs. James Anderson, the night-watchman, propped forward to the last ball of the first over. Andrew Strauss had extended his overnight 41 to 56 when he came down the pitch to hit Rehman over the legside and was stumped by Adnan Akmal. England led by 42 runs in first innings.\nOn the second day, Younis Khan came to the crease shortly before lunch. By the close, Younis had 115, his third-wicket stand with Azhar Ali (75*) was worth 194 in 72 overs and Pakistan's lead was 180.\nYounis Khan added only 12 to his overnight 115 before he fell lbw to the deserving Stuart Broad, but Azhar followed up Younis' hundred with one of his own. His highest first-class score, 157 from 442 balls, was an impressive feat of patience and skill. Pakistan scored 365 in their second innings. England survived their initial reconnaissance. There were few devils in the 20 overs up to the close, although Alastair Cook was badly dropped in Umar Gul's second over by Taufeeq Umar at third slip.\nEngland, 36 runs banked the previous evening, needed a further 288 at start of play. Strauss fell in the sixth over of the morning. England were all out for 252. Umar Gul and Saeed Ajmal took 4 wickets each and Pakistan won the match by 71 runs. Saeed Ajmal, the Man of the Series, Abdur Rehman tormented England to the end. They shared 43 wickets between them in a three-Test series.\nMohsin Khan, the Pakistan coach, compared his team's whitewash against England to the 1992 Cricket World Cup triumph. \"Today is like a dream come true,\" Mohsin told Sky Sports. \"It's not a very experienced team but it's very talented. Today, the captain and all the players have proved they are one of the best in the world. It's a great achievement for the Pakistan team.\""

Jamie Joslin led all Colonial skaters with nine blocks. Joslin assisted on RMU's second goal in the game, which moved her into a tie for the most points in a season by a Colonials defender with 16, respectively. \nKatelyn Scott scored the first goal of her NCAA career to open the scoring. Thea Imbrogno extended the Colonials lead to 2-0. At the 16:06 mark of the second, Mercyhurst cut the lead.\nThe Lakers were granted a great chance to tie it when they received two more power-play chances within two minutes after their first goal, but the RMU defense held firm and protected the lead. Just when it seemed as though the Lakers might take momentum into the intermission, Delaney drilled home a rebound with just 30 ticks left in the second to reestablish RMU's multi-goal advantage heading into the third.\nWith less than a minute to play in the second period, Rebecca Vint and Kylie St. Louis assisted on a marker by Brianna Delaney that would stand as the game-winning goal. With seven seconds left to play, Mercyhurst scored on the power play, but were unable to tie the game. On the power play, the Colonials held the Lakers to a 2-for-12 mark. Heading into the game, the Lakers were the NCAA's best man-advantage unit.\nOf note, Delaney played in the final game of her NCAA career. With the goal, she moved into sole possession of first place in career goals scored at Robert Morris with 53. In addition, she moved into first place in career GWG at Robert Morris. She extended her RMU career points record to 121, was subsequently named to the All-Tournament Team.

        "text": "James Ryan (8 February 1887 – 17 July 1957) was a New Zealand rugby union player who represented his country internationally. A utility back, Ryan was versatile in his ability to play throughout the backline.\nBorn in Masterton, Ryan was educated at St Patrick's College in Wellington. He joined the Petone club after leaving school. He made his debut for the Wellington province in 1905 as an eighteen year old.\nRyan was first selected for the national side, the All Blacks, in 1910. A side was chosen to travel to Australia and 8 matches were arranged. He played in 5 of these, including 1 test match at fullback.\nThe next international tours New Zealand had took place in 1913. One, a visiting Australian side and one, further afar to the United States. Ryan was selected for neither of these but he continued playing at a provincial level.\nThe next year, however, another tour to Australia was organised and Ryan was selected again to play for his country. Of the eleven matches he missed just one game against Metropolitan Union. Ryan captained his side twice. First, in their warm-up match against Wellington before they left. And again, against Central-Western Districts once in Australia. Adding to this, he also played in the three test matches scheduled against Australia. The squad won all 10 of their games while overseas. The only loss coming against Wellington in the warm up fixture.\nA soldier in the Otago Infantry Regiment during World War I, Ryan captained the New Zealand Army team in 1919. Leading them in the King's Cup. A trophy played for by army personnel of New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, South Africa and the Royal Air Force. New Zealand, making the final, defeated the British 9 points to 3. Ryan suffered an injury in this game, but nonetheless led his team to victory. He was thus, presented with the King's Cup by George V. The French Army were then invited to play the cup winners and the New Zealanders won 20 points to 3.\nAfter this Ryan continued to tour Great Britain and France. Included was an international match against Wales, which Ryan captained. The All Blacks won 6 points to 3. Before they sailed home, the party set off for South Africa to play a further 12 games.\nUpon returning to New Zealand, Ryan appeared for both Wellington and Manawatu. The latter of which he finished his final three playing years with. He then became a Manawatu selector and coach for the team through the 1920's and 30's.\nRyan had six other brothers who played for the Petone club. Three of them, Joe, Michael and Bill also played for Wellington. Another, Eddie, notably became a 1 match All Black in 1921. Eddie also played in the New Zealand Army side."

The tournament was combined with the 2nd Women's Asian Champions Trophy.\nThe tie-breaker in a knockout match was a one on one between the striker and the goalkeeper. The striker had to start from the 23-meter line and was given only eight seconds to score. This way of tie-breaker was used as part of a testing phase by FIH.\nIndia won the tournament after defeating Pakistan in the final. The Indians won 4-2 in a penalty shootout after regulation and extra time ended scoreless, and became the first champion of the tournament."

        "text": "Harry Lewis Elliott (December 30, 1923 – August 9, 2013) was an American professional baseball player who appeared in 92 games in Major League Baseball for the and St. Louis Cardinals. A , outfielder, Elliott threw and batted right-handed.\nEarly life.\nElliott was born in San Francisco, California. As a youth, his family moved to Watertown, Minnesota. He played piano professionally from the age of 15, playing Big Band music until the mid-1990s. Elliott graduated from Watertown High School in 1942. He was a standout athlete, lettering two years each in football, basketball and baseball and earned All-Conference and All-District honors. Elliott then attended the University of Minnesota where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, earning three varsity letters in both football and baseball. In 1949, he was their first athlete to earn first-team Big Ten honors in the sport of baseball. He then spent a short time teaching in Austin, Minnesota.\nElliott started playing professional baseball at the relatively advanced age of 27 and put up prodigious batting numbers in his early seasons in minor league baseball. He batted .391 with 221 hits for the 1951 Alexandria Aces of the Class D Evangeline League, notched 204 hits one year later in the Double-A Texas League with the Shreveport Sports, and in 1954 batted .350 with 224 hits, 42 doubles, 15 home runs and 110 runs batted in in 168 games for the San Diego Padres of the Open Classification Pacific Coast League. In his seven-year minor league career, Elliott batted .326 lifetime.\nAcquired by the Cardinals in December 1952, he was batting .321 for their Houston Buffaloes farm club in 1953 when he was called up for the final two months of the Major League season with the Redbirds. Although he struck out against Brooklyn Dodgers left-hander Preacher Roe in his debut on August 1, Elliott gained a measure of revenge against Roe exactly one month later, with three hits in four at bats, including his first MLB home run.\nElliott spent the entire 1954 season in the Pacific Coast League — then vying for possible Major League status as an \"Open\" (one level above Triple-A) circuit — and was named a PCL all-star because of his stellar season with San Diego. Reacquired by the Cardinals, he spent the entire 1955 season on their roster, appearing in 29 games in the field and in more than 40 games as a pinch hitter. He had two of his best games against Chicago Cubs southpaw Paul Minner, with three hits on May 30 and two more, including his second and final Major League home run, off Minner on September 19. Elliott was featured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine in March 1956.\nAll told, Elliott collected 45 hits, including ten doubles and one triple in the majors. He retired from professional baseball after the 1958 season.\nRetirement.\nFollowing his retirement from baseball, Elliott taught physical education at El Cajon Valley High School. Throughout his 27 years of teaching, he also coached baseball, football, basketball and soccer.\nElliott subsequently spent 30 years in retirement in Yuma, Arizona, and frequently traveled in his motor home.\nDeath.\nElliott spent the final days of his life in Lyons, Kansas, with his family by his side. He died on August 9, 2013, at the Sandstone Heights Nursing Home in Little River, Kansas."

The competition was organized and held by the Professional Darts Corporation, with the 2011 edition having a maximum prize fund of £189,000.\nThe format of the tournament was similar to the Premier League Darts tournament, also organized by the PDC, except it was contested by a larger pool of players who were split up into a number of groups.\nEvery match could be watched on one of the thirty bookmaker websites who broadcast the competition. The tournament was available globally through the internet, except in the United States of America where it could not be shown for legal reasons.\nFormat.\nThe first group consisted of the top eight players from the PDC Order of Merit who were available for the competition. These eight players played each other over the course of a day, receiving two points for each win. All matches were contested over a maximum of 11 legs with a player winning the match on reaching 6 legs. After all players had played each other, the four players with the most points progressed to the semi-finals with the winners of those matches progressing into the final.\nThe winner of the final progressed to the winners group which took place at the end of the competition.

The original eight schools were Drexel University, La Salle University, Saint Joseph's University, Temple University, University of Delaware, University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, and West Chester University. In the first championship game, Delaware defeated Villanova 6–2.\nWhen West Chester was reclassified as Division II, it was replaced by Rider University, which was then in turn replaced by Lehigh University. When Drexel's baseball program was dissolved after the 2003 season, Lafayette College joined the Liberty Bell Classic.\nOriginally all games were played at Veterans Stadium but with the closure of Veterans Stadium, starting in 2004, games are now played at local venues with the championship game being held at Citizens Bank Park. The first championship at Citizens Bank Park was claimed by Lehigh as they defeated Villanova 11–3.\nA second tournament, the Bill Giles Invitational, was created in 2001 for the Philadelphia-area Division II colleges. Competing in the Giles Invitational is previous Liberty Bell competitor West Chester University, along with Philadelphia University, University of the Sciences, and Wilmington University. The championship games for the Bill Giles Invitational and Liberty Bell Classic are hosted as part of a double header.\nBill Giles Invitational.\nThe Bill Giles Invitational (BGI)—named for Philadelphia Phillies chairman emeritus Bill Giles—was begun in 2001, for the NCAA Division II baseball teams in the Philadelphia area."

He was a right-handed pitcher whose ten-year minor league career was punctuated by a three-game stint in Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators.\nFrom 1950 to 1959, the , Currie compiled a 92–72 win–loss record in minor league baseball, playing for at least six Major League organizations. His brief trial with Washington in April 1955, however, was marked by his rude treatment by the New York Yankees in his MLB debut at Yankee Stadium. Currie entered the game (the Senators' second of the year) in the fifth inning as his team's third pitcher of the day with New York already leading 7–0. He loaded the bases on two walks and a hit batsman and gave up a two-run single to Whitey Ford in his first inning. Then, in his next frame, he gave up back-to-back home runs to Yogi Berra and Bill Skowron as the Yanks added on four more runs. Currie gave up five hits and five earned runs in two innings, with two bases on balls, one hit batter, and one wild pitch in an eventual 19–1 Washington defeat.\nCurrie pitched much more effectively in his next two outings, also as a relief pitcher, but he was sent back to the Double-A Southern Association when the rosters were reduced from 28 to 25 players. In his three MLB games, he yielded seven hits and six earned runs in 4⅓ innings pitched, with two walks and two strikeouts."

        "text": "The VMI Keydets baseball team represents the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. The team is a member of the Southern Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. VMI's first baseball team was fielded in 1866. The team plays its home games at Gray–Minor Stadium in Lexington, Virginia. The Keydets are coached by Sam Roberts.\nHistory.\nIn fall 1866, just two years after the Virginia Military Institute had been burned down by David Hunter and the Union Army, a group of cadets got together and created the Institute's first organized baseball team. It was the first organized team from any sport. In the inaugural season, the Keydets had an astounding mark of 20–1–2, playing among in-state rivals such as Washington and Lee, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Randolph-Macon and Hampden-Sydney, and continuously so for the next several decades.\nIn 1921, the team started playing at recently built Alumni Memorial Field along with the football team. Both squads had, up to that point, been playing on the Parade Ground. It was not until the 1960s that the baseball team shifted to Patchin Field, and most recently in 2007, began playing in Gray-Minor Stadium.\nDespite having many winning seasons throughout the 20th century and into the last decade, the Keydets have never been able to make the NCAA tournament. The 1993 team came closest to breaking the barrier with a run to the Southern Conference finals, and despite being an 8th seed, VMI upended three higher-seeded teams before bowing down to eventual champion Western Carolina.\nVMI and MLB.\nVMI has had 31 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1938 film, \"Brother Rat\" is set at the Virginia Military Institute. The film features Eddie Albert as the VMI baseball team's star pitcher, and Ronald Reagan as his catcher. The film's plot centers on Albert and Reagan as they attempt to win the big baseball game against rival Virginia. Portions of the film were shot on location at the VMI campus in Lexington. In 1940, the film was followed by a sequel, \"Brother Rat and a Baby\", featuring the same lead cast members. The sequel film's plot centered on the since-graduated Albert's attempt to get a job as a baseball coach at his alma mater."

Then-Montreal Expos right fielder Vladimir Guerrero is featured on the cover. The game was released in March 2001 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2, followed by a Game Boy Advance port in September 2001. A Game Boy Color version was also in development but was cancelled.\nReception.\nThe Windows and PlayStation 2 versions received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation versions received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"Nintendo Power\" gave the Game Boy Advance version a favorable review while it was still in development. \"Edge\" gave the same GBA version six out of ten, saying, \"While US players can happily debate the pros and cons of team line-up, it's hard to see UK gamers making the same emotional link.\" Christopher Allen of \"AllGame\" gave the Windows version four stars out of five, stating, \"With its massive number of statistics, solid gameplay, and avalanche of customization options, \"High Heat Major League Baseball 2002\" is a must have for any baseball fanatic. A wide fan base and multiplayer options will insure the freshness of this title for a long time. Beyond the gnawing irritation of glaring bugs requiring a patch to swat, the game is the closest representation to baseball on the computer as of 2001.\" Tom Carroll of the same website gave the PlayStation 2 version three stars out of five, saying that it was \"not a beautiful game, despite being one of the most complete baseball titles on the market today.\" Rob Smolka of \"NextGen\" called the PlayStation 2 version \"a must-buy for all serious PS2 baseball fans.\" Glenn Rubenstein of \"Extended Play\" gave the same console version three stars out of five and said that it was \"by no means a poor title, it just lacks the polish and completeness of the other two titles [\"All-Star Baseball 2002\" and \"Triple Play Baseball\"].\"\nUncle Dust of \"GamePro\" compared the PlayStation version to \"that off-speed pitcher who wins 15 games a year for your team—you tolerate him as a solid performer, but he's not your favortie player.\" However, he said of the PlayStation 2 version, \"This is one game that is better every time you play and deserves to be taken on a full 162-game season.\" However, he also said of the Game Boy Advance version in its early review, \"It's sad because \"High Heat MLB 2002\" could've been a terrific game on the GBA, yet its lack of depth, bad soundtrack, and easy difficulty level make the game a minor leaguer.\"\n\"Computer Games Magazine\" and \"PC Gamer US\" both named the PC version the best sports game of 2001, with the latter calling it \"the best simulation of any sport.\" It also won the award for \"Best Sports Game for PC\" at \"The Electric Playground\"s 2001 Blister Awards."

Each club again played a differing number of fixtures, depending upon the closeness of neighbours, ease of travel etc.. The season tapered off towards the end when the 1919 (Feb-May) \"Victory\" League was hurriedly introduced.\nSeason summary.\nThe war was starting its fifth year and the Rugby League again started the season by continuing with the Wartime Emergency League set up. This arrangement, as in other sports, meant that the sport could continue, which in turn would boost the public's moral. The fixtures were usually quite local, thus cutting down on travelling time and costs, whilst not wasting precious war resources.\nSeveral clubs did not participate during this season :-\nNo clubs re-joined the League and no new clubs joined the league for this season.\nAlthough it is known that St Helens Recs did play some matches during the season, it is not clear whether these were just friendlies or whether part of the league programme.\nThe armistice was signed in a railway carriage in Compiègne Forest on 11 November 1918, signifying an end to the Great War. This in turn meant a slight relaxation of the emergency rules on sport and leisure introduced by the British Government during the war. The Northern Union decided to organise a new \"Victory\" League\" starting in February 1919. This in turn meant that the 1918–19 League programme seemed to peter out and was never finished. Consequently no table was ever produced for the \"partial\" season.\nNote - Nowhere in the official archives is the word \"Victory\" used. It has been used in this article to distinguish between the two competitions held in the 1918–19 season.\nThere is very little information available for this partial season, although Wigan played 13 matches and Hull F.C. 12 matches.\nThe table below gives the teams competing in alphabetical order, only Wigan and Hull F.C. results are complete.\nThere were no other trophies to play for during this season.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the duration of the war. \nThe majority of the trophies, such as the County Leagues and County Cups were also suspended for the duration of the First World War.\nNotes and Comments.\n1 - It is uncertain as to whether the matches played by St Helens Recs were friendlies or went towards the league programme"

        "title": "2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final was the last match of the 2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup which took place on September 11, 2011 at the Stadio del Mare, in the Italian city of Ravenna. The final took place between Russia, who were taking place in their first ever final and defending champions Brazil, who were playing in their fourteenth final, aiming to win their fourteenth title. The result of the match saw Russia claim the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup crown, winning their first ever title and becoming only the third team other than Brazil to win the World Cup.\nRoads to the final.\nRussia.\nRussia began their World Cup campaign in Group C alongside Nigeria, Tahiti and Venezuela, as European Champions after winning the 2011 Euro Beach Soccer League. Having finished third in the European World Cup qualifiers in July 2010, as well as playing in a group with two surprise nations, who not only were not expected to qualify but had never even competed in a FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup before, quickly made Russia one of the favourites of the competition.\nRussia's first match came against Nigeria, who pundits thought would be the only nation to pose any sort of threat to Russia's predicted dominance in the group. Despite Nigeria's enthusiasm and athleticism, Russia were the eventual victors, scoring twice as many goals as their opponents, winning 8-4. Their second match in the group stage came against Tahiti. The Oceanian side defeated regular World Cup participants the Solomon Islands in qualifying to compete in their first ever World Cup, making Russia odds on favourites to win the match, regardless of Tahiti's surprise win against Venezuela in the first round of matches. As expected, Russia controlled the game and steered to a 5-0 victory, ensuring qualification for the quarter-finals. In Russia's final match, they met Venezuela who had already been eliminated from the competition. In an exhibition style performance from both sides, Russia claimed all three points, therefore taking their total to a maximum total of nine points, finishing first in the group.\nHaving finished first in Group C, Russia met the runners-up of Group D, Mexico in the quarter finals. Having won the North American qualifiers back in December 2010, as well as having finished in second place in the World Cup of 2007, Mexico went into the quarter-finals against Russia, evenly matched. However this was not to be the case. Russia never found themselves behind in the match and went on to win 5-3 to progress to their first ever World Cup semi final. By far the biggest shock in the competition, it would be El Salvador who would play Russia in the semi-finals. The Central American's, who up until now had never even won a game at a World Cup, had beaten Oman and Argentina in the group stage and had even beaten hosts and European giants Italy in the quarter-finals to reach this stage, making Russia huge favourites to reach the final. In spite of El Salvador's efforts, Russia prevailed in a straightforward semi final, winning 7-3, moving on to play in their first ever FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final.\nBrazil.\nBrazil started their World Cup campaign in Group D alongside Mexico, Ukraine and Japan, as reigning World Champions as well as being considered the best team in the world, having won the last four FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups and having scored a huge 56 goals in 6 games during qualifying. Brazil were by far the favourites to win a fifth consecutive title.\nBrazil's first match was against the surprise champions of the European qualifiers, Ukraine. Despite having beaten the likes of Switzerland and Portugal to win the European qualifiers, many believed it was a stroke of luck that Ukraine were champions of the tournament and therefore it was expected that they would struggle against Brazil. However this was not the case. Ukraine, playing a very defensive game, taking Brazil to a penalty shootout after a 3-3 draw after extra time, but ultimately, after a fantastic performance by Ukraine and an average performance by Brazil, the South American's won the penalty shootout 2-1, taking 2 points away from the game. It was the first time since 2007 that Brazil had been taken past normal time. Brazil's second game was against Mexico. Again, Brazil's performance was below par however their quality was still enough to win the game, 5-2, which all but secured a place in the quarter-finals. The final round of matches saw Brazil take on already eliminated Japan. Although Japan had been convincingly beaten by both Mexico and Ukraine, Brazil once again struggled to dominate as they have dominated games in the past and scraped to a 3-2 victory, finishing top of the group on 8 points.\nHaving finished first in Group D, Brazil met the runners-up of Group C, Nigeria in the quarter-finals. Having finished second behind Senegal in the African qualifiers, plus having failed to beat giants Russia in the group stage, it was thought unlikely that Nigeria could pose any threat to Brazil. Nevertheless, Brazil's lack of form gave confidence to Nigeria who, in a stunning game, drew the game level at 8 goals all in the final minutes, taking Brazil to extra time; the first time in history that Brazil had been taken to extra time twice in a World Cup. Brazil scored two goals in extra time to win 10-8 and move into the semi-finals. For the third tournament in a row, Brazil met Portugal in the semi-finals. With Brazil's mediocre performances, many believed that Portugal could put an end to Brazil's winning streak of 28 World Cup games. Having already played 4 games, Brazil finally found form when they needed to, coming through to beat their old rivals 4-1 to set up another World Cup final.\nSummary.\nComparison.\nRussia finished the group stage after 3 conclusive wins, taking a maximum 9 points away from the games, scoring 20 goals and conceding just 7 to have a positive goal difference of 13. On the other hand, the usually dominant Brazil found themselves having 8 points on the board for the first time since 2007, scoring a record low 11 goals, conceding 7, leaving Brazil on a positive goal difference of 4, after some very average games. Despite Brazil's performances, they were still favourites in the final due to there experience in World Cup finals."

        "text": "The 2011–12 VCU Rams men's basketball team represented Virginia Commonwealth University during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. It was the 44th season of the University fielding a men's basketball program. Led by third-year head coach Shaka Smart, the Rams were coming off a season marked by a run to the Final Four. Expected to finish lower in the CAA regular season standings, the Rams finished as regular season runners-up with a 15–3 conference record, before winning the 2012 CAA Men's Basketball Championship against Drexel, 59–56, earning their 11th ever berth into the NCAA Tournament. It was also the first season since 1984–85 that the Rams consecutively qualified for the NCAA Tournament.\nDuring the NCAA Tournament, the Rams were the only CAA representative in the tournament and earned a 12-seed. The Rams upset Wichita State in the second round, before losing to Indiana in the Third Round.\nPreseason.\nVCU was predicted to finish third in the Colonial Athletic Association preseason polls, which was released October 18, 2011 in Arlington, Virginia. Senior guard/forward Bradford Burgess was selected to the preseason Colonial Athletic Association first team.\nAccolades.\nHonors and awards.\nSenior guard/forward Bradford Burgess was named to the first team Colonial Athletic Association. Sophomore forward Juvonte Reddic and junior guard Darius Theus were named to the third team Colonial Athletic Association. Theus was also named to the Colonial Athletic Association all defensive team.\nRegular season.\nPrior to the start of the regular season, the men's basketball team played two preseason exhibitions. On November 3, the Rams defeated Cal U. Vulcans 71–48. Treveon Graham of the Rams led the team in scoring with 16 points.\nThe regular season began with the Rams hosting the Saint Francis Red Flash on November 11. In a close affair, the Rams earned a 63–57 victory over the Red Flash to open up the season. Despite the opening victory, the Rams lost their second two games of the season, both at neutral venues during the Charleston Classic, losing to Seton Hall and Georgia Tech. Against Tech, the Rams held an eight-point lead at halftime, before relinquishing the lead in the second half. Bradford Burgess led the Rams in scoring, with 17 points. Their final game of the Classic ended in a five-point victory over Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. On November 23, the Rams played the Hilltoppers again, this time in an intra-conference early season game, and still picked up a victory. Burgess once again led the Rams in scoring, with 16 points.\nOn November 27, 2011, the Rams traveled south to take on the Alabama Crimson Tide, their first nationally ranked opponent of the season. The Crimson Tide, who were NIT finalists the previous season, had gone off to a 6–0 start to the season, and were ranked thirteenth in the nation at the time of tip-off. The Crimson Tide were also coached by former Rams head coach Anthony Grant, who led the Rams to three NCAA Tournaments during his tenure. While the game was closely contested, the Tide pulled away late on to earn a 72–64 victory. Burgess led the Rams in scoring with 18 points. At the time, the 64 points scored by the Rams was the most points the Crimson Tide had allowed all season long.\nFrom late November until early January, the Rams went on an eight-game winning streak, including victories over their intercity rivals, the Richmond Spiders and South Florida.\nThe Rams began Colonial Athletic Association conference play on December 17, 2011, by hosting the UNC Wilmington Seahawks. Despite having a 2–6 regular season record at the time, the Seahawks were on a two-game winning streak. The Rams, also on a two-game win-streak were able to dominate the majority of the game, earning an 87–64 victory of the Seahawks. Once again, Burgess led the Rams in scoring, tallying 22 points. Juvonte Reddic of the Rams led the team in rebounds, totaling nine off the glass. Darius Theus led the Rams with both assists and steals, accumulating eight assists and seven steals.\nFollowing their conference opener against UNC Wilmington, the Rams played three more non-conference games to close out 2011. At their December 20 home game, the Rams posted a 68–49 victory over the UAB Blazers. Following the victory over the Blazers, the Rams travelled to games at UNC Greensboro and Akron, winning each affair. The December 29 victory at Akron was the Rams' first overtime game and victory of the season.\nTo open 2012, the Rams traveled up north to take conference foe, Hofstra. The January 2 game resulted in a 17-point victory for the Rams, making it, at the time, the largest road victory for VCU of the season. Two days later, the Rams hosted Georgia State, and suffered their first home loss of the season, falling 53–55 against the Panthers. The game was also the Rams' first defeat in CAA play. Their follow-up game at Drexel also resulted in a narrow defeat, as the Rams fell to the Dragons, 58–64.\nFor the next month, from January 11 – February 12, the Rams went on an eleven-game winning streak, improving their overall record to 22–5 and their conference record to 13–2. The record earned the Rams three votes in the AP Coaches' Poll, making them unofficially ranked 36th in the nation amongst Division I schools. Their winning streak came to end on February 14, when the Rams traveled north to take on their I-95 rivals, George Mason. The closely-knit affair saw the Rams lose 61–62 on a last-second three-pointer by George Mason's Sherrod Wight.\nFollowing the one-point loss to George Mason, the Rams played their final non-conference game of the regular season against Northern Iowa in the ESPN BracketBusters series. Held at the Siegel Center, the Rams earned a 77–68 victory over the Panthers, giving the Rams a final non-conference regular-season record of 10–3. The Rams finished their conference schedule at home against George Mason. Following the narrow loss to George Mason in Fairfax, VCU beat George Mason 89-77 to end conference play at 15-3.\nPostseason.\nFinishing as the regular season runners-up, the Rams earned a direct bye to the quarterfinals of the 2012 CAA men's basketball tournament, where they earned the second seed in the tournament. Their conference tournament run began on March 3, 2012, when the Rams took on the Northeastern Huskies at the Richmond Coliseum in downtown Richmond, Virginia. The Rams won 75–65 and advanced to the semifinals against Mason. In the semifinals, the Rams took a 22-point lead against Mason, leading 22–0 before Mason successfully scored their first basket. Winning, again by a ten-point margin, 74–64, the Rams reached their second-consecutive CAA Championship, and their seventh in the past eleven years. In the CAA Championship, VCU took on Drexel, whom they lost to during the regular season. After leading by as many as sixteen in the second half, the Rams would weather a Drexel comeback, winning their fifth CAA tournament, 59–56.\nOn March 11, 2012, the Rams were announced by the NCAA Selection Committee as a #12 seed in the Southern Region, taking on Wichita State in the second round of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Wichita State, finished the season ranked #15 in the nation and won the previous year's National Invitation Tournament. Played in Portland, Oregon at the Rose Garden, the Rams took a 62–59 victory over Wichita State, sending them into the Third Round of the NCAA Tournament. The Rams led by as many as 13 points in the game. As the season comes to a close, VCU was defeated in a heart breaker by Indiana in the third round of the NCAA tournament after Hoosiers came back from 6 down with 4 minutes to win 63-61 as VCU's three-point attempt bounced off the inside of the rim at the buzzer. The Ram's season finished with a 29-7 record.\nSchedule.\nSource\n!colspan=12| Preseason Exhibitions\n!colspan=12| Regular season\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n!colspan=9| 2012 CAA men's basketball tournament\n!colspan=9| 2012 NCAA tournament"

It is currently produced by Manny Pacquiao's MP Promotions and is currently airing on One Sports channel since 2022.\nIn the original version, the show was produced by Vintage Sports and aired over television network PTV and later IBC. Debuting in 1994, it focuses mainly on up-and-coming boxing prospects. The show ended in 1999.\nHistory.\nThe show is usually taped on small venues and gyms across Metro Manila (usually from Parañaque or Mandaluyong).\nThe show is noted for airing the early bouts of Manny Pacquiao, who quickly became one of its featured boxers.\nRevival.\nThe show was revived on December 13, 2015, and aired every Sunday afternoon on TV5. Pacquiao, one of the homegrown boxers featured in Blow by Blow, together with Sports5, former North Cotabato vice governor and acclaimed boxing analyst Manny Piñol, and boxing promoters Gerry Garcia and Lito Mondejar spearheaded the return of the program that will feature boxing fights of amateur boxers in the country.\nIn November 2022, Pacquiao, through his MP Promotions, revived the show this time on One Sports channel.\nNotable incidents.\nEugene Barutag incident.\nOn December 9, 1995, a young fighter from General Santos City named Eugene Barutag, was scheduled for an eight-round match against veteran Randy Andagan of Biñan, Laguna. Barutag was winning the match in the first four rounds and almost knocked out Andagan, but the latter got his second wind and beat the younger boxer, who at the end of the bout, collapsed in his corner. At that time, there were no standby paramedics in case of emergency. Using the service vehicle of Vintage Sports, Barutag was rushed to the Jose Reyes Memorial Hospital and was declared dead on arrival.\nThe bout was shown on an i-Witness episode entitled \"Kamao\" (fist). The episode won a Peabody Award, together with two other documentaries that the program produced.\nThe fight also features in the 2015 Movie, Kid Kulafu, where Manny Pacquiao witnesses his death."

In the second semi-final England defeated India by 35 runs at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, on 5 November 1987. Australia and England met in the Final on 8 November 1987 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, with Australia winning the trophy by 7 runs.\nSemi-finals.\nAustralia vs Pakistan.\nThe Australian batsmen got off to a very good start, and they scored fluently, with David Boon (65 from 91 balls, 4 fours) top scoring, and making an 82 run second-wicket partnership with DM Jones. Australia were looking to reach 300 with strong batting before Imran Khan took 3 wickets for 17 runs in 5 overs. Australia lost 4/31, but a high number of extras (34) from the Pakistani bowlers, as well as the solid batting from earlier on, brought Australia to 267 (8 wickets, 50 overs).\nPakistan started badly, falling to 3/38. Imran Khan (58 from 84 balls, 4 fours) and Javed Miandad (70 from 103 balls, 4 fours) shared a partnership of 112 runs in 26 overs. However, with the required run rate at 7.87 runs when Miandad fell, there was just too much for the upcoming batsmen to do, and Pakistan lost 6/99 as they were bowled all out for 249 (all out, 49 overs). Earlier Steve Waugh scored 18 runs off the 50th over bowled by Saleem Jaffar and ironically Pakistan lost the match by 18 runs.\nEngland vs India.\nIndia won the toss and chose to field. After reaching 2/79, Graham Gooch (115 from 136 balls, 11 fours) and captain Mike Gatting (56 from 62 balls, 5 fours) shared a partnership of 117 runs in 19 overs. After Gooch was finally stumped, 51 more runs were added, and England reached 254 (6 wickets, 50 overs).\nIndia made a bad start, falling to 3/73. The middle order scored fluently, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls, 7 fours) top scoring. Before Azharuddin was removed lbw by Eddie Hemmings, India were at 5/204, needing 5 runs an over from the last 10 overs, with 5 wickets in hand, and it looked like it would be a very close game. However, the middle and tailend order for India collapsed, as India lost 5/15. India were eventually bowled all out for 219 (all out, 45.3 overs), giving England both a berth in the final and a measure of revenge for the loss they suffered to India in the semifinal of the World Cup four years earlier in England.\nFinal.\nAustralia won the toss and chose to bat. David Boon (75 from 125 balls, 7 fours) top-scored for Australia, whose batsmen scored fluently. Australia posted 253 (5 wickets, 50 overs). Mike Veletta (45 from 31 balls, 6 fours) cut loose late in the innings, as Australia scored 65 runs from the last 6 overs of their innings.\nIn the English reply, opener Tim Robinson fell leg before wicket for a first ball duck. Bill Athey (58 from 103 balls, 2 fours) top-scored, and England were almost on target, when captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) handed back the initiative with the loss of his wicket, going for a reverse sweep which ended a growing partnership of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Athey. Allan Lamb (45 from 55 balls, 4 fours) also posted a great innings, but it was in vain as the required run-rate for England began to rise. When England failed to score the last 17 runs from the final over, the cup went to Australia."

        "text": "The South African national cricket team toured Zimbabwe in November 1999 and played a single Test match against the Zimbabwean national cricket team. The tour took place immediately after Zimbabwe had visited South Africa to play their first Test match in the country with only a fortnight separating the matches. South Africa had previously played one Test match in Zimbabwe in 1995 and had visited the country to play a single One Day International in 1992 soon after the end of the apartheid era sporting boycott of South Africa, although sides from Zimbabwe and Rhodesia had previously played in South African domestic cricket competitions, including during the apartheid era.\nSouth Africa won the Test match convincingly, recording their biggest victory and Zimbabwe's heaviest Test defeat in the process. Later in the summer Zimbabwe returned to South Africa to play in the 2000 Standard Bank Triangular Tournament, a series of One Day Internationals against England and South Africa, before England toured Zimbabwe for a four-match ODI series. The Test match was the only game South Africa played in Zimbabwe and the team returned home immediately after the match was completed.\nTour party.\nFollowing their convincing victory at Bloemfontein at the beginning of the month, the South African selectors named the same team on 2 November. The team was captained by Hansie Cronje and had twelfth man Nicky Boje as a replacement. Both Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs were unavailable as the result of injuries. The same 11 players took to the field in Harare as had done at Bloemfontein.\nZimbabwe were captained by Andy Flower following Alistair Campbell's resignation only 48 hours before the start of the match. Flower had captained the team before Campbell and was reinstated for the match. The Zimbabwean team was also unchanged from the match at Bloemfontein with key bowlers Heath Streak and Paul Strang both unavailable through injury. The team had suffered heavy defeats to Australia earlier in the summer as well as the loss at Bloemfontein and, \"Wisden\" reported, were suffering from low morale as a result of these results and an ongoing pay dispute.\nTest match.\nThe match was played at the refurbished Harare Sports Club. The toss was won by South Africa who chose to bowl first on a pitch which had \"quite a bit of grass left on it\" and favoured the experienced South African bowling attack.\nThe first day was cut short with only 23 overs possible. Writing in \"Wisden\", Geoffrey Dean was of the view that the match began in \"conditions overwhelmingly favouring the bowlers\" and a combination of the conditions, the \"helpful pitch\" and \"injudicious strokes\" by Zimbabwean batsmen saw the home side bowled out for only 102 runs by lunch on day two. The total was Zimbabwe's lowest in Test matches at the time; John Ward considered that the \"brilliant\" bowling of the South African attack and the low confidence of Zimbabwe's batsmen as well as the pitch and conditions were the causes of the batting collapse.\nSouth Africa scored 492 runs in reply, with centuries for Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis. Although the pitch was still helpful to bowlers, Zimbabwe's bowling were less consistent or effective and the South African batsmen more experienced – Kallis' hundred was described as \"masterful\" whilst Boucher, who went in as a nightwatchman towards the end of the second day, scored 125, the highest score made by a nightwatchman in Test cricket at the time. Boucher and Shaun Pollock put on 148 runs for the eighth South African wicket, a new eighth wicket record for the country, and South Africa declared before the start of play on the fourth day, leaving Zimbabwe requiring 390 runs to make South Africa bat again with two whole days play remaining.\nThe Zimbabwean second innings lasted only 3 and a half hours, with the team dismissed for 148 runs. The Zimbabwean batting was described in \"Wisden\" as \"dispirited and inept\", although Ward considered that the South Africa's bowlers were \"dominant\", with Donald taking Grant Flower's wicket with an unplayable delivery with only the second ball of the innings. The result was Zimbabwe's worst defeat in Test cricket, with South Africa winning by an innings and 219 runs, their biggest Test match victory. The player of the match was awarded jointly to Boucher and Pollock."

Bangladesh also played three List A matches. They lost two by large margins, one was unfinished, and a fourth was abandoned without play. Bangladesh were captained by Akram Khan. Bangladesh had just won the 1997 ICC Trophy and was a candidate for Test status, which was granted on 26 June 2000.\nBangladesh had been playing List A matches since 1986, but the four first-class matches on this tour were the first first-class matches played by any Bangladeshi team.\nTeam.\nSeveral leading players were unavailable, including Mohammad Rafique and Khaled Mahmud.\nThe tour.\nAll the Bangladesh players made their first-class debuts. In the Bangladesh second innings Kerry Walmsley took 5 for 23 and Mark Haslam took 5 for 25. The match, scheduled for four days, finished on the third afternoon.\nMark Jefferson had innings figures of 3 for 5 and 5 for 42. Jefferson's match figures of 8–47 were his best in first class cricket. No Bangladesh batsman reached 50. The match was over by the end of the second day.\nIn Bangladesh's first innings Al Sahariar hit Bangladesh's first first-class century, 102 off 184 balls.\nChris Gaffaney and Michael Parlane scored centuries for the Academy and put on 213 for the first wicket. David Sewell took 5 for 34 and 4 for 47.\nAssessment.\nThe convenor of New Zealand's selection panel, Ross Dykes, thought Bangladesh played at a level below first-class standard – more like Hawke Cup district association standard. \"Wisden's\" report said the batsmen \"played suicidal one-day shots early in first-class innings\", and noted that the bowlers took only 36 wickets in the four first-class matches at a collective average of 47.16.\"\nAftermath.\nSeven of the team – Akram Khan, Al Sahariar, Aminul Islam, Habibul Bashar, Hasibul Hossain, Khaled Mashud and Mehrab Hossain – all played in Bangladesh's inaugural Test match three years later. Javed Omar, Manjural Islam and Sanwar Hossain also played Test cricket. For Athar Ali Khan, Jewel Hossain and Mafizur Rahman, in contrast, the matches on this tour comprised their entire first-class careers.\nNew Zealand had intended to invite Kenya to play in the 1998–99 Shell Conference, but after Bangladesh's lack of competitiveness they changed their minds and invited the stronger Pakistan A instead."

        "text": "The South Africa national cricket team toured Australia from November 1910 to March 1911 to play five test matches against Australia. This was the South Africans first tour of Australia and the second tour between the two nations after the Australia tour of South Africa in late 1902.\nBefore the first test, the South Africans played in five warm-up matches before the first test. Australia would win the opening two tests of the series in Sydney and Melbourne, before South Africa recorded their first test win against Australia in the third test at Adelaide by 28 runs. Three more tour matches against Tasmania and Victoria were played before the fourth test in Melbourne where the Australians won the series by 530 runs. After a tour match against New South Wales a week prior, the South Africans would go on to lose the final test match by seven wickets.\nAubrey Faulkner was leading the run scorer for the series with 732 runs from ten innings, while the leading wicket taker was Australian bowler Bill Whitty who took 37 wickets in ten innings.\nBackground.\nThe 1910–11 series was the first time that the South Africans had toured Australia. This was also the second series between these nations with the first tour being the 1902–03 tour of South Africa where Australia had won the series 2–0. For the South Africans, their last series was at home to England in 1909-10 with the South Africans recording a 3–2 series victory. Leading into the tour, the South Africans touring team did play two matches in South Africa against Transvaal and Western Province before they left aboard to head to Australia. Australia on the other hand had won their last series 2–1 against England back in the 1909 Ashes series.\nTour matches.\nSouth Africa vs. South Australia.\nThe first game of the tour for the South Africans was a trip over to South Australia as they took on the South Australians. After being sent into bat, the South Africans were bowled over for only 133 with some people stating that the tourists were being treaty fairly. In response, South Australia could only get 183 which meant that they held a fifty run lead with Reggie Schwarz taking six wickets. Dave Nourse and Louis Stricker then guided the South Africans on Day 2 with a 242 run partnership with the first 100 of those being scored over 67 minutes. Stricker who was playing his first tour outside of Africa would score 146 which would be his highest score in first-class cricket. Though Nourse would go and score 201 as he would give South Australia a target of 458 runs which South Australia fall 281 runs short as Schwarz took another five wicket haul.\nSouth Africa vs. Victoria.\nThree days later the South Africans headed to Melbourne for the second tour match with it being against the Victorians. After the first day play was mainly washed out except for a brief period in the morning, the South Africans could only score 189 which was aided with a 106 run partnership between Nourse and Aubrey Faulkner. Victoria opened their innings at 4:50pm and would see Tom Warne ending the second day one run short of his half-century. He would go on to finish on 84 as him, Bert Kortlang and Jimmy Matthews all scoring fifties as Victoria scored 301 just before 5pm local time. Bert Vogler being the pick of the bowlers as he took five wickets. \nVictoria was then set a target of only 125 runs when the South Africans were all bowled out for 236 with Matthews taking another three wickets while Frank Laver had two chances go begging. For the South Africans, Faulkner top scored for the South Africans with 69 which included another 80+ run partnership between him ad Nourse. Though this was aided by the tail contributing in what The Age described as having \"no tail\". The Victorians went on to win the match by five wickets, with top scorer Barlow Carkeek scoring the winning runs for Victoria at 12:10 local time. 23,598 attended the match across the five days as the South Africans went on the train off to New South Wales for the next tour game which was only two days away. \nSouth Africa vs. New South Wales.\nThe South Africans next took on New South Wales in Sydney. Once again batting first, the South Africans scored 300 with Faulkner and Striker each scoring 70s which the pair also played in a partnership of 82 runs. Charles Kelleway was the leading wicket taker in the innings with five wickets which included the wicket of Striker. New South Wales in response got off to a good start by the end of the opening day at 70 without loss in what would be later be a 122 run partnership between Victor Trumper and Warren Bardsley. For Warren his 70 would come off only 69 minutes before caught off a delivery from Bert Vogler. This partnership would be the backbone in Day 2, but consist wickets from the South Africans brought them back into the match and gave them a lead of only 13 runs with Faulkner claiming five wickets. The crowd applauded the Bert Folkard performance on the third day as he took a six-wicket haul with him being a major assistance in restricting the South Africans to only 198 which the hosts would go on to win the match by three wickets with Trumper again top scoring with 78. \nStatistics.\nAfter all five tests were played, South African batsman, Aubrey Faulkner ended the series with the most runs with 732 runs from ten innings with highest score being a double century in the second test in Melbourne. He finished ahead of two Australians in Victor Trumper (661 runs) and Warren Bardsley (573 runs). For bowling, the leading wicket taker was Australian bowler Bill Whitty who took 37 wickets which included a 6/17 in the second test match which was held in Sydney. He finished ahead of South African bowler, Reggie Schwarz who took 25 wickets with Tibby Cotter rounding out the top three with 22."

        "text": "An Australian team toured New Zealand and Fiji from February to April 1905 to play four first-class matches including two against New Zealand, which had not then attained Test status. Although it was the fifth Australian team to tour New Zealand, it was the first one to play matches on even terms, which therefore have first-class status. On previous tours all matches had been against teams of 15, 18 or 22 players. As well as the two matches against New Zealand, the Australians played first-class matches against Canterbury and Otago. The other games were non-first-class against Auckland, Wellington and Fiji.\nThe Australian team was captained by Monty Noble and included several notable Test players such as Warwick Armstrong, Tibby Cotter, Clem Hill and Victor Trumper. After they left Fiji they proceeded on to their tour of England. Joe Darling, who captained the team once it arrived in England, was unavailable for the tour of New Zealand and Fiji.\nThe Australians won the matches against Auckland, Canterbury and Otago and drew against Wellington. They were held to a draw in the first match against New Zealand, but they won the second match by an innings and 358 runs.\nThe team.\nLaver was the player-manager, assisted by Newland.\nThe matches.\nFirst-class matches are indicated in bold.\nAfter delays caused by rain, the Australians needed 137 to win in one hour, on a wet pitch. Trumper hit 87 not out, giving the Australians victory off 18 overs with one minute to spare. His innings was described some years later as \"almost universally recognised as the finest innings that has ever been seen in New Zealand\".\nArmstrong made 126 not out and took 5 for 27 and 5 for 25. Hill made 118, Trumper 84. For New Zealand, Keith Ollivier took 5 for 113 and top-scored in each innings with 39 and 32 not out. Rain delayed the start of play on the final day.\nTrumper made 172, Hill 129. Together they added 269 in 110 minutes for the sixth wicket. Armstrong made 67 not out and took 6 for 51 in the second innings. The former Australian Test batsman and Test umpire Charles Bannerman umpired both matches in partnership with a local umpire.\nThe former Australian Test players Sydney Callaway and Harry Graham, both of whom had moved to New Zealand in recent years, represented New Zealand in both matches. The New Zealand captain was Arthur Sims, who later organised and captained the Australian team that toured New Zealand in 1913-14. When Sims was injured and had to leave the field during the second match, Graham acted as captain.\nHowell took 5 for 6. The top-scorer was Hopkins with 54.\nLeading players.\nTrumper was the highest scorer in the four first-class matches, with 436 runs at an average of 109.00. Hill scored 308 runs at 77.00, and Armstrong 254 at 127.00. Armstrong was the leading wicket-taker, with 21 wickets at an average of 6.90. Cotter took 15 wickets at 9.20, and Noble 15 at 12.20.\nAmong the New Zealanders, the highest first-class score was 49 by James Lawrence for Canterbury. The best bowling figures were 5 for 84 by Joe Bennett, also in the Canterbury match."

New Zealand at this time had not been elevated to Test status.\nAustralia won five of the seven first-class matches by comfortable margins, including the two against New Zealand. The match against Canterbury was a close draw, and the last match, against Hawke's Bay, was abandoned without any play taking place.\nBackground.\nIn late 1908, The New Zealand Cricket Council asked the Australian Board of Control of Cricket to consider a proposal that the Australian team selected for the 1909 Ashes tour play a series of matches in New Zealand prior to departing for England, as had been the case for the previous tour in 1904/05. The Australian Board declined this proposal and offered to send a Second Eleven team instead. The New Zealand authorities rejected this proposal on the grounds that a second-string team would not make the tour a financial success and asked the Australian Board on what terms would the Australian side visit New Zealand on their return journey from England. Again, this proposal was rejected by the Australian Board and the arrangements for the tour were pushed back to the 1909/10 season.\nTeam.\nOn 14 Jan 1910 the Australian Board of Control of Cricket met and appointed a selection committee of Clem Hill, Frank Iredale and Peter McAlister to choose the touring squad and appointed Alick Mackenzie as the tour manager and Australian Board representative. The appointment of Mackenzie to this role was seen as a reward for his services to Australian cricket after a long career. The 1909/10 season was his last in competitive cricket. It was his second tour of New Zealand having previously toured with the New South Wales side in 1893/94.\nThe Australian Board of Control asked each state representative on the board to nominate a set number of players from their state for selection. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were asked to nominate six players each, while Queensland and Tasmania were asked to nominate two each. From this pool of 22 players the selectors would choose a final touring squad of 13.\nOf the players initially selected, Gar Waddy and Stanley Hill were unavailable to make the tour. They were replaced in the team by Tom Warne and Charles Simpson respectively.\nThe touring party was not a full-strength Australian team. Of the selected players, only Armstrong, Bardsley, Hopkins and Whitty had previously played Test cricket and no other players outside of those four had toured with the 1909 Australian team in England. Outside those four, Emery, Kelleway, Mayne and Smith went on to play Tests.\nThe tour.\nThe touring party left Australia on 5 February 1910, departing Sydney on the steamship \"Moeraki\", and arrived in New Zealand at Wellington on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival the touring party were officially welcomed to Wellington at a function in the town hall hosted by Dr. Alfred Newman."

The Australians also played the main provincial teams.\nThe touring team.\nThe Australian team, with ages at the start of the tour, was:\nThe manager was Tom Howard of New South Wales.\nAs the Test series against England was still in progress when the tour began, the team for New Zealand was virtually an Australian second eleven. None of the players had taken part in the Test series. The only player with Test experience was Ransford, who played 20 Tests before World War I. John Ellis, Hunter Hendry, Johnny Moyes, Arthur Richardson, Donald Steele (named as captain) and Carl Willis were selected but were unavailable. They were replaced by Bogle, Forssberg, Hornibrook, Kippax and Waddy.\nThe tour.\nThe Australians arrived in Wellington on the SS \"Manuka\" on 7 February. They were given a civic reception on 8 February at the Town Hall, with speeches of welcome from the mayor, John Luke, and Sir Francis Bell, president of the Wellington Cricket Association.\nFirst-class matches are indicated in bold.\nThis was one of two scheduled two-day first-class matches in the tour. It was the last first-class match for Hawke's Bay, who played 53 first-class matches between 1884 and 1921. Their top scorer in each innings was Bob Bishop, who made 61 and 60. Ransford made 158, \"retired out\".\nThe match was scheduled for three days but completed in two. This match was the only first-class match ever played by the Minor Associations, and for six of their team it was their only first-class match. They included the Rev. Tasman Drake, an Anglican minister who was serving in Gisborne at the time.\nRain prevented play on the second day. This was a two-day first-class match, and the last of the eight first-class matches Southland played between 1915 and 1921.\nBogle was the match top-scorer with 69. Ironmonger took 6 for 34 in the second innings. For Otago, Dick Torrance took 5 for 68.\nMost of the first day was lost to rain. Liddicut top-scored in each innings for Australia with 83 and 49 not out. The New Zealand captain Stan Brice took 7 for 80 in the first innings. The gate takings of 925 pounds were a record for a match in New Zealand.\nThe Australians made their runs off 108 eight-ball overs in 430 minutes. Richardson made 112, Lampard 132, and Ransford 128. Lampard also took seven wickets and Ironmonger nine. Sydney Smith was New Zealand's top scorer with 89 in the first innings.\nDuring a week of sightseeing and recreation in the central hot springs region of the North Island, the Australians also won a light-hearted one-day match against a team of locals in Taupō on 9 April, for which no scores are available. They left Auckland for Sydney on the SS \"Maheno\" on 14 April."

Bull of New South Wales was the team manager.\nIt was a strong team. \"The Cricketer\" said that \"the majority of the cricketers may be expected to represent the Commonwealth [of Australia] in the Test matches against England a few months hence. J. M. Gregory, in fact, was the only likely man who did not make the trip.\"\nThe tour.\nThe team arrived in Wellington on the SS \"Marama\" on 14 February. They were given a civic reception at the Town Hall that afternoon by the Mayor of Wellington, George Troup. The president of the New Zealand Cricket Council, the former New Zealand captain Dan Reese, also spoke at the reception, noting that the visit marked the golden jubilee of cricket tours between the two countries. \nThe Australians arrived in Nelson early on the morning of the match, which commenced at 11.55 after a welcome at the ground by the Mayor of Nelson. Grimmett, returning to New Zealand for the first time since migrating to Australia in 1914, took 7 for 64 on the first day. Kippax scored 115. \nWoodfull made 165, and Grimmett took seven wickets against his former team.

        "text": "The Australian national cricket team toured New Zealand in March 1946, playing a single Test match against New Zealand's national team.\nThe Australians opened the tour with first-class matches against the four Plunket Shield teams, winning all by large margins, three of them by an innings.\nThe Test, played at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, was the first played between the two countries, and the first Test played after the conclusion of World War II. Australia (captained by Bill Brown), won the match by an innings and 103 runs, having bowled out New Zealand (captained by Walter Hadlee) twice in less than two days. The two national sides did not again meet in Tests until New Zealand toured during the 1973–74 season.\nBackground.\nTeams from the Australian colonies had visited New Zealand as early as the 1877–78 season, when a combined Australian team played several matches against New Zealand teams. These tours persisted well into the early 20th century, with unofficial Test matches between national representative sides occurring during both the 1909–10 and 1913–14 tours. However, no full internationals were played, owing to the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket's perception of New Zealand as a second-class team. Despite this, New Zealand played its first Test series when an English team toured during the 1929–30 season. Australia had not played an official Test series since its 1938 tour of England, with New Zealand's last Test series occurring on its tour of England the previous season.\nA Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the Second World War. An itinerary of 14 matches – three Tests, four first-class matches against Plunket Shield teams, and seven other matches – had been arranged, and it was expected that Don Bradman would lead a strong team.\nCricket during World War II had been severely limited in both countries, although an Australian Services team, captained by Lindsay Hassett, had played a series of \"Victory Tests\" during the 1945 English season.\nTest series.\nOnly Test.\nThe status of the match at the time was uncertain, and the game was not recognised as an official Test until March 1948. Instead of the usual baggy greens, the Australians wore caps and blazers marked \"ABC\" (for \"Australian Board of Control\"). Both teams included several debutants—of the twenty-two players in the match, thirteen were making their debut. Australia's best batsman and usual captain Don Bradman declined to tour, having suffered from regular bouts of fibrositis. Queensland batsman Bill Brown was selected as captain in his place, although Lindsay Hassett had also been suggested for the position. New Zealand was skippered by Otago batsman Walter Hadlee, with pre-war captain Curly Page having retired. Australia included seven debutants for the Test, many of whom would go on to play large roles for the national side in later tours, including during the 1948 \"Invincibles\" tour. The match was also Bill O'Reilly's last at Test level."

New Zealand batted first and made 231, Doug Ring taking 7 for 88 and Tony MacGibbon, playing his first match for New Zealand, top-scoring with 65 at number seven. Australia were 105 for 5 in reply when Don Tallon came to the crease; he scored 116 in three hours with eight fours and seven sixes, and Australia made 299. Fen Cresswell took 8 for 100 off 48.3 overs. New Zealand then lost wickets quickly and were 67 for 9, still one run in arrears with 15 minutes to play, when Cresswell joined the New Zealand captain, Walter Hadlee. They stayed together till time expired with the score at 76 for 9.\nThe Australians won all nine minor matches, seven of them by an innings. Only one century was scored against them during the whole tour, by Noel McMahon for Waikato. In the first-class matches the Australian spin bowler Jack Iverson took 25 wickets at an average of 12.88, but in all matches he took 75 wickets at only 7.7."

In spite of all this Ian Chappell's side won impressively, beating the West Indies in the third and fourth Test matches at Port of Spain and Georgetown respectively. Australia won as much as anything because of the strength and the nature of their temperament which both collectively and individually refuses to accept defeat until it has become a fact. On the other hand it was the temperamental deficiencies of the West Indies players which contributed more to their defeat than any technical inadequacies."

This led to the West Indies easily beating the tourists to take a 2–0 lead in the series. However, in the lead up to the 3rd Test in Guyana, the WICB made a decision to leave out three of their WSC contracted players, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the West Indies' tour to India and Sri Lanka later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of Clive Lloyd as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series. Australia won the 3rd Test, but lost the 4th. Australia were on track to win the 5th Test but the crowd rioted and the game had to be called off early.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just defeated India 3–2 at home during the 1977–78 season; however, the team was rebuilding in the wake of defections of players to World Series Cricket. Most of these players were available for selection but the furore had led the Australian Cricket Board refusing to consider those players that had signed up to play in WSC for selection to the national side.\nThe original squad selected were as follows:\nReplacements.\nKim Hughes fell ill during the tour and David Ogilvie was flown out as a replacement.\nTour.\nAustralia started the tour well with a victory against Leeward Islands, with Wood and Simpson both scoring centuries and Jim Higgs taking 12 wickets. While in St Kitts Kim Hughes came down with acute stomach pains and was diagnosed with appendicitis.\nAustralia then flew to Antigua for the first one-day international. Australia won the toss and elected to field. Jeff Thomson was no-balled six times in the first over. The match was notable for Desmond Haynes' international debut, scoring 148 runs. Gary Cosier scored 84 off 78 balls in Australia's response, but they lost through inferior run rate. The game was called off early because of time taking up due to fast bowlers' run ups.\nAustralia then flew to Trinidad and Tobago, beating that side in first class match by six wickets. Darling scored a century, Serjeant and Toohey made half centuries, and Australia's spinners took 17 wickets (nine of them went to Yardley). This game saw the first of what would become many clashes between the Australian team and West Indies umpire Douglas Sang Hue.\nAustralia's team for the test match consisted of Darling, Wood, Yallop, Toohey, Cosier, Simpson, Rixon, Thomson, Yardley, Higgs and Clarke, with Serjeant as twelfth man. However Darling fell ill and was replaced at the last minute by Serjeant.\nIt rained the day before the game and on the morning, so when the West Indies won the toss they elected to field. Australia were dismissed for 90, with only Cosier (46) offering much resistance. Simpson later criticised the preparation of the wicket. The Windies Indies easily passed Australia's total, despite good bowling from Jeff Thomson. Umpire Sang Hue also announced he thought Yardley and Clark were throwers.\nWhen Australia batted again, Yallop scored 81 and Serjeant and Wood got starts, but Australia collapsed to lose 6–15 and lost by an innings. To make things worse Toohey fractured his right thumb.\nDue to Toohey's injury and Hughes' health it was decided to send for David Ogilvie to join the squad.\nThe next tour game, against Barbados, was a draw. Ogilvie was selected to play even though he did not arrive in Barbados until the second day of the match, in order to give him a chance to make the test eleven. Australia batted well, with both Serjeant and Simpson scoring centuries, with half centuries to Wood, Darling and Ogilvie.\nAustralia replaced Toohey with Darling for the second test, with Serjeant keeping his place.\nAustralia's first innings was notable for Graham Yallop being the first batsman to wear a full protective helmet in test cricket and Bruce Yardley's knock of 74 off 48 balls. Jeff Thomson then delivered an inspiring spell of bowling which Simpsons said \"proved beyond question that he is the world's fastest bowler\". Thomson ended up taking 6–77, limiting the West Indies lead to 38, but Australia collapsed in their second innings (despite another Yardley cameo) and the hosts had little difficulty in winning by nine wickets.\nAfter the game, news came through that three of the new players in the West Indies team – Desmond Haynes, Richard Austin and Colin Croft – had signed with WSC.\nAustralia flew to Guyana to play the local side. Darling, Yallop and Cosier all scored centuries and Laughlin took five wickets, but the match ended in a draw. The match was overshadowed by negotiations with the various boards about the availability of West Indies players who had signed to WSC.\nThe third test began in controversy when Haynes, Austin and Murray were omitted from the West Indies side – ostensibly in order to give new players a go before the upcoming tour of India. Clive Lloyd objected, and resigned the captaincy, puling out with five other players who had all signed to WSC. The West Indies Cricket Board announced that any players who signed with WSC would not be considered for the rest of the series and picked a new team captained by Alvin Kallicharran. Of the West Indies team, only Kallicharran and Derek Parry had played in the previous tests; six would be making their test debut.\nAustralia replaced the injured Graham Yallop with David Ogilvie and replaced Jim Higgs with Trevor Laughlin.\nThe third test was far more equal, with Australia being victorious due to a 251 run partnership between Serjeant and Wood in their second innings. It was a close run result with Australia having to score 69 runs on the final day with 4 wickets in hand – Simpson later said he was so anxious he could not watch the game. However Australia got home by three wickets.\nAustralia's good form continued in the next game, with a low-scoring victory over Windward Islands. Wayne Clark took 12 wickets and Peter Toohey making a half century.\nRain saw the second one-day international reduced to 35 overs. It was another low scoring game which Australia won by two wickets on the last ball of the match. Bob Simpson was man of the match taking 2–23 and making 23 runs.\nFor the fourth test, Peter Toohey and Graham Yallop came back into the Australian side from injury (replacing Ogilvie and Cosier), and Jim Higgs was preferred to Trevor Laughlin, as it was felt his bowling would suit the conditions. Simpson felt this side \"was the best team since we had been in the West Indies\". The West Indies replaced Shillingford with Bacchus and Clarke with Jumadeen.\nDuring the game the umpires expressed concern about Wayne Clark's action. Simpson said he was inclined to agree with them because Clark had adjusted his action because of a bad back.\nAustralia had the upper hand several times during the test but could not drive home the advantage. They were set 293 to win but collapsed against the West Indies spinners to be out for 94.\nAustralia decided not to pick Clark for this game or the test because of fear the West Indies umpire would call him for throwing, so Callen took his place.\nDuring the match Yardley was called for throwing by Douglas Sang Hue. There was also considerable protest from the Jamaican crowd about the continued omission of WSC players from the West Indian side.\nAustralia ultimately beat Jamaica by 2 wickets, with Yardley and Higgs taking 15 wickets between them.\nFor the final test, Australia replaced Darling with Ogilvie and Clark with Laughlin. Due to Australia protests, San Hue did not umpire the game.\nStrong batting from the Australia's saw them keep the upper hand throughout the match. Australia needed only 3 wickets in 35 minutes plus 20 overs to win the game. Eventually century-maker Kallicharran was dismissed, then Holder given out caught behind with 6.2 overs to go. Holder showed dissent at the decision, leaving Australia one wicket to get – but the crowd reacted badly to Holder's response and a riot ensued, forcing both teams to leave the field. It was eventually decided not to continue the game into a sixth day and the game as ruled a draw.\nDuring the game, sports journalist Jack Anderson had been murdered in his home by two gunmen.\nSummary and Notable Events.\nOverall the tour was a disappointing one for the Australians, particularly their failure to win the 4th and 5th tests. Positives included the batting form of Graeme Wood and Graham Yallop, and the bowling of Yardley, Higgs and Thomson. Jeff Thomson did not enjoy the tour, which contributed to his leaving establishment cricket for World Series Cricket during the 1978–79 summer. After the tour the Australian Cricket Board elected not to ensure Simpson's selection as captain the following summer against England, resulting in Simpson's final retirement from first class cricket.\nDespite Thomson did not enjoy the tour, he bowled arguably the fastest bowling spell in Second Test Match at Barbados. According to Tony Cozier, a veteran commentator who commentate in game for 40 years, Rated the spell by Thomson as fastest he ever saw anyone bowl in a Test Match. In this fiery spell Thomson knocked off Viv Richards' cap who is often regarded as greatest batsman against genuine fast bowling and finished with 6/77."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in the West Indies in 1983–84",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured the West Indies in the 1983–84 season to play a five-match Test series against the West Indies.\nThe West Indies won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn. Then West Indies therefore retained the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy.\n\"Wisden\" said that Australia \"were outplayed in every department of the game, sometimes embarrassingly so.\" The West Indies did not lose a single second innings wicket in any of the five Tests and were only once dismissed for fewer than 300. Australia made more than 300 only once.\nThe series was enormously successful for Allan Border who was top scorer in half his ten Test innings and scored more than twice as many as anyone else in the team. It also saw the establishment of Wayne Phillips as Australia's first-choice wicketkeeper after Roger Woolley initially looked like taking the job. However veteran Australian players such as Geoff Lawson, Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes and David Hookes performed poorly.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just defeated Pakistan 2–0 at home during the 1983–84 season. However this was the first tour the team had undertaken since the retirement of Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh.\nThe original squad selected were as follows:\nThe selection of the side was generally uncontroversial – all the players had been in good form over the Australian summer, and those that did not play test cricket had played one day games for Australia. Smith toured Sri Lanka while Ritchie had played three tests in Pakistan.\nWestern Australian all rounder Ken MacLeay had been thought a possible tourist but his form had fallen away during the summer. Spinner Murray Bennett was considered unlucky to not be picked, having been in the Australian squad against Pakistan that summer. Jeff Thomson was overlooked despite an excellent domestic season.\nFormer test bowler turned journalist Bill O'Reilly thought Bob Holland, then Australia's leading leg spinner, should have been taken because of the success of leg spinners on West Indian wickets. Holland had a better domestic record than Matthews that summer but was not as skilled with the bat. (The bowling of Bennett and Holland would later deliver Australia a rare test victory over the West Indies the subsequent Australian summer.)\nIan Chappell thought Australia's selectors should have gambled on a leg spinner, Peter Sleep, instead of Tom Hogan.\nDavid Hookes had not played for the Australian test side for a while but was in the one day team and had toured the West Indies before, and his experience was thought to be useful considering the retirements of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh.\nRoger Woolley, the first choice wicketkeeper, was the first Tasmanian based player to be picked for Australia since Laurie Nash in 1931. Rod Marsh had been Australia's wicketkeeper since the 1970–71 summer, so Woolley had the chance to establish himself in that role long term. His main rival for the position had been New South Wale's Steve Rixon. Australian selectors had indicated their preference for Woolley by sending him on the tour to Sri Lanka in 1983, and he had scored 532 first class runs at an average of 44.5 that summer. Woolley:\nFor the next three months I've a job to do as a batsman keeper. That's all I'm thinking about for the time being... I was worried about Queenslander Ray Phillips this season – he had taken a lot of catches and I hadn't. Strangely, we were not getting wickets that way and my tally, along with the other Tasmanian fieldmen, was down. But 1 felt the Sri Lankan tour has brought me along and my batting was improving with the responsibility of being Sheffield Shield captain.\nThe \"comeback story\" of the Australian squad was bowler Terry Alderman, who had damaged his shoulder in November 1982 while tackling a spectator who had charged on to the ground.\nReplacements.\nGraham Yallop had injured his knee during a one-day international in Australia in 1984 and it was unsure if he would be able to tour so Dean Jones was placed on standby. Rod McCurdy was announced as a backup if any bowlers were injured. Steve Smith and Greg Ritchie injured themselves during the one-day finals and David Boon and Graeme Wood were placed on standby for them. Both Smith and Ritchie recovered to fly out with the squad.\nYallop never made the tour and Jones took his place. Kepler Wessels was injured in the West Indies and Graeme Wood flew out to take his place. McCurdy did not tour.\nPre Tour Contractual Dispute.\nThe tour was marked by a contractual dispute between the players and the Australian Cricket Board. The ACB were worried about players going on \"rebel\" cricket tours to South Africa. This was resolved after some amendments to the contract.\nCriticism of Kim Hughes.\nThere was also the issue of Ian Chappell's constant criticisms of Kim Hughes' captaincy. Hughes had been given the captaincy over Rod Marsh, whom many – particularly Chappell – thought was the superior candidate. At a testimonial dinner for Marsh in February 1984, Chappell, paraphrasing a country and western song, claimed that \"Hughes got the goldmine, Marsh the shaft\". This resulted in Hughes refusing to participate in pre-game interviews with Chappell at the end of the 1983–84 Australian summer. Hughes:\nIt was a terribly embarrassing thing in front of a full roll-up of the team. It was more so when 30 or 40 more people came up to me after the dinner and said they disagreed with Ian Chappell's remarks and said that in their opinion I had been doing a good job. I've always said that if you don't have anything good to say about a person you don't say anything at all. I don't have to put up with people who make remarks about me... I have conducted myself, in my belief, beyond reproach. I might be a 'nice guy' but I was certainly embarrassed with my team there at the testimonial and I won't put up with it. If Channel Nine wants Ian Chappell to handle their interviews that's their business, but I won't be any part of it.\nPeter McFarline wrote \"a good tour as batsman and captain in the next 90 days should silence his detractors for some time to come.\" Dean Jones later recalled:\nIt was an awful time to play for Australia. Greg Chappell, Rod Marsh and Dennis Lillee had just retired from Test cricket and South African cricket officials, like Dr Ali Bacher, were lingering around trying to induce players to play in South Africa on an unauthorised tour. I was the first player to reject Bacher's $200,000 tax-free offer and my teammates hated me for it. Players had their own agendas. Our team culture was pathetic and most players were very selfish.\nHughes was upbeat at the beginning of the tour:\nWe are not going to win Tests against their pace attack by just playing shots – we must physically defend our wickets right from one to 11. The experienced ones know the need – and newcomers like Steve Smith and Dean Jones have learned quickly. You only have to recall Dean Jones, without a helmet, advancing down the wicket to confront Michael Holding to see the spirit in the side... A big factor is that I think we are a fitter line-up than the Windies after their Australian tour. And how much longer can Clive Lloyd keep going too?... We go as underdogs – I think that's an advantage... We haven't won a series overseas since 1975 and this is a tough challenge for us. But there is no doubting the cricket ability in the squad – but we must cope with conditions arising out of living away from home. They know they have to consider a total of 350 to 400 runs every time we go to the crease.\nEarly games.\nAustralia vs Leeward Islands, Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts.\nThe first tour game was against Leeward Islands. It was held on the island of St Kitts, where Australia had not played since 1965. The team flew from Sydney via San Francisco, New York, and Antigua before arriving in St Kitts - a 46 hour trip. They arrived 30 hours before play was to start. David Hookes was selected despite having not played cricket for a month. Viv Richards and Andy Roberts were left out of the Leeward Islands team but Richie Richardson and Eldine Baptiste were selected. Australia rested fast bowlers Rodney Hogg and Geoff Lawson and Greg Matthews was 12th man with Tom Hogan the spinner.\nAustralia won the toss, elected to bat and scored 7-429, with good innings from Wessels (126 retired hurt), Hughes (61), Border (74) and Hookes (66), Eldine Baptiste taking 4-95. Hughes and Wessels put on 125 runs in 95 minutes and Border and Hookes 134 in 75 minutes. A local called Johnny Gomez acted as 12th man dressed in a tuxedo and hat wheeling a silver drinks tray on to the ground. Greg Ritchie and Wayne Phillips, who were rooming together, arrived 75 minutes for the second day's play.\nAustralia dismissed Leeward Islands for 305 (Julien 123, Baptiste 57) with Rackemann taking 6-105 off 35 overs, and Alderman 3-52. Rackemann was hit in the groin taking a catch off Julien and collapsed to the ground in pain, but Hughes insisted he keep bowlind and he did. Tom Hogan did not bowl particularly well and it was thought Greg Matthews would keep his spot for the first test. Australia declared at 7-250, Wessells making 86 (he and Phillips put on 114 for the opening partnership although Phillips only scored 23 and did not bat well. \nAustralia dismissed Leeward for 170, with Rackemann, Alderman and Maguire taking three wickets each. Hughes called it \"a tremendous start\" to the tour. McFarline said \"Hogan bowled without penetration and too full while Woolley's work, especially on the leg side, was sloppy. But he has not kept to these bowlers for some time and will need some time to adjust.\"\nPhillips and Ritchie were fined by their teammates and presented with a T shirt which said \"missing in action... St Kitts 1984\".\nAustralia vs Guyana.\nThe Australians then flew six hours to Guyana to play a tour game against the local side, a one day international, and a test match. There was some apprehension that protests might be made over the presence of Wessels, South African born and raised, as the Guyanese government had objected to the presence of Robin Jackman, a South African connected player who toured with the English side in 1981. However Wessels was allowed into the country. \nKim Hughes missed this game due to a torn hamstring strain so Allan Border captained the side and Dean Jones replaced Hughes. Steve Smith, who had been rested for the first tour game, replaced Wessels. Guyana picked two spinners, Roger Harper and Clyde Butts, as did Australia (Hogan, Matthews). Australia batted first and scored 6-467 before declaring; all Australia's batters made runs except Wayne Phillips (1): Smith (105), Ritchie (64 off 69 balls), Border (113), Hookes (61) and Jones (58). Guyana declared at 8-417 (Andy Jackman 125, Mohamed 68, Hogg 5-144, Hogan 2-66). Roger Woolley dropped Jackman when the batter was on 2.\nAustralia scored 5-276 in their second innings, Smith making another century (116) with runs to Phillips (62) and Jones (60). Smith was dropped six times during his innings. Border declared leading Guyana to score 327 on the final day - they were 6-144 at one stage but held on to be 8-260 at stumps (Roger Harper 86, Hogan 5-95). Woolley broke a finger and could not keep in Guyana's second innings. Smith was awarded Man of the Match)\nThe game was marred by conflict between Geoff Lawson and a local umpire over a decision and minor injuries to Woolley and Lawson; Peter McFarline also questioned the uninspiring captaincy of Allan Border.\nThe early good form of the Australian squad plus injuries to Malcolm Marshall and Michael Holding led to some optimistic forecasts. Cricketer writer Peter McFarline wrote that \"the Australians, to a man, are confident they can win both [the first test and one day international], even though the odds against them in local eyes are substantial.\"\n1st ODI.\nFor the first one-day international of the tour, Australia picked Wayne Phillips as keeper and selected Dean Jones over David Hookes. They took in no specialist spinner. Clive Lloyd missed the game due to injury. The game was played at Albion in front of a crowd of 18,000 people, 5,000 more than capacity. The players were taken there from Georgetown via army helicopters.\nAustralia batted first and Wessels (44) and Smith (60) put on 106 for the opening partnership. Australia fell to 4-159 before Ritchie (46) and Dean Jones (43 off 43 balls) lead a recover to 5-231. Larry Gomes took 3-34 and Viv Richards 1-38.\nThe West Indies comfortably chased this total down for the loss of two wickets, headed by Haynes (133) and Richardson (61. Haynes was dropped on 51 and Richardson on 28 and 36. Newspaper reports singled out Greg Ritchie and Rodney Hogg in particular for poor fielding.\nDuring the game spectators watched by climbing on the scoreboard; the scoreboard collapsed but no one was seriously injured.\nCarl Rackemann suffered a muscle injury to the lower part of his back during his ten overs and it was thought he might have to be sent home.\nFirst Test.\nFor the first test Australia went with six batters, a keeper, a spinner and three fast bowlers. Steve Smith, after his stong early tour form, was selected to make his test debut as opener with Kepler Wessels. Wayne Phillips would have been dropped but received a reprieve when Woolley's thumb did not heal and was picked as a wicketkeeper. Greg Ritchie and David Hookes occupied the batting slots that had been taken by Greg Chappell and Graham Yallop over the Australian summer (Hookes was picked over Jones because of the former's experience). Tom Hogan was spinner over Greg Matthews on the basis of the game against Guyana; Lawson, Hogg and Alderman constituted the pace attack (Alderman's first test since he was injured in 1982 and due to Rackemann's unavailability). Dean Jones was 12th man.\nThe West Indies were without Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall, meaning the selectors decided to play a spinner, Roger Harper. Both Kim Hughes and Clive Lloyd said before the game that the most likely result would be a draw.\nAustralia batted first and at one stage were 9–182 (Ritchie 72) but then Rodney Hogg and Tom Hogan came together and decided to ignore Kim Hughes' instructions to hit out; they combined for a partnership of 97, a record tenth wicket stand for Australia against the West Indies, and took the total to 279.\nThe West Indies were then dismissed for 230 (Haynes 60, Hogan 4-56). There was an incident when Geoff Lawson had an labw decision off Haynes turned down and he snatched his hat off umpire Denis Narine.When Australia batted again they were 5-60 but efforts from Border (54) and Phillips (76) took them to 273. Hughes declared after batting 90 minutes on the last day, setting the West Indies 323 to win.\nHaynes and Greenidge batted well and made 171 off the first 45 overs, leaving them 152 runs to get off the last 20 overs. However they decided not to go for it, and the innings ended on 0-250. Clive Lloyd later said 'It was difficult to play shots when the ball was keeping low - i was just not worthwhile having a go in those conditions.\" The total of 250-0 is still the only Test innings in which all who batted scored a century (Gordon Greenidge 120* and Desmond Haynes 103*). Man of the Match was Tom Hogan.\nGeoff Lawson was later fined £150 by the Australian team management for the hat snatching incident.\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago Game - Kim Hughes controversy.\nAustralia then flew to Trinidad &amp; Tobago, where they played a tour game against the local side. Dean Jones missed the game due to haemmeroids and Carl Rackemann was still unavailable due to injury.\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago batted first and scored 336 (Rajah 100, Maguire 4-67). Australia made 373 in reply (Wessels 89, Hughes 73). Batting second the local side were 8-170 but Ranjy Nana and Harold Joseph put on 50 off 29 balls and took the total to 222 (Hogan 4-74). Since rain washed out the third day's play, Australia were set 189 runs to win off 23 overs.\nAustralian captain Kim Hughes was upset the local captain did not declare and set a winnable total. He opened the batting with Greg Matthews and made only two scoring shots (a six and a four) in a 75-minute innings of 10. He refused to take singles. Greg Matthews followed in a similar fashion, as did Wayne Phillips, who took off his pads for the last over and lay down for the last ball. \"What I have seen today is one of the sad days for me in cricket,\" said former West Indian captain Gerry Gomez. \"The performance of Kim Hughes and the Australian team today represented what I consider a travesty of the game of cricket.\" At a press conference after the game Hughes said \"Why should touring sides carry the bag for local teams without imagination. I am not really interested in the welfare of Trinidad cricket. I am interested in the welfare of West Indian crowds.\"\nPeter McFarline wrote:\nHughes, who has worked hard to give a new direction to the Australian team since taking over as captain... has lost many supporters... it is a pity the majority of members of this touring side just cannot come to terms with the reality of playing cricket in another country with different styles, beliefs, cultures and characteristics from the ones they are used to... This team fondly believe they are a collection of professional players. On the strength of their performance on Monday, under the leadership of Hughes, they are still strictly amateurs.\"\nHughes was fined $200 by team management.\n2nd ODI.\nHowever the Australian team bounced back in the second one-day international, beating the West Indies in a rain-shortened game.\nAustralia won the toss and sent in the West Indies who made 6-190. The best of the bowlers was John Maguire. Australia made this total in the last over, helped by Wessels (67) and the fact the West Indies bowlers gave away so many extras (29).\nSecond Test.\nThe second test match saw Smith pulled out due to injury, replaced by Dean Jones, who made his test debut. Wayne Phillips was kept as keeper but also had to open. Viv Richards led the West Indies in the place of the injured Clive Lloyd. Jones later recalled:\nOn the night of my first Test in Trinidad, I was struck down with the worst virus. My roommate was Geoff Lawson. He rightly said he didn't want me in his room for fear of catching the virus. Our manager at the time, Colin Egar, said the ACB wouldn't pay for another room. So I slept in the corridor outside my room for three nights until I was well. Can you believe a Test cricketer sleeping in the corridor during his first Test?\nAustralia batted first and the top order collapsed again, falling to 5-85 before Allan Border (98) and Dean Jones (48) combined to put on a stand of 100, helping take the total to 255 (Garner 6-60). Jones later described his first innings score of 48 as his \"best knock\" in test cricket.\nIn response the West Indies are one stage were 4-129 but recovered due to Richards (76), Logie (97) and Dujon (130) to declare at 8-468. Australia's top order collapsed again to 5-115 then 9-238 but Allan Border (100) partnered with Terry Alderman (21) to ensure they escaped with a draw. This effort by Border is one of his greatest feats with the bat. Border hit the last ball of the match for a boundary to bring up his century. \nHughes addressed the Trinidad controversy after the game saying \"In hindsight, I should have added something when I said I didn't care for Trinidad cricket. I should have added 'If that's the way they play the game here'. If people have got the wrong impression from what I said, then I am sorry.\"\nAustralia vs Barbados.\nKepler Wessels injured his knee while fielding during the test match and was sent home; he flew from Barbados to Sydney where he was operated on. Graeme Wood was flown out as a replacement and arrived on 21 March, playing in the next tour game against Barbados (Hughes insisted he be acclimatised if he was to play the third test). Phillips played as a batter while Woolley kept.\nAustralia, using only two bowling specialists (Maguire and Rackemann) batted first and declared at 6-332 (Ritchie 99, Wood 76), Roger Woolley scoring a half-century off 43 balls.\nBarbados was dismissed for 302, Matthews, Maguire and Rackemann each taking three wickets. Australia made 4-356 in their second innings, headed by David Hookes' 103 and half centuries to Smith and Hughes, before declaring (his declaration enabled Hookes to make a century). Hookes and Phillips put on 113 runs in 68 minutes.\nBarbados were set 387 to win in 20 overs and 222 minutes. At the end of play it was 5-233. Peter McFarline wrote \"Greg Ritchie made everyone laugh with his famous impersonations in the final oval of the match.\"\nThird Test.\nThe turning point of the tour came with the third test. Dean Jones made way for Steve Smith, back in the side from injury, with Phillips still as keeper but pushed back down the order. Graeme Wood replaced an injured Kepler Wessels as opener. Wessels flew back to Australia.\nAustralia batted extremely well in the first innings. Wood (68) and Ritchie (57) took Australia to 1-114. There was a minor collapse, going to 6-263 but Wayne Phillips scored 120, including four sixes, taking the total to 429. At the end of day three the West Indies were 3–301 in reply and it seemed the game was headed for a draw. (Richardson and Greenidge, who both scored centuries, had been dropped early on in their respective innings.) Peter McFarline thought Phillips had batted Australia to a \"position from where it cannot lose the match\".\nHowever Clive Lloyd then hit 76 off 77 balls, taking the West Indies to 509 and giving them a lead. By the end of day four Australia were 4-68; they lost the next four wickets quickly the following day, all out of 95. The West Indies won by ten wickets.\nGraeme Wood fractured his finger during the game and had to return home from the tour.\nFourth Test.\nFor the fourth test Australia brought in Roger Woolley as wicketkeeper letting Phillips play as a specialist batter. Rodney Hogg was injured and missed the game. Australia used its third opening combination for the sieres, Philips and Ritchie.\nAustralia batted first. At one stage they were 4-78 then Border (98) and Hookes (51) took the score to 4-202 and the final total was 262. Richardson (154) and Richards (178) put on a 308 run partnership in 377 minutes taking the West Indies to 2-351. The Australian bowlers managed to restrict the West Indies to 498 (Rackeman 5-161). At one stage Rackemann bowled 24 overs unchanged. Roger Woolley dropped Richardson off Lawson's bowling when the batter was only 38 and the West Indies 2-100.\nAustralia had to bat for two days to save the match. They were dismissed for 200 (Garner 5-63), no Australian batter scoring more than 29 and the top score being 36 sundries. This meant the West Indies retained the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy. \nAustralia vs Windward Islands.\nAustralia went to St Lucia and played against Windward Islands. Hogg, Lawson and Phillips were rested. Australia batted first and Steve Smith scored 127 of 167 deliveries, taking part in a 122 run opening stand in 103 minutes with Greg Matthews (54); the total was 362. Hughes was dropped on 5 and 9 but only made 22. \nWindward Islands made 337 in response, Hookes taking 3-114. The innings was highlighted by the antics of local batter Linton Lewis. Australia made 6-344 in their second innings (Jones 95, Hookes 74) before declaring. Dean Jones opened after Greg Matthews was injured. Windward Island were 3-190 when the game ended.\n3rd ODI.\nFurther centuries from Desmond Haynes saw the West Indies comfortably win the third and fourth one day internationals.\nFifth Test.\nFor the fifth test, Australia tried to bolster the bowling by using Greg Matthews as a fifth bowler and playing Phillips as a wicketkeeper again. It did not work and the West Indies won by ten wickets. Steve Smith was injured and could not bat in Australia's second innings.\nConclusion.\nThe tour had been a disastrous one for Australia, despite some encouraging early performances. The only players who could have been said to return with their reputations enhanced were Allan Border and Wayne Phillips; Peter McFarline spoke well of Geoff Lawson and Tom Hogan. McFarline said \"Woolley's tour with the gloves has been as poor as I have seen in this class of cricket. It resulted in Wayne Phillips, a man of talent but not yet with the capacity to understand that talent, being placed in the position of keeping as well as opening the batting.\"\nPhillips' relative success as wicketkeeper encouraged the Australian selectors to persist with him in that position for the next two summers with ultimately disastrous consequences for Phillips' career and the Australian team.\nAustralia's senior players were seen to have let them down: Hughes, Hookes, Rackemann, Hogg. Kim Hughes' failures with the bat were instrumental in him resigning the captaincy in November 1984. Allan Border later remembered:\nBy the end of the tour Kim was really feeling the pinch. At one stage we were in Jamaica, at Montego Bay, and we'd had the day off and been on the beach. We came back to the team hotel and there's Kim, half cut watching the Donald Duck show or something with his hair all braided and with those coloured balls hanging off. I thought then: 'Kim, you've lost the plot.\"'\nIan Chappell, a long time critic of Hughes' captaincy, later wrote:\nHughes has suffered a string of defeats as Australia's captain on foreign soil but this latest one makes his job of trying to drag the side up by his bootstraps an impossible one, and I think the ACB has to offer the job to Allan Border.\nDean Jones said the team had poor culture:\nAn example of the bad culture within our team came when one of our front-line bowlers got very upset when he didn't get the new ball. He was furious that he was selected to bowl first change. This particular bowler took our first wicket for the match. When everyone ran in to congratulate him, he threw a haymaker punch at our captain, Kim Hughes. When asked to explain his actions by Hughes, the bowler's response was, \"I got a wicket for ya\", and walked back to his mark. Oh yes, things were very different than.\nHowever at the time there were many positive reports about the Australian team culture. Peter McFarline called the squad \"the fittest tourists for many years, perhaps ever.\" It was the first tour by physiotherapist Errol Alcott, who became an integral part of the side."

Australia won the fifth test.\nODI series summary.\nAustralia won the Cable and Wireless Series 4–1.\nControversy.\nA book was written about the tour, \"Calypso Cricket\" by Roland Fishman, in which some Australian cricketers were quoted bragging about how many women they slept with. This was seen as a breach of the unspoken agreement between players and journalists for the latter not to report on the former's private lives, and embarrassed Greg Matthews, who was a friend of Fishman's, and who helped him get access to the players. Matthews:\nFishman lied to me. He bludged my money, my clothes, my bed and he told me he was writing a story about cricket in the Caribbean and the way of life. It was anything but that. He deceived me to the max. I haven't seen him since and next time I see him I'll be spitting in his face."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in the West Indies in 1998–99",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured the Caribbean from February to April 1999 to play four Tests and seven One Day Internationals (ODIs) against the West Indies. Australia additionally played three first-class matches, winning two and drawing one. The Test series was drawn 2–2 resulting in the Frank Worrell Trophy remaining in Australia. The ODI series was also drawn with three wins each and one tie. This was the first four-match series in the history of Test cricket to finish as a two-all draw. The only other four-match Test series, , to finish with the same result was England at home to Pakistan in 2016.\nBackground.\nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) announced in June 1998 that Sabina Park would host the first Test – the first following the abandonment of the Test between England and the West Indies after just 62 deliveries in January 1998.\nThis was the 19th Test series between these two teams and the 16th time they were contesting the Frank Worrell Trophy. Australia last toured the West Indies in 1995 securing the trophy for the first time since 1976. Australia retained the trophy in 1996–97 winning the series 3–2. Since then, Australia won Test series at home against New Zealand and South Africa and away against South Africa, England and Pakistan. Their only loss came in their tour of India in 1998. Meanwhile, the West Indies were successful against India, Sri Lanka and England at home but lost away to Pakistan.\nImmediately prior to this tour, Australia won a home Ashes series against England, and won an ODI tri-series against England and Sri Lanka. Australia's Test captain Mark Taylor initially indicated that he would continue to lead the side for this tour, but in February 1999 he announced his retirement. Steve Waugh, who had held the captaincy of the ODI side for 18 months, was appointed as the new Test captain with Shane Warne as his deputy. Conversely, the West Indies on their first tour of South Africa in the post-apartheid era had suffered their first 5–0 Test whitewash and lost the ODI series 6–1. Brian Lara led a player revolt against the WICB over pay and conditions and the tour was delayed by a week. He was stripped of the captaincy and later reinstated as skipper. Following the South African tour, the board announced that Lara would be retained as captain for the Australian series.\nSummary.\nThe West Indies continued their poor form in the opening match of the Test series, posting their lowest innings score of 51 and losing the match by 312 runs. They fought back in the second Test breaking their six-match losing streak with Lara scoring 213. The third Test was described by Steve Waugh as the best Test match he had ever played in. Lara led his team to a one-wicket victory with his second innings score of 153 not out rated by Wisden as the second-best innings in the history of Test cricket. Leg spinner Shane Warne was dropped for the final Test, which Australia won by 176 runs. This was the second-drawn series of the Frank Worrell Trophy with the 1981–82 series finishing at one-all.\nFollowing the Test series, the two teams played in their first seven-match bilateral ODI series against each other. In a back-and-forth series which saw neither team win back-to-back matches, the series ended three games-all. These were the final ODI matches for both teams before the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England which Australia went on to win. Lara was rested due to a wrist injury for the final three matches with Jimmy Adams standing in as captain. The series was marred by poor crowd behaviour by the West Indian supporters. The fifth ODI ended in a tie after the crowd invaded the ground in scenes almost identical to the final ODI match between Pakistan and the West Indies at the same ground six years earlier. The WICB later apologised for the incident. The final ODI match was suspended for over an hour due to spectators throwing glass bottles and other debris onto the ground in protest at Sherwin Campbell being obstructed by Brendon Julian and being given run out. One of the bottles narrowly missed captain Steve Waugh. This mirrored a similar incident at the same ground in March 1979 during the second Supertest between WSC Australians and WSC West Indies. Midway through the final day's play, the crowd threw bottles onto the ground after the controversial lbw dismissal of Roy Fredericks. Play did not resume and the match ended in a draw. Prior to the final ODI match, the former West Indian captain Carl Hooper announced his retirement from international cricket.\nSquads.\nA fifteen-man squad for the West Indies was announced on 1 March 1999 for the first Test. Ahead of the second Test the WICB named a thirteen-man squad which excluded Corey Collymore and Phil Simmons. Roland Holder was injured during the 1st Test and was replaced by Daren Ganga. Mervyn Dillon was dropped for Nehemiah Perry. Collymore was then brought back into the squad to replace Reon King who injured his shoulder. The thirteen man squad announced ahead of the third Test saw Adrian Griffith, Carl Hooper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul coming in as replacements for Suruj Ragoonath, Daren Ganga and Lincoln Roberts. Hooper was unavailable for first two Tests with his child being sick and Chanderpaul was unavailable due to injury. The only change to the West Indies squad for the fourth Test was Wavell Hinds being brought in for Shivnarine Chanderpaul who did not play in the third Test due to his right shoulder injury.\nFor Australia, the only change to the Test squad came ahead of the fourth Test when backup wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist was called in as a possible replacement for Ian Healy due to issues with his calf muscles. Healy however played in the final Test.\nDuring the fourth Test, Adam Dale came down with pneumonia and returned to Australia for treatment. He was replaced by the One Day International squad with Andy Bichel. Before the second ODI, the squad was reduced to 14 with Bichel being removed."

This was the first Test series ever played by New Zealand. England began the tour in October 1929 in Ceylon with a single minor match and then in Australia where they played five first-class matches. The New Zealand leg of the tour began in December and, in addition to the Test series, England played each of the main provincial teams: Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago. England, captained by Harold Gilligan, won the Test series 1–0 with three matches drawn.\nAt the same time another English team, captained by Freddie Calthorpe, was touring the West Indies, playing the first Test series there. It was the only time one country has played in two Test matches on the same day.\nThe English team.\nApart from Woolley, who had played 55 Tests before the tour, it was an inexperienced side at Test level. Bowley had played two Tests, and Barratt, Dawson, Duleepsinhji and Legge one each; the other eight had not played a Test. There were eight amateurs and six professionals.\nThe team was selected in late June, with Arthur Gilligan, who had played 11 Tests, as captain. However, he was unable to tour owing to illness, and his younger brother Harold was selected to replace him. The other change to the original selected team was that Maurice Allom replaced Frank Watson.\nAssessments.\nThe tour made a small profit for the New Zealand Cricket Council, despite the unusually wet summer, but some of this profit had to be used to pay the English team's professionals. The council's chairman, Arthur Donnelly, declared that the English team were \"the most agreeable and pleasant lot of fellows\" the council had ever dealt with.\nIn its report of the tour, \"The Cricketer\" said the New Zealand batting was strong, but the bowling and fielding needed substantial improvement. It said the general standard of cricket throughout New Zealand was rising, \"but except in the Test matches the placing of the field was none too good, and the bowlers suffered accordingly. The umpiring, apart from the Tests, was only moderate.\""

The doctor and former Australian Test player Roland Pope accompanied the team throughout Australia and New Zealand at his own expense, serving as honorary physician.\nAssessments.\nThe tour made a loss of about £2000, a substantial amount at the time. The MCC and the New Zealand authorities shared the financial burden. One of the reasons for the loss was the extravagance of MacLaren, who insisted on having his wife with him throughout, at the tour's expense. Bill Ferguson, who travelled with the team as baggage master, said MacLaren never made \"even a token attempt to make the tour pay its way, being content first and foremost with his own requirements – and he had expensive tastes\". Ferguson said the MacLarens \"frequently went away to Rotorua and such places for holidays\", but he observed that their absences did not upset the rest of the team."

The tour was organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club and the English team played under the name MCC in non-Test matches.\nThe New Zealand leg of the tour began at the beginning of March, the England team having been away for more than five months on a trip which was the last major MCC tour to use sea travel. It began with a first-class match against Canterbury at Christchurch. A further first-class match was played between the two Test matches against Wellington. England won the Test series 2–0, leaving New Zealand still without a win in a Test match since gaining Test status in 1923.\nIn the second Test, New Zealand were dismissed for 26 runs in their second innings, the lowest score in Test cricket history. The score was made in New Zealand's second innings and resulted in an innings defeat in the match, despite only trailing by 46 runs after the first innings were completed. It was four runs less than the previous lowest score in Test matches made by South Africa against England in 1896 and 1924 and beat New Zealand's previous lowest Test score of 42 made against Australia in 1946. As of June 2022 it remains the lowest score by a side in a Test match.\nDespite being played on slow pitches which made scoring difficult, the matches on the tour were well attended. Gate receipts of £26,000 made the series profitable for the hosts.\nOther matches.\nThe first match the England side played in New Zealand was against Canterbury at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. Between the two Test matches a further match was played against Wellington at Basin Reserve. The MCC side won both matches."

        "text": "The India national cricket team toured the West Indies during the 1975–76 cricket season. They played four Test matches against the West Indian cricket team, with the West Indies winning the series 2–1.\nSeries overview.\nThis Test Series proved to be very eventful and controversial. In many respects its outcome was shaped by the events that preceded it. Earlier in the 1975/6 Season the West Indies had toured Australia and played a six-Test series that was billed as an unofficial World Championship between the two strongest teams. While many of the West Indian players showed isolated evidence of their prodigious talent, the team as a whole suffered from disunity and ill-discipline and were defeated 5–1. Gordon Greenidge described the tour as a 'collective debacle and a personal nightmare', whilst Michael Holding recalled, 'There was plenty of argument and dissent at meetings and in the dressing room. Well before the end our spirit was broken and we were divided among ourselves'.\nAlthough the West Indies entered the series against India with their confidence shattered, they were assisted by some poor scheduling which entailed their opponents arriving in the Caribbean after a 62-hour flight from New Zealand, where they had just completed a Series, with only two days to rest and prepare before their opening match. India consequently suffered heavy defeats at the hands of Barbados and at Bridgetown in the First Test.\nThe Second Test at the Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain ended in a high-scoring draw on a flat wicket where the Indian batsmen felt more at home. The Third Test had been scheduled for Georgetown, Guyana but because of heavy flooding was rearranged to be played in Trinidad again. The experiences of the last match, together with an injury to key fast bowler Andy Roberts persuaded the West Indian selectors to go into the match with 3 specialist spin bowlers: Raphick Jumadeen, Albert Padmore and Imtiaz Ali. Centuries from Viv Richards and Alvin Kallicharran put the West Indies in a strong position and India were set a target of 406 to win the match. Centuries from Gundappa Viswanath and Sunil Gavaskar enabled India to reach this target for the loss of four wickets (two of which were run-outs) and created a new record for the highest ever successful fourth-innings' run chase in a test match (surpassing Australia's 404/3 at Headingley against England in 1948)\nFor Clive Lloyd this was the final humiliation he was prepared to let his team suffer. He told his spinners after the match, 'Gentlemen, I gave you 400 runs to bowl at and you failed to bowl out the opposition. How many runs must I give you in the future to make sure that you get the wickets?' In fact Lloyd decided to dispense with the use of slow bowlers. He argued that the spinners at his disposal were not of the required quality and he was forced to play them through tradition and the convention that cricket teams always included at least one slow bowler. He felt that West Indian strength lay in their crop of young fast bowlers, and the experiences of his team in Australia had demonstrated how the high-quality, hostile pace attack of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson could intimidate the opposition batting.\nGoing into the deciding test at Kingston, Jamaica at 1–1, the West Indies duly picked a four-pronged pace attack of Michael Holding, Wayne Daniel, Bernard Julien and Vanburn Holder. The Sabina Park pitch was new with uncertain and variable bounce, however the Indian batsmen played with sound defence to grind out 178–1 at the end of the first day's play. An overnight growth of grass encouraged the West Indian bowlers and they began to attack the Indian batsmen around the wicket, targeting the bodies of the opposition. After Mohinder Amarnath was dismissed by a short-pitched delivery, Viswanath's finger was broken by the delivery from which he was caught, and Brijesh Patel, hit in the face, was forced to retire hurt. Then Anshuman Gaekwad, a tall bespectacled batsman who had batted bravely to reach 81 not out began to show signs of backing away to leg as the onslaught of bouncers continued. After being hit on the glove and on the body he was finally felled by a bouncer which hit him behind the left ear. He had to be taken to hospital.\nThe Indian captain Bishen Bedi and senior players such as Sunil Gavaskar were incensed by the West Indian tactics. They felt that the umpires could have but had refused to intervene, partly because of crowd pressure. Gavaskar was particularly upset that the local crowd had chanted 'kill him' as Holding had bowled to Gaekwad and had cheered when the Indian batsman had been knocked out. Bedi declared the innings at 306/6, partly out of protest but also because he was not prepared to allow himself and his bowling partner Chandrasekhar, both terrible batsmen, to face the West Indian quicks. The West Indies scored 391 in their first innings, and when India went out to bat again they made a solid start but lost Amarnath, Madan Lal and Venkataraghavan in quick succession to slump to 97/5. At this point Bedi announced that the Indian innings was over. He was without the three batsmen who had been hit in the first innings, and stated that both he and Chandrasekhar had picked up fielding injuries and that consequently 5 Indian batsmen should be recorded as 'absent hurt'. The West Indies were left the formality of scoring 13 runs to record the victory in a Test where they had only taken 11 wickets. According to Michael Holding:\n'On that surface it was inevitable that some batsmen would be hit against such a pace-based attack as ours, especially as we adopted the tactic of bowling round the wicket, aiming the ball at their bodies. I was not too keen on this method since it gives the batsman little chance of avoiding a bouncer, but it was 1–1 in the series and we were under extreme public pressure to win'.\nAccording to \"Wisden\" the Indian team resembled Napoleon's troops in the retreat from Moscow as they boarded their 'plane home. Official complaints were made by the Indian Cricket Board concerning the West Indian tactics in the final Test but to no avail. After this victory Clive Lloyd developed a strategy based on an attack of four fast bowlers. It was to prove successful in the next series, a three-nil victory over England, and was to provide the foundation for the West Indian dominance of Test Cricket for the next 20 years."

They played five Test matches and four One Day Internationals (ODI) against the West Indies.\nWest Indies won the Test series 1–0. Shivnarine Chanderpaul of West Indies was named the player of the series after he scored 443 runs at an average of 73.83. West Indies also won the ODI series 3–1, and Chanderpaul was again named the player of the series, having scored 209 runs.\nBackground.\nBefore the tour began, India's leading pacer Javagal Srinath, then one of the five top-ranked bowlers in the ICC Rankings, was ruled out due to injury. India's tight schedule preceding the tour was blamed for it. Srinath picked up a shoulder injury in the 1996 Sahara Cup that worsened during his first spell in the third Test against South Africa at Johannesburg. He was subsequently made to bowl full ten overs in the seven-match ODI series that followed when the injury aggravated. His ruling out proved to a blow for India as West Indian batsman Brian Lara had then called Srinath the most \"dangerous\" pace bowler he had faced in his career. Leading into the series from India's May 1996 tour of England, Srinath had bowled an average of 47 overs per Test, the most by any bowler during that period. Spinner Noel David was flown immediately to the Caribbean, but his inclusion in the squad was denied to be as a replacement for Srinath by the BCCI, but \"keeping with the requirements of the touring team management\".\nIndia had historically a poor record in the West Indies, having won only two of the 28 Tests played there leading into the series. They were also coming on the back of a 2–0 Test series defeat against an away series to South Africa.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nIndia won the toss and elected to bat first on a bouncy wicket. Despite having scored a hundred in a warm-up game at the same venue on 24 April, Sourav Ganguly was not included in the side and Navjot Singh Sidhu replaced him. Sachin Tendulkar started strongly for India hitting four fours off Ian Bishop's second over. India lost Sidhu after Curtly Ambrose caught him lbw for 5. Tendulkar also fell to Ambrose after making 44 off 43 balls with the score at 65/2. Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Azharuddin fell in quick succession with the score at 86/4. Nayan Mongia (29) and Ajay Jadeja (19) put on 33 runs for the fifth wicket before the lower order followed them after the final wicket fell in the 19th over and the score at 179. Ambrose finished with four wickets. The innings was however interrupted by rain four times and a target of 146 in 34 overs was set for West Indies based on Clark's Curve. Shivnarine Chanderpaul continued his good form from the Test series into the match and scored 83 off 88 balls including 12 fours. His team reached the revised target in the 28th over with eight wickets to spare. Brian Lara and Carl Hooper took the team over the line with an unbeaten partnership of 17 runs.\n2nd ODI.\nThe second game of the series was played on the same venue the next day with India winning the toss again and sending the West Indies to bat first on what was now a drier pitch and overcast conditions. India made three changes: Sourav Ganguly was included in the side in place of an off-form Robin Singh, spinner Sunil Joshi was dropped for debutante Noel David and Saba Karim replaced an injured Nayan Mongia as wicket-keeper. West Indies got off to a poor start losing two wickets for 5 runs, including Brian Lara for a golden duck. India's pacers Venkatesh Prasad and Abey Kuruvilla picked the said two wickets and picked up three more reducing West Indies for 32/5. Jimmy Adams and Ian Bishop put on 56 runs for the seventh wicket before the latter got out caught for 31. Wickets fell in quick succession and the team ended at 121 after playing 43.5 overs. Rain interruptions reduced India's target to 119 from 46 overs and later 113 from 42 overs. Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar started off well for India taking the team's score off the mark in the 24th over, both remaining unbeaten at 39 and 65 respectively. Kuruvilla was named player of the match.\n3rd ODI.\nIndia won the toss and put West Indies, who replaced Ian Bishop by Ottis Gibson, to bat first on a rough wicket with \"slight\" grass. Abey Kuruvilla trapped Shivnarine Chanderpaul lbw early on before opener Stuart Williams and Brian Lara put on 60 runs for the second wicket. Jimmy Adams was promoted up the order but was dismissed by Noel David for 9. Williams, still at the crease, added another 84 runs for the fourth wicket with Carl Hooper before losing his wicket for Tendulkar after making 76. The lower order batted through the entire 50 overs taking the total to 249. For India, Tendulkar started off with a four before being bowled by a Courtney Walsh delivery in the fifth over that kept low. Rahul Dravid joined opener Sourav Ganguly and the two put on 130 runs, then the highest partnership for the second wicket for India, scoring at a steady pace, both going past 70s. With Dravid dismissed by Gibson, India need 94 off 96 balls with eight wickets in hand. Ganguly fell a few overs later, leaving his team 56 to get off 60. The middle and lower order batsmen fell quickly, losing eight wickets in nine overs for 46 runs, owing to poor shots and running, winding up after making 231, falling 18 runs short of the target. Gibson who gave away the most runs (61) of all the West Indies' bowlers, also picked three of the said wickets.\n4th ODI.\nHaving been put to bat, India lost its openers inside five overs for 6 runs. The poor start reduced India to 17/2 at the end of ten overs before recovering to reach 62/2 after 20 overs, with Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Azharuddin in the middle. After they fell, Robin Singh (29) and Ajay Jadeja (68) put on 75 runs. A slower scoring rate throughout the innings took the total to a low 199 at the end of 50 overs. In response, West Indies opener, Chanderpaul started off strongly scoring boundaries in regular intervals, and despite looking vulnerable to the seaming ball at the start, his opening partner Stuart Williams stuck on and remained unbeaten at 78 taking the team past the line. Chanderpaul meanwhile scored his first ODI hundred before finishing unbeaten at 109 off 134 balls and was named player of the match and the series."

        "text": "The London International Basketball Invitational was a men's basketball competition. It took place at the Basketball Arena in London and was the first event to take place in the Olympic Park. The event was part of the London Prepares series and was organised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\nThe event took place between 16 and 21 August 2011 and was held in a round robin format. The tournament tested the venue's scoreboards, the playing area accreditation and catering. The competition featured six international teams: Australia, China, Croatia, France, Great Britain and Serbia. After five rounds, France were the winners after going through the competition undefeated.\nTournament.\nThe tournament was the first sporting competition to take place in the Olympic Park. The tournament took the shape of a round robin format meaning that each team played each other. The event was contested between six national men's basketball teams. The teams which competed were Australia, China, Croatia, France, hosts Great Britain and Serbia. The test event took place in the Basketball Arena. The arena is a temporary structure constructed in 2010 and 2011, situated on the north of the Olympic park. It can hold up to 12,000 people during the games and cost an estimate of £40,000,000. For the test event the venue had a capacity of 3,000. Serbia were the highest ranked team in the tournament, ranked at number 8 in the world. The tournament featured 4 other top 20 teams with Great Britain the lowest ranked at 53 in the world.\nThe event was part of the London Prepares series and tested the competition floors, scoreboards, accreditation and catering. The competition was run and organised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG).\nTeams and squads.\n \nMatches.\nThe first ever international basketball game at the arena saw Australia thrash China. The Boomers without Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aleks Marić and Brad Newley who were all rested eased to a 28-point win. The second match saw Croatia beat rivals Serbia with Simon leading the line with 17 points. In the last game on day one, Great Britain played France. Joel Freeland topped scored for the hosts with 16 points while Tony Parker weighed in with 23 points for France. It was a scrappy match with 17 turnovers by halftime. Parker started well for France as he netted 10 points in the opening quarter. However, when he was rested in the second quarter the French team went for five minutes without scoring a basket. However, with Parker back France opened up a 12-point lead in the third quarter. Britain made mistakes in the final quarter as the French ranout winners by 22 points.\nSerbia opened the second day with an 87–53 win over China. The second match saw France defeat Australia in a thriller. With Tony Parker the French had managed to establish a 13-point lead in third quarter. Parker scored a game high 27 points whilst Mills netted 20 for the Boomers. The final quarter witnessed Australia comeback at France and trailed by only one point with 11 seconds to go. However, Parker clinched the win for the French team. In the final match of the day world number 19 Croatia held on to beat Great Britain by five points. Strong opening and final quarters kept the hosts in the game. However, a poor second quarter saw Croatia into a 12-point lead at halftime. In the final quarter Britain started 14 points behind and climbed to within 3 points, before Lenzly and Simon sealed the win for Croatia.\nDay three opened with a comfortable win for France over China, minus Tony Parker. Patty Mills led the Boomers with 20 points to defeat Croatia. Žorić top scored with 18 for Croatia who led by 5 at the end of the first quarter only to be 12 down at halftime, a gap that they never recovered from. In the final match of the day Serbia clinched victory over the hosts in the dying seconds. At halftime the teams could not be separated in 44 points each. Sullivan and Freeland hobbled off for the Brits whilst Boating top scored. Serbian captain, Nenad Krstić netted a game high 21 points as his team won with 2 seconds to spare. \nThe opening match of day four saw France beat Croatia thanks to a 12-point blitz in 23 minutes from Parker. Luol Deng returned for Britain as they won their first match of the tournament defeating China. Deng who had been absent whilst running a camp for children netted 15 points for the hosts. However, he was out shone by Joel Freeland who was the MVP of the game netting 18 points. Yi netted a game high 20 points for China. Britain missing its captain Sullivan with injury managed to open a 6-point lead in the first half. However, China came within one point before Britain eased away to win their first match. In the final match of the day Australia took on Serbia. Australia turned a one-point deficit at the start of the final quarter into a nine-point win as they managed a 10-point swing. Ingles led the line for the Boomers with 17 points whilst Ogilvy snatched 10 rebounds.\nOn the final day Croatia beat injury deprived China, to finish in third place in the table. In the final match for Australia and Great Britain, it went to overtime as Deng top scored with 26 points. The Aussies led by four points at halftime and extended the lead to 10 in the third quarter. Britain battled back to force overtime, which they led until two free throws in the dying seconds saw the win go down under. The final match of the tournament saw France waste a 23-point lead but hang on to go undefeated throughout the week. France led by 17 points at halftime and with Serbia limiting time on court for their key men, France took advantage and went into a 23 with 4:12 left to play in the third quarter. Serbia then went route one with a 3-point barrage which saw them take the lead. France responded by sticking their starting five on to see out the match.\nReaction.\nJoanna Sutherland, London 2012 Competition Manager for Basketball was pleased with the volunteers saying that they had been enthusiastic and keen. Great Britain captain Drew Sullivan said that it was a shame that the venue was only temporary. While Patrick Mills said the atmosphere was good and the venue was nice. FIBA Secretary-General and International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Patrick Baumann, agreed with Sullivan about the venue being temporary, but he also said it was amazing what had happened in this part of London."

He was one of his country's first national representative players making the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and then had a patchy first-grade club career in the first decade of the code's popularity in Sydney.\nCareer.\nClub.\nDavis had been a South Sydney rugby union junior before he joined the new South Sydney rugby league club in its inaugural 1908 season. He initially played three seasons with the club and was sent off in the 1910 Grand Final played against Newtown. He played the 1911 NSWRFL season with North Sydney before playing three seasons with the Glebe club. His top-grade career finished up back at Souths in 1918-19 before concluding with a country stint at Parkes.\nRepresentative.\nDavis made his debut Test appearance in 1908 against New Zealand, appearing in both matches of the first rugby league international series played by an Australian representative side. At the end of that season he was selected in the 35-man squad to make the first-ever Kangaroo Tour. Davis played in six tour matches but in none of the three Test matches played. In the 1909 season, he returned to test selection playing in the first test against New Zealand. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 3.\nDeath.\nDavis became depressed when unable to find work during the Depression, and in 1934 he killed himself. The inquest into his death was held at Parkes, New South Wales on 22 February 1934. Davis's body was found in the Peoples Park, Parkes on the morning of 9 February 1934. The deceased's wrists had been cut, and the verdict was suicide. A suicide note was also produced during the Inquest."

In his final season with Portland in 2009–10, Walker scored a career high 57 points in 61 games, despite missing time due after surgically implanting a plate in his chin after he was hit in the face by a puck on December 8, 2009. He returned to help Portland progress to the second round of the postseason by scoring 10 points in 13 games. \nAfter passing through the draft the two previous years, on June 26, 2010, Luke was chosen by the Colorado Avalanche in the fifth round, 109th overall, of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.\nProfessional.\nWalker attended his first Avalanche NHL training camp for the 2010–11 season and after impressing through camp, with eligibility to play in the AHL with affiliate the Lake Erie Monsters, he was signed by Colorado to a three-year entry level contract on September 28, 2010. Walker remained a constant with the Monsters throughout his entry level contract with the Avalanche.

After originally re-signing for another season with Graz and after competing in pre-season, Walker and Graz mutually opted to terminate his contract on September 9, 2015. Three days later on September 12, Walker remained in Austria to sign a one-year contract with fellow EBEL club, EC KAC.\nInternational play.\nOn January 5, 2010, Walker won a Gold Medal as a member of the United States men's national junior ice hockey team that won the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2012)",
        "text": "The 2012 Royal Rumble was the 25th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on January 29, 2012, at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2012 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. It was the first Royal Rumble held since the end of the first brand extension in August 2011.\nSix professional wrestling matches were featured at the event. The main event was the 2012 Royal Rumble match. Sheamus - the 22nd entrant - won the match by last eliminating Chris Jericho, the 29th entrant. Two title matches were featured: a WWE Championship match with CM Punk defending against Dolph Ziggler, which Punk won to retain the title, and a Triple Threat Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship between the reigning champion Daniel Bryan, Big Show, and Mark Henry, which Bryan won to retain the championship. Incidentally, this event is also noted as Mick Foley's last night as an active wrestler as he would compete in the Royal Rumble match.\nThe event received 443,000 pay-per-view buys, slightly down from 446,000 buys the previous year's event had received.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by WWE since 1988—in April 2011, the promotion ceased going by its full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, with \"WWE\" becoming an orphaned initialism. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2012 event was the 25th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 29, 2012, at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Tickets went on sale on December 10 through Ticketmaster. It was the first Royal Rumble held since the end of the first brand split in August 2011.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. The 2011 event broke tradition and had 40 participants, but 2012 returned to 30. The winner of the match traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2012, the winner could choose to challenge for either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nA highly promoted match featured CM Punk defending his WWE Championship against Dolph Ziggler. On the December 26, 2011, episode of \"Raw\", Punk was put into a gauntlet match by Interim Raw General Manager John Laurinaitis, with the stipulation that if either one of Jack Swagger, Ziggler, or Mark Henry defeated Punk, they would receive a championship match against the latter the next week. Ziggler won the match after Punk was distracted by Laurinaitis throwing out Vickie Guerrero and Swagger from ringside. The next week, during the title match, Punk was counted out as a result of another intervention from Laurinaitis. However, since titles cannot change hands via countout, Punk retained the championship. After the match, Laurinaitis announced that Punk would defend his championship against Ziggler in a rematch at the Royal Rumble, with himself acting as the special guest referee. Then on the January 9, 2012, episode, when Punk faced Swagger in a singles match, Laurinaitis added a stipulation that if Swagger lost, he and Vickie Guerrero would be banned from ringside at the pay-per-view; Punk won the match, and thus, Guerrero and Swagger are banned from ringside during the championship match. Additionally, a week later on the January 16 episode, in a segment with Mick Foley, Laurinaitis revealed that he was using this opportunity to cost Punk his title for disrespecting him.\nAnother match heading into the Royal Rumble featured John Cena against Kane. Upon returning to WWE on the December 12 episode of \"Raw\", after an absence of nearly four months, Kane interrupted Cena's match against Mark Henry, and though it was Henry who put him out of action, he bypassed him and attacked Cena, chokeslamming him before revealing his new mask. While demanding an explanation for these events the next week on \"Raw\", Cena was again attacked by Kane, who revealed in the next several weeks of his desire to have Cena \"embrace the hate\" (his current on-screen character and T-shirt promoting otherwise) within caused by the anti-Cena crowd who continued to boo him. When Cena dismissed any intentions of doing so, Kane not only continued his attacks on Cena, but began to direct his attention to his close friend Zack Ryder, assaulting him as well, to the point of injuring him (kayfabe), ultimately leading to Ryder losing his United States Championship to Jack Swagger on the January 16, 2012, episode, under orders from John Laurinaitis. The same night, Laurinaitis put Cena in a one-on-one match against Kane at the Royal Rumble, in addition to booking Cena in a match against Swagger. Before the match even officially started, Cena started to attack Swagger aggressively to avenge Ryder's loss, prompting Kane to appear on the TitanTron and congratulate him to have started \"embracing his hate\". On the January 23 episode, during a Falls Count Anywhere match (in which Laurinaitis had prevented Cena from interfering, on the pretext of never granting Ryder a rematch for the United States Championship if he did so), Kane chokeslammed Ryder through the entrance stage, incapacitating him. As Ryder was stretchered and taken away in an ambulance, Eve Torres (Ryder's storyline girlfriend) blamed Cena for Ryder's injuries, leading to Cena knocking the microphone out of interviewer Josh Mathews' hand in frustration, and donning a very aggressive look in response to this entire situation.\nAnother featured bout involved Daniel Bryan defending his World Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat Steel Cage match against Big Show and Mark Henry. In December 2011, at , after Big Show defeated Henry in a chairs match to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time, Bryan immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat Big Show, after a post-match attack on the latter by Henry. Using his rematch clause, Big Show faced off against Bryan on \"SmackDown\", only for the champion to agitate Henry at ringside, who pushed Bryan, thus retaining his title. The following week on \"SmackDown\", Bryan defended his title against Big Show again, this time in a No Disqualification, No Count-Out match, which ended in a no contest, when Big Show accidentally ran into and injured Bryan's storyline girlfriend, AJ. The next week on \"SmackDown\", Henry finally enacted his rematch clause against Bryan in a lumberjack match; however, that match also ended up as a no contest, when the lumberjacks became too hostile because of how Bryan had agitated them, and the post-match scenario erupted into a large brawl involving nearly everyone. This forced SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long to officially book Bryan, Big Show, and Henry in a Triple Threat Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Royal Rumble.\nEvent.\nIn a dark match prior to the PPV broadcast, Yoshi Tatsu defeated Heath Slater.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with a Triple Threat Steel Cage match with Daniel Bryan defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Mark Henry and Big Show. Bryan retained by escaping the cage after he fell from Big Show's grasp (Bryan was climbing out of the cage, and Show was trying to pull him back in over the top) and fell to the arena floor.\nThe next match was an Eight-Diva tag team match with Alicia Fox, Eve Torres, Kelly Kelly, and Tamina Snuka taking on The Bella Twins (Nikki Bella and Brie Bella) and The Divas of Doom (Divas Champion Beth Phoenix and Natalya). The latter team won after Phoenix tagged herself in and performed a glam slam on Kelly Kelly, scoring the pinfall.\nThe following match was between John Cena and Kane. After a back and forth contest, the action would spill from the ring, and the match ended in a double count-out. After the match, Kane would continue his assault, hitting Cena with multiple chair shots before attacking an injured Zack Ryder, who was watching the event from a private office. Kane dragged Ryder to the ring and performed a Tombstone Piledriver on him. Cena then reentered the ring and tried to retaliate, only for Kane to execute a chokeslam on him.\nThe next match was made after Drew McIntyre requested a spot in the Royal Rumble, asking SmackDown general manager Teddy Long for an opportunity to prove himself, so he gave him a match against a mystery opponent who turned out to be Brodus Clay. Despite McIntyre starting the match well, Clay would quickly defeat him after a running splash.\nThe penultimate match of the card was the WWE Championship match between reigning champion CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler with Raw interim GM John Laurinaitis serving as outside enforcer. As per the match stipulations, Ziggler's tag team partner Jack Swagger and manager Vickie Guerrero were both banned from ringside. The first part of the match was a hold-for-hold encounter. Towards the latter part of the match Punk had Ziggler beaten, but the referee was knocked out and unable to make the count. Punk would execute a second GTS and both the referee and enforcer Laurinaitis counted to three and Punk retained his championship.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the annual Royal Rumble match, where the winner would get a world championship match of their choice at WrestleMania XXVIII. As a result of losing a match to R-Truth on \"Raw\", The Miz entered at #1, and started the match with Alex Riley. Miz quickly eliminated Riley and was then joined by entrant #3, R-Truth, before Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes entered at #4. Miz eliminated R-Truth, who then pulled Miz under the bottom rope and laid him out on the outside. Mick Foley, the first surprise entrant of the match, entered at #7 and immediately eliminated one half of the Tag Team Champions Primo (#6). Ricardo Rodriguez then entered at #8 and teamed up with Foley to eliminate Justin Gabriel (#5). Santino Marella entered at #9 and eliminated Ricardo before squaring off with Foley. Marella brought out his Cobra puppet while Foley brought out Mr. Socko. The two then teamed up to eliminate entrant #10 Epico, the other half of the Tag Team Champions. Marella and Foley locked Cobra and Mr. Socko together, only for Rhodes to intervene and eliminate Marella. Foley applied Mr. Socko on Miz, but Rhodes then eliminated him as well. Hall of Famer Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, who was sitting on commentary, entered at #12 as a surprise entrant and performed a diving fist drop on Miz, but was quickly eliminated by Rhodes immediately afterwards.\nThe ring began to fill up with superstars as Booker T, who was also sitting on commentary, entered at #17 and Hall of Famer and first ever winner \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan entered at #19, the latter of whom was quickly eliminated by Rhodes. Miz almost eliminated Kofi Kingston (#11) by causing him to almost fall off the apron. When Miz tried to flip Kingston over by his legs, Kingston instead did a handstand and walked over to the steps without his feet touching the floor, saving himself and staying in the match. Rhodes and Dolph Ziggler (#18) teamed up to eliminate Booker T and The Great Khali (#15). Michael Cole, the final member of the commentary team, entered at #20, only to be joined by entrant #21, Kharma, the third female superstar to ever enter a Royal Rumble match. Cole climbed over the top rope to avoid Kharma, only for Lawler and Booker T to pull Cole to the floor, eliminating him. Kharma then eliminated Hunico (#16), but was then eliminated by Ziggler. Another surprise entrant, Road Dogg, entered at #23, before United States Champion Jack Swagger joined the match at #25. Wade Barrett (#26) eliminated Road Dogg only to be joined by 2009 winner Randy Orton (#28), who in turn eliminated him. Chris Jericho came out at #29, eliminating David Otunga (#27), before Big Show entered at #30. As Big Show entered, he assisted Sheamus (#22) in eliminating Swagger before hitting Swagger with a knockout punch. Big Show cleared out the ring, eliminating both Miz (who lasted over 45 minutes) and Rhodes (who lasted over 41 minutes and scored the most eliminations with six) at the same time, as well as Ziggler.\nThis brought the final four down to Sheamus, Orton, Jericho and Big Show. The former three teamed up on Big Show, who fought them off, executing a chokeslam on Jericho only to be hit with an RKO from Orton. Sheamus and Orton then attempted to eliminate Big Show. Big Show pushed Sheamus away but Orton tipped Big Show over the top rope to eliminate him. Immediately afterwards, Jericho quickly eliminated Orton from behind to put himself in the final two with Sheamus.\nSheamus and Jericho went back-and-forth as Sheamus countered a running bulldog from Jericho to almost eliminate him, but Jericho fought out of it and hit Sheamus with a dropkick. Sheamus hit Jericho with the Irish Curse backbreaker and set up the High Cross to try and eliminate him. Jericho slipped out and clotheslined Sheamus over the top rope, who held on, before Jericho hit another dropkick to try and eliminate Sheamus, who still managed to hold on. Sheamus fought back into the ring, hitting a battering ram on Jericho before attempting a Brogue Kick. Jericho countered and locked Sheamus in the Walls of Jericho. Jericho tried to clothesline Sheamus over the top rope, but Sheamus countered and flipped Jericho over the top rope onto the apron, who held on just enough to stop his feet touching the floor. The two superstars made their way onto the top turnbuckle, where both fell off but avoided elimination. Jericho caught Sheamus with a Codebreaker and attempted to tip him over the top rope, but Sheamus fought out of it and pushed Jericho away. Jericho ducked a Brogue Kick attempt from Sheamus and attempted a second Codebreaker, but Sheamus countered by catching Jericho and threw him over the top rope onto the apron. Jericho again avoided touching the floor, but as he brought himself back up, Sheamus hit him with a Brogue Kick, which knocked Jericho off the apron to finally eliminate him after a seven-minute clash, meaning Sheamus won the Royal Rumble match.\nReception.\nThe event received mixed reviews. The \"Canadian Online Explorer\" gave the event a 6.5 out of 10, with the Royal Rumble match receiving the same rating. The World Heavyweight Championship match and the John Cena vs. Kane match were rated a 5 out of 10 and the Divas' tag-team match a 3 out of 10. The WWE Championship match received the highest rating with an 8.5 out of 10."

        "text": "Robert Charles Christian (October 17, 1945 – February 20, 1974) was an American professional baseball player who played seven seasons (1964–1970) in North America — including parts of three seasons in the Major Leagues with the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox — and two more years (1971–1972) in Japan. A third baseman and outfielder, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nChristian was born in Chicago, but his family moved to El Cajon, California, when he was a boy. After attending El Cajon Valley High School and Grossmont College, he signed his first baseball contract with the New York Yankees before the 1964 season. But Christian spent only one season in the Yankee farm system, with the Rookie-level Johnson City Yankees, before he was selected by Detroit in the first-year player draft, and he would play the next four seasons in the Tiger organization. After collecting a career-high 151 hits and batting .319 for the Toledo Mud Hens, Christian was recalled for his first taste of Major League action after the September 1 roster expansion. The Tigers were breezing to an American League pennant and, ultimately, the 1968 World Series championship, and used Christian in three games as an outfielder, first baseman and pinch hitter. In his second MLB game, he collected his first Major League hit, a double off Camilo Pascual of the Washington Senators. Those three games constituted Christian's entire Tiger career; on September 30, he was sent to the White Sox as part payment for relief pitcher Don McMahon, who had been acquired by Detroit on July 26.\nChristian then spent parts of the – seasons with the MLB White Sox (and the remainder with the Triple-A Tucson Toros). He appeared in 39 games played and recorded 143 plate appearances with the 1969 ChiSox, batting .217. Called up in June, he hit his first Major League home run on June 14 against a future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, Jim Palmer, and was Chicago's starting left fielder for much of September. He began with the White Sox and stayed with the club into May as a pinch hitter and occasional left fielder. On May 20, his ninth-inning, two-run pinch home run against the California Angels' Tom Murphy was a key hit in a game-winning rally, as Chicago scored three times in the final frame to win, 3–2, at Comiskey Park. Christian spent most of that season with Tucson, batting .335 before drawing his release to play in Japan. All told, he collected 33 hits during a 54-game Major League tenure, including four home runs and five doubles.\nHowever, illness curtailed both his playing career and his life. Diagnosed with leukemia, Christian died in San Diego, California, at the age of 28. He was survived by his wife and two children."

Forty-six men started the competition and 27 countries were represented.\nValeriy Borchin entered as the reigning world and 2008 Olympic champion. The athletes on the Chinese and Russian teams led the rankings that year: Wang Zhen and Chu Yafei were the top two, while Borchin, world record holder Vladimir Kanaykin, and Sergey Morozov were in the top six. Wang Hao, Eder Sánchez and Jared Tallent had also performed well that year, as had Kim Hyun-sub, who represented the host nation.\nItalian Giorgio Rubino and Japan's Yusuke Suzuki were the early leaders after 5 km. The two remained half a minute ahead at 10 km, but Rubino fell off the pace and was later disqualified for lifting both feet off the ground. Borchin and Wang Zhen made up ground on Suzuki and after 15 km Borchin progressively pulled away to win the race and defend his title.\nIn the last 5 km Vladimir Kanaykin and Luis Fernando López finished quickly to came away with the silver and bronze medals, respectively. Wang Zhen held on for fourth, with Stanislav Emelyanov fifth kKim Hyun-sub sixth.\nAt the time, Borchin became only the third walker to win consecutive 20 km world titles, joining Maurizio Damilano and Jefferson Pérez. Although his winning time was not especially quick, the race was undertaken in hot and humid conditions.\nOn 20 January 2015, Borchin was suspended for eight years from 15 October 2012, with his results between 14 July 2009 and 15 October 2012 (including his 2009 and 2011 World Championship gold medals) being deleted from the records. On the same day, Kanaykin was suspended for life starting from 17 December 2012, with all of his results between 11 February 2011 to 17 December 2012 (including his 2011 world Championship silver medal) being deleted from the records.\nLópez was therefore declared the 2011 World Champion, with his gold medal being Colombia's first ever medal in the history of the Championships, while Wang Zhen was promoted to silver.\nStanislav Yemelyanov of Russia was originally promoted to the bronze medal, but he was suspended for eight years for a second doping offence from 7 April 2017, with all of his results from 2 June 2009 being deleted from the records (including these championships); this suspension was made indefinite on 2 June 2018.\nAccordingly, the IAAF informed the Korea Association of Athletics Federations (KAAF) that Kim would be awarded the bronze medal, South Korea's first ever at these Championships."

        "text": "St. Peter (currently known as Stade Santander International for sponsorship reasons) is a Rugby ground in Saint Peter, Jersey and is home to Jersey Reds, who have played in the RFU Championship, the second level of the Rugby Football Union's league pyramid, since 2012–13. The ground is located within walking distance of Jersey Airport. The ground also hosts Jersey's Siam Cup games against Guernsey every 2 years.\nDevelopments.\nDue to Jersey's relatively quick rise through the leagues, the St. Peter ground has had to undergo redevelopments quickly. In order to prepare for promotion to National League 1 in 2011, Jersey applied for planning permission for floodlights to be erected on the ground. Jersey had previously received a grant to erect floodlights on the nearby training pitch in 2007. Floodlights are a mandatory requirement for clubs in National League 1. This came a year after the opening of the Lord Jersey Stand and a new pavilion by William Villiers, 10th Earl of Jersey and the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, Andrew Ridgway to go with their clubhouse. They were built mainly to grant better facilities for spectators.\nIn 2012, with Jersey closing in on promotion to the Championship, the club announced possible plans to build a new terrace as well as a gym and player accommodation. They averaged about 2,000 fans in 2011-12, which easily led the third-level National League 1, and frequently drew over 3,000 for big matches including a club record crowd of 3,648 for the 20-18 win over Rosslyn Park on 25 January 2012.\nHistory.\nThe ground has seen a number of major events in Jersey's history. In 2010 it hosted Jersey's National League 3 South East play-off victory against Taunton R.F.C. Jersey then went on to win the final against Ampthill at Twickenham Stadium in London, England. The St Peter ground also hosted Jersey's matches against Old Albanian RFC and Shelford in 2011 that made sure that Jersey would reach the National League 2 South play-offs. The ground also hosted Jersey's National League 2 South play-off final victory against Loughborough Students RUFC.\nHowever, arguably the two biggest events in Jersey's rugby history to date—their 37–13 win over Coventry that secured their promotion to the 2012–13 Championship, and their 41–31 win over Bedford Blues that saved them from relegation at the end of the 2013–14 Championship—did not take place on the island. The former match was played in Coventry, and the latter in Bedford."

        "text": "George Donald Bullard (October 24, 1928 – December 23, 2002) was an American professional baseball player. The native of Lynn, Massachusetts, was a shortstop and outfielder during a nine-season (1950–1958) career. He played 891 games in minor league baseball and received a four-game, end-of-season trial in the Major Leagues with the 1954 Detroit Tigers. He batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nBullard attended Lynn Classical High School, where he was a teammate of celebrated local athlete and future MLB first baseman Harry Agganis. Bullard was recalled by Detroit after his fifth season in the team's farm system and made his debut as a pinch runner on September 17, 1954, running for Walt Dropo in the ninth inning of a 6–3 loss to the Cleveland Indians. After two more pinch running appearances, Bullard played his only game in the field (at shortstop) and recorded his only plate appearance in MLB on September 25, also against the Indians. He entered the game in the sixth inning. Defensively he handled five chances and made one error. At the plate, he recorded one at bat against Early Wynn, a future Hall of Famer. He reached first base on a force play and did not score a run.\n\"I replaced shortstop Harvey Kuenn in the game and I hit the ball hard and got on base,\" Bullard once said. \"It was a big thrill to play. On the Indians that day in Cleveland was my hometown neighbor Jim Hegan, the great Indians catcher. I hurt my hand in the game and was shipped back to Boston for treatment and missed the chance at playing in more games that late September.\"\nBullard played another four season in the Tigers and Milwaukee Braves organizations before leaving baseball in 1958."

        "text": "The Visa FIVB Beach Volleyball International was a women's beach volleyball tournament held at Horse Guards Parade, London, between 9 and 14 August 2011. It was the beach volleyball test event for the 2012 Summer Olympics and was part of the London Prepares series. The tournament, run as an exhibition, was won by the Brazilian pair Maestrini and Vieira. 2,274 tonnes of sand was transported to the parade ground for the event. After the tournament, the sand went to several locations within London to fulfill a legacy promise. The stadium had a capacity of 1,500 spectators. The play was affected by the 2011 England riots.\nTournament.\nThe tournament featured 24 teams from around the world. It was jointly staged by the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) and the British Volleyball Federation. The event took place at Horse Guards Parade between 9 and 14 August 2011. The event saw 54 matches played but, although prize money was available, no ranking points were on offer, as it was classified as an intercontinental exhibition. Teams who were eligible to take part in the European Championships Final were not allowed to participate. A total of 2,274 tonnes of Redhill 28 sand was delivered from a quarry in Godstone, Surrey, to create one competition court and two practice courts. The main stadium had a capacity of 1,500, ten times fewer than the 15,000 capacity of the planned Olympic venue itself.\nParticipants included world number one team and 2009 world champions Jennifer Kessy and April Ross, Sydney Olympic champion Natalie Cook, and Beijing and 2011 World Championship bronze medalists Zhang Xi and Xue Chen. Six teams from Commonwealth countries were also invited as the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) and the FIVB wanted to demonstrate their support for beach volleyball becoming a sport at the Commonwealth Games.\nFormat.\nThe format of the competition was similar to the one to be used at the Olympics. The 24 pairs were divided into 6 pools of 4 teams. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the last-16 knockout stage along with the best two third-place finishers in the groups. The remaining third-place teams then played off in \"lucky loser\" matches to determine the final two spots in the last 16. The knockout stages were seeded according to the teams' rankings in the pool stage.\nPrize money.\nA total of 10,000 US dollars in prize money was awarded as follows.\nLondon riots.\nBecause of the riots affecting England at the start of the competition, all evening matches on 9 August were brought forward, and matches were played on practice courts, allowing people to get home safely. Natalie Cook said that the situation reminded her of the 1996 Summer Olympics, where she had to play in the bronze medal match after a bomb had been detonated.\nPreliminary phase.\nPool A.\nOn day one British pair Mullin and Dampney beat Clancy and Hynes of Australia in straight sets. On day two they played Santiago and Acevedo of Puerto Rico, going a set and 2–8 down and saving 3 match points before winning in 56 minutes. Meanwhile, Wang and Ma of China won both their first two matches. In the group decider, the British pair struggled at first but rallied and eventually won, although Mullin received a yellow card for disputing a line call. A win for Santiago and Acevedo put the Puerto Ricans in the last 16.\nPool B.\nIn the first round, Xue and Zhang of China beat Sinnema and Wiltens of the Netherlands 21–15, 21–8, while Elwin and Matauatu beat Roubains and Papageorgiou of Greece in straight sets. The same two pairs won in the second round. The group decider was played during a downpour. Elwin and Matauatu won the opening set, but the second seeds from China took the next two sets to win the match. Meanwhile, the young Dutch pair Sinnema and Wiltens exited the competition after a straight-sets loss to Roubains and Papageorgiou.\nPool C.\nThird seeds Kessy and Ross of the US all their matches. The crowd favourites, Uganda, finished bottom but expressed their determination to return for the 2012 Olympics.\nPool D.\nBritish pair Boulton and Johns won the first match in the group with a straight sets win over Broder and Voth from Canada. Cunha and Lima of Brazil won their first two matches. The Brazilian pair won the group decider with a straight sets win over the British pair.\nPool E.\nAfter two matches the Australian and Canadian teams were undefeated in group E.\nThe Australians won the decider in straight sets win. Malaysia lost all three of their matches in straight sets.\nPool F.\nIn the first match of the tournament, Mexican pair Candelas and Garcia defeated Brazilians Maestrini and Vieira. The Mexicans won their next two matches to win the group with three wins.\nKnockout stage.\nLucky loser.\nSantiago and Acevedo (Puerto Rico) and Rutledge and Hochevar (US) were the best third-placed teams, who automatically qualified for the last 16. Hunkus and Lowe (US), Simon and García Gonzalo (Spain), MacTavish and Rodrigue (Canada) and Roubanis and Papageorgiou (Greece) competed for the final two places in the last 16, which were won by the Spanish and Canadian teams.\nLast sixteen.\nMaestrini and Vieira (Brazil), Cunha and Lima (Brazil), Kessy and Ross (USA), Xue and Zhang (China), Cook and Hinchley (Australia) and Boulton and Johns (UK) won in straight sets. Bibiana and Garcia (Mexico) and Mullin and Dampney (UK) won in three sets.\nQuarterfinals.\nCunha and Lima were the first pair to reach the semi-finals, defeating Cook and Hinchley in the final set after missing four match points. Boulton and Johns defeated Beijing medalists Xue and Zhang in straight sets, their first win in three meetings with them and the best win of their career to date. However, British number ones Mullins and Dampaney lost in straight sets to Brazilian pair Maestrini and Vieira. Ross and Kessy won a close first set against Bibiana and Garcia but won second easily.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals saw the fifth international meeting of the year between the two Brazilian pairs. Maestrini and Vieira came from three points down to take the opening set. In the second, they went three points ahead themselves. Cunha and Lima drew level, but Maestrini and Vieira won the last five points. In the other match, Americans Kessy and Ross took the first set 21–13, but Britain's Boulton and Johns took the second – the first time they had done so in four meetings between these two teams. The Americans, however, won the third set to win a place in the final.\nThird place playoff.\nBrazilians Cunha and Lima were too strong for Boulton and Johns, beating the British pair in two close sets.\nFinal.\nKessy and Ross quickly took control of the first set, winning it 21–10. In the second set it was Maestrini and Vieira who started fast. The Americans rallied, but the Brazilians won the set. A closely fought final set reached a score of , but the Brazilians won the next two points to achieve their first win over the Americans in 2011. Maestrini was awarded the Visa Hero Award for her performance in the final.\nReaction.\nThe event was praised by both spectators and the press, and British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Hunt suggested that a beach volleyball competition should be held in London every year, adding: \"We've proved to the world that despite the incidents earlier in the week, ... all of the test events coped well and it's an opportunity to learn from that experience.\" London Evening Standard journalist Dan Jones commented: \"I'm not sure that beach volleyball will ever be a direct solution for civil unrest and mob rule but it sure as hell diverts your mind from the aftermath.\" David Luckes, Head of Sport Competition at LOCOG, called the atmosphere \"fantastic\", and Vicente Araujo, Technical Delegate and FIVB Beach Volleyball Commission secretary, said the venue was \"inspirational\". Natalie Cook said that they \"couldn’t ask for a better spot for our sport of beach volleyball to be showcased, so we’re very proud\". The 2,274 tonnes of sand used for the event was distributed to Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, The Score Sports Centre in Waltham Forest and the sports centre of the Westminster Academy in London."

        "text": "The World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships, is an annual team triathlon competition organized by World Triathlon. The competition is completed in teams of four, two men and two women, with each member doing a super-sprint distance triathlon.\nHistory.\nThe first relay event appeared in 2003 in Tiszaújváros, Hungary as the ITU Team Relay Championships, two races were run one for men's teams and one for women's teams every team would have three members who would each complete one leg and the teams combined time would be their total time. Despite being deemed a success the event would not return until 2006. The championship would return in 2006 and 2007 before once again lacking an annual competition in 2008. In 2009, World Triathlon (then known as the International Triathlon Union or ITU) went through a major reorganization of its top level competitions, the men's and women's relay championships where merged and the title would be contested as a mixed relay. The event was initiated with the aim of getting more triathletes as well as the team triathlon discipline on the Olympic programme.\nThe format appeared at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2014 Asian Games, which was considered a significant step towards adding team triathlon to the 2016 Summer Olympic programme. In July 2013, the IOC executive board ruled that they would not add any new disciplines to the 2016 games for fear of putting additional financial pressure on Brazil. In June 2017 with the announcement of mixed gender events being added to the Olympic program the mixed team relay has gained Olympic status and will hold its inaugural Olympic event in the 2020 Olympics. In 2018 it was decided that at three of the events of that years World Triathlon Series would also host a mixed relay event would be held alongside the men's and women's competition one of these would be the World Championship and all three events would grant points towards Olympic qualification and constitute the new mixed relay series. In 2019 the number of mixed relays in World Triathlon Series were increased to five and once again one of these would be the World Championship.\nIn 2021 the Mixed Relay World Championships were awarded to Bermuda, with the intent of holding a combined World Triathlon Sprint &amp; Mixed Relay Championships, which would also mark the return of a stand alone Sprint Championship after a ten-year hiatus. However, the Bermuda event was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the inaugural combined event was instead held as the Montréal leg of the 2022 World Triathlon Championship Series. The event doubled as the first qualifier for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and also included the first age-group mixed relay world championships.\nTeam Relay Championships.\nBefore the creation of the mixed team relay, single gendered relay races were held intermittently."

        "text": "The Men's decathlon at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Daegu Stadium on August 27 and 28.\nAshton Eaton started off strongly, taking a 22-point advantage in the 100m over American teammate Trey Hardee, then adding three more points in the long jump. Oleksiy Kasyanov placed himself in third. Defending champion Hardee pulled back that advantage to take a 6-point lead after the shot put. Aleksey Drozdov blew past the field with a 2.14 high jump, but cumulatively it was only a short lived 2-point lead. And the faster Eaton took the 400m and a 53-point lead over Hardee at the end of Day 1.\nThe second day was more of the same, Eaton's speed over the 110 hurdles extended his lead to 69 points over Hardee, but considering how much faster Eaton normally is vs Hardee, he didn't extend the lead enough. Kasyanov was the best of the rest now almost 170 points behind the leaders. The discus was the reversal of fortunes. Hardee threw over 3 and a half metres further and took an 8-point lead. In the pole vault, Eaton's 4.60 was the poorest of the top 16, losing 20 cm to Hardee, while Leonel Suárez vaulted 5.00 to slide into third, barely ahead of Drozdov. In the javelin, Eaton only managed a 55.16, while Hardee went 68.99 and Suárez bettered that with 69.12 to move into second place by 32 points. With a 244-point lead, Hardee was not going to be caught from behind. It was predictable that Suárez needed to finish within 4.8 seconds of Eaton to hold on to silver. With Suárez' personal best in the 1500m at around 4:16, and Eaton's best around 4:20, it looked like a foregone conclusion. But Eaton went out aggressively, taking the lead on the final lap and powering close to a 65-second last lap to get a personal best 4:18.94. Eaton beat Suárez by 5.22 seconds to edge 4 points ahead and take the silver medal.\nResults.\n100 metres.\nWind:Heat 1: -0.5 m/s, Heat 2: +0.5 m/s, Heat 3: -0.2 m/s, Heat 4: 0.0 m/s\n110 metres hurdles.\nWind:Heat 1: -0.8 m/s, Heat 2: -0.7 m/s, Heat 3: -0.5 m/s, Heat 4: -0.1 m/s"

        "text": "Andrew Shaw (born July 20, 1991) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the fifth round (139th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. During his 10-season NHL career, Shaw played for the Blackhawks and the Montreal Canadiens. He is a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Blackhawks (2013 and 2015). Shaw ended his playing career in 2021 after suffering multiple concussions.\nEarly life.\nShaw grew up in Belleville, Ontario. He has three siblings. When he was growing up, many, including his own family, believed his younger brother had a better chance of making the NHL.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nNiagara IceDogs.\nShaw made his OHL debut with the Niagara IceDogs in a September 20, 2008 game against the Ottawa 67's. He scored his first OHL goal in a game against the Plymouth Whalers. On November 14, Shaw had his first assist in a game against the Kitchener Rangers at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex. Shaw had 17 points (eight goals and nine assists) overall in his OHL rookie season and ranked second on his team with 97 penalty minutes (PIM) in 56 regular-season games.\nOn October 17, 2009 in a game against the Sudbury Wolves, Shaw gained a goal and two assists making it his first career multi-point game. In a January 2, 2010 game at Sudbury he had his first career multi-goal game. Shaw had 11 goals and 25 assists in 68 regular-season tilts. He ranked fifth on the team with 36 points and paced the team with 129 PIM, recording 4 PIM in five postseason appearances.\nOwen Sound Attack.\nShaw had a season-best four assists in a September 15, 2010 game against the Guelph Storm. From October 14 to October 23, he had a point in six straight games, with two goals and six assists, and Shaw had points (four goals and two assists) in four straight games during the OHL playoffs. He also had three multi-goal games in 20 OHL postseason games in 2011. After the end of the season Shaw was honoured as the OHL's Hardest Working Player of the Year.\nDuring the 2010-11 season, Shaw led Owen Sound with 135 penalty minutes and ranked fifth on the team with a junior career-high 54 points. This season gave him junior career highs, with 54 points, 22 goals, 32 assists, 135 penalty minutes in 66 regular-season games. He registered a junior-career best +17 plus/minus rating, led his team with 135 PIM, ranked third on his team with 10 goals and fourth with 17 points (10 goals and 7 assists) in 20 postseason appearances. Shaw paced the attack with 53 PIM on the way to the OHL Championship, paced all skaters at the 2011 Memorial Cup with seven points (2 goals and 5 assist) in four games.\nProfessional.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nDespite missing two consecutive drafts, Shaw was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 5th round (139th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Shaw split time between the Chicago Blackhawks and their AHL associate the Rockford IceHogs in the 2011–12 season, playing 38 games for the IceHogs and 37 games for the Blackhawks and recording 12 goals, 11 assists and 23 points for both clubs.\nShaw made his professional debut in an October 8, 2011 game against the Grand Rapids Griffins. In Rockford's 5–3 win against the Peoria Rivermen on October 9 at Carver Arena Shaw made an assist on the game-winning goal, his first professional career point. In Rockford's 6–4 win against the Peoria Rivermen on October 28 at Carver Arena he scored the first goal of his professional career. Shaw had both the first multi-point game (one goal and two assists) and first shorthanded goal of his professional career in Rockford's 7–3 win over the Peoria Rivermen on November 25. In Rockford's 6–3 at-home victory over the Chicago Wolves on December 9 Shaw had the first multi-goal game of his professional career and he was named the #1 Star of the game. Shaw scored two goals in Rockford's 5–4 shootout loss to Grand Rapids Griffins on December 14 at Van Andel Arena. For the month of December, Shaw totalled nine points: eight goals and one assist.\n On January 3, 2012, Shaw signed a three-year entry level contract and was recalled January 4 by Chicago to replace injured agitator Daniel Carcillo, his first career NHL recall. On January 5, Shaw made his NHL debut in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, getting into a fight, with Flyers rookie Zac Rinaldo, on the second shift, the first fight of his NHL career. He needed stitches, but later returned to score the first goal of his NHL career on his first shot of his first game against Ilya Bryzgalov and played on the Blackhawks first line with Patrick Sharp and captain Jonathan Toews. On January 18, Shaw recorded his first career assist on a goal by Jonathan Toews in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. Between January 12 through January 18 Shaw had a goal in four straight games. Shaw missed three postseason tilts (April 17–21) in the Blackhawks first round exit to the Phoenix Coyotes due to a suspension from an illegal hit to Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith in game two. \nDuring the lock-out, Shaw played for the IceHogs. He served a six-game suspension after leaving the bench to join a fight in a game against the Lake Erie Monsters on November 3, 2012. Four games after serving that suspension, Shaw received a one-game suspension for a boarding incident in a game against the Chicago Wolves on November 2012. Shaw scored a goal in each of the four games between these two suspensions. Shaw had a goal and an assist in a 4–3 shootout win over the Lake Erie Monsters.\nShaw returned to the Blackhawks when the abbreviated NHL season started in January 2013. He played in all 48 regular season games with 9 goals, 6 assists and 15 points recorded as the Blackhawks won the Presidents' Trophy as the regular season champions and advanced to the Stanley Cup playoffs and, eventually, the Stanley Cup Finals. On June 12, 2013, Shaw had the game-winning tip-in of the opening game of the Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 triple-overtime victory over the Boston Bruins. Minutes into the first period of the sixth (and final) game of the Finals on June 24, Shaw took a puck off Shawn Thornton's shot to the face. He fell to the ice and laid in a small pool of blood. Officials stopped the play and Shaw was helped to his feet by teammates Nick Leddy and Michal Rozsíval and repaired in the dressing room by the trainers. Shaw returned in the second period and hoisted the Stanley Cup with his wounds still partially bleeding. After the playoffs ended, Shaw revealed that he had a broken rib while playing in the Stanley Cup Finals that was originally sustained in the second round against the Detroit Red Wings and sustained a broken orbital bone as a result from getting hit in the face by the puck in game six of the finals. Shaw played all 23 playoff games and scored nine points 9 (5 goals, 4 assists) and had 35 penalty minutes in the playoffs and helped Chicago win the Stanley Cup.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Shaw hit the 20-goal mark for the first time, ending the season with 80 games played and 20 goals, 19 assists and 39 points recorded.\nOn March 30, 2015, Shaw recorded his 100th point with an assist on a goal by Bryan Bickell in a 4-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings. He finished the 2014–15 season playing in 79 games with 15 goals, 11 assists and 26 points recorded. He was also the team leader in penalty minutes with 67. On May 19, in the second overtime of game 2 of the Western Conference Finals against the top seeded Anaheim Ducks, Shaw deliberately headbutted the puck into the Ducks' net. The goal was waved off by the game's referees, but the Blackhawks eventually won the game after Marcus Krüger scored with 3:48 remaining in the third overtime period. Shaw and the Blackhawks eventually defeated the Ducks in round 3 in seven games and then the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals in six games, giving Shaw his second Stanley Cup.\nShaw finished the 2015–16 season playing in 78 games with 14 goals, 20 assists and 34 points and was again the team leader in penalty minutes with 69. On April 19, 2016, Shaw recorded one goal and two assists in game four in the first round of the 2016 playoffs against the St. Louis Blues. Later in the same game, he shouted a homophobic slur towards a referee who had penalized him for interference against Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester and also instigated a brawl after the final horn. Shaw apologized for the remarks the next day during a press conference at O'Hare International Airport before the Blackhawks traveled to St. Louis for game five. The NHL suspended Shaw for one game and fined him $5,000. After missing game five due to the suspension, Shaw came back to the Blackhawks lineup in game six to help force a game seven which the Blackhawks would lose 3–2 and the series 4–3 resulting in their elimination from the 2016 playoffs. Shaw finished the playoffs with four goals and two assists for six points in six games.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn June 24, 2016, Shaw was traded to the Montreal Canadiens during the 2016 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for two 2016 second-round picks. Three days later on June 27, Shaw came to a six-year contract agreement with the Canadiens worth $23.4 million. The NHL suspended Shaw for three games for boarding Connor Hobbs during a preseason game played on September 26. Shaw scored his first goal with the Canadiens on October 13. Controversy ensued Shaw again when he slew footed Johan Larsson of the Buffalo Sabres at the end of the same game. The incident occurred towards the end of the game while the Canadiens had a 4–1 lead over the Sabres. Shaw was assessed a match-penalty, but did not receive any supplemental discipline after meeting with the Department of Player Safety. On December 12, Shaw sustained a concussion after being upended on a hit by Boston Bruins defenseman Torey Krug, causing him to miss 14 games. He then finished the 2016–17 season with 12 goals, 17 assists and 29 points recorded in 68 games played. He also led the team in penalty minutes with 110. Shaw also played in five games in the Canadiens first round exit in the 2017 playoffs in six games to the New York Rangers.\nOn March 13, 2018, Shaw checked Dallas Stars defenseman Greg Pateryn but was injured himself on the play. He suffered a torn lateral collateral ligament and a concussion. As a result, Shaw underwent knee surgery and was expected to miss around six months to recover. He finished the injury-marred season with 51 games played with 10 goals, 10 assists and 20 points. He finished the injury-marred 2017–18 season with 51 games played with 10 goals, 10 assists and 20 points and the Canadiens struggled as a team and with injuries throughout the season resulting in them missing the playoffs by 26 points in the standings. \nAlthough Shaw missed the Canadiens training camp, he was cleared to play in time for the start of the 2018–19 season and had a resurgent season filled with milestones while playing most of the season on Montreal’s second line with Max Domi and Tomáš Tatar. On November 24, 2018, Shaw recorded his 100th NHL assist on a goal by Tomáš Tatar in a 3–2 loss to the Boston Bruins. On December 6, Shaw scored his 100th NHL goal in a 5–2 win over the Ottawa Senators against Senators goaltender Craig Anderson. Shaw suffered a neck injury on December 31, in a game against the Dallas Stars which kept him out of the lineup for 15 games. After missing all of January and the first four games in February, he returned to the Montreal lineup on February 9, 2019, a 4–3 OT loss against the Toronto Maple Leafs. On February 26, Shaw scored his first career hat trick in an 8–1 win over the Detroit Red Wings. On March 28, Shaw played his 500th NHL game in a 6–2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Shaw finished his bounce-back season with 63 games played with 19 goals, 28 assists and 47 assists recorded and the Canadiens as a team came just two points out of a playoff spot. The 28 assists and 47 points Shaw tallied were both career highs. Shaw was nominated by the Canadiens for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, the award that goes to the player that \"best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey\" but was not named a top 3 finalist by the league.\nReturn to Chicago.\nOn June 30, 2019, the Canadiens traded Shaw (alongside a 2021 seventh-round pick) back to the Blackhawks in exchange for 2020 second and seventh-round picks and a 2021 third-round pick. On November 30, Shaw suffered a concussion during a game against the Colorado Avalanche and was immediately placed on injured reserve. This injury effectively ended his season after the first 26 games of the 2019–20 season when the team announced he would not return. On July 14, 2020, Shaw opted out of playing the remainder of the season (which saw the last three weeks of the season and the playoffs postponed to the summer with an expanded format due to the COVID-19 pandemic), citing a preference to continue healing from the concussion.\nOn February 9, 2021, 14 games into the pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, Shaw suffered another concussion in a game against the Dallas Stars. On April 26, towards the end of the season, Shaw announced his retirement effective immediately after being advised by the team doctors to discontinue his playing career due to multiple concussions within short time spans. Shaw was nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy after the season ended by the Blackhawks making it the second time in his career where Shaw has been nominated for the trophy but wasn't named a top 3 finalist by the NHL.\nPlaying style.\nShaw developed a reputation as an agitator for his aggressive play and verbal instigation while playing for the Chicago Blackhawks. He compared his playing style to Boston Bruins player Brad Marchand, whom he fought in the third game of the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, by saying \"We're both agitators. We both play physical and we're always chirping.\" Joel Quenneville, who coached Shaw in Chicago from 2011 to 2016, praised Shaw by stating, \"You're not going to find the same ingredient that [Shaw] provides, whether it's the game-to-game consistency of being an agitator, net-front presence on your power play, good in the room, good on the bench, good on the ice, smart hockey player, makes plays, brings that nastiness you appreciate and comes ready to play every game.\" Shaw has also gained the nickname \"Mutt\" from some of his teammates and fans regarding his rough style of play.\nShaw also performs an intricate warm-up ritual which he has practiced before every period since 2009. As part of his routine, Shaw strikes his shin pads approximately seven times with his hockey stick, practices fore and back-hand face-off draws, twirls his hockey stick in his hands, plants the knob-end of his stick onto the ground, and then walks in a circle around it.\nPersonal life.\nShaw is known for wearing a black rubber bracelet with 'Ironworkers Local 721', the name of a local union in Belleville, on the back in tribute to ironworkers from his hometown and as a reminder of his roots. In July 2013, he brought the Stanley Cup back to his hometown for his day with the cup. In August 2013, Shaw auctioned the stitches from his facial injury—made famous as \"the definitive image of the NHL playoffs\"—for $6,500 and donated the money to The V Foundation for Cancer Research. \nShaw and his wife have two children. Shaw was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder in 2016.\nIn May 2023, on the \"Raw Knuckles Podcast\" with Chris Nilan and Tim Stapleton, Shaw discussed the alleged sexual assault of Kyle Beach, which happened during the Blackhawks' 2009–10 season. On the podcast, Shaw said that the issue \"should have nothing to do with the players and the coaching staff\", but instead should have been handled by the team's management and HR. He also said, \"As a 20 year old, I would've never put myself in the situation Kyle was in. [...] Obviously, I don't know what was going on with Kyle, but he put himself in a bad situation.\" He received criticism for his comments, particularly for victim blaming."

The team was led by defending high jump champion and medal hope Blanka Vlašić.\nTeam selection.\nMost members of the Croatian team qualified for the World Championships by meeting the A standards in their respective events. In men's discus throw, Martin Marić surpassed the A standard in April 2011, followed by Roland Varga, national record holder in the same event, who did so in June. Hammer thrower András Haklits qualified in mid-August with a throw of 75.77 m, good enough to meet the B standard.\nA notable absence from the World Championships was Sandra Perković, the reigning European champion in discus throw and thus an automatic qualifier. She set a then-world-leading mark of 67.96 m in February 2011, but subsequently received a six-month suspension for testing positive to methylhexanamine, a banned psychostimulant, and was forced to miss the championships.\nDiscus thrower Vera Begić met the B standard, but was not selected for the World Championships.\nMedalists.\nThe following Croatian competitor won a medal at the Championships\nResults.\nMen.\nIn the hammer throw qualification on August 27, András Haklits made only one legal throw of 70.93 m, which was sufficient for 14th place in his qualification group and 25th place overall. Haklits stated he was \"depressed\" over his failure to reach the final, ascribing the poor showing to an adductor injury he had sustained one week before the championships. He said that his leg was \"good enough for a half-an-hour training session\", but anything longer than that was \"impossible\".\nIn the discus throw qualification on August 29, Martin Marić and Roland Varga were both far from their best. Marić's mark was five meters shorter than his personal best, and Varga was shorter by eight meters, which was insufficient to qualify either of them for the final.\nWomen.\nIn the women's marathon on August 27, Lisa Stublić placed 27th with the time of 2:36:41. She started the race conservatively, then gradually progressed through the rankings: she was 42nd at 5 km and 10 km, 32nd at 20 km, and 30th at 40 km. In the end, Stublić was satisfied with her performance as her pre-race expectation was to finish around 30th place. She described the racing conditions as difficult, due to high humidity.\nOn August 29, Nikolina Horvat placed 7th in her 400 meters hurdles heat with the time of 56.60 s, not far from her personal best and national record of 56.28 s, and still sufficient to advance to the semifinals as one of the fastest losers. Her semifinal time on August 30 was slower, at 57.02 s, eventually placing her 22nd among 24 semifinalists. Horvat was pleased with her result, as this was the first time in her career that she entered a semifinal of a major competition, but stated that her semifinal performance was somewhat below her expectations. Horvat said that she had made more strides than usual due to an interference from a gust of wind at the last hurdle. She pointed out that she was - at - among the shortest 400 meters hurdlers in Daegu, which was the reason why she could not afford technical errors."

However, their run into the finals series threatened to be disrupted by suspensions arising from a wild brawl in a clash with Melbourne in the penultimate round of the season. Four Manly players received suspensions, including a three-match ban for key forward Glenn Stewart. Despite the suspensions, Manly qualified for the Grand Final with ease, defeating Queensland teams the North Queensland Cowboys 42–8 in the qualifying final and the Brisbane Broncos 26–14 in the preliminary after earning a weeks break. Steve Matai and Tony Williams were reported to the NRL's match review committee for incidents during the win over Brisbane, raising the prospect that they may be suspended for the Grand Final. However, the committee refused to charge Matai, while Williams' clean record enabled him to avoid a suspension by pleading guilty to a charge of effecting an unlawful high tackle. However, Manly would play the Grand Final without their co-captain Jason King, who suffered a pectoral injury in Round 22 of the season, and winger David Williams with a neck injury.\nIt would be Manly's 18th Grand Final appearance, a record seventh consecutive decade in which the club had achieved the feat, and a chance for the club to win its eighth premiership. Coach Des Hasler made his third Grand Final in the position after appearing in three others as a Manly player.\nNew Zealand Warriors.\nFor only the second time in the club's entire history the New Zealand Warriors would search for their first premiership title up against the second-placed Manly side. Having finished sixth on the competition ladder with 32 points, they lost their first match of the finals series to the Brisbane Broncos in their heaviest defeat of the season losing 40–10 but however earned a second chance, only due to the two lower-ranking teams also losing. They then upset the Wests Tigers in the semi-finals after many gave them a slim chance of winning and they were down 18–6 at half time before mounting a comeback to be down just 20–18 with a few minutes remaining before Kristian Inu scored the match winner for the Warriors as they won 22–20.\nThe New Zealand Warriors then went on to post a major upset over the 2011 minor premiers the Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park in their Grand Final qualifier. The New Zealand Warriors were down 6-0 after 5 minutes due to some poor defence that Gareth Widdop took advantage of to put Sika Manu through a gap to score; the try was converted by Cameron Smith. the Warriors would hit back in the following dozen minutes through Bill Tupou and James Maloney scoring in the 12th and 16th minutes for the Warriors to lead 12–6. The Melbourne side would hit back through a Beau Champion try in 36th minute which Cameron Smith would convert to level the scores at 12-12. Before half time the Warriors were given a penalty which they opted to kick a penalty goal which James Maloney successfully converted for the Warriors to lead 14–12 at half time. The second half was a heated battle with the Warriors starving Melbourne of the ball and any good field position throughout the entire 40 minutes as the Warriors defence superbly defending anything the Melbourne Storm threw at them. The Warriors were believed to have scored in the 72nd minute through Lewis Brown only for the try to be disallowed due to an earlier knock on from Kevin Locke but the Lewis Brown would then go on to score in the 77th minute after some nifty footwork from Warriors young gun Shaun Johnson. James Maloney would beautifully convert a sideline conversion to put any hope of a Storm comeback impossible. This win would then qualify New Zealand for their second ever Grand Final.\nThe Grand Final was Ivan Cleary's last match as coach of the club, having signed to take over the Penrith Panthers the following season. Coincidentally, his last match as a player was when he was the fullback in the New Zealand Warriors side that lost the 2002 Grand Final to the Sydney Roosters, another club Cleary played for in the NRL. Cleary grew up on Sydney's northern beaches, and started his professional career with Manly playing alongside Des Hasler, now his opposing coach.\nThe New Zealand Warriors also fielded teams in the NSW Cup and Toyota Cup Grand Finals, thus becoming the first team since the Sydney Roosters in 2004 to field sides in three different-grade Grand Finals; at the time, the other two grades were the Jersey Flegg Cup and the Premier League Cup. The Warriors' Toyota Cup successfully defended its 2010 title defeating the North Queensland Cowboys in golden point extra time by the scoreline of 31–30.\nMatch day.\nPre-match.\nTwo other matches were played before the NRL Grand Final. At 12.00pm, the New South Wales Cup Grand Final was held between the Auckland Vulcans and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs with the Canterbury side winning 30–28. The Toyota Cup Grand Final, featuring the youth teams of New Zealand Warriors and the North Queensland Cowboys, was played at 2.00pm, with the Warriors winning in extra time after North Queensland winger Kyle Feldt (who in the top-grade 2015 NRL Grand Final would score a try in the final seconds to force extra time) missed the opportunity to win the side's first premiership by missing a relatively simple conversion right on full-time.\nEntertainment included performances by American singer Kelly Clarkson and Australian band Eskimo Joe, marking Clarkson's first appearance at the event since the 2003 NRL grand final. Clarkson performed her song \"Mr. Know It All\", accompanied by 300 dancers.\nMatch details.\nFor the third year in a row, grand final day was a rainy one. Russell Packer, Lance Hohaia and Elijah Taylor swapped places with Sam Rapira, Aaron Heremaia and Feleti Mateo respectively from their interchange spots before the match.\nFirst half.\nAfter a tight opening 28 minutes, Manly prop George Rose struck Aaron Heremaia's cheek with an elbow on the ground. However he was only penalised and put on report and was not sent off and James Maloney kicked a penalty goal to give New Zealand a 2–0 lead. However, Manly broke clear with two tries before half-time, the first just two minutes later to Brett Stewart, and the second just on half-time (which attracted controversy due to a possible obstruction in the lead-up) to Daly Cherry-Evans, one play after an audacious grubber kick from lock forward Glenn Stewart on his own 20 metre line which was gathered in by winger Michael Robertson who broke free despite a desperate attempt by Manu Vatuvei to tackle him.\nSecond half.\nManly stretched its lead to 16 points after half-time following a try to Glenn Stewart, set up by a blind flick pass from William Hopoate just before he was pushed into touch. The New Zealand Warriors then scored two unconverted tries in the final fifteen minutes to Vatuvei (which attracted controversy due to the blatantly forward pass from Johnson to Vatuvei) and Elijah Taylor to narrow the deficit to eight points; however, Manly held onto its lead and celebrated victory with a try to captain Jamie Lyon in the final minute of play. Regular goal kicker Lyon then handed the ball to winger Robertson (who had played his last game for the club) for the conversion. Robertson calmly kicked the goal from out wide after the siren to bring the curtain down on both the game and his successful NRL career.\nPost-match.\nManly lock forward Glenn Stewart was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the player of the match. It was also the 10th time that brothers Brett and Glenn Stewart had each scored a try in the same game for Manly, with the club winning all 10 games. It was also the first time since the 1929 Premiership final when Alf and Frank O'Connor scored for South Sydney that two brothers had each scored a try in the premiership decider."

        "text": "The 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand was the first ever tour of Australasia by any French sports team in history. Puig Aubert captained the France national rugby league team who played 28 matches in total in both Australia and New Zealand, winning 21 of them in what is regarded as the high point in the history of rugby league in France. The Australian Test series resulted in a 2–1 victory to France; however, the tourists then lost their match against the New Zealand national rugby league team. Welcoming the team home to Marseille, more than 150,000 people turned out for a street parade.\nTouring squad.\nThe French side was coached by former internationals Robert Samatan and Jean Duhau, and was captained by Puig Aubert. France had just claimed the 1950–51 European Rugby League Championship before embarking on the tour. The squad's average age was 26.5 years. The backs' average weight was while the forwards' was . \nClaude Teisseire, half back for Carcassonne and Lucien Barris, a forward, were initially selected in the squad but did not tour. \nThe \"Rugby League News\" published Player Details (Position, Occupation, Age, Height and Weight).\nFrance's captain Puig Aubert had been offered a large contract to play in Sydney but returned to his homeland where he was voted French sportsman of the year.\nAustralian leg.\nThe tour's Australian leg featured games played in every mainland State capital except Adelaide, drawing a total of over 450,000 spectators.\n1st Test.\nAfter five matches against New South Welsh teams, the French side played the tour's first Test match against Australia in Sydney. The two countries had played four Tests against each other previously, with Australia winning all of them.\nAll of the French players selected for the Test had played in at least one tour match so far except their five-eighth, Charles Galaup who had only recently arrived in the country. The Australian team featured nine players from the Sydney team that drew with France nine days prior, in addition to four Queenslanders.\nPuig-Aubert opened the scoring with a Penalty kick. At one point France led 16–0, but Australia came back, starting with a penalty kick by Graves. The half time score was 16–2.\nAustralia came back strongly in the second half. However, the game ended with the French celebrating their first ever rugby league victory against Australia. France's captain Puig Aubert was presented the Commonwealth Jubilee Cup after the match by the Governor General of Australia, William McKell.\n2nd Test.\nAfter five matches against Queensland teams, the French side played the tour's second Test match against Australia in Brisbane.\nOnly one change was made to the French team for the second Test: five-eighth Charles Galaup was replaced by Jacques Merquey. This time The Australian test team included six Queenslanders and returned to its winning ways with a 23–11 victory. Following a head clash with French prop forward Louis Mazon in the second half, Australian captain Clive Churchill was assisted from the field.\nFrance were leading 12–7 at half time. However, in the second half Brisbane captain and five-eighth, George Atherdon scored a try and his side was leading 16–15 with seven minutes remaining. France were awarded a penalty near the half-way line and Puig-Aubert scored a drop-goal from about 53 yards out two minutes from full-time. Aubert reached a points total for the tour of 112, thus passing Briton Ernest Ward's total of 106 the previous year.\n \n3rd Test.\nThe French team travelled back from Queensland to Sydney for the third and deciding Test match of the series. The Australians were slight favourites to win the match. People began to queue up in bitterly cold winds the night before the match.\nFrench captain and fullback Puig Aubert kicked 7 goals and his half back Joseph Crespo scored three tries as the tourists overpowered Australia to claim the Test series. This was the last test match for Australian five-eighth Wally O'Connell.\nNew Zealand leg.\nFrance defeated Canterbury 13–7 in front of 13,000 at the Show Grounds.\nTest Match.\nNew Zealand defeated France 16–15 in a \"brutal match\" at Carlaw Park. Des White kicked the winning penalty goal after the full-time siren had sounded to seal victory in \"one of the most dramatic and dirtiest games ever played by the Kiwis\".\nFirst it was West Coast five-eighth George \"Geordie\" Menzies forced off with a cheekbone broken by a French head-butt. Then it was Otago's 1946 All Black halfback, Jimmy Haig with a broken jaw. Also Charlie McBride was bitten.\nIn the mid-second half, a brawl erupted amongst the forwards. French prop and national middleweight champion, Louis Mazon, was heavily involved. It took referee J. Griffen three minutes to separate the combatants. Ten minutes later, when the touch judges and officials intervened and things finally settled down, Griffen sent France's hooker Martin Martin from the field for throwing mud at him, but the Frenchman refused to go. The president of the French Rugby League, Anton Blain, and his New Zealand counterpart, Jack Redwood, came on and eventually persuaded Martin to leave the field.\nNo replacements were allowed so the game wound down with 11 Kiwis on the field against 12 Frenchmen. There was no ground clock or siren in those days and the players had to listen for the chimes from the nearby University of Auckland wedding-cake tower to get an indication of time remaining. They knew that it was usually all over by 4 pm, but this game went well past four.\nIn the final seconds of the match New Zealand wing Bevin Hough, a 1950 British Empire Games silver medal-winning sprinter, was heading for the Domain Stand corner and a certain try when he was taken out by a high shot from Cantoni. White was then called to kick. He backed up against the white picket fence sideline on the domain side, and sent the ball sailing between the posts, the crowd roaring before it got there.\nThe bitterness continued. One of the Frenchmen attacked Maurie Robertson, leaping onto his back as he left the field, and a touch judge was knocked to the ground. As the crowd gathered to congratulate the Kiwis, the French spat at them. Later however, at the after-match dinner the French were gentlemen, conceding victory to the better side. Puig Aubert shook White's hand and congratulated him on the match-winning goal.\nThe 50th anniversary of this match was commemorated during the 2001 French rugby league tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea with another Test between New Zealand and France in Auckland.\nTwo days after the one-off Test match France returned to Carlaw Park to play Auckland. France won 15–10 in front of 30,000 spectators. Auckland included Des White, Jimmy Edwards, Tommy Baxter, Cyril Eastlake, Bevin Hough, Bruce Robertson, captain Des Barchard, Cliff Johnson, George Davidson, Graham Burgoyne, Doug Richards-Jolley, Clarence Hurndell and Allan Wiles.\nDuring this match, French half-back Jean Dop was running for the ball when he was struck by a spectator, prompting police to move the crowd from the area.\nAustralian return leg.\nFollowing the New Zealand leg of the tour, the French returned to Australia for another 3 matches before heading home.

Reynolds also saw time in the outfield and as a starting pitcher, while hitting a career .223 batting average.

Nicknamed ″Windy″, because of her constant chatter on the field and from the dugout, she was chosen as the team's captain and eventually served as interim manager.\nIn 1947, Reynolds hit a career-best .245 average with a .935 fielding percentage at third base and earned a spot in the All-Star team. Her most productive season on the mound came in 1948, when she posted a 9–6 and a 2.27 earned run average in 18 pitching appearances. She also was the best fielding pitcher in 1950 as she committed no errors.\nSince 1988 Reynolds is part of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities.\nMary Reynolds died in her homeland of Gastonia, North Carolina, at the age of 70.\nCareer statistics.\nBatting\nPitching\nCollective fielding"

After spending the rest of 1954, and all of 1955 through 1957, in minor league baseball, he was selected in the winter 1957 Rule 5 draft by the Cardinals and began 1958 on their roster. In his only National League appearance, against the Chicago Cubs at Busch Stadium April 15, Flanigan hurled one inning in relief and allowed two hits and one run, the latter coming on a home run by Cub catcher Cal Neeman. He then was returned to the White Sox' Indianapolis Indians affiliate, from which he had been drafted.\nFlanigan allowed three hits and one run in 2 MLB innings pitched, with two bases on balls and no strikeouts. In 246 minor league games from 1952 to 1958, he won 55 of 100 decisions.\nFlanigan died in Edgewood, Kentucky, on December 8, 2022, at the age of 88."

        "text": "James McGee (born 10 June 1987) is an Irish former professional tennis player. He was born in Castleknock, Ireland. He attended Belvedere College in Dublin, County Dublin.\nPersonal life.\nMcGee was born to Kieran and Marie McGee. He started playing tennis at the age of seven at Castleknock. He won his school's tennis championship in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and was also awarded the Most Outstanding Player of the Year in Ireland in 2003. He was educated at Belvedere College in Dublin and then obtained a major in Psychology from North Carolina State University in 2008.\nCareer.\nMcGee has spent most of his career on the Futures and Challenger circuits. As of 9 June 2014, he has played in 10 Davis Cup ties for Ireland with a record of 13 wins and 8 losses (9–5 in singles &amp; 4–3 in doubles).\n2014.\nMcGee had finished 2013 in good form and continued this into 2014, reaching the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas de Nouvelle-Calédonie in Nouméa, equalling his best performance at a challenger. He then competed in Australian Open qualifying but lost in his first match to eventual qualifier Jimmy Wang. McGee later recorded an impressive win over top 100 player Alex Bogomolov, Jr. at the Challenger of Dallas and then narrowly missed out on making his first ATP World Tour main draw the following week, losing in the final round of qualifying at the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships to David Goffin. In March, McGee played in qualifying for the BNP Paribas Open, an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event, but was again defeated by Goffin. He then helped Ireland to a 3–2 victory over Egypt in the Davis Cup, winning both his singles rubbers in straight sets.\nIn late April, McGee once again equalled his best challenger result, reaching the semi-finals of the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger. He then went on to win his first ever Grand Slam qualifying match, defeating Norbert Gomboš at the French Open and then stunning Guido Pella in two sets in the following round. McGee, however, was unable to become the first Irish tennis player since Sean Sorensen, in 1982, to reach the French Open main draw, as he lost in straight sets to Andrea Arnaboldi. In early June, McGee once again reached the final round of qualifying for an ATP World Tour event, this time at the Queen's Club Championships, but came up just short in a tight three sets match against Daniel Brands. McGee next competed at Wimbledon qualifying but was defeated in straight sets by Aljaž Bedene.\nMcGee then travelled to North America for the summer hardcourt swing. He first competed at the Nielsen Pro Tennis Championships but lost out to Tim Smyczek in the second round. McGee then came his closest to making an ATP World Tour main draw at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, where he lost to Ante Pavić in a final set tie-break in the final qualifying round. He then reached the semi-finals of the Challenger Banque Nationale de Granby. This result saw him break into the top 200 of the rankings for the first time in his career, reaching a new high of 193. He also made the semi-finals of the doubles with Chase Buchanan. The following week, at the Kentucky Bank Tennis Championships, McGee defeated the number one seed Evgeny Donskoy in the opening round. He was eliminated at the quarter-final stage by 2011 champion Wayne Odesnik. In the doubles he again played with Chase Buchanan and the pair reached the final, the first challenger final of McGee's career, but they were defeated in straight sets. The following week he lost to Vincent Millot in the opening round of the Odlum Brown Vancouver Open.\nMcGee qualified for his first ever grand slam main draw at the 2014 US Open after defeating Zhang Ze in the final round of qualifiers in 3 sets. He also defeated Gonzalo Lama and Yuki Bhambri during the qualifying stages. McGee faced Aleksandr Nedovyesov in the first round of the main draw where he lost in 4 sets. Despite this defeat, the prize money earned for reaching the first round accounted for more than a quarter of his career earnings to date."

Initially the most predominant teams in the league were veteran women's basketball clubs such as Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv, who won almost yearly during the first two decades after the establishment of the women's league. This changed in 1976, when the team Elitzur Tel Aviv began winning all of the league's championships for 19 years straight. During the 1990s the trend again changed, as the most prominent championship winners became Electra Ramat Hasharon and Elitzur Ramla. \nThe champions of the 2010/2011 season were Elitzur Ramla. Elitzur Tel Aviv and Elitzur Holon share the distinction of having won the most championship trophies, 20 between themselves., although the union that was established in 1990 between the two team was disbanded in 2008.\nIn the 2011/12 season Maccabi Bnot Ashdod reached \"double\" winning, for the first time, the national league and national cup in one season."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Charles I, Charing Cross",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, London, England, is a work by the French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur, probably cast in 1633 during Charles’ lifetime. It is considered the central point of London.\nIts location at Charing Cross is on the former site of the most elaborate of the Eleanor crosses erected by Edward I, which had stood for three and a half centuries until 1647. Charing Cross is used to define the centre of London and a plaque by the statue indicates that road signage distances to London are measured from this point. The statue faces down Whitehall towards Charles I's place of execution in 1649 at Banqueting House.\nThe first Renaissance-style equestrian statue in England, it was commissioned by Charles's Lord High Treasurer Richard Weston for the garden of his country house in Roehampton, Surrey (now in South London). Following the English Civil War the statue was sold to a metalsmith to be broken down, but he hid it until the Restoration. It was installed in its current, far more prominent location in the centre of London in 1675, and the elaborately carved plinth dates from that time.\nDescription.\nThe statue shows Charles I of England on horseback, with the king wearing a demi-suit of armour but without a helmet. Across the chest is a scarf tied into a bow on the right shoulder. The king is holding a baton in his right hand, and the reins of the horse in his left.\nHistory.\nThe 24-year-old Charles succeeded his father in March 1625. The statue was commissioned by Weston in January 1630.\nThe contract, in French with an English translation, is thought to have been drafted by the architect Balthazar Gerbier, who was then building Putney Park, Weston's country house in Roehampton. The statue was to be finished in 18 months (summer 1631), but its execution was delayed; the date 1633 inscribed on the horse's left forefoot is probably when the work was cast.\nAfter the Parliamentary victory in the English Civil War, the statue was sold to John Rivet, a metalsmith in the Holborn area. Rivet received instructions from Parliament to break down the statue, but instead he hid it on his premises. He produced some broken pieces of brass as evidence that he had followed his instructions, and for some time sold brass-handled cutlery to both Royalists and Parliamentarians, which he claimed was made from the remains of the statue.\nAfter the Restoration, the statue was found by Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland and, following a complaint to the House of Lords, it was decreed \"That the said John Rivett shall permit and suffer the Sheriff of London to serve a replevin upon the said Statue and Horse of Brass, that are now in his Custody.\" It was purchased by the King and in 1675 was placed in its current location. The pedestal itself is made of Portland stone with a carved coat of arms; the work was completed by Joshua Marshall, who was mason to Charles II.\nOn 28 October 1844, during the visit of Queen Victoria to open the Royal Exchange, the sword and the badge of the Order of the Garter were stolen. During the Second World War the statue was removed by the Ministry of Works for protection, and was stored at Mentmore Park, Leighton Buzzard. Before being returned to its plinth in Whitehall, the Ministry carried out some repairs on the statue, including adding a replacement sword and the badge of the Order of the Garter. Additionally, a bronze tablet was added to the base of the plinth, explaining the addition of the replacement items.\nIn late 1892, the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland, led by Herbert Vivian, applied to the government for permission to lay wreaths at the statue, on the anniversary of Charles I's execution. Permission was refused by Prime Minister Gladstone, and George Shaw-Lefevre, Vivian's one-time travelling companion and now the First Commissioner of Works, enforced the order. The League attempted to lay their wreaths anyway on 30 January 1893. Police were dispatched to stop the League and after a confrontation, Vivian and other League members were allowed to complete their ceremony. Press coverage generally mocked the League for their actions.\nIn 1977, the plinth was cleaned for the first time in three centuries. The work was conducted by the Department of the Environment and the department of conservation at the Victoria and Albert Museum."
