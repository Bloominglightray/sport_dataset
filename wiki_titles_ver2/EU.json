        "title": "Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club",
        "text": "Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club (abbreviated to Clydesdale ARC, or CARC) is Scotland's largest rowing club, located on the River Clyde in the centre of Glasgow. It is successful each year in many events at the Scottish Rowing Championships and is affiliated to Scottish Rowing. \nHistory.\nClydesdale Amateur Rowing Club was officially formed in 1857, however, evidence exists to suggest that the club was actually first formed in 1856; the first club annual report, dated to 1856, identifies the formation of the club as occurring “in a small meeting, convened in Steele’s Coffee-Room, where, with Arethusa Albert Small Esq. as chairman, your secretary moved, the creation of an humble rowing club”. It was originally named the Clydesdale Gentlemen Amateur Rowing Club.\nRangers Football Club were formed by four founders of the rowing club – brothers Moses McNeil and Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath – who met at West End Park (now known as Kelvingrove Park) in March 1872. Rangers' first match, in May that year, was a goalless friendly draw with Callander on Flesher's Haugh situated on Glasgow Green.\nBoathouse.\nThe club currently resides in the eastern half of The West Boathouse on Glasgow Green, sharing the building with Clyde Amateur Rowing Club. Due to the limited size of the West Boathouse, the club also uses the East Boathouse, situated 400m upriver, to house their eights, as well as boats for Glasgow Schools Rowing Club. \nThe current boathouse is a category B listed building. It contains two medium boat bays: the riverside one is barely long enough for shorter coxless fours, and is used to store one of these, along with the club's doubles and Aldens. The other bay is for the fours and singles, with singles being stored in a system with two singles per shelf. Access to the boathouse is from the path on Glasgow Green, the bay doors face east onto the asphalted forecourt, with steps onto the river along the south side of the boathouse, which are shared with Clyde.\nThe female changing rooms are also on the ground floor, the top floor contains male changing rooms, a tearoom, and the gym in which the Concept 2 Ergometers, and weights equipment are stored. Access to the balcony is also from this floor. There is also an attic in which Club belongings and equipment are kept.\nBoats.\nThe clubs boat-fleet consists mainly of British Janouseks, as well as some newer Stämpfli boats. In Autumn 2009 a used Stämpfli 8 was delivered (\"Cruachan\"), as well as a new Coxless Quad (\"Islay\"). A Filippi F41 Eight (named \"Ben y Vrackie\" after a hill outside Pitlochry) was bought with financial help from Henry Abram and Sons Ltd, Awards for All Scotland, the Sports Council for Glasgow and Culture and Sport Glasgow.\nThere are also two other Stämpfli fours, most other boats are Janousek. The majority of boats are built for scull and sweep rigging for versatility, also necessary due to the limited boat racking space, meaning the total number of boats is limited.\nNotable Members.\nSeverin Nielsen (born 2002) and Matthew Fielding (born 2001) are Scottish elite rowers who represented Scotland in the quadruple sculls at the 2019 Home International Regatta. Community Development Officer, Miki Lee Dale, was awarded sportscotland’s ‘Young Person’s Coach of the Year’ in 2017.\nFormer alumni include:\nColours.\nClub colours are Royal Blue. The blades are Royal Blue with a white cross spanning the height and breadth of the blades. A previous design was Royal Blue with two vertical white stripes towards the end of the blade, which can still be seen on some private blades. The one-piece is also Royal Blue with a double white-stripe along each side. (A former design had a white upper and blue lower part to the one-piece, however this was changed. )\nEvents.\nThe Club is involved in organising a few races throughout the year, most notably the Clydesdale Sculler's Head every October, the largest Scottish single's head race, in which doubles can also race in a separate division since 2007.\nThere is also the Clydesdale Four's and Eight's Head, as well as the Corporate Regatta where companies can send teams to learn to row and then compete, which is both a source of income and new members.\nClydesdale Summer Regatta is held annually in May."

It was an historical tour, but the results were very poor: only a victory against the SARF Leopard selection.\nThe most important player of the last match, against Transvaal XV, was Rocco Caligiuri: the fly-half (but normally play ad full-back) scored three drops. It was the first time that a player scored three drops in an international match in South Africa.

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLVII halftime show occurred on February 3, 2013, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans as part of Super Bowl XLVII. Beyoncé headlined with special guests Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child. It was critically acclaimed, becoming the then second most watched show in Super Bowl history with 110.8 million viewers, behind the previous year's Super Bowl XLVI halftime show record. \nThe show was produced by Ricky Kirshner, directed by Hamish Hamilton, and choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. Receiving widespread acclaim, critics commented that Beyoncé once more proved her abilities during live performances. The performance, and the stadium blackout that followed, generated more than 299,000 tweets per minute, making it the most-tweeted moment in the history of Twitter. It was the first Pepsi sponsored halftime show since Prince's performance in Super Bowl XLI.\nBackground.\nIn October 2012, news sources confirmed Beyoncé would headline the halftime show at the Super Bowl XLVII. Beyoncé made the announcement on her website prior to the National Football League's confirmation by posting an image of her face with the date of the game stenciled into eye black. Lisa de Moraes of \"The Washington Post\" quipped that she would become the first \"female solo artist under the age of AARP eligibility\" to headline the Super Bowl halftime show. Initial reports mentioned that Beyoncé's husband, Jay-Z was a potential collaborator on the show. However, he did not appear during the show, and a source told to \"Us Weekly\" that he changed his decision at the last minute as he wanted the performance \"to be her moment and didn't want to take away from it\".\nDevelopment.\nThe halftime show was produced by Ricky Kirshner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. During the performance Beyoncé was dressed in an oversized black jacket, lace-and-leather bodysuit and thigh-high stockings. Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams were also dressed in a matching \"black-leather dominatrix-wear\", as stated by David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\". Two logos of Beyoncé's portraits opposite each other were put on stage and the show began with Beyoncé emerging from the floor between them while a blaze of flames also appeared on stage. Throughout the performance, she was backed by her all-female band, her back-up dancers as well as the Saintsations, a 32-girl cheerleader troupe of host-city New Orleans team the Saints and a horn section made up of female musicians.\nFollowing Beyoncé's performance of the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at President Obama's second inauguration on January 21, 2013, she was accused for lip sync. During a news conference where she discussed her halftime performance, she admitted that she sang the song along with a pre-recorded track during the ceremony, but confirmed that she's going to sing live during the Super Bowl halftime show, saying \"I will absolutely be singing live... This is what I was born to do, what I was born for. I've had a 16-year career. All the things I've done have prepared me for this.\" Following her performance at the halftime show, Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Beyoncé, who wasn't \"used to having her reputation impugned\", silenced the \"doubters\" who criticized her after the performance at the inauguration. Randall Roberts of the \"Los Angeles Times\" also wrote in his review: \"As she danced and asked that the crowd clap along, her microphone hand made an audible thump. It was loud and obvious. And it proved something true: The mike was live, and our singer was too.\"\nSynopsis.\nA countdown to the halftime show began under the music for \"Countdown\". It then opened with an instrumental portion of \"Run the World (Girls)\" and Beyoncé ascended on a stage lift while a Vince Lombardi speech was heard in the background:\nThen Beyoncé started singing an a cappella version of the chorus of \"Love on Top\", which later led to a performance of \"Crazy in Love\" when as stated by Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" Beyoncé was \"virtually growling, giving that song a ferocity it has never before had\". Beyoncé went on the perform \"End of Time\" which began with stomping dance. A performance of \"Baby Boy\" followed when Beyoncé danced while screens behind and below her projected clones of herself dancing the same choreography. Former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams joined her on stage, after being launched off the floor to perform \"Bootylicious\" and \"Independent Women Part I\" from the \"Charlie's Angels \" soundtrack which they finished with a pose in the form of the film's lead female characters. They continued with a version of Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". After they left the stage, Beyoncé said to the crowd, \"Everybody put your hands toward me – I want to feel your energy!\" and ended the show with an \"emotional\" rendition of \"Halo\". After her last song, Beyoncé told the crowd, \"Thank you for this moment. God bless y'all\".\nReception.\nCritical.\nBeyoncé's performance was widely acclaimed by critics. Randall Roberts of the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented that Beyoncé's performance at the half time show \"reconfirms her skills as a live performer, silencing anyone who might have wondered about them in the wake of a certain revelation.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote: \"Continuing in the vein of Madonna in 2012, [Beyoncé] steered the Super Bowl halftime show away from dad rock to embrace girl power.\" Melinda Newman of the website HitFix commented: \"In a Super Bowl half-time performance that was as frenetic as it was fierce, [Beyoncé] delivered a sexy segment that was part Victoria's Secret fashion show, part tutorial on how to dazzle an audience.\" Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" praised the performance at the show, commenting that \"for 12 or so minutes... she balanced explosions and humanity, imperiousness with warmth, an arena-ready sense of scale with a microscopic approach to the details of her vocals. Amid all the loudness were small things to indicate Beyoncé was answering her skeptics, quietly but effectively.\" He finished his review with the conclusion that Beyoncé \"the machine had made her point\" and that the performance was \"proof of life\". Jim Farber of \"Daily News\" wrote in his review of the performance that \"It's hard to think of a star better suited to the Super Bowl than she is\". Dan Hyman of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote in his review that Beyoncé \"flaunted her supreme vocal and dancing chops throughout the halftime show\" and added that the set's biggest moment was when she was joined on stage by her former bandmates. Rob Sheffield of the same publication praised the performance of Beyoncé's guitarist Bibi McGill during the show, commenting that it was a \"ready-made obligatory-Slash-cameo guitar solo\". He finished his review by writing, \"The actual game wasn't bad, either. Sorry, 49ers. But there's no question who the night belonged to: Beyoncé.\"\nRecognition.\nIn March 2013, Michael Hogan of \"The Observer\" put the performance in his list of \"The 10 best Beyoncé moments – in pictures\". Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show received three nominations for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards which took place on September 22, 2013. It was nominated in the categories for Outstanding Special Class – Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Programs; Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special; and Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special eventually winning in the last category. In next year, the performance was nominated for Best Awards, Music, or Game Shows at 2014 Art Directors Guild.\nMedia.\nNielsen ratings confirmed that the 2013 show was watched by 110.8 million viewers, thus becoming the seventh most watched halftime show in the history after Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime show which was watched by 112.5 million viewers, Bruno Mars' Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show with 115.3 million viewers, Coldplay's Super Bowl 50 halftime show with 115.5 million viewers, Lady Gaga's Super Bowl LI halftime show with 117.5 million viewers, Katy Perry's Super Bowl XLIX halftime show with 118.5 million viewers, and Rihanna's Super Bowl LVII halftime show with 118.7 million viewers. Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show became the most tweeted-about moment in Twitter history with 268,000 tweets per minute.\nIn the week ending February 10, 2013, Beyoncé sold 220,000 digital song downloads in the US, while Destiny's Child sold 60,000; up 80% and 36% on the previous week, respectively.\nSet list.\nSet list adapted from BBC."

        "text": "The 2014 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Gran Premio d'Italia 2014) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 September at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Lombardy. It was the 13th round of the 2014 Formula One World Championship and the 65th Italian Grand Prix held as part of the series. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the 53-lap race from pole position. His teammate Nico Rosberg finished second and Williams driver Felipe Massa took third.\nHamilton claimed the 36th pole position of his career by recording the fastest lap in qualifying but a slow start dropped him behind Rosberg. He returned to second by lap ten and drew closer to teammate Rosberg. He was instructed by radio to remain at least 2 seconds behind Rosberg but opted to ignore the message and took the lead on lap 29 when Rosberg ran off the circuit. Hamilton maintained the lead for the rest of the race to achieve his sixth victory of the season and the 28th of his career. There were three lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the race.\nThe result saw Hamilton lower Rosberg's lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 22 points with Daniel Ricciardo remaining in third position. Valtteri Bottas moved to fourth position while Fernando Alonso did not finish the race and fell to fifth. Mercedes increased their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to 182 points over the second-placed Red Bull. Williams overtook Ferrari for third with six races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 Italian Grand Prix was the 13th of the 19 round 2014 Formula One World Championship, and the 65th running of the event as part of the series. It was held on 7 September at the 11-turn Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Lombardy. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race: one was on the straight between the second Lesmo corner and the Ascari chicane, and the second was on the straight linking Parabolica to the Rettifilo chicane. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought the white-banded medium and orange-banded hard dry tyre compounds to the race.\nBefore the race Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg led the World Drivers' Championship with 220 points, ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton in second and Daniel Ricciardo in third. Fernando Alonso was fourth on 121 points and Valtteri Bottas was a further eleven points behind in fifth. Mercedes led the World Constructors' Championship with 411 points, and Red Bull were second on 254 points. Ferrari and Williams were third and fourth and McLaren fifth.\nFollowing a collision between Hamilton and Rosberg on the second lap of the preceding , the third such incident surrounding the Mercedes team in 2014, which went back to qualifying for the when Rosberg was accused of spoiling Hamilton's lap, the Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff threatened sanctions against one driver if a similar situation happened again and insisted that both men were obliged to serve the team's interests. Hamilton said his objective at Monza was to regain some of the lost ground in the Drivers' Championship and would not give up until the season-closing round in Abu Dhabi: \"It's as big as it's been all season so I've got a lot of work ahead of me but anything can happen in this sport.\" Rosberg was aware of his situation in the title battle and was confident of achieving a strong result: \"I'm focused on taking the maximum points possible in the remaining seven races and I know the team is too, starting with a top result this weekend.\"\nThe Parabolica corner was altered ahead of the race. A large portion of its gravel trap was replaced with asphalt, reportedly for a possible return of the Superbike World Championship in 2015 after series officials raised concerns about a lack of run-off areas on the circuit. The change was heavily criticised by the sport's fan base on social media and certain drivers who felt it removed part of the challenge from Parabolica. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) race director Charlie Whiting, defended the changes, saying drivers and the FIA asked for changes to be made for safety reasons but acknowledged that the corner might not provide as much of a challenge than before. Others joined in Whiting's defence, including Romain Grosjean, who believed the gravel trap's removal would allow drivers to find their limit quicker because of a lack of fear of a major accident.\nA total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) each fielded two race drivers for the event with one driver change and four free practice participants. Having driven in one of the two Caterham cars in lieu of regular driver Kamui Kobayashi at the preceding Belgian Grand Prix, three-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner and 2011 Formula Nippon champion André Lotterer was replaced by Kobayashi. Lotterer planned to race at Monza but did not do so after Caterham team principal Colin Kolles ran Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Roberto Merhi in the first practice session. He told the press that he needed the maximum amount of driving time because he was a rookie. Kobayashi said he was looking forward to testing an updated CT05 car and did not doubt the team's decision to change drivers. Lotus reserve driver Charles Pic replaced Grosjean for the first free practice session for the first time in 2014. Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters driver Daniel Juncadella used Pérez's Force India vehicle for the session's first half-hour, and Giedo van der Garde drove Adrian Sutil's Sauber car.\nPractice.\nThree practice sessions—two on Friday and a third on Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted 90 minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. In the first session, which took place in dry and sunny weather, Hamilton was fastest with a time of 1 minute, 26.187 seconds, six-tenths of a second faster than Jenson Button in second, who was fastest until Hamilton's lap, and Rosberg third. Alonso, Kevin Magnussen, Vettel, Kimi Räikkönen, Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg occupied position four to ten. During the session several drivers noted the hard compound tyres took longer than anticipated to reach their optimum working temperature, and some went off the track while acquainting themselves with a low-downforce set-up. Ricciardo had DRS trouble and his session ended early when he entered the pit lane with a suspected energy recovery system problem, and Magnussen had rear-braking issues.\nRosberg set the fastest lap of the second session at 1 minute, 26.225 seconds; Hamilton was 0.061 seconds behind in second despite electrical repairs taking an hour in the garage, with Räikkönen third. His teammate Alonso was fourth-fastest, with Bottas fifth and Button sixth. Vettel (who ran wide at Parabolica corner on his fastest lap), Magnussen, Massa and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Multiple drivers went off the track during the session. The Lotus duo of Grosjean and Maldonado struggled to generate heat into their tyres and had further difficulty with braking stability and steering. In the third session, which was held in warmer and sunnier weather, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend so far of 1 minute, 25.519 seconds, ahead of Alonso in second and the Williams duo of Bottas and third and fourth. Button, Vettel, Räikkonen, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Hülkenberg were in positions five to ten. Reoccurring gearbox problems forced Rosberg to abandon his short run programme early.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify. The second session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part ran for 12 minutes and determined pole position to tenth. Cars that qualified for the final session had to start the race on the tyre they set their quickest lap times in the second session. Qualifying took place in warm weather. Hamilton was fastest in all three sessions to claim his fifth pole position of the season, the 36th of his career, and his first since the with a lap of 1 minute, 24.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg (using a repaired gearbox) who had improved on his first timed lap, but an oversteer through the Ascari chicane prevented him from achieving pole position. The two Williams duo of Bottas and Massa were third and fourth; both drivers could not improve their fastest times on their second attempts. They were ahead of McLaren's Magnussen and Button in fifth and sixth; the latter lost time through the Lesmo corners on his final timed lap. Alonso was slightly slower than Vettel after his first lap, but he improved slightly for seventh. He attributed his pace to recording similar lap times on four sets of tyres. Vettel qualified higher than his teammate Ricciardo for the fourth time in the past six races to secure eighth. Ricciardo started ninth and Pérez tenth.\nKvyat was the fastest driver not to qualify for the final session; he took a ten-place grid penalty for an overnight engine change, his sixth of the season. Hence, Räikkonen inherited 11th. Räikkonen lacked car grip and locked his front tyres, ending his first timed lap early because cars exiting the pit lane reduced his visibility for the Rettifilo chicane. After preparing for a second lap, he locked his right-front wheel and drove onto a run-off area. Jean-Éric Vergne was 12th with Hülkenberg 13th after traffic slowed his preparation for a lap at Parabolica and felt the car was loose. Sutil had problems driving but gradually improved his car's balance as he drove, and improved on his final lap to secure 14th, ahead of teammate Esteban Gutiérrez, who made a minor error on his final lap. Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first session; his teammate Grosjean did five laps after missing the first 13 minutes as Lotus repaired a fluid leak. Kobayashi slipstreamed his teammate Marcus Ericsson to pass Jules Bianchi for 18th, with Bianchi not improving because he slid sideways through the Ascari chicane and other drivers were faster on the medium compound tyres. His teammate Max Chilton qualified 20th and Ericsson took 22nd; the latter was hindered by a lack of running on the medium tyres following an engine problem in the third practice session.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNotes:\nRace.\nThe weather at the start was dry and sunny, with the air temperature and the track temperature from . A right-front wheel cooler fitted to Hamilton's car detached and crunched on the front wing, causing Mercedes to push him to his grid slot following a reconnaissance lap. An inspection by Mercedes found there to be no problems for Hamilton. Unlike previous years when softer tyre compounds were selected, making one pit stops was calculated to be faster than two by around 12 seconds. Ericsson was ordered to begin from the pit lane after being penalised for driving too fast under double waved yellow flag conditions in the third practice session. When the race began from its standing start at 14:00 Central European Summer Time (), an incorrect mode dropped Hamilton to fourth and moving Rosberg to the lead into the Rettifilo chicane. Wheelspin dropped Bottas to 11th. Magnussen passed Massa on the left for second going into the Rettifilo chicane. Pérez accelerated faster than Alonso and passed him before Alonso repassed Pérez on the left at Curva Grande corner.\nVettel moved to fifth by the end of the first lap but his teammate Ricciardo was put wide onto the chicane's run-off area, dropping four positions over the same distance. Massa attempted to take second from Magnussen by braking later than he did at the start of lap two as Rosberg pulled away from the two. Magnssen went wide at Curva Grande corner and blocked another pass from Massa. DRS was enabled on the next lap and Hamilton used it to attack Massa, allowing Magnussen to pull away from Massa. Magnussen defended but ran deep entering the Rettifilo chicane, allowing Massa to slipstream him into the Variante della Roggia chicane and steered right to claim second place. Magnussen entered the turn off the racing line, spun his tyres on its exit, allowing Hamilton past for third into the first Lesmo corner with better acceleration. Massa and Hamilton pulled away from Magnussen who was being caught by Vettel, Button, Alonso and Pérez.\nHülkenberg lost ninth to Räikkonen on the same lap and Bottas was unable to find the space at Parabolica corner to attempt a pass. Bottas did however overtake Hülkenberg for tenth at the Rettifilo chicane. Chilton entered the Variante della Roggia chicane too fast on lap six, and hit the second set of kerbs at the corner, launching his airborne car into the barrier, ending his race. The safety car was not needed. Rosberg led by almost four seconds by the conclusion of the lap and moved his brake bias towards the front of his car. As Massa went faster Rosberg did the same in response. On the following lap, Rosberg locked his tyres into the Rettifilo chicane at , drove onto an escape road and slalomed through obstacles to retain the lead. His advantage over Massa fell to two seconds. Hamilton used DRS to steer left before the Rettifilo chicane and passed Massa for second on the 10th lap.\nHamilton began drawing closer to Rosberg but required a further few laps to pull clear from Massa; he did not attack Rosberg and stayed out of his teammate's slipstream, nursed his tyres and minimised his fuel usage. Bottas overtook Räikkönen for ninth on lap 13; the next lap, he slipstreamed past Pérez on the left for ninth into the Rettifilo chicane. Bottas overcame Alonso's defence on the outside to take seventh on the main straight during lap 16. Two laps later, Bottas passed Button on his right for sixth. Red Bull elected to bring Vettel into the pit lane at the end of the same lap for hard compound tyres to try and pass Magnussen on pit stop strategy rather than duel Bottas. Pérez followed in response the following lap. Bottas passed Magnussen for fourth at the Rettifilo chicane on lap 21. Magnussen and Alonso made their pit stops on the next lap, rejoining in ninth and eleventh, behind Vettel and Pérez separated them. Magnussen slid exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane trying to pass Pérez.\nMassa made his pit stop from third on lap 24, and emerged in fifth. Hamilton received instructions for an engine mode change and Rosberg entered the pit lane from the lead on the next lap and handed the lead to Hamilton. Bottas made his stop on the same lap and rejoined alongside Vettel on the main straight but was forced wide, allowing Magnussen to pass him. Hamilton took his pit stop on the 26th lap and handed back first to teammate Rosberg. Bottas also fell behind Pérez but re-passed the latter going into the Rettifilo chicane. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington radioed him to stay at least 2 seconds behind teammate Rosberg and conserve his tyres for an attack later on. Hamilton was aware from previous experiences earlier in the season that the method to pass a driver was to do so when tyre grip was optimal otherwise it would not have been possible to draw close enough to effect a pass. He recorded the fastest lap at that point to move within seven-tenths of a second of his teammate Rosberg by the start of lap 28, causing debate among Mercedes pit lane staff.\nMassa at this point was 12 seconds behind and Bonnington allowed Hamilton to attack earlier than planned. Rosberg's front brake temperatures overheated and his attempt to conserve his rear tyres by moving his brake bias towards the front of his car compromised them. Hamilton used DRS and as Rosberg applied his brakes, he drove onto the Rettifilo chicane's run-off area and slalomed his way past some obstacles, promoting Hamilton to the lead. Alonso's energy recovery system failed, triggering a complete electrical shutdown half a minute later, and stopped at the side of Rettifilo's run-off area to retire for the first time in 2014. Button attempted to pass Pérez into the Rettifilo chicane but the two narrowly avoided contact. Bottas tried to pass Magnussen into the same turn but defensive driving from Magnussen forced Bottas to cut the chicane on lap 31. On the 34th lap, Ricciardo turned right and braked later than Räikkönen for ninth into the Rettifilo chicane.\nHamilton began to pull away from Rosberg, leading his teammate by 4.3 seconds by the start of lap 36. Bottas steered left into the Rettifilo chicane the following lap and Magnussen turned right, causing Bottas to mount a kerb to avoid a collision; Bottas overtook Magnussen. Soon after, the stewards imposed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on Magnussen for putting Bottas off the track in the latter's earlier passing attempt. Button turned right to pass Pérez into the Rettifilo chicane for seventh on lap 39. Pérez then drew alongside Button through the Curva Grande and Variante della Roggia turns. Pérez steered right and was forced wide onto the Curva di Lesmo chicane kerb in passing Button for seventh. On the following lap, Bottas passed Vettel at the Rettifilo chicane for fourth and his teammate Ricciardo overtook Button for seventh at the same turn. Ricciardo caused Pérez to lock his brakes before the Rettifilo chicane and moved lanes to take seventh at the Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 41.\nButton passed Pérez at the second attempt into the Rettifilo chicane but had a slow exit after locking his tyres, allowing Pérez to put Button wide into the Variante della Roggia chicane and reclaim eighth. Ricciardo caught and passed Magnussen on his left at the Rettifilo chicane for six on lap 44 despite locking his tyres and drifting sideways. Ricciardo received a message to chase his teammate Vettel, who defended fifth from Ricciardo into the Rettifilo chicane on lap 47 but was slow leaving the turn. Both drivers were alongside through the Curva Grande corner and Ricciardo turned left to pass Vettel for fifth at the Variante della Roggia chicane. Brake problems caused Gutiérrez to hit Grosjean at the Rettifilo chicane on the 51st lap, puncturing Grosjean's right-rear tyre, who slowly drove into the pit lane.\nKvyat's brakes failed on lap 52, causing him to turn left onto the grass at the Rettifilo chicane to avoid hitting Räikkönen, and clipping a polystyrene marker as he rejoined the track. Hamilton won the race by 3.1 seconds over Rosberg. Massa took his first podium result of the season in third, and his first since the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix. Bottas took fourth, ahead of the Red Bull duo of Ricciardo and Vettel in fifth and sixth. Pérez, Button, Räikkönen and Magnussen rounded out the top ten after his five-second time penalty was applied. Kvyat, Hülkenberg, Vergne, Maldonado and Sutil, Kobayashi and Bianchi, Gutiérrez and Ericsson were the final classified finishers. It was Hamilton's sixth victory of 2014 and the 28th of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Hamilton led twice for a total of 27 laps, more than any other competitor.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium ceremony following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, repeating a similar incident towards him at the previous race in Belgium for a collision with Hamilton, which was the catalyst for their displeasure. Hamilton told the press he felt uncomfortable with the fans behaving in such a manner: \"I've had it here, years and years ago, and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I was up there, it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport.\" Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fans while also saying: \"It's a sport and sport should unite.\" When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was \"not nice\" he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. At the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa said he was happy to finish third and was certain luck was beside him with \"a lot more to come.\"\nIn the hours following the race, conspiracy theories emerged on social media concerning the circumstances of Rosberg losing the lead to Hamilton on lap 29. They suggested the incident was an act of revenge for the collision between Rosberg and Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks prior. Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said he felt the move was \"a bit too easy\" and appeared to indicate the error was done purposely: \"I thought [Rosberg] could have least made an effort to get round the corner. I first thought 'that's wise', because he knew it wasn't a difficult thing to believe; the second time I thought: 'Hello, what's going on here?'\" Wolff denied allegations the mistake was deliberate, suggesting Rosberg was under pressure because of the championship battle but admitted it was uncommon for Rosberg to run wide twice: \"Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea.\" Rosberg said Hamilton's fast pace prompted him to push hard and that there was a large probability of flat-spotting a tyre and driving onto the run-off area was the safer option. He stated he learnt about the theory and affirmed there was \"no possible reason\" for him to purposely drive off the circuit. Television pictures apparently showed Wolff smiling moments after Rosberg's error. Wolff said the broadcast was not live and that the transmission of pit-to-car radio before Rosberg's mistake about him asking Hamilton to slow to preserve his tyres for a late race attack was inaccurate.\nThe stewards deemed Gutiérrez responsible for hitting Grosjean and imposed a 20-second time penalty on him although they accepted he had brake problems. Gutiérrez said his brake problems had manifested in \"an inconsistency that sometimes you cannot predict\" and the contact with Grosjean was \"an unfortunate moment.\" Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn deemed the incident \"unnecessary\" and Grosjean said he was unsure as to what happened with Gutiérrez. Williams performance chief Rob Smedley said the team were investigating Bottas' slow start that lost him positions, which it believed it to be clutch-related problem. Bottas stated he felt he was too assertive with his clutch and his race was hindered by a lack of acceleration leaving the chicane: \"The start on the formation lap – when we always do the final checks – was a bit compromised because Lewis had a slow getaway, so that maybe hurt a little bit. But definitely the tyres were not in the optimum window.\"\nAlonso was convinced he could have finished fifth had he not retired, saying he felt quicker than Ricciardo and revealed his team changed their approach, prompting him to slow after his problem emerged. He stated the remainder of the season was \"not going to be too different\" after a strenuous campaign in the past 12 rounds but that Ferrari was prepared: \"It is the way at the moment but we cannot do anymore than this.\" Bottas said Magnussen's driving was \"on the limit\" but was unsure whether the latter deserved a penalty. Magnussen was \"frustrated\" upon receiving his second consecutive time-penalty and stated he would review the incident and carry over lessons into the season's next race. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom disagreed with the stewards decision, Smedley felt the penalty was justified. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner praised Ricciardo's overtakes and called it a strength of his: \"For somebody that had a question mark over his overtaking coming into the year, he [has shown it] is right up there with the best.\"\nThe result saw Hamilton lower Rosberg's lead in the Drivers' Championship to 22 points, with Ricciardo remaining in third place on 166 points. By finishing fourth Bottas passed the non-finishing Alonso for fourth and the latter fell to fifth. Mercedes further extended their advantage in the Constructors' Championship to lead the second-placed Red Bull by 182 points. Williams overtook Ferrari to move into third place and McLaren were with 110 points with six races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.\nNotes:"

        "text": "The 2014 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2014) was a Formula One motor race held on 25 May at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo. It was the sixth race of the 2014 Formula One World Championship and the 61st Monaco Grand Prix as part of the series. Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg won the 78-lap race from pole position. His teammate Lewis Hamilton finished second and Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo was third. It was Rosberg's second victory of the season and the fifth of his career.\nRosberg won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying under controversial circumstances and maintained the lead at the start. The race was neutralised on the first lap with the safety car following an accident between Sergio Pérez and Jenson Button, and when it was restarted Rosberg kept the lead. Adrian Sutil further caused disruption when he crashed his Sauber car on lap 24 and Rosberg kept the lead after the field made pit stops. He maintained a varying advantage over Hamilton as the two pulled away from other drivers. Rosberg was instructed to conserve fuel while Hamilton was told he did not need to do so. Hamilton later got dirt in his eye in the final laps, allowing Rosberg to pull away and win the race.\nThe result saw Rosberg regain the lead of the Drivers' Championship by four points over Hamilton. Fernando Alonso remained in third while Ricciardo's third-place finish moved him past teammate Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes further increased their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 141 points ahead of Red Bull while Ferrari maintained third position. Force India kept fourth and McLaren overtook Williams for fifth with 13 races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 Monaco Grand Prix was the sixth of the 19 rounds in the 2014 Formula One World Championship, and the 61st running of the race as part of the series. It was held on 25 May 2014 at the 19-turn Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo. It was officially called the \"Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2014.\" Tyre supplier Pirelli brought the red-banded super soft and yellow-banded soft dry compound tyres to the race. The drag reduction system (DRS) had one activation zone for the race which was on the straight linking the final and first turns. For the Grand Prix, a total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entered two race drivers each.\nBefore the race Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 100 points, ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg in second and Fernando Alonso in third. Sebastian Vettel was fourth on 45 points, seven ahead of teammate Daniel Ricciardo in fifth. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 197 points, and Red Bull were second on 84 points. Ferrari (66 points) and Force India (57) were third and fourth and Williams were fifth on 46 points.\nThe tension between the two Mercedes teammates was high before the weekend when Hamilton was found to have altered his car settings in the final laps of the , using a forbidden higher-powered engine setting to keep Rosberg behind. Rosberg was found to have done the same while battling Hamilton at the end of the . Despite losing the lead of the Drivers' Championship to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the title but expected it to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid car would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well and wanted Ferrari and Red Bull to battle him for the victory.\nThe circuit was altered following the 2013 race. The track was resurfaced from the exit of Casino corner until the entry to the tunnel with small areas before the Novelle chicane and Tabac undergoing a similar change. The pit lane barrier and the debris fencing was renewed and the turn 12 TecPro energy absorbing barrier was made more efficiently constrained. Work on the track was carried out at night to minimise roadside traffic disruption. Jenson Button for McLaren predicted the changes would create a situation similar to the 2012 United States Grand Prix where grip was low and felt the soft compound tyres would be difficult to get working properly. Pérez said the experience around Monaco would be \"difficult\" but that \"It will be a new Monaco – very, very interesting\". Alonso stated the event would be \"a question mark for everybody\" and that Formula One needed to see the team that would adapt their car better for Monaco.\nPractice.\nThere were three practice sessions held before the race on Sunday, two 90-minute practice sessions on Thursday and a third one-hour session on Saturday. Hamilton was fastest in the first practice session, which took place in dry weather, with a lap of 1 minute, 18.271 seconds, 0.032 seconds faster than teammate Rosberg in second. The two Red Bull cars were third and fifth with Ricciardo ahead of Vettel; they were separated by Alonso's Ferrari. Ricciardo was set to go faster but slower traffic delayed him. Kimi Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas, Sergio Pérez, Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Max Chilton stranded his Marussia after spinning at Mirabeau corner early in the session, ending his session early. Esteban Gutiérrez went straight on at Sainte Dévote corner. Alonso locked his left front tyre at Mirabeau corner but avoided damaging his car. His teammate Räikkönen spun at Sainte Dévote corner but continued.\nClouds moved into Monaco in the first session and a heavy hailstorm fell but ended before the second session began. The track was saturated with water and teams opted to keep their drivers in their garages for 45 minutes. Drivers first drove on the intermediate tyres although the surface dried quickly. They used dry slick tyres in the final ten minutes which saw Alonso lap fastest with at 1 minute, 18.482 seconds, keeping Hamilton fastest overall for Thursday. Alonso was four-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton in second. Vettel, Jean-Éric Vergne. Bottas, Pérez, Hülkenberg, Button, Ricciardo and Felipe Massa followed in the top ten. Marcus Ericsson hit the barriers leaving Portier corner but reversed away from the area and drove his damaged car to the pit lane.\nAfter taking Friday off—a feature unique to the Monaco Grand Prix— the drivers returned to action on Saturday in clear weather. All of the leading drivers had trouble getting clear air as they fought for clear space around the narrow circuit which had been made worse by them taking longer than usual to get optimum tyre temperature. Despite Hamilton having difficulties with his car's handling and narrowly avoiding an accident at Tabac corner, he set the fastest lap of the weekend so far of 1 minute, 16.758 seconds, a tenth of a second quicker than Ricciardo in second. Rosberg, Vettel, Alonso, Räikkönen, Pérez, Hülkenberg, Vergne and Daniil Kvyat were third through tenth. Vergne ran off the track at Sainte Dévote and Mirabeau corners. Ericsson went onto the Dévote run-off area and reversed to rejoin the track.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify. The second session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part lasted 12 minutes and determined pole position to tenth. Cars who progressed to the final session were not allowed to change tyres for the race's start, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times in the second session. After the final session's first runs, Rosberg had provisional pole position with a lap of 1 minute, 15.989 seconds, 0.039 seconds faster than Hamilton. During his second and final quick lap, Rosberg locked his tyres, ran deep at Mirabeau corner and had to abort his lap, before reversing back onto the track. The resulting yellow flags forced Hamilton to slow, ruining his final qualifying lap (after he had set a personal best first sector), and stopped him from challenging Rosberg's earlier time. After qualifying, the stewards investigated Rosberg under suspicion of deliberately spoiling Hamilton's lap. The stewards examined video evidence and telemetry data from Mercedes, and racing governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Rosberg. It was Rosberg's second pole position of 2014 and the sixth of his career.\nRicciardo qualified third; he could not improve his fastest time after sliding on his final timed lap. His teammate Vettel lost the use of his energy recovery system in the first session; he ran in a different mode and the yellow flags left him fourth. The Ferrari duo of Alonso and Räikkönen were fifth and sixth; both had tyre warming problems. Although the yellow flags affected Vergne's final lap, he took seventh and his teammate Kvyat ninth after struggling with rear control and hit a barrier. He drove to the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. They were separated by Magnussen in eighth and Pérez was tenth after locking his tyres into the Novelle chicane. Hülkenberg in 11th was the fastest driver not to qualify for the final session. A Toro Rosso car delayed Button in 12th on his final lap at the Swimming Pool complex. Front tyre heating problems put Bottas 13th. Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado in the two Lotus cars took 14th and 15th with Massa unable to record a lap time. Ericsson locked his rear tyres going into Mirabeau corner and glanced Massa's car heading into the turn, causing both drivers to hit the barriers. The stewards investigated the incident and Ericsson incurred two penalty points on his super licence and was required to start from the pit lane. Gutiérrez failed to progress beyond the first session, and was followed by Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil. Jules Bianchi, 19th, lost a second in slower traffic and yellow flags. He received a five-place grid penalty, because his team changed a problematic gearbox overnight. Hence, his Marussia teammate Chilton began 19th. Kamui Kobayashi in 20th used super soft compound tyres on his first two timed laps and adjusted his front wing but could not improve.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold .\nRace.\nThe weather at the start was dry and overcast with an air temperature between and a track temperature ranging from . A 20 percent chance of rain was forecast. Rosberg's hand clutch was replaced when the one he used in qualifying burned out following his error at Mirabeau corner. After the problems with his car in qualifying, Red Bull changed parts of Vettel's energy recovery system. He did not incur a penalty but was not allowed to use the parts again until the . Maldonado was unable to take the start because of a fuel pump failure on the grid. When the race began at 14:00 Central European Summer Time (), Rosberg led the field into the first corner with teammate Hamilton in second. Vettel remained in third while Räikkönen moved from sixth to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo and Alonso who had been boxed in by Ricciardo. After hitting Button, Pérez spun leaving Mirabeau corner, and his car's suspension was damaged, and had further contact with Sutil, ending his race. The incident blocked the track and forced drivers to slow to allow them to pass Pérez's stranded car.\nThe safety car was deployed to allow marshals to move Pérez's car onto the run-off area. Grosjean's tyre was punctured from contact by Sutil and both drivers made pit stops. Swift work from the marshals allowed the safety car to be withdrawn at the end of the third lap and Rosberg led. A mechanical problem stopped Vettel's turbocharger and the rest of the field overtook him. He made a pit stop and emerged among the leaders and complained he was stuck in first gear. Both Mercedes drivers pulled away from the rest of the field, and Hamilton was six-tenths of a second behind Rosberg by being faster. Vettel's turbocharger restarted on lap six but Red Bull instructed him to retire on the following lap. The stewards investigated the first lap incident between Pérez and Button. An exhaust issue forced Kvyat to retire in the pit lane on lap 11.\nAs drivers struggled to keep heat in their tyres, the time deficit between Rosberg and Hamilton varied but held a larger lead over the rest of the field. Rosberg locked his tyres into Mirabeau corner but avoided driving onto the turn's escape road on lap 18. Soon after, the stewards imposed five-second stop-and-go penalties on Chilton, Ericsson and Gutiérrez for being out of position on the grid. Hamilton began to lap faster than teammate Rosberg before the latter responded by going two-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton to extend his lead. Ricciardo closed to within 1.1 seconds of Räikkönen by lap 22 by going one second faster than Räikkönen. Cresting a rise leaving the tunnel on lap 24, Sutil's car became light braking from , speared into the inside wall, and slid down the escape road at the Novelle chicane. A marshal ducked under the barrier to avoid debris hitting him. Sutil was unhurt but the safety car was deployed for debris removal.\nEvery driver, except for Massa, elected to make pit stops for new tyres. Hamilton radioed his team on whether he should make a pit stop to which they responded no. He was annoyed, asking why he could not make a pit stop the lap before and fell back from Rosberg to avoid waiting behind his teammate. Vergne was released directly in front of Magnussen, causing him to swerve to prevent contact, prompting the stewards to investigate Vergne. On lap 28, Räikkönen had to make a second pit stop for a punctured tyre after Chilton's front wing hit his left-rear wheel at Mirabeau corner. Ricciardo and Alonso took over third and fourth. The safety car entered the pit lane at the end of lap 30 and racing resumed with Rosberg leading Hamilton. As the race restarted, Magnussen passed Vergne into Rasacasse corner but returned it because he had done it before the second safety car line. Hülkenberg aggressively overtook Magnussen on the inside at Portier corner for seventh.\nRäikkönen passed Kobayashi at the Novelle chicane for 12th place on lap 33 but ran wide and gave the position back to Kobayashi. Vergne was imposed a drive-through penalty for his unsafe pit stop release on the following lap and served it four laps later. After Räikkönen passed Kobayashi, Bianchi and Kobayashi made contact three times and Bianchi overtook on the outside at Rasacasse corner for 13th on lap 36. At the front, Rosberg continued to lead Hamilton and the duo pulled away from the rest of the field. Mercedes instructed Rosberg by radio to use longer gears at Sainte Dévote and Casino Square corners as a fuel-saving measure, causing him to defend from Hamilton over the following laps after slowing. Hamilton closed up to Rosberg but was unable to pass his teammate who was faster into the tunnel. Massa made his only pit stop of the race on lap 45 and emerged in 11th place behind Räikkönen but ahead of Bianchi.\nWhile Rosberg was instructed to continue conserving fuel, Hamilton was told by radio that he did not need to do so. Rosberg was reassured that his fuel consumption levels were back on target and began to lap faster than Hamilton. Vergne caught Bianchi and the two made minor contact at the Loews hairpin. Leaving the tunnel, smoke billowed from the rear of Vergne's car but he was able to enter the pit lane and retire on lap 52. Gutiérrez caught Bottas along with, Räikkönen and Massa – who was on new tyres – and Gutiérrez attacked Bottas at the Novelle chicane but Bottas kept eighth by cutting the corner. With smoke billowing from his car on lap 55, Bottas drove to the side of the track at the Loews hairpin to retire. The need for a safety car was avoided when a crane removed his car from the track and yellow flags were waved in the area. Gutiérrez in eighth was on course to score points when he hit the inside guardrail at La Rascasse on lap 59, damaging his car's rear suspension and necessitating his retirement. This promoted Bianchi into tenth, which put him in position to score Marussia's first points in Formula One, but he also had a five-second time penalty for illegally taking his earlier, five-second time penalty under the safety car.\nAfter running closely behind teammate Rosberg and feeling the wind penetrating his visor, Hamilton got some dirt in his left eye on lap 66 and slowed in the circuit's low-speed turns as a result, allowing Ricciardo to close up to him. Hülkenberg had heavily worn rear super soft tyres, and by the 69th lap, was caught by McLaren drivers Button and Magnussen. Bianchi was told that he needed to be five seconds ahead of Grosjean to cancel out the time penalty. Five laps later, Button overtook teammate Magnussen on the main straight for sixth. Räikkönen ran too deep in doing the same on the inside at the Loews hairpin on lap 7, putting himself and Magnussen in the barrier. Both Räikkönen and Magnussen reversed out of the barrier but lost a large amount of time, promoting Bianchi to eighth and Grosjean to ninth. Räikkönen had to make a third pit stop for a new front wing and the super soft tyres.\nRosberg opened the gap to 8.8 seconds, and won the 78-lap race. Hamilton finished second, 9.2 seconds behind and held off the hard-charging Ricciardo at the start/finish line. Alonso took fourth, Hülkenberg fifth and Button sixth. He was followed by Massa in seventh, Grosjean eighth, Bianchi was ninth after his five-second time penalty was applied and Magnussen tenth. Ericsson missed out on scoring Caterham's first points in 11th, and Räikkönen, Kobayashi and Chilton were the final classified finishers. Rosberg's victory was his second of the season and the fifth of his career. The Mercedes team continued their dominance of the season with their fifth consecutive one-two finish. Rosberg led every lap from pole position but was denied his first career Grand Slam when Räikkönen set the race's fastest lap of 1 minute, 18.479 seconds on lap 75.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Rosberg described the day as \"very, very special\" and praised his car and team. Hamilton said that despite the eye problem it was \"a good day\" and \"really good\" Mercedes finished first and second. Ricciardo stated it was \"really nice\" to stand on the podium in Monaco and third was the best result his team could achieve. In the subsequent press conference, Rosberg said the victory was more \"special\" because Hamilton had pre-race momentum and was unsurprised he was not called into the pit lane following Sutil's crash. Hamilton said he remained in a particular engine mode and was certain the battle with his teammate Rosberg would continue until later in the season. When asked if Red Bull would have the pace to challenge Mercedes, Ricciardo replied he felt the team closed slightly in Monaco and the circuit favoured the car slightly better than at other tracks.\nBianchi's ninth-place finish earned him and Marussia's first career points since the team entered Formula One as Virgin Racing in . He told \"Sky Sports F1\" that Marussia had been awaiting a long time for the result and was \"so proud\" for his team, saying: \"They did a really good job and I am really happy to give them the result.\" Marussia team principal John Booth was delighted at Bianchi's overtake on Kobayashi, describing it as \"stunning\", and despite the five-second time penalty, his team were \"absolutely over the moon\" with the achievement. Graeme Lowdon, Marussia chief executive officer, was pleased at the sign of progress, saying: \"It is tough and I would be lying if I didn't reflect that\", and the result was a \"direct reward for people who have worked very hard.\" Alonso said of Bianchi: \"I am extremely happy for him, [and] very proud for what this result will mean for his career. I have no doubts it will be a good career, but hopefully with this result he can have a more competitive car next year and show his talents even more.\" Former driver Allan McNish wrote in his \"BBC F1\" column the result was like \"a Grand Prix victory\" for Marussia and called it \"a deserved reward for their dogged determination and never-say-die attitude.\" Following Bianchi's death from severe head injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, Will Dale of \"Fox Sports Australia\" wrote: \"Monaco 2014 will be remembered as his day in the sun, the high watermark of a career — a life — ended far too soon.\"\nTensions at Mercedes increased following qualifying in which Hamilton felt Rosberg had deliberately driven off the track in a bid to stop him taking pole position, which strained their relationship. Hamilton refused to accept Rosberg's apology for the incident and the two did not communicate with each other on the podium. Mercedes' non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, upset over the incident, said he disliked the lack of communication between the two drivers on the podium and that he would talk to them before Canada. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, said the incident between Rosberg and Hamilton would not be allowed to reoccur in the future and that the drivers would be given autonomy as long as they did nothing deceitfully. Hamilton said he had no answer and was surprised on how quickly the situation escalated. After Hamilton spoke with Rosberg, he posted a picture on Twitter with him and Rosberg in their youth to ease anxiety over their relationship, saying: \"We've been friends a long time, and as friends we have our ups and downs. Today we spoke and we're cool, still friends, no problem.\" FIA race director Charlie Whiting suggested that qualifying be extended by one minute to give drivers affected by yellow flags another attempt at a timed lap to prevent similar incidents from happening again.\nThe stewards reprimanded Räikkönen for his late race contact with Magnussen but took no action on the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen argued that Räikkönen was to blame for the incident, saying that he drove defensively, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he did not expect Button to be there because of a lack of space for another car. Button did not comment on the crash. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner opined that Vettel would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him after his turbocharger problem, and said Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the final laps was an indication that the team's approach was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless there was an error.\nThe result saw Rosberg retake the Drivers' Championship lead with 122 points, four ahead of Hamilton. Alonso maintained third position on 61 points, while Ricciardo's third-place finish moved him seven points clear of Hülkenberg in fifth. Mercedes's one-two finish further increased their advantage at the top of the Constructors' Championship to 141 points ahead of second-placed Red Bull. Ferrari remained in third place with 78 points. Force India likewise kept fourth and McLaren passed Williams for fifth with thirteen races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.\n – Jules Bianchi had five seconds added to his race time for taking a penalty under the safety car, and he dropped from eighth to ninth."

        "title": "2014 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2014 Singapore Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 21 September at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. It was the 14th round of the 2014 Formula One World Championship and the 7th Singapore Grand Prix held as part of the series. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the 60-lap race from pole position. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo were second and third. It was Hamilton's seventh victory of the season and the 29th of his career.\nHamilton won the pole position by posting the fastest lap time in qualifying and maintained the lead into the first corner. His teammate Nico Rosberg had a wiring loom steering problem and began from the pit lane. Hamilton remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops before ceding it to Ricciardo for one lap in the second pit stop phase. In the final laps, Hamilton made his final pit stop to switch tyres and rejoined just ahead of Ricciardo. Vettel led for one lap until Hamilton passed him on lap 54 to win. There were four lead changes among three different drivers during the course of the race.\nThe result returned Hamilton to the lead of the World Drivers' Championship with 241 points, three ahead of teammate Rosberg who retired after 14 laps after his problem could not be rectified. Ricciardo maintained third place, with Fernando Alonso and Vettel passing the non-scoring Valtteri Bottas to move into fourth and fifth. Mercedes further extended their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 182 points over Red Bull in second. Williams and Ferrari maintained third and fourth and Force India overtook McLaren for fifth with five races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 Singapore Grand Prix was the 14th of the 19 rounds in the 2014 Formula One World Championship, and the seventh Formula One Singapore race. It was held on 21 September at the 23-turn Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay. The official name was the \"2014 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix\", and was scheduled to last 61 laps. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought the red-banded super-soft \"options\" and yellow-marked soft \"primes\" dry tyre compounds to the race. There were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) fielding two race drivers for the Grand Prix.\nThe drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; one was from turns five and seven, and the second was on the start/finish straight from the final to first corners. Parts of the track parts of the circuit were resurfaced with a mandatory track jet sweeper used to ensure the grip on the new asphalt equalled that from the old surface following the 2013 race. The outside turn seven barrier on the run-off area was realigned to allow traffic to drive behind it and the pit lane's fast section was resurfaced.\nBefore the race Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg led the Drivers' Championship with 238 points, 22 ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton in second. Daniel Ricciardo was a further 50 points behind in third place. Valtteri Bottas was fourth on 122 points, one ahead of Fernando Alonso in fifth. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 454 points, and Red Bull were second on 272 points. Williams in third had 172 points, Ferrari in fourth had 162 and McLaren were fifth with 110 points.\nAt the previous race in Italy, the gap between Rosberg and Hamilton closed to seven points. Hamilton started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but a poor start dropped him to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained in the lead for the rest of the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton said he was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship and was pleased to have improved after winning at Monza: \"Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races – starting in Singapore.\" Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but was unconcerned about it and focused on himself: \"At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win,\" Ricciardo stated that while he was aware he had an unrealistic chance of winning the championship, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win one of the next two races to draw closer in the title battle: \"All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens.\"\nIn the weeks before the race, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA; Formula One's governing body) race director Charlie Whiting, introduced a ban on certain pit-to-car communications, with a particular emphasis on banning driver \"coaching\"—such as describing their sector times relative to another competitor—under the sporting regulations stating a driver must drive the car \"alone and unaided\". Additionally, in the week of the race, the FIA banned teams from sending drivers coded messages either by radio or pit board, and decided that at the following round in Japan, they would be prohibited from sending information concerning tyres and brake wear. After team principals raised concerns about the extent of the ban three days before the race, the FIA revised what teams could tell their drivers by radio, including car performance and safety concerns. After persistent media speculation about his future at Caterham, the team confirmed that Kamui Kobayashi would enter the race.\nPractice.\nThere were three evening practice sessions—two 90-minute sessions on Friday and a single 60-minute session on Saturday—preceding Sunday's race. In the first practice session, Alonso lapped fastest at 1 minute, 49.056 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than Hamilton in second. Rosberg, Vettel, Ricciardo, Jean-Éric Vergne, Kimi Räikkönen, Jenson Button, Daniil Kvyat and Sergio Pérez were in positions two through ten. Although several drivers narrowly avoided damaging their cars, the session passed relatively smoothly. Vergne's battery was changed, causing him to miss the first hour. After setting his fastest lap, he stopped with an energy recovery system failure, ending his session early. Räikkonen's session also ended early with brake fire. Vettel stopped at the pit lane exit with a sudden loss in oil pressure; he avoided a ten-place grid penalty because he used an older engine.\nHamilton, who had brake vibrations, set the day's fastest lap of 1 minute, 47.490 seconds on the super soft compound tyres in the second practice session; Alonso, Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Vettel, the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Button, Pérez, Nico Hülkenberg and Kvyat followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted halfway through when Pastor Maldonado overdrove through turn 10, lost control of his car's rear, and slid into the right-hand exit barriers, damaging his vehicle's front-right hand corner. After the session, Lotus constructed a new E22 chassis overnight for Maldonado for the remainder of the event. In the final practice session, held in cloudy weather, Alonso set the fastest lap of the weekend so far at 1 minute, 47.299 seconds, 0.051 seconds faster than Ricciardo in second. Rosberg was third after a slow first third of the lap and went over the turn 11 kerbs. Vergne, Vettel, Hamilton, Felipe Massa, Bottas, Räikkönen and Esteban Gutiérrez completed the top ten.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first session ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify. The second part lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final session ran for 12 minutes determined pole position to tenth. Cars in the final session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times in the second session. Although Hamilton lost two-tenths of a second locking his tyres entering turn one and subsequently missing its apex, he set the fastest time in the final session to achieve his sixth pole position of the season, and the 37th of his career with a lap of 1 minute, 45.681 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg, who called it \"the most difficult qualifying of my career so far\" because he had difficulty finding a rhythm and changed his brakes for qualifying. Ricciardo took third and had pole position until both Mercedes drivers went faster in the session's final seconds. He was ahead of teammate Vettel in fourth who believed pole position could have been his after feeling he overdrove. Alonso made a minor set-up change, giving him confidence and qualified fifth. Massa took sixth, ahead of Räikkönen, who was quickest in the first session, and was satisfied with his car's handling, but his engine shut down while preparing for a second timed lap in the final session.\nBottas's preparation for his final timed lap was slightly compromised, and an error in the first turn left him eighth. Magnussen took ninth and Kvyat was tenth after only having the super soft compound tyre available. Button was the fastest driver not to qualify for the final session; he locked his front tyres at the turn 13 hairpin on his final timed lap and went wide, losing him time, and struggled with front grip despite a change of engine and differential settings. Vergne had front grip issues, and locked his tyres, putting him 12th. Force India's Hülkenberg and Pérez qualified 13th and 15th respectively after being unable to improve on their second attempts; Gutiérrez's faster Sauber car separated them. Romain Grosjean was the slowest driver in the second session; a turbocharger wastegate problem slowed him and he radioed his frustration to Lotus after being eliminated. Adrian Sutil failed to advance beyond the first session due to energy management and engine problems. Maldonado had the same turbocharger issue as his teammate and qualified 18th. Minor errors on Jules Bianchi's first timed lap left him 19th. Bianchi was ahead of Kamui Kobayashi in 20th. Max Chilton, 21st, could not extract full engine power on his first attempt because of mapping problems and had to prepare for another lap. Marcus Ericsson ventured onto the track late in the first session after his team worked quickly to rectify an electrical issue and qualified 22nd.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions are denoted in bold.\nRace.\nThe weather at the start was dry and clear, with the air temperature between and a track temperature from . All drivers started on the super soft compound tyre. Rosberg's car had a faulty steering wheel control due to a wiring loom problem. Although he made the starting grid after a steering wheel change and computer reset, the problem persisted and he began from the pit lane. Kobayashi's car developed an oil pressure issue on the formation lap and pulled off the circuit, preventing him from starting. When the race began at 20:00 Singapore Standard Time (), Hamilton led the field into the first corner. Ricciardo's engine briefly lost power, preventing him from passing teammate Vettel. Alonso attempted to pass the Red Bull cars to their right but entered turn one too quickly, locked his front-left tyre, and drove onto the run-off area, falling to third.\nMagnussen passed Massa for sixth outside of track limits at turn five, but slid sideways at turn seven while holding off teammate Button, dropping to ninth. Button gained four positions by the end of the first lap, while Rosberg fell to 22nd over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Hamilton led Vettel, Alonso, Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Massa, Button, Bottas, Magnussen and Kvyat. The stewards investigated Alonso's start but took no further action. Rosberg left the pit lane on the second lap but was initially unable to keep up with Chilton's Marussia. DRS was enabled on the third lap as the field spread out. The stewards investigated Magnussen for violating track limits. McLaren teammates Magnussen and Button avoided a collision on lap four and the Williams duo passed them. Vettel kept Hamilton's lead constant, causing the latter to go faster by a second while conserving fuel.\nRosberg overtook Chilton to move into 20th on lap five, while Kvyat was told by radio to battle Magnussen after lapping 0.3 seconds faster than Magnussen in the first sector on the next lap. Rosberg could not pass Ericsson and was more than 40 seconds behind Hamilton by that lap. It was announced on lap seven that there would be no further action against Magnussen. Magnussen, Kvyat and Vergne were within one second of each other and battled for ninth place. Vergne encouraged his teammate Kvyat to cede a position to him but Kvyat insisted he could pass Magnussen. Vergne overtook teammate Kvyat for tenth on lap eight and began gaining on Magnussen. Rosberg was limited to two gears and was five seconds slower than teammate Hamilton. Hamilton led by five seconds by the start of lap ten despite car balance problems over a single lap. Massa ran close behind Räikkönen until his first pit stop at the end of the lap as part of the Williams' team plan to pass the latter through strategy. Räikkönen made his stop on the following lap and emerged behind Massa.\nBottas entered the pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo stopping on the next lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and retained it, narrowly in front of Button. Rosberg was informed by radio that he could not go past 6,500 revolutions per minute in first gear because of a faulty pit lane limiter. He slowly entered the pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched Rosberg's car off and he selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel to try and change gear. After almost two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed into his garage to be retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap. Vergne incurred a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the following lap after he was deemed to have exceeded track limits. On lap 19 Gutiérrez retired in his garage with an engine electrical problem. Two laps later, Chilton made an unscheduled pit stop after a wheel value punctured his front-right tyre.\nOn lap 23, Räikkönen drew closer to Massa and the Williams team responded by bringing the latter into the pit lane for soft compound tyres for a potential strategic overtake. He rejoined in ninth behind teammate Bottas. Hamilton pulled away from Vettel who was caught by Alonso. By the 24th lap, Alonso had the potential to pass Vettel after the pit stops. That lap, Ferrari brought Alonso into the pit lane for super soft compound tyres. Vettel made his pit stop on lap 25 for soft compound tyres and emerged in third behind Alonso's faster Ferrari. Massa overtook Hülkenberg on the main straight for eighth on the same lap. Hamilton made his stop for super soft compound tyres on the following lap, giving the lead to Ricciardo; his team used a large time gap to remove rubber debris on his front wing. Ricciardo took his pit stop on lap 27 returning the lead to Hamilton. Grosjean was close behind Pérez but he could not pass him. Pérez attempted an overtake Sutil on the straight on the 30th lap, and Sutil squeezed Pérez into a wall, clipping the left-front nose cone section. It slid under Pérez's wheel, littering the track with debris, and prompting the safety car's deployment, to allow marshals to remove debris from the track.\nSome drivers elected to make pit stops to switch onto the soft compound tyres; Ferrari brought their drivers in to enable them to reach the end of the race without the need for another pit stop. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington cautioned him about the debris but Hamilton did not receive the warning in time and drove over shards of wing. He inquired about tyre pressures and was told no issues had been discovered. Sutil incurred a five-second stop-and-go penalty for the collision with Pérez. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of the 37th lap and racing resumed with Hamilton in first. Hamilton set the race's fastest lap of 1 minute and 50.417 seconds on lap 39 to lead Vettel by 5.8 seconds. Sutil's car developed a water leak and retired two laps later to prevent the risk of an engine failure.\nHamilton led Vettel by 24 seconds by the next lap and wanted to make a pit stop because he was worried about tyre wear but was advised to further grow his advantage over the next three laps. Hamilton made his final pit stop for the soft compound tyres on lap 52. He rejoined in second behind Vettel and narrowly ahead of Ricciardo. Hamilton quickly caught Vettel, used DRS leaving turn five, and turned right to reclaim the lead two corners later on lap 54. Button stopped at the side of the track to retire with a power box failure on the same lap. His retirement promoted Räikkönen to seventh and Bottas' worn tyres slowed him, enabling Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez to run close behind him. Maldonado's aspiration for his first point of 2014 was not realised when Magnussen passed him for tenth place on lap 56. Three laps later, Vergne passed Hülkenberg for eighth place. Vergne overtook Räikkönen for seventh on the left into the first corner and then Bottas for sixth. Pérez had better traction than teammate Hülkenberg and passed him between turns 17 and 18.\nPérez passed Räikkönen into turn 10 and took seventh when Bottas lost all tyre grip and fell from the top ten quickly. Because of the safety car period, the race ended under a two-hour time limit. In the remaining eight laps, Hamilton distanced himself from Vettel and was the first to finish after 60 laps for his seventh victory of the season and the 29th of his career. Vettel finished second in his best result of the season, 13.534 seconds behind, and successfully held off teammate Ricciardo and Alonso in the final laps. Massa finished fifth. Vergne's five-second time penalty did not affect his sixth-place finish. Pérez, Räikkönen, Hülkenberg and Magnussen were seventh through tenth. Bottas, Maldonado, Grosjean, Kvyat and Ericsson, Bianchi and Chilton were the final finishers. There were four lead changes in the race; three drivers reached the front of the field. Hamilton led three times for a total of 58 laps, more than any other driver.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Hamilton said he did not feel any pressure at his final pit stop because he felt comfortable with his large lead. Vettel said his team altered their strategy before the safety car and the final laps on worn tyres were \"very, very much borderline\" and emphasised the challenge of the track in hot and humid weather. Ricciardo said the event felt like a \"home race\" and that he would watch Alonso's first lap to see whether he should have ceded another position to Vettel. In the later press conference, Hamilton felt the race would have been \"hardcore\" had Rosberg not retired and knew Mercedes would not be \"100 percent happy\" because they aspired to secure victories collectively and be the series' most dominant team. Vettel revealed how uncomfortable he felt that he could not reach the end of the race on worn tyres but stated second was the best possible result for Red Bull. Ricciardo was satisfied to pressure his teammate Vettel but felt it was a processional event for the top three.\nRosberg called his race \"the toughest of the year\" and deemed it worse than the where he retired with a gearbox failure. He stated that his car's reliability needed the most attention and wanted to understand the problem: \"It’s tough not even leaving the grid. I was hoping the team could fix it [after the race had started] because it was going on and off, sometimes working, sometimes not. There's no point in shouting, it's a reliability issue, and it's happened again.\" Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff apologised to Rosberg immediately following the driver's retirement, saying it was \"a bitter moment\" to lose ground in the Drivers' Championship. He stated he did not want to see the championship decided on reliability and Mercedes needed to discover the origin of their problems. The team's technical director Paddy Lowe added reliability concerns worried him throughout the season and hoped it would not be repeated in the future.\nPost-race, trainer Antti Vierula treated Magnussen for dehydration and minor burns on his lower back with an iced towel and McLaren sought a doctor who tended to Magnussen in its hospitality building. His condition was caused by a broken radiator seal possibly loosened after mounting the turn seven kerbs early in the race, causing hot air to be directed into his cockpit, warming his seat and drinks bottle. He found the water in his drink bottle very hot to consume and radioed his team it burned his mouth. Magnussen raised his arms out of the cockpit to direct cool air down his sleeves and onto his back to alleviate the pain. He called his tenth-place finish \"the hardest-earnt point I've ever had\" and the McLaren team principal Éric Boullier said his performance under the circumstances was a \"scant consolidation\" and praised Magnussen for being \"indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit\". Magnussen posted on Twitter reports of his condition were exaggerated and said he felt \"just hot and sweaty.\" Kvyat also suffered from dehydration when his water supply malfunctioned after race distance.\nAlonso said he believed the timing of the safety car and not a strategy error prevented him from finishing on the podium: \"The moment of the safety car was probably not good, but sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't help. Today it didn't help.\" Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci defended his team's strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented them from finishing on the podium: \"Definitely the safety car didn't do any better for us, but the race is made of 60 laps. We squeezed the car as much as we could; the strategy from the pits was excellent. There were other variables we know we cannot control. We did our best.\" Boullier suggested Red Bull used coded messages to assist Ricciardo when they told Ricciardo to stay off the kerbs but stressed it was the FIA's task to investigate. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner asked Whiting for clarification because Ricciardo had battery damage from mounting the kerbs. The governing body confirmed it was satisfied with Red Bull's radio messages and said the team abided by the rules.\nThe result regained Hamilton the lead of the World Drivers' Championship with 241 points. Rosberg's retirement dropped him to second, three points behind Hamilton. Ricciardo consolidated third place with 181 points, and Alonso and Vettel moved ahead of Bottas for fourth and fifth. Mercedes further extended their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to 182 points over of Red Bull in second place. Williams and Ferrari remained in third and fourth places and Force India moved in front of McLaren to move into fifth position with five races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.\nNotes:"

        "text": "Dale Steyn, a South African cricketer, has taken 29 five-wicket hauls in international cricket. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 42 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm fast bowler, Steyn reached 300 Test wickets in fewer matches than any other South African bowler. He was named the ICC's Test Player of the Year in 2008, and the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" named him one of their cricketers of the year in 2013.\nSteyn made his Test debut in 2004 against England at the St George's Oval, Port Elizabeth. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 2006, against New Zealand at the SuperSport Park, Centurion. In November 2007 against the same team at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He has repeated this feat twice more: against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2008, and Pakistan at the Wanderers Stadium in 2013. Steyn's career-best figures for an innings are 7 wickets for 51 runs against India at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, Nagpur, in February 2010. He has taken ten or more wickets in a match on five occasions. As of 2015, he has taken the most number five-wicket hauls for South Africa.\nSteyn made his One Day International (ODI) debut for the African XI in the first match of the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup, against the Asian XI at the SuperSport Park, Centurion. His first ODI five-wicket haul came during the 2011 Cricket World Cup, against India, a match which South Africa won at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium. His career-best bowling in ODI cricket is 6 wickets for 39 runs against Pakistan at the St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, in November 2013.\nMaking his first Twenty20 International (T20I) appearance in 2006, Steyn has yet to take a five-wicket haul in the format. His best performance in T20I is 4 wickets for 9 runs, against the West Indies at the St George's Oval, in December 2007. As of 2015, he is joint eighth—with Harbhajan Singh—overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

It has hosted numerous MGA Championships and a few MN section PGA Championships in 1954 and 2000.\nHistory.\nIn 1883 James J. Hill, known to be The Empire Builder, purchased a 3,070-acre piece of land from Charles D. Gilfillan. This piece of land Hill named the North Oaks Farm. When Hill passed on, his son, Louis W. Hill inherited much of the land. From here the Hill heirs took over and maintained the land. Fast forwarding to 1950, more land was bought and the planning process began. Stanley Thompson began work on designing the course. It officially opened in the summer 1951. Shortly before it had opened, a “hurricane” hit. The storm caused two holes to be flooded. North Oaks Golf Club became an official private golf club in 1953. The term and process called a shotgun start, was first used at North Oaks Golf Club. Although it was incorrectly credited three years later to a course in Washington. Fast-forwarding even more to the year 2007, Lehman Design Group renovated the course. They fixed particular issues while mostly sticking to Thompson's original design."

They remain the only 11 seed to beat the 1, 2, and 3 seeds in their region in the same tournament.\nSeason.\nThe team is also remembered for overcoming numerous obstacles during that season. Star forward Jerry Reynolds had left LSU early for the NBA draft. The Tigers originally had two seven-footers and a third player near that height on their roster, but only one was available by the start of the season—6–11 Damon Vance was declared academically ineligible, and 7-1 freshman and future NBA player Tito Horford either left the team or was dismissed, depending on the source. The other seven-footer, Zoran Jovanovich, suffered a season-ending knee injury during the team's Christmas break. Two other players were declared academically ineligible—Dennis Brown, reportedly a solid engineering student, took too few courses in his major and was ruled out for the entire season, and star forward Nikita Wilson failed two courses in the fall semester, ruling him out for the spring semester. As a result of these losses, Ricky Blanton switched positions from guard to center, and team captain Don Redden said at the time that the Tigers had \"gone from an NBA-size team to a big junior high team.\" The team was then hit with a chickenpox outbreak, with star forward John Williams and backup forward Bernard Woodside hospitalized for a week and the team quarantined for several days. LSU was forced to reschedule what was intended to be a nationally televised game against Auburn due to a lack of healthy players, and coach Dale Brown even went so far as to draft football player Chris Carrier as emergency cover.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B; color:#FDD023;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B; color:#FDD023;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B\"| SEC tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Melbourne Bowling Club",
        "text": "The Melbourne Bowling Club, nicknamed the Demons, and affiliated with Bowls Victoria (BV), is the oldest lawn bowling club in Australia. Founded in 1864, the club has been based at Union Street, Windsor, Victoria, Australia on a continuous basis since formation.\nMelbourne's uniform consists of a shirt displaying a Red and white devil, on a blue background, and blue pants/shorts with \"Melbourne\" prominently displayed along their length.\nHistorically the club has had many successes going back to 1892, and since the formation of the Premier League in 1997 Melbourne has won eight premierships having played in 17 grand finals in 21 years.\nThe club also currently fields a team in Divisions 2, 4 and 8 in the Bowls Victoria Saturday Metropolitan Pennant competitions.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nOn 11 March 1864 The Melbourne Bowling Club was founded by John Campbell, obtaining a lease of land at “Chapel” Street (facing Union Street), as recorded as the first entry in the records of the club in the handwriting of John Campbell. The club has continuously occupied this same parcel of land ever since. This record makes Melbourne Bowling Club the oldest bowling club in Australia. By October that year, the bowls greens were in full operation, as was a temporary structure for entertaining, as well as facilities for quoits and croquet.\nIn 1865 a breakaway group formed the Prahran Bowling club, and this remained so until the 1980s, when Prahran’s greens were closed and the members rejoined Melbourne.\nIn 1867, the painter S. T. Gill visited the Melbourne Bowling Club and painted two water-colours of a bowls match in progress, one of the summer green and one of the winter green. The paintings were purchased by members, and were presented to the club as a gift in 1892.\nIn 1887, the original Georgian style double story brick clubhouse was opened, which still stands today. The original building had upper and lower verandas with ornate iron-lace work, which were removed during renovations over the intervening years. Gas lighting was added in later years.\nIn addition to bowls, the club catered for a wide variety of activities during this period, including skittles and tennis. Remnants of the skittles alley were rediscovered in the foundations during renovations in the 1900s.\nDuring this time also saw the formation of the Victorian Bowling Association (1880), and the number of inter-club competitions grew, with the first premiership “pennant” trophy being awarded to Melbourne in 1892\nIn 1899, Melbourne Bowling Club player, Major B.J. Wardill, in England to watch the Australian Cricket team under the captaincy of Joe Darling, met with him and English bowler Mr S.E. Yelland. As a result of the meeting, Major Wardill arranged for the Victorian and NSW Association Presidents, also travelling to England, to meet with Mr Yelland, resulting in the formation of the Imperial Bowling Association, becoming the International Bowling Board, now World Bowls Ltd, the governing body for bowls worldwide.\n1900–1950s.\nThe early 1900s was a successful period for Melbourne Bowling club on the field when it won many championships as a team, as well as numerous members winning state and Australian titles.\nIn the 1920s the club saw a number of extensions built, including a long single storey building added to the side in 1923, and which is still in use today. \nThe club was very fortunate to have a number of patrons, who supported the club in many ways, including R.G. Watson, who left a legacy to the club in the form of the R.G. Watson Trust, and R.G. Watson Trophy tournament, which still runs today to honour his name and contribution.\n1950s–1990s.\nThe 1950s also saw a great deal of on-field success, and the club extended its Windsor site by acquiring surrounding properties with the view to future extensions.\nThe club throughout the 1900s was a hub of social activity as well, with large member gatherings for social as well as bowls based functions. In particular the Thursday member night formal dinners were high sought after events to attend. These events were regularly reported in The Argus, The Malvern Standard and Malvern Times, excerpts of which can be found on the club website today(ref).\n1990s–present.\nNeighbouring houses were incorporated into the clubhouse to provide a gaming room, which has now been converted into a meeting room “The Demons Den”.\nIn 1997, Bowls Victoria (formerly the Royal Victorian Bowls Association) formed the Premier League pennant competition, to represent the highest level of competition in metropolitan Melbourne. Melbourne Bowling Club has been represented in Premier league every year since inception, and to date has appeared in the final x times, winning x times, also capturing 3 State Pennant titles as well. The current player group include a number of region, state and Australian representatives, and the honour boards are testament to success at region, state, national and international levels.\nIn 2014, the club celebrates its 150th anniversary.\nClub symbols and identity.\nUniform.\nOne of the early adopters of coloured uniforms, Melbourne distinctive Blue, Red, and White Uniform features a stylised “M” on the front of the shirt, together with a cartoon style Devil.\nSong.\nThe club song is sung to the tune of “You're a Grand Old Flag”, George Cohen, 1906\nMembership.\nSize.\nClub membership in 2021 is approximately 250, and the club fields teams in 4 competitions in the Bowls Victoria Saturday Pennant Competition, 1 team in the Bowls Victoria Midweek Pennant Competition as well as a team in the Southern District Electric Light Bowls Association.\nDemographics.\nThe club attracts a broad range of members across the metropolitan region. Largely due to the ongoing success of the Premier League side, close to 60% of the membership comes from outside the local Stonnington Council area."

He attended the University of Dayton. In 1971–72 as a 6'0\" guard, the sophomore had an immediate impact on the team, averaging 20.2 points per game with a .442 field goal percentage and an .861 free throw percentage.\nAs a junior, Smith averaged 23.4 points per game (tied for second in UD history) with a .451 field goal percentage and a then-UD record (currently second) .910 free throw percentage (111-for-122). He still holds the Flyers' single-game scoring record; he scored 52 points his junior season against Loyola University Chicago at Chicago Stadium, and he also had a 44-point game that season against Xavier University in which he was 20-for-25 from the field.\nAs a senior in 1973–74, Smith averaged 18.0 points per game but with a career-best .469 field goal percentage and an .888 free throw percentage as the Flyers, after consecutive 13–13 seasons, went 20-9 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen. There, Smith scored 36 points in a memorable triple-overtime, 111–100 loss to the Bill Walton-led UCLA Bruins.\nSmith ended his UD career with the career free throw percentage record of .886.\nSmith was selected in the second round (19th overall) of the 1974 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played for the 76ers for just the 1974–75 season. He played in 54 games, averaging exactly 10 minutes per game, and averaged 5.2 points. His career-high scoring game came on March 8, 1975, with 19 points against the Washington Bullets. And remaining true to his college free throw shooting form, he made every one of his 21 free throw attempts.\nIn 1980, he was inducted into the University of Dayton Hall of Fame.\nSmith had been on dialysis for two years and was on Ohio State University's waiting list for a kidney donor when, after being hospitalized for two weeks with heart problems, he died on March 9, 2004, at age 52. Smith had been seriously injured in an automobile accident several months earlier, and that may have contributed to his death. His wife, Katrina, who was also injured in the accident, survived him.\nIn 2004, Smith was named to the University of Dayton's All-Century Team."

Although the game received poor reviews, it is considered decent in comparison to the other games in the Extreme Sports series, especially Extreme Paintbrawl. The game sold poorly and is now difficult to find for sale. The objective of the game is to climb various rock walls.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Extreme Rock Climbing\", the player may choose from one of several different game modes, including Free Climb, Capture, Solo Climb, and a practice mode. After that, they can choose from one of many different characters to play as. Then, the player chooses a map, and the game begins. The game is played by using the arrow keys to grab onto one of the rocks on the wall. As the game progresses, the character's health goes down slowly. If it depletes entirely, the player will fall off the rock and lose the game. Power-ups called Power Bars are required to win the game, since they restore the player's health. Once the player reaches the top of the wall, the game rewards them with a congratulations screen and returns to the title menu.\nCriticism.\nAlthough it was by no means a good game, IGN gave \"Extreme Rock Climbing\" a 4.5/10, which is much higher than most of the other Extreme games. For example, IGN gave Extreme Paintbrawl a 0.7/10. Allgame.com also reviewed the game, and gave it a poor score of 2.5/5. The game was praised by many reviewers for its impressive visuals, and is better than other Extreme games, but it is nonetheless a poor game."

It was formed in 2012 with six teams, with conference play beginning in February 2013 to compete in Division 1-AA. In 2016, PAC added USC and Stanford and dropped Oregon State, and moved up to D1-A. Despite only recently moving up from D1-AA affiliation, the PAC has historically been one of the strongest conferences in college rugby, with five of its members consistently ranked in the Top 25 overall. The PAC Rugby Conference began play on February 2, 2013, with Cal beating Arizona State at Witter Field in Berkeley.\nHistory of rugby at PAC schools.\nAround the turn of the century, American football was frowned upon for its violence, and President Theodore Roosevelt insisted upon reform or abolition of the game. During this period of uncertainty, rugby made a brief but important reappearance in many colleges, most notably at Cal and Stanford. It was these two Universities that supplied most of the players to the two U.S. Olympic rugby teams that won gold medals at the 1920 Olympics and 1924 Olympics. PAC Rugby was shown on television for the first time in 2014, when the PAC 12 Network broadcast Cal vs UCLA. Cal has long been one of the faces of rugby at the collegiate level. In addition, excellence by teams such as UCLA and Arizona, as well as recent growth by USC, have made the conference one of the toughest in the country.\nPAC Sevens Rugby Tournament.\nThis PAC Sevens Rugby Tournament occurs every fall. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth to the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.\nThe tournament debuted in 2011 where Colorado beat Utah in the final match. In 2012, all 12 of the Pac-12 schools participated for the first time and Cal won. In 2016 the tournament was hosted in Tucson, Arizona for the first time, where it was won by Cal for the fifth straight year."

        "title": "2026 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The 2026 Winter Olympics (), officially the XXV Olympic Winter Games () and also known as Milano-Cortina 2026, is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 6 to 22 February 2026 in the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo. The joint bid from the two cities beat another joint bid from Swedish cities Stockholm–Åre by 47–34 votes at the 134th Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 June 2019.\nThis will be the fourth Olympic Games hosted in Italy, which previously hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo and the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. It will be the first Olympic Games officially featuring multiple host cities and will be the first Winter Olympics since Sarajevo 1984 where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held in different venues. Events will also take place in seven other north-northeastern Italian cities. The games will mark the 20th anniversary of the Winter Olympics in Turin, the 70th anniversary of the Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo and the first time that Milan will host an Olympic Games.\nBidding process.\nHost city selection.\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo were selected as the host cities on 24 June 2019 at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. The three Italian IOC members, Franco Carraro, Ivo Ferriani and Giovanni Malagò, and two Swedish IOC members, Gunilla Lindberg and Stefan Holm, were ineligible to vote as stated in the Olympic Charter.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nSpeed Skating venue selection.\nDuring the bid process, the bidding Committee proposed that the speed skating events could be held at the existing Ice Rink Piné in Baselga di Pinè. However, despite the infrastructure being ready, it required a roof which impact and cost studies indicated would be very expensive, potentially breaking the budget. So instead, the Committee deliberated over three choices: building a temporary or a permanent ice rink in the pavilions of Fiera Milano, options that would require significant structural work, or move the events to the Oval Lingotto in the city of Turin which required no structural changes.The venue was constructed to host the speed skating during the 2006 Winter Olympics and after the games, hosted a variety of events such as exhibitions, fairs and conferences.The venue was also used at 2007 Winter Universiade to host the same sport and also will host the same event in 2025. In April 2023, it was estimated that the temporary ice rink in Fiera Milano would cost nearly €20 million, which would be paid for with private funds. The proposal to use Turin's Oval Lingotto received opposition from Milan-area officials, including Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala and officials from the host regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Fiera Milano was confirmed as the speed skating venue on 19 April 2023.\nConcerns about sliding sports.\nDuring the bidding process, the joint Committee proposed to restore the iconic Eugenio Monti olympic track in Cortina, to be relaunched as a federal centre also for sledding and skeleton. The minimum cost of restoring the closed track was initially estimated at about €14 million, while in the official Milan-Cortina bid dossier the cost indicated was €100 million (similar budget needed to build the Cesana Pariol track used at the 2006 Winter Olympics). After initially forecasting an expenditure of €40-50 million, the Veneto Region allocated funding up to €85 million to build the new Olympic venues. An annual expenditure of €400,000 was also planned for the management of the facility, which would be open four months a year, to be settled through the establishment of €8 million fund. Due to the rising cost of construction materials, the Veneto region president Luca Zaia turned public in February 2023 that the restoring cost for the Eugenio Monti track could be upwards of €120 million. Calling for tenders to award the work, no company came forward with a bid by the 31 July 2023 deadline; even after that, no company interested in carrying out the work could be found, both for economic reasons and because of the difficulty to complete all works before the start of the Olympics. Due to critical issues, costs and prohibitive times for the total renovation of Cortina track, the mayor of Innsbruck, Austria made a proposal for the use of Igls Olympic Sliding Centre. On 16 October 2023 the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) announced that the track will not be rebuilt to host the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, and the sliding events could be held outside of Italy. However, the current Italian government wanted the sliding events to remain in Italy, so they are currently studying the possibility to revamp the Cesana Pariol track which hosted the events at the 2006 Winter Olympics, which has been dormant since 2011. Since then, several construction companies have summited bids to study a potential reconstruction of the Eugenio Monti track. A bid was won to build a new sliding track instead of rebuilding the Eugenio Monti track.\nVenues.\nThe Milano-Cortina 2026 proposal involved many of the competition venues used during the 2013 Winter Universiade (Val di Fiemme), held in the province of Trentino and those infrastructures that were still in use that were also used in the 1956 Winter Olympics also held in Cortina D'Ampezzo. All the ice events with the exception of curling will be held in venues in Milan or their Metropolitan Region. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the San Siro and the closing is to be held at the Verona Arena as the only event scheduled for Verona.\nSports.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.\"\nOn 18 June 2021, the International Olympic Committee proposed that ski mountaineering be included as a sport for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The proposal was approved on 20 July.\nOn 24 June 2022, the IOC announced the final 2026 program. The alpine mixed team parallel event was removed, while the alpine combined event will now feature two athletes (one man and one woman) from each team instead of one as proposed by the FIS. Along with the three ski mountaineering events, five new events have been added to the Olympic program in four sports that were already on the program. In this way, a total of 116 events in eight sports were scheduled. \nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nThe following 8 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes. Seven qualifiers and the hosts, Italy, were confirmed as entered by the IIHF into their ice hockey tournament with Russia provisionally holding another spot. \nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nFor the first time, the emblem of an Olympic Games was determined via a public vote. On 6 March 2021 during the Sanremo Music Festival finals, two candidate designs titled \"Dado\" and \"Futura\" were unveiled by former Italian Olympic gold medallists Federica Pellegrini and Alberto Tomba. They were both designed by Landor Associates. On 30 March 2021, \"Futura\" was announced as the winning emblem. The emblem consists of a stylized \"26\" written in a single stroke, representing the impact of \"small gestures\", and \"sport, solidarity, and sustainability\".\nMascot.\nAn online vote closing on 28 February 2023 was held among a list of candidates to select the two mascots of the event. The winning candidates, designed by the students of a school in Taverna and inspired by stoats, were presented during the second night of the Sanremo Music Festival 2024 on 7 February 2024. Their names were revealed to be Tina and Milo (derived from the names of the host cities), and are portrayed as sister and brother. The choice of stoats has been explained as being due to these animals' embodiment of \"the contemporary Italian spirit\" of curiosity, ability to change according to the seasons, and capacity of adaptation to challenging habitats. The two main mascots are additionally accompanied by six snowdrop flowers, called \"The Flo\".\nCharacteristics.\nMilo, a brown stoat, and Tina, a white stoat, are a brother and sister \"born in the mountains of Italy\" who \"decided to move to the city\". Tina, the main Olympic mascot, symbolizes art, music and the transformative force go beauty. Milo, the Paralympic mascot, was born without a leg, and represents ingenuity, willpower and creativity.\nTheme song.\nDuring the Sanremo Music Festival 2022 finals, the two final candidates for the official anthem of the event were presented, with a poll opening afterward. On 7 March 2022, \"Fino all'alba\" (\"Until the dawn\")—composed by the youth music group La Cittadina of the San Pietro Martire in Seveso, and performed during Sanremo by Arisa — was announced as the winner.\nBroadcasting rights.\nOn 16 January 2023, the IOC announced that it had renewed its European broadcast rights agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery Sports to last from 2026 through to 2032. The contract covers pay television and streaming rights to the Summer, Winter, and Youth Olympics on Eurosport and Discovery+ in 49 European territories. Unlike the previous contract where corporate precursor Discovery, Inc. was responsible for sub-licensing them to broadcasters in each country, free-to-air rights packages were concurrently awarded to the European Broadcasting Union and its members to cover at least 100 hours of each Winter Olympics. In Italy, domestic rights are handled by the country's public broadcaster RAI and WBD's Italian division.\nIn the United States, NBC will again broadcast the event as part of its US$7.75 billion contract to air the Olympics through to 2032. Under the National Football League's new media rights agreements that begin in 2023, NBC will also serve as broadcaster of the Super Bowl (which is now rotated among all four of the United States' major commercial FTA networks) during Winter Olympic years that fall under the contract."

        "title": "2014 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2014 Major League Baseball season began on March 22 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, Australia, between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The North American part of the season started on March 30 and ended on September 28.\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 85th edition was held on July 14 at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota, home of the Minnesota Twins. The American League (AL) beat the National League (NL) 5–3. With the win, the AL champion earned home-field advantage during the World Series.\nThis year the Houston Astros hosted the Civil Rights Game on May 30 at Minute Maid Park. They played host to the Baltimore Orioles.\nThis was also the final season of Bud Selig as the Commissioner of Baseball. Selig served as the Executive Council Chairman from 1992 to 1998, acting as the commissioner, and then was appointed as the official commissioner in 1998. On August 14, 2014, the franchise owners selected Rob Manfred to become the new Commissioner, starting in 2015.\nSchedule.\nNo significant changes were made to the 2014 schedule. As was the case in 2013, each team played 19 games against each division opponent for a total of 76 games, and six or seven games against each team from the other two divisions in its league for a total of 66 games. All teams played 20 interleague games, with the majority of match-ups following the divisional rotation in place since 2004. For 2014, the matchups were AL East vs. NL Central, AL Central vs. NL West, and AL West vs. NL East. Teams played four games against a designated \"rival\" in two back-to-back two-game series, one home and one away. Unlike in 2013, when all of these series were played during the same week, these rivalry series were spread from early May through mid-August. The table below shows the interleague rivals for the 2014 season.\nRule changes.\nOn August 15, 2013, Major League Baseball announced that it would expand its video review process for the 2014 season, and MLB clubs unanimously approved the new rules on January 16, 2014. Managers were now able to challenge certain plays no more than twice per game, including force plays, fair or foul balls, and batters hit by a pitch, among others. If a manager exhausted his ability to challenge plays during the game and after the beginning of the seventh inning, the umpire crew chief could choose to invoke instant replay on any reviewable call. Calls that were challenged were reviewed by an umpiring crew at MLB headquarters in New York City, which made the final ruling.\nOn December 11, 2013, the Playing Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly to outlaw home-plate collisions between runners and catchers. On February 24, 2014, the new rule was put into effect as Rule 7.13 was released.\nManagerial changes.\nField managers.\nOff-season.\nAt the end of the 2013 season, the following teams made replacements to their managers.\nUniforms.\nPatches.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nThe following teams will wear commemorative patches for special occasions:\nThrowbacks.\nIn addition to ten Cubs throwback uniforms to mark the 100th anniversary of Wrigley Field, selected teams wore throwbacks throughout the season:\nTelevision.\nNational.\nUnited States.\nThis was first year of the new eight-year TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports, and TBS. ESPN will air Sunday night games, some Monday Night games and Wednesday night games, while Fox Sports will air Saturday games and TBS will air Sunday games.\nContract provisions in ESPN's contract virtually eliminated local blackouts among the network's Monday and Wednesday night games, allowing ESPN coverage to co-exist with that of the local broadcasters in home markets. Sunday Night Baseball blackout rules will still apply.\nFox Sports' contract also covers Fox Sports 1, which began its first year of Major League Baseball coverage. Fox Sports 1 televised 40 regular-season games (mostly on Saturdays) and possibly up to 15 playoff games. The increase in televised games from previous years is due to a provision in the contract that allows for Fox Sports 1 to take a game between two teams in which Fox operates the teams' individual RSNs and elevate it into a national broadcast. As a result, MLB regular season coverage on the Fox network was reduced to 12 weeks beginning in 2014.\nIn the post-season, TBS and ESPN aired two Wild Card Games. TBS, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network aired the Division Series, while TBS aired the American League Championship Series. The Fox network and Fox Sports 1 aired the National League Championship Series, and the Fox network exclusively aired the All-Star Game and the World Series.\nCanada.\nThis is the first year of eight-year contracts for national broadcasts in Canada. Sportsnet, owned by Rogers Communications (and sister company of the Toronto Blue Jays), continues to be the primary rightsholder, retaining rights to the All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby, and most postseason games. In total (including Canada-wide rights to all Blue Jays games which are acquired directly from the team), Sportsnet's various channels will carry almost 300 MLB games per season until 2021. As part of the deal, Rogers Cable became the Canadian launch partner for MLB Network, which was not previously available in Canada, and did not secure carriage on any Canadian providers other than Rogers that year. Despite this, MLB Network's Division Series telecasts were kept exclusive to that channel in Canada as well.\nSeparately, TSN announced its own eight-year deal to expand its MLB coverage. Having carried ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" since 2010 under sublicense from Sportsnet, TSN and TSN2 will now carry all of ESPN's regular-season coverage (ESPN being a minority partner in TSN), adding \"Monday Night Baseball\" and \"Wednesday Night Baseball\", totalling over 75 games per year.\nFrench-language rights, previously held exclusively by TSN's French-language sister channels RDS and RDS2, will now be split with TVA Sports, with each group airing approximately 70 games per season (TVA Sports also carries additional Blue Jays games acquired directly from the team). RDS will continue to carry the All-Star Game and the World Series, but the remaining postseason rights will be split equally between RDS and TVA Sports.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio aired its 17th season of national coverage, including Sunday night games, Saturday games, Opening Day and holiday games, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, and the entire postseason.\nLocal.\nThe New York Yankees left WCBS, which was their radio home for 12 years, but the rights remained with CBS Radio's New York cluster, as they moved to WCBS's sister station WFAN with a new rights agreement, which allows an FM simulcast with WFAN-FM, which would mark the first time the Yankees are heard on FM radio in their hometown. The move to WFAN means that the New York Mets moved to WOR (purchased by Clear Channel in late 2012) for the 2014 season, as they had been on WFAN since the station had adopted the all-sports format in 1987.\nThis will be the final year in which the Chicago Cubs will air on WGN. WGN has had some form of broadcast relationship with the Cubs since 1925 and has been the exclusive broadcaster of the team since 1958; for many years, the Cubs and WGN were both owned by Tribune Company. The spin-off of the Cubs to new ownership, combined with continued financial losses, the Cubs' persistent on-field futility and the pending end of the rival Chicago White Sox's contract with WSCR after the 2015 season, prompted Tribune to end its relationship with the Cubs. Cubs broadcasts will move to CBS Radio's WBBM for 2015 and, if the White Sox do not renew with WSCR, to WSCR for 2016 and beyond."

        "title": "2014 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2014 British Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 6 July 2014 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom before a crowd of 122,000 people. It was the ninth round of the 2014 Formula One World Championship, and the 65th British Grand Prix to be held as part of the series. Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes team won the 52-lap race, from a sixth position start. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas finished second, with Daniel Ricciardo third for the Red Bull squad. It was Hamilton's fifth victory of 2014 and the 27th of his career.\nHamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg recorded the fastest lap in qualifying to start from pole position. The race was suspended for one hour, five minutes after a first-lap accident involving Kimi Räikkönen left a section of guardrail barrier needing repair. Rosberg led for 18 laps after the restart as Hamilton moved to second, then made a pit stop for tyres, giving the lead to Hamilton for six laps. Hamilton took the lead for good when Rosberg retired from a gearbox fault on the 29th lap; he won by more than a minute over Bottas. Ricciardo held off McLaren's Jenson Button in the final laps to take third.\nRosberg's non-finish left him with a reduced lead of four points over Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Ricciardo and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari maintained third and fourth respectively, and Bottas passed Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel for fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a 158-point lead over Red Bull and Ferrari was third. Williams overtook Force India for fourth with ten races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 British Grand Prix was the 9th of the 19 races in the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship and the 65th edition of the event as a round of the World Championship. It was held at the 18-turn Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England on 6 July. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought a white-banded Medium and orange-banded Hard dry-compounds to the race as well as two wet-weather compounds, the intermediate and full wet tyres. The drag reduction system (DRS), an adjustable flap at the back of each car that helps with overtaking when activated, had two activation zones for the race: one on the Wellington Straight linking the Arena and Brookands turns, and one on the Hangar Straight between Chapel and Stowe corners. After the 2013 race, artificial grass was removed at the exits at three corner, the inside side barrier at the entrance to Brooklands corner was enlargened, and circuit drainage was improved.\nAfter the two weeks earlier, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg led the Drivers' Championship with 165 points, ahead of his second-placed teammate Lewis Hamilton with 136 points. Daniel Ricciardo of the Red Bull team was third with 83 points, and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso followed close behind in fourth with 79 points. Sebastian Vettel, in the second Red Bull car, was fifth with 60 points. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 301 points with Red Bull second with 143 points, Ferrari with 98 points, and Force India with 87 points battling Williams with 85 points for fourth position.\nAfter a series of errors in the previous four rounds left Hamilton 29 points behind Rosberg, the Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda suggested this would motivate Hamilton to perform better at the British Grand Prix and saw no reason to guide him in his driving, \"Lewis will fight back, there is no worry on my case about this at all. He is not in any way disturbed. He will keep fighting. Don't worry.\" Valtteri Bottas said Williams intended to run well at Silverstone and sought to build on the momentum from Austria, \"I am really looking forward to Silverstone. It's always a great event and means a lot to us as it's the team's home Grand Prix, so hopefully some of the guys from the factory can come up and support us as well.\" Ricciardo said he was looking forward to the race as he liked the Silverstone track.\nThere were a total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) each fielded two race drivers for the Grand Prix with four driver changes for the first practice session. Williams development driver Susie Wolff drove for the team in lieu of Bottas, becoming the first woman to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix weekend since Giovanna Amati's attempted to qualify for the 1992 Brazilian Grand Prix. Force India gave Daniel Juncadella, the team's reserve and simulator driver and Mercedes-Benz Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters racer, his first Formula One race appearance in Nico Hülkenberg's car at Silverstone. Former GP2 Series competitor Robin Frijns drove Kamui Kobayashi's Caterham for the second time in the 2014 season; the in April was the first. Finally, and for the fourth time in 2014, Giedo van der Garde took Adrian Sutil's Sauber seat.\nPractice.\nPer the regulations for the 2014 season, three practice sessions were held: two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another 60-minute session on Saturday. In the first session, Rosberg set the fastest lap at 1 minute, 35.424 seconds. Hamilton, Alonso, Ricciardo, Kimi Räikkönen, Vettel, Jenson Button, Daniil Kvyat, Jean-Éric Vergne and Kevin Magnussen were in positions two to ten. Four minutes in, Felipe Massa ran onto artificial grass at the exit of Stowe corner and was sent backwards into a sideways spin, hitting the outside tyre barrier at . His damaged Williams FW36 car stopped near the entry to the pit lane and the session was halted for 17 minutes as track marshals removed it. Later, an oil pressure problem caused Wolff's engine to shut down after four laps, and Marcus Ericsson spun at Becketts turn. After the session, Ricciardo and Rosberg were summoned to the stewards for overtaking Alonso and Kvyat under red flag conditions. Both drivers were deemed to have driven safely under series regulations after data examination and their explanations convinced the stewards not to penalise them.\nHamilton used soft compound tyres to record the fastest lap of the second session with an early time of 1 minute, 35.508 seconds; his running was curtailed because his engine cut out with an hour to go. Rosberg, Alonso, the Red Bull pair of Ricciardo and Vettel, Bottas, Button, Magunssen, Räikkönen and Vergne rounded out the top ten. A localised explosion tore through the left-hand side of Bottas' engine cover and loosened it with five minutes to go. Vergne's left-front wheel detached at Abbey corner and he had to stop at the side of the track. On Saturday morning, FIA race director Charlie Whiting adopted a \"zero tolerance policy\" and cautioned drivers not to run wide leaving Copse and Club without being forced or their lap times would be deleted in a bid to enforce stricter regulations on driving off the track. Overnight rain made the track wet and a north-westerly wind was a factor in the final session; four drivers chose not to set a timed lap and some went off the slippery track. Vettel set the fastest lap of 1 minute, 52.522 seconds, with his teammate Ricciardo second. Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Sutil, Kvyat, Magnussen, Button, Bottas and Räikkönen completed the top ten. Jules Bianchi broke his front wing in an impact with the barrier at Stowe corner. Sutil also avoided hitting the wall at Stowe turn and exited the corner's gravel trap.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished qualifying 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107 per cent of the fastest lap to qualify. The second part lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final session lasted 12 minutes and determined pole position to tenth. Cars who progressed to the final session were not allowed to change tyres for the race's start, using the tyres with which they set their best lap times in the second session. A damp track worsened as rain began to fall with increasing, if intermittent, severity; all drivers used intermediate compound tyres for the first two sessions. The rain stopped at the start of the third session and drivers used dry tyres in its first minutes. Rain soon returned and they drove to the pit lane. Several drivers returned to the circuit with three minutes left for one last try at improving their laps. Rosberg took his fourth pole position of the season and the eighth of his career with a 1-minute, 35.766 seconds lap. He was joined on the grid's front row by Vettel who bowed out of his first try due to the rain. Third-place Button went wide at Aintree corner and oversteered on the run to the Hangar Straight and began from the top three at Silverstone for the first time since the 2005 British Grand Prix. Hülkenberg in fourth briefly held pole position as he was the first driver to improve his lap on the drying track. Magnussen was fifth. Hamilton provisionally held the pole position after all first timed laps; he fell to sixth after he abandoned his final attempt because it was slower and he felt the track was not dry enough to improve his lap times.\nSergio Pérez in seventh ran wide at Chapel turn and lost heat in his tyres. Eighth-placed Ricciardo did not anticipate the improvement in track conditions and he remained in the pit lane. The Toro Rosso duo of Kvyat and Vergne were ninth and tenth. Grosjean was the fastest driver not to advance to the final session, because a yellow flag at Brooklands corner required him to slow. Marussia fuelled their cars for the second session and its reaction to the changing weather saw Bianchi qualify 12th and Max Chilton 13th. However, Chilton incurred a five-place grid penalty for changing his gearbox after the third practice session. Esteban Gutiérrez lost traction in his vehicle on a kerb leaving Brooklands corner and was sent backwards into a guardrail barrier at Luffield turn. He was 14th and also incurred a ten-place grid penalty for an unsafe release at the preceding round in Austria. Maldonado in 15th had a fuel pressure problem in the second session requiring him to stop his car. He was demoted five places for not providing the FIA with at least of fuel for analysis. Hence, Sutil started 13th after he lost control of his car's rear and got beached in a gravel trap. A strategy error left the Williams pair of Bottas and Massa to drive on a wet track on dry compound tyres and took 14th and 15th. Alonso in 16th (who spun at Brooklands turn) and his teammate Räikkönen in 17th were also caught out by the weather and used the incorrect tyre compound, after Ferrari spent longer than most teams deciding their strategy. The Caterham cars of Ericsson and Kamui Kobayashi were slow enough to transgress the 107 per cent rule. The stewards granted them dispensation to start the race.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNotes:\nRace.\nThe weather at the start was dry and sunny with the air temperature between and the track temperature from ; no rain was forecast. The 52-lap race began before 120,000 people at 13:00 local time, with Rosberg making a brisk start to hold the lead into Abbey corner. Vettel in second had a slow start and Button and Magnussen passed him. Hamilton moved from sixth to fourth as Massa stalled from 15th. On the Wellington Straight, the rear of Räikkönen's Ferrari F14 T car got loose and he drove onto the run-off area. He identified a run-off area without grass to reemerge on the track, rejoining at an angle at , causing him to hit a bump on a grass verge and unsettling his car. He was vaulted right at an angle and into the guardrail barrier close to the pillar of an overhead bridge in a impact. The Ferrari's right-front tyre flew by Chilton, who had to duck his head to avoid being struck; his front wing and front-left brake duct were damaged.\nRäikkönen ricocheted across the track and into the path of Kobayashi and Massa. Kobayashi grazed the front of the Ferrari and veered onto the grass; Massa applied the brakes upon seeing the impact, trying to spin to the right to avoid a T-bone collision. The rear of Massa's car made contact with the front of Räikkönen's. A track marshal assisted Räikkönen, who had hip and heel injuries, out of his car and into an ambulance for transport to the circuit's medical centre. The safety car was deployed for a lap until Whiting discovered the barriers were dented and needed repair, and stopped the race. Every driver was directed to stop on the grid. Damage to Massa's rear suspension necessitated his retirement. In the meantime, Chilton incurred a drive-through penalty for entering the pit lane under red flag conditions. Repairs to the barrier prevented the resumption of the race for an hour, five minutes until course workers were finished at 14:05 local time. The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension.\nBoth Red Bulls switched to the hard-compound tyres on the grid during the stoppage and Alonso used the softer compounds to improve the possibility of making a solitary pit stop by driving on the more durable harder tyres later on. Rosberg was first, followed by the McLarens of Button and Magnussen. Bottas overtook Kvyat at Brooklands corner to move into ninth and Hamilton began to challenge Magnussen for third. On lap three, Hamilton drew alongside Magnussen through Woodcote turn and passed him for third entering Copse corner as Magnussen ran off the track. That same lap, Bottas overtook Ricciardo on the Hangar Straight for seventh as Alonso passed Gutiérrez for twelfth. During the next lap, Hamilton drew alongside Button and overtook him on the outside at Brooklands turn for second. Alonso passed Sutil for eleventh before Brooklands corner and then Bianchi for tenth as Hülkenberg lost sixth to Bottas in Stowe turn on the fifth lap. DRS was enabled on lap six. That lap, Alonso used DRS to pass Kvyat on the outside leaving Woodcote corner and into Luffield turn for ninth. Ricciardo overtook Hülkenberg at Stowe corner and the subsequent loss of momentum allowed Alonso to get by him around the outside at Vale corner for eighth on lap seven.\nOn lap eight, Alonso used DRS to pass Hülkenberg on the outside at Brooklands turn after a short battle. Further back Sutil passed Bianchi for eleventh as Ricciardo battled Hülkenberg for eighth at Luffield turn on lap ten but could not pass due to the latter's higher straight-line speed. Ricciardo tried again into Stowe corner and succeeded. On the inside at Club turn on the same lap, Gutiérrez attempted to pass Maldonado, who sought to overtake Bianchi. Gutiérrez hit Maldonado's left-hand side; contact continued through the corner and Maldonado was launched airborne off Gutiérrez's right-front tyre. Gutiérrez got beached in a gravel trap and retired with rear car damage. The first pit stops for tyres occurred on lap 11 as Vettel entered the pit lane to try and pass the McLarens; the faster Bottas, behind him, was thus freed to try to catch Magnussen. On the next lap, Ericsson's suspension failed on the Brooklands corner kerb and he drove to the pit lane to retire. Alonso incurred a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the 13th lap because he was deemed to have been out of position on his grid slot for the restart.\nBy the 14th lap Bottas had caught Magnussen, and entering Stowe corner used his DRS and better speed to pass him on the outside for fourth. Alonso overtook Magnussen around the outside of Stowe corner for fifth as Ricciardo made a pit stop for the soft compound tyres on lap 15. Two laps later, Bottas passed Button at Stowe turn for third. On that lap, Ricciardo passed Sutil on the approach to Stowe corner for ninth. Rosberg made his first pit stop from the lead on the 18th lap. Hamilton led for six laps; the plan was for him to run the middle stint on the hard-compound tyres before his own stop at the conclusion of lap 24. In the meantime, Rosberg began developing gearbox problems on lap 20. As Alonso battled with Button, a stone lodged in his rear wing slot gap that remained there for the rest of the Grand Prix. He twice oversteered coming through Becketts corner as Ricciardo passed Hülkenberg for eighth. Rosberg had increased his advantage over Hamilton, whose pit stop lasted 1.7 seconds than expected as his hard-compound left-rear wheel was slow to install at his pit box, to six seconds.\nOn the 25th lap, Vettel passed Magnussen for sixth at the exit of Luffield turn. Three laps later, Alonso overtook Hülkenberg through Copse corner for eighth after the former took his five-second stop-and-go penalty. As Hamilton reduced Rosberg's lead from six to four seconds within three laps on his newer tyres, the latter had gear-selection problems. Rosberg attempted to change his gearbox's settings; this did not work as he slowed at Village corner and Hamilton took the lead on the Wellington Straight on lap 29. Rosberg steered onto the grass down the approach to Becketts corner, and retired due to his gearbox. Attention then focused on the battle for third. Ricciardo's pit stop allowed him to change his strategy into a one-stopper, as tyre degradation rates were less than during the two Friday practice sessions. Bottas made his second pit stop on lap 32 and emerged in third behind Vettel. Two laps later, Bottas glimpsed space and passed Vettel for second on the Hangar Straight.\nVettel immediately made a second pit stop at the end of the lap. He rejoined ahead of Alonso in fifth place. Alonso twice passed Vettel around the outside at Copse corner during a duel for fifth between laps 35 and 36. On lap 37, Vettel had optimum tyre temperature, and used DRS on the Wellington Straight to pass Alonso on the outside under braking. Alonso then went across the front of Vettel leaving Brooklands corner to retain fifth. Vettel saw space to pass Alonso at Brooklands corner on lap 42, but the latter blocked his pass on the racing line. Three laps later, Vettel turned to the outside of Luffield corner. Although he did not pass Alonso, Vettel entered the straight faster than the former who reacted by turning to the inside past the former Grand Prix pit lane to block him. On the 47th lap, Vettel turned to the outside at Brooklands corner to draw alongside Alonso through Woodcote turn but Alonso kept fifth by braking later than him.\nVettel was aided by the rear of Alonso's car stepping out into Copse corner and overtook him on the outside for fifth. Once past, Vettel pulled away from Alonso. In the meantime, Button drew closer to Ricciardo; he had made a pit stop earlier than the latter, and his two-stop strategy left him the faster of the two. Maldonado's exhaust failed on the 51st lap, and he retired at the side of the track at Abbey turn with smoke billowing from the rear of his car. Unchallenged in the final 23 laps, Hamilton achieved his fifth victory of the season, and the 27th of his career to equal three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart's race wins total. Bottas followed 30.135 seconds later in second and Ricciardo was another 16 seconds behind in third. Button could not get close enough to pass Ricciardo and finished fourth. Vettel, Alonso and Magnussen were in positions five to seven. Hülkenberg held off Kvyat in ninth to take eighth and Vergne was tenth. The final finishers were Pérez, Grosjean, Sutil, Bianchi, Kobayashi, Chilton and Maldonado.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by former driver David Coulthard, Hamilton said that his weekend had demonstrated perseverance: \"Yesterday wasn't a case of giving up, I didn't think I could do the lap, I was really shocked that the last sector was so fast. But coming here today I had my family with, just focused, the support from the fans, as I said, just spurred me on, and I really couldn't have done it without them.\" Bottas said he was enjoyed to pass other drivers and was complimentary of his team and car, \"The plan was to come as high as possible, as high as the pace of the car is giving the possibility. I think as a team we made the most out of it.\" Ricciardo spoke of his feeling that had the race lasted one more lap, Button would have passed him. In the subsequent press conference, Hamilton said the fans' positive attitude helped him and that the win had no comparison to his one in 2008 as that race was held on a wet track. Bottas said Williams predicted Mercedes and Red Bull would be strong opponents and the team targeted points not the podium. Ricciardo stated Red Bull restarted on the hard tyres for track position and called his third-place result \"one of my best podiums\" of the season.\nRäikkönen was declared fit for the following , and said he felt the crash was not his largest and hoped to avoid such incidents in the future. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda claimed that the delay to repair the damaged wall was too long, unnecessary, and an over-regulation by Formula One. \"This over-nursing of F1, being over cautious, over-controlling and over-regulating, drives me mad. This little guardrail issue is another example. There are too many people involved in making F1 as safe as the roads, which is wrong. They should have fixed it quickly, done something instantly, and then 10–15 minutes later the race would have gone on.\" Massa stated his belief that Räikkönen might not have crashed had he been more cautious in slowing and remerging onto the track. The FIA rejected suggestions Räikkönen should have been penalised because it decided he did not rejoin unsafely. Whiting responded to Lauda by noting safety was enhanced following Massa's 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix injury from being struck in the helmet by a spring.\nAlonso told the press he expected to lose the battle with Vettel because his car's rear-wing aerodynamic deficiencies led it to not operate correctly, and Ferrari contemplated retiring him. \"Vettel overtook me by going out of the track. He finished in front, but I was very proud of my 13 laps. If he had not passed me on the lap he did it would have been the next one because we were in slow motion and they were at real speed.\" Vettel described a series of radio transmissions where he complained of a series of suspected illegal manoeuvres such as driving off the track during his duel as \"silly\"; \"I got the message that I should respect the limits and that he was complaining, so I was doing the same thing. I'm not sure who won the list-keeping. I think twice it was maybe a bit too harsh into Turn 6 [Brooklands], but it was good to get the move at the end.\" Nevertheless, former driver Allan McNish said on a BBC Sport online column the battle was \"some of the best racing you will ever see\" and it demonstrated \"two world champions having to really work for their living.\" Gutierrez was found to be \"predominantly at fault\" for his collision at Club corner on lap line, and incurred a five-place grid penalty for the following German Grand Prix and three penalty points on his super licence.\nThe result reduced Rosberg's Drivers' Championship lead to four points over Hamilton. Ricciardo's third-place finish increased his points tally over fourth-place Alonso to eleven and Bottas' second-place finish advanced him past Vettel and from seventh to fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes maintained its lead with 326 points; their advantage over Red Bull remained at 158 points. Ferrari stayed third while Williams overtook Force India for fourth with ten races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold."

The Australian Sports Commission (ASC), Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), the Australian Commonwealth Games Association (ACGA), and World Boxing have recognized Boxing Australia as the National Sporting Organisation for boxing.\nOn July 13, 2023, due to the International Olympic Committee's decision to expel the International Boxing Association from the Olympic movement over corruption involving its Russian organizers, Boxing Australia announced its intention to depart from the federation and join World Boxing. This decision was approved on August 13, 2023.\nHigh Performance.\nHigh Performance is a concept within sport that focuses intensely on a group of individuals or teams, aiming to achieve both individual and collective goals in order to attain success.\nBoxing Australia has a range of High-Performance programs. In 1997, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) introduced Boxing as a scholarship sport. Its origins started out as a camp-based program, and by the early 2000s, Boxing became a full-residential program at the AIS.\nIn 2005, Boxing was accepted as a program sport for the Australian Sports Commission’s (ASC) National Talent Identification and Development (NTID) program which focused on identifying indigenous and heavyweight talent.\nIn 2011, following the removal from the AIS Residential program, Boxing Australia assumed full ownership and management of its High-Performance programs. The Boxing Australia Academy was established and operated from the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, based on centralized camps.\nThe Boxing Australia Centre of Excellence was established as a decentralized program within each state and territory. The program aims to identify talented boxers with the potential to represent their respective state or territory at future Australian Championships.\nIn 2013, the AIS Combat Centre was established. The AIS Combat Centre houses the Boxing Australia training facilities.\nIn the 2013–14 season, the Centre of Excellence program evolved into the BAL Development Program, with a renewed emphasis on adolescent athletes with the potential to qualify for state/territory teams. The primary objectives of the Development Program are to impart boxing terminology and skills to young boxers at an early age. This ensures that as they advance through the pathway, National Coaches do not need to re-teach these fundamental skills but rather refine them.\nBoxing Australia receives support from the Australian Sports Commission with Combat AUS managing the high-performance program.\nStructure.\nBoxing Australia adopts a Federation-style organization with member association representation from a council, a board of directors that are elected, management and operational staff, standing committees, and Commissions.\nBoard Directors.\nThe overarching management and strategic focus are handled by a Board of seven directors, with the ability to coopt two non-voting directors plus the Chief Executive Officer, Dinah Glykidis.

The following week Williams played against South Africa again, this time for his club side. The Springboks won six points to three.\nIn the 1913-14 season Williams played in three internationals against Scotland, at Inverleith, England, at Cardiff Arms Park and against Ireland, at St Helens, Swansea. He was picked to play against France in Paris but was prevented from doing so because he would have been absent too long from work. The game against Ireland was to be his last game for Wales as the war intervened. Despite playing his last match for Wales, in 1915 he was selected for invitational touring team the Barbarians. He played in two matches for the Barbarians, both against Leicester.\nWilliams returned to rugby after the end of the First World War, and represented Cardiff until the 1919-1920 season, ending his club career with 159 appearances."

The award has been given ever since the conference first sponsored women's basketball in the 1985–86 season, when it was known as the West Coast Athletic Conference. There have been two ties in the history of the award. The first was in 2006–07 between Stephanie Hawk of Gonzaga and Amanda Rego of Santa Clara (coincidentally, players from the same two schools were involved in a tie for the WCC Men's Player of the Year Award that season). The second was in 2020–21, when BYU's Shaylee Gonzales and Gonzaga's Jenn Wirth shared honors. There have also been a total of four repeat winners, but only one—Courtney Vandersloot of Gonzaga—has been Player of the Year three times.\nNo one WCC school has dominated the total awards distribution over time. The overall leader is Gonzaga, with 12 awards; BYU is next with seven, while Saint Mary's and Santa Clara have five each. Of these schools, all but BYU, which joined the WCC in 2011 and left for the Big 12 Conference in 2023, have been WCC members throughout the conference's women's basketball history. Each current WCC member except for Pacific has at least one award. Pacific had been a charter member of what is now the WCC, but left in 1971, long before the conference sponsored women's sports, and did not return until 2013. The only former WCC women's basketball member that failed to produce an award winner was Nevada, which only participated in the conference's first two women's basketball seasons (1985–86 and 1986–87).\nWinners by school.\nNote: Years of entry for each school are the actual calendar years they joined the WCC and first played women's basketball in the conference. Because the basketball season spans two calendar years, the award years reflect the years in which each season ended. Schools that have left the WCC are highlighted in \"italics\"."

        "text": "The 2013–14 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team represented the University of Notre Dame during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games at the Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center in South Bend, Indiana. This marked Notre Dame's inaugural season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, having moved from the Big East Conference. They finished the season 15–17, 6–12 in ACC play to finish in a three-way tie for 11th place. They lost in the first round of the ACC tournament Wake Forest.\nPrevious season.\nThe Fighting Irish finished the 2012–13 season 25–10, with an 11–7 record in Big East play. They reached the semifinals of the Big East tournament, which was their fourth consecutive trip to that round in their final appearance before departing to the ACC. However, for a third year in a row they were eliminated by Louisville. The Irish earned a #7 seed for the NCAA tournament, where they were eliminated in the second round by Iowa State.\nSenior forward Jack Cooley was named First Team All-Big East, while junior guard Jerian Grant was named Second Team All-Big East. Additionally, sophomore guard Pat Connaughton was named to the Big East Championship All-Tournament Team, the first Irish player to be so honored since Scott Martin in 2011.\nPre-season.\nOn September 12, 2012, Notre Dame announced that they had accepted an invitation to join the ACC in all sports except for football. Discussions with both the Big East and the ACC eventually led to an agreement for the Irish to join the ACC starting with 2013-14 calendar year. Notre Dame basketball announced its first slate of conference games on April 23, 2013. As \"partner schools\" with Georgia Tech and Boston College, Notre Dame will always play home-and-away series with those two schools each year, and then play the remaining 11 ACC teams on a rotating basis as part of an 18-game conference schedule. The Irish were also scheduled for their first-ever game in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. On May 8 it was confirmed their opponent in the 2013 Challenge would be Iowa. The full 2013-14 schedule was unveiled August 22. In the poll taken at ACC Media Days in October, the Irish were picked to finish fifth in their first season in the new conference.\nNotre Dame recruited four players from the high school senior class of 2012–13, each of whom signed letters-of-intent in November 2012. The recruiting class, which featured three players from the state of Indiana, was ranked among the top 20 in the nation by Rivals.com, Scout.com, and ESPN.\nDuring preseason practices, the Irish suffered two notable injuries in their sophomore class. First, forward Zach Auguste suffered a broken wrist on October 10. Initially expected to be out for up to six weeks, he was ready by the time of the season opener on November 8. On October 26, the school confirmed sophomore Eric Katenda underwent knee surgery that will keep him out for up to six weeks.\nWhen the preseason rankings were released by two major college basketball polls, Notre Dame was #21 in the AP poll and #22 by the USA Today/Coaches Poll.\nRoster.\nThe school announced on November 8 that sophomore Cameron Biedschied will sit out the 2013–14 season. Biedschied had no injury issues necessitating the redshirt, but arrived at the decision with Coach Brey that he would benefit academically and athletically by sitting out a year, citing specifically his struggles in conference play during his freshman year. On December 26, however, after the fall semester concluded, Biedscheid requested and received permission to contact other schools in order to transfer.\nOn December 22, the school announced that Jerian Grant would be suspended for the remainder of the 2013–14 season due to an \"academic matter\". Grant wrote in a note posted on the school's athletic website that, \"It is my full intention to return to Notre Dame as soon as possible following the 2014 spring semester. I intend to do whatever it takes to earn my degree and finish out my college basketball career here.\"\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002649; color:#CC9933;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002649; color:#CC9933;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002649; color:#CC9933;\"| ACC Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002649; color:#CC9933;\"| ACC Tournament\nSee also.\n2013–14 Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team"

        "title": "North Carolina Tar Heels women's lacrosse",
        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels women's lacrosse team represents the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's lacrosse and currently competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The North Carolina women's lacrosse team won the ACC tournament in 2002 and their first Division 1 national championship in 2013.\nHistory.\nUNC started a women's lacrosse program in 1994 due to Title IX. Jenny Levy, a recent graduate from the University of Virginia was hired as the head coach.\nReflecting on why she was hired Levy stated, “I was 24 years old, and I think I got hired because I was pretty cheap, very ambitious and high energy, I believed in the school and what we could sell here to student-athletes with academic opportunity and great tradition. I focused on what I knew and could do.”\nThe task of creating a successful women's lacrosse team was challenging; during the preliminary years of the program Levy had only a part-time assistant and a small budget. She still managed to bring in talented recruits, some of which were transfers and some were members of the UNC women's soccer team, which at the time had 14 NCAA Championships in 16 years.\nAnother obstacle was being a part of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which had the University of Maryland and the University of Virginia, two established women's lacrosse teams. Levy stated, “we rose pretty quickly, but there was not a lot of foundation, and it is very hard to establish tradition when you are a young program; sitting where I am today, I have learned that it takes a while to establish things that identify with the program that is unique to just that program.”\nAlthough the task at hand was difficult the Tar Heels started out with success early on with a 12–4 record in its first varsity season of 1996. In their second year, UNC made the NCAA semifinals with a 14–4 record, tallying two victories against the Virginia Cavaliers. In UNC's third season, the Tar Heels beat the eventual NCAA champion Maryland two times and reached the semifinals of the NCAA again. By the third season in program history UNC claimed the number 2 overall ranking.\nLevy's program grew stronger as years passed and certain perks came along with that success; Levy was granted a full-time assistant and UNC started to increase their athletic support staff overall.\nLevy spoke of the early years saying “It was a gradual process of pushing and asking; it was a process for all Carolina sports, and slowly we have made progress with that, but even with it, the athletic program has been very successful.”\nThe UNC Women's Lacrosse team is in their 19th season of program history. Phil Barnes has served as the Assistant Coach for 10 seasons. Katrina Dowd joined the Tar Heels in 2012–2013 season to help them win their first national championship.\n2013 national championship.\nWhen asked about constructing a national championship-type team, Head Coach Levy stated that “its not just a one-year thing for us.\" The team expects success because they have been a perennial final four team for the past 5 years. Even though they had not won a national title until 2013 they expect to be in a position to do so year in and year out. She stressed the importance of the recruiting process; the team consists of not only talented lacrosse players, but also hard workers with an ability to sacrifice self-interest for the team. The freshmen are expected to be on “a constant ascension of personal development, athletically, academically, and in the community.\"\nThe 2013 Tar Heels had a small senior class with only 5 players and ended their previous season with an early loss in the post season (their first time not making it to the final-four in three years). This was the first year that Katrina Dowd joined the coaching staff to help build a dynamic attacking unit. This was a young team with a lot of change going into the 2013 season. In the season opener against The University of Florida, the Tar Heels lost 5–3. The team went on an 11-game winning streak after the loss to Florida, but the margins of victory were not very large. Their most notable win during the 11 game winning streak was their 11–8 win over the reigning national champions, Northwestern. The Tar Heels went on to defeat every team they played besides Maryland once in regular season (April 6) and once in the ACC Championship (April 28). These two losses were crucial to the team's success in the NCAA tournament because they eventually took down the Terrapins in a triple-overtime thriller to secure their first national championship in the 18-year program history.\nWhen Jenny Levy was asked: \"What’s it going to take for UNC to repeat as national champions?\" she responded \"Nothing’s changed, but everything has changed. We’re a tough group, and I think more than anything this championship is a tipping point for us because it validates what we’ve always talked about. Now our players have experienced that and they won’t forget that. We’re going to enjoy the championship right now but we’ll begin again in August and we’ll start from the very beginning and work our way back up. It took a lot of hard work, a lot of belief and a lot of trust and I think those lessons will stay with us for a long time.\"\n2013 Season Performance\nIndividual honors.\n First Team All Americans \nTewaaraton Finalists\nPostseason Results.\nThe Tar Heels have appeared in 24 NCAA tournaments. Their postseason record is 42–21.\nCoaching staff.\nJenny Levy\nPhil Barnes\nKatrina Dowd"

The British team was made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom including Northern Ireland, whose athletes may have elected to hold Irish citizenship, allowing them to represent either Great Britain or Ireland. Additionally some British overseas territories competed separately from Britain in Olympic competition. A total of 56 athletes competed in 11 sports making it the biggest contingent that Great Britain had sent to a Winter Olympic Games for twenty-six years.\nOn 9 February 2014, Jenny Jones won Great Britain's first medal on snow in their Winter Olympic history after finishing third in the women's slopestyle.\nOn 14 February 2014, Lizzy Yarnold won gold in the skeleton. She became the second Briton to win the gold in the event, taking the title from previous Great Britain champion Amy Williams. She was elected to be the flag bearer for the closing ceremony.\nOn 20 February 2014, the women's curling team won their bronze medal match against Switzerland 6–5. In doing so, they ensured that Great Britain met its UK Sport medal target of three medals from the Games.\nOn 19 February 2014, the men's curling team won their semifinal against Sweden 6–5 and on 21 February 2014, they won the silver medal after being defeated by Canada in the gold medal match 9–3, but the result still confirmed Great Britain's most successful Olympics for ninety years by equaling the medal count of the 1924 Winter Olympics.\nIn November 2017, the Russian Bobsleigh teams that came first and fourth in the Four-man event were disqualified. This meant that Great Britain (who originally finished 5th) would move up into the bronze medal position. The IOC requested that the IBSF modify the results, and the medals were redistributed accordingly.\nRecords.\nOlympic records.\nOn 11 February Great Britain matched an Olympic scoreline record by beating USA 12–3 in women's curling. They also set a new Olympic record by scoring seven points in a single end. On 14 February they equalled the scoreline record again, this time beating Japan 12–3.\nMedal and performance targets.\nOn 16 January 2014, the funding body UK Sport announced their medal targets for Team GB at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi with the target to win three medals with the best chance of success with the ladies skeleton events. Although the target was set at three medals the funding body predicted that Great Britain had the potential to win as many as seven medals, although this total was not widely expected to be reached. Other realistic chances of medal success were with the bobsleigh and curling events.\nThe games proved to be highly successful for Team GB, exceeding the initial target of three medals and achieving all of the targets for each of the winter sports that were set.\nUK Sport funding.\nIn the Winter Olympic Cycle running from 2010 to 2014 the UK government body UK Sport allocated a then record budget of over £13 million to fund Team GB for the individual athletes as well as the bobsleigh and curling teams for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The sports receiving the highest funding were bobsleigh, curling and skeleton, whilst speed skating, ski and snowboard, and figure skating also received funding, but all other winter sports where British athletes were competing did not receive any funding from the body.\nAlpine skiing.\nAccording to the quota allocation released on 27 January 2014, Great Britain qualified two athletes in alpine skiing.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their performance at the 2012 and 2013 Biathlon World Championships, Great Britain qualified 1 man and 1 woman.\nCross-country skiing.\nAccording to the quota allocation released on 30 December 2013, Great Britain had four athletes in qualification position.\nCurling.\nBased on results from 2012 and the 2013, Great Britain has qualified their men's and women's team (consisting of five athletes) as one of the seven highest ranked nations.\nMen's tournament.\nRound-robin.\nGreat Britain had a bye in draws 4, 7 and 11.\nWomen's tournament.\nRound-robin.\nGreat Britain has a bye in draws 2, 6 and 10.\nFigure skating.\nOn 11 December 2013 the British Olympic Association announced the figure skaters taking part in the Sochi 2014 Olympics:\nFreestyle skiing.\nAfter suffering injuries and a loss of consciousness as a result of an accident during training on 17 February, it was decided that Rowan Cheshire would not compete in the women's halfpipe event, which began just three days later.\nShort track speed skating.\nBased on their performance at the two World Cup events in November 2013, Great Britain qualified 3 men and 2 women.\nThe team for GB was named on 16 December 2013."

        "text": "Ukraine competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from 7 to 23 February 2014. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine sent a total of 43 athletes.\nThe women's relay victory gave Ukraine its second Winter Games gold medal ever. The first was won by Oksana Baiul at the 1994 Winter Olympics. On 22 February, cross-country skier Maryna Lisohor was excluded from the Olympics after testing positive for trimetazidine.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nUkraine qualified 2 berths, one male and one female.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their performance at the 2012 and 2013 Biathlon World Championships, Ukraine qualified 5 men and 6 women.\nCross-country skiing.\nUkraine qualified 7 berths.\nAccording to press reports Lisogor and Serdyuk had refused to start because they had been denied to wear black arm bands to honor those killed in the violent clashes Ukraine's capital Kyiv the previous day. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine claimed Serdyuk was injured.\nFigure skating.\nUkraine has achieved the following quota places:\nFreestyle skiing.\nUkraine qualified 7 berths, three male and four female (all aerial).\nLuge.\nUkraine has qualified a total of six athletes and a spot in the team relay.\nNordic combined.\nUkraine qualified one male athlete.\nShort track speed skating.\nUkraine qualified 1 woman in the 1000 m for the Olympics during World Cup 3 and 4 in November 2013.\nSnowboarding.\nUkraine qualified 2 berths, one male and one female (all parallel).\nConcerns and controversies.\nOn 19 February 2014, Ukrainian athletes asked for and were refused permission by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to wear black armbands to honour those killed in the violent clashes in Ukraine's capital Kyiv on the previous day. According to IOC spokesman Mark Adams, \"They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. The Ukrainian NOC met with IOC officials informally yesterday. They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment. Some athletes have taken other views and other ways of doing things\". IOC president Thomas Bach offered his condolences \"to those who have lost loved ones in these tragic events\".\nAlpine skier Bohdana Matsotska refused to participate further at the Olympic Games in protest against the violence. She and her father posted a message on Facebook stating, \"In solidarity with the fighters on the barricades of the Maidan, and as a protest against the criminal actions made towards the protesters, the irresponsibility of the president and his issues with the government, we refuse further performance at the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014\". Matsotska was reportedly followed by about thirty Ukrainian athletes who left Sochi and returned to their country (mostly after having competed), leaving a dozen present at the Games.\nOn 20 February 2014, the Ukrainian NOC reported that as many as half of the Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics had left the games to return home. But according to Ukrainian NOC president Serhiy Bubka they had returned home in compliance with their original schedule, and their departure was thus not related to the riots in Kyiv. According to Bubka, the remaining athletes did plan to participate in the closing ceremony. In a statement on 20 February 2014, the Ukrainian team had expressed condolences for the dead and stated, \"We are thinking about our families and loved ones back home in Ukraine, and we are doing our best to honour them on the fields of play here in Sochi. We appeal for peace and mutual understanding to find a positive way forward for Ukraine\".\nFigure skater Natalia Popova stated after finishing her figure skating short program on 20 February, \"That’s very unfortunate because you just want peace everywhere. But all I can do is just focus on my performance and, hopefully, my skating can inspire the people back in Ukraine to be more peaceful with each other\". Olympic biathlete Olena Pidhrushna at a news conference after her women's relay victory asked for a minute's silence in memory of the people who died in Kyiv."

        "text": "Brian Christopher Goodwin (born November 2, 1990) is an American professional baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Cincinnati Reds and Chicago White Sox. Before his professional career, Goodwin played college baseball for the North Carolina Tar Heels.\nAmateur career.\nBorn and raised in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Goodwin attended Rocky Mount High School where he was a three-sport athlete in baseball, football, and basketball. Goodwin was named Gatorade North Carolina Baseball Player of the Year during his senior season, and also received All-Conference honors in football as a cornerback and kick returner.\nGoodwin attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he hit .291, tied the school record for triples in a single season, led the team in RBIs, and was named a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American. However, Goodwin transferred to Miami-Dade College, due to issues with his grades. As a sophomore at Miami-Dade, Goodwin hit .382 with a .500 on-base percentage. In 2010, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Goodwin committed to play baseball at the University of South Carolina following the 2011 season.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Nationals.\nGoodwin was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 17th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft out of Rocky Mount High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He did not sign and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was then drafted by the Washington Nationals in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Goodwin joined the Auburn Doubledays along with other draft picks for the 2011 season, but was not added to the active roster.\nPrior to the 2012 season, \"Baseball America\" ranked Goodwin as the Nationals fifth best prospect. Goodwin made his debut that year for the Class-A Hagerstown Suns. He was promoted to Double-A Harrisburg Senators after hitting .324/.438/.542 with nine home runs and 38 runs batted in.

Goodwin hit his first major league home run on June 2, 2017, at the Oakland Coliseum, connecting for a two-run shot to right-center off Oakland Athletics relief pitcher Zach Neal, amid a four-hit outburst that marked his best day at the plate in his major league career to that point. On July 27, 2017, Goodwin touched off back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Nationals against Michael Blazek of the Milwaukee Brewers, hitting a two-run shot that scored pitcher Max Scherzer from first base to begin the onslaught. It was the first time the feat had been accomplished in Major League Baseball since the 2011 season.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn July 22, 2018, the Nationals traded Goodwin to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for minor league pitcher Jacob Condra-Bogan. Goodwin was released by the Royals on March 25, 2019.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn March 27, 2019, Goodwin was claimed off release waivers by the Los Angeles Angels.

        "title": "David Dahl (baseball)",
        "text": "David Martin Dahl (born April 1, 1994) is an American professional baseball outfielder in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. He was selected by the Colorado Rockies in the first round of the 2012 MLB draft out of Oak Mountain High School in Birmingham, Alabama. Dahl made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2016, and was an All-Star in 2019. He has also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres.\nAmateur career.\nDahl attended Oak Mountain High School in Birmingham, Alabama. As a freshman, he made the school's varsity baseball team as a shortstop. In 2011, Dahl was selected to play for the United States 18-and-under national baseball team, and appeared in the 2011 Pan American Games. Dahl recorded 11 runs batted in (RBIs) during the 15 games of the tournament, in which the United States won the gold medal.\nIn 2012, his senior season at Oak Mountain, Dahl had a .412 batting average, 34 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases as an outfielder. He committed to attend Auburn University on a scholarship to play college baseball for the Auburn Tigers.\nProfessional career.\nColorado Rockies.\nThe Colorado Rockies selected Dahl in the first round, with the tenth overall selection, of the 2012 MLB draft. Dahl signed with the Rockies, receiving a $2.6 million signing bonus, rather than follow through on his commitment to attend Auburn University. He made his professional debut for the Grand Junction Rockies of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, hitting .379/.423/.625 with nine home runs and 57 RBIs. He was named the Pioneer League's most valuable player.\nPrior to the 2013 season, Dahl was ranked as the Rockies second best prospect by \"Baseball America\". He was also ranked as the 58th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com. The Rockies suspended Dahl at the beginning of the season, reportedly because he missed a team flight, and played in ten games for the Asheville Tourists of the Class A South Atlantic League, missing the remainder of the season due to a torn hamstring. Dahl began the 2014 season with Asheville, and was promoted to the Modesto Nuts of the Class A-Advanced California League in July. Between Asheville and Modesto, Dahl batted .299, hit 14 home runs, and stole 21 bases for the season.\nOn May 28, 2015, while playing for the New Britain Rock Cats of the Class AA Eastern League, Dahl collided with a teammate during a game while chasing a fly ball, and suffered a spleen laceration. After surgery to repair the damage, Dahl opted to have his spleen removed, rather than waiting for it to heal, in order to return to baseball with less recovery time. Allowing it to heal would have cost Dahl the remainder of the season, while removing it left him with a recovery time of four to six weeks. He resumed playing baseball in July, with a six-game rehabilitation stint with the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, before returning to New Britain. Dahl finished the season with a .278 batting average, six home runs, and 22 stolen bases.\nThe Rockies invited Dahl to spring training as a non-roster player in 2016. Dahl began the 2016 season with the Hartford Yard Goats of the Eastern League. After he batted .278 with 13 home runs, 45 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases for Hartford, the Rockies promoted Dahl to the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Dahl appeared in the All-Star Futures Game as an injury replacement for Austin Meadows. After batting .484 in 16 games for Albuquerque, the Rockies promoted Dahl to MLB on July 25, 2016, and he made his MLB debut that night as the Rockies' starting left fielder. Dahl recorded his first MLB hit off the Baltimore Orioles' Yovani Gallardo during his debut. On August 11, 2016, Dahl pushed a career-opening hitting streak to 17 games, tying the MLB record set by Chuck Aleno in 1941. The hitting streak ended at 17 games.\nDuring spring training in 2017, Dahl had a stress fracture in a rib, making it painful to swing the bat. After developing back spasms while rehabilitating in July, the Rockies shut Dahl down for the season.\nIn 2019, Dahl played 100 games, hitting .302 with 15 home runs and 61 RBI. He was named to the National League All-Star roster and recorded a single in the All-Star Game. Dahl's 2020 season saw his offensive production regress as he also battled with injury. In 99 plate appearances, Dahl hit .183 with eight RBIs. On December 2, Dahl was nontendered by the Rockies.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn December 15, 2020, the Texas Rangers signed Dahl to a one year, $2.7 million contract for the 2021 season. In 205 at-bats for the Rangers, Dahl hit .210 with four home runs and 18 RBIs. On August 2, 2021, Dahl was designated for assignment by the Rangers. On August 6, Dahl was released by the Rangers.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn August 17, 2021, Dahl signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He played for the Nashville Sounds before he was released on July 12, 2022.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn July 22, 2022, Dahl signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals organization.

        "text": "John Cooney (born 1 May 1990) is an Irish rugby union player who plays scrum-half for Irish provincial side Ulster in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup, having previously played for Leinster and Connacht, and has eleven caps for Ireland. Since joining Ulster in 2017, he has been nominated for EPCR European Player of the Year once, been named in the Pro14 Dream Team four times, and been Ulster's player of the year twice.\nHe is the first player to play over 20 games for three different Irish provinces. Ulster describe him as a \"talismanic player ... known for his sniping runs, kicking success, and ability to dictate games\" whose \"performances for the province have seen him consistently rank among the top points-scorers in the PRO14, now United Rugby Championship, competition.\"\nEarly life and family.\nBorn in Dublin, Cooney grew up in the suburb of Terenure, and was educated at Gonzaga College and University College Dublin. His father, John Cooney senior, who was born in Blantyre in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, was a journalist who worked for the \"Glasgow Herald\" before becoming European correspondent, and later religious affairs correspondent, for \"The Irish Times\" and the \"Irish Independent\", and published a critical biography of the former Catholic Primate of Ireland John Charles McQuaid, \"Ruler of Catholic Ireland\". His mother is from County Sligo. His uncle by marriage is the journalist and author Martin Sixsmith.\nClub career.\nLeinster.\nCooney made his senior debut for Leinster on 2 September 2011, when he started against Ospreys in Swansea during the opening game of the 2011–12 Pro12. He continued to make appearances for Leinster in the league, playing four more times, though each of these appearances came from the bench. Most of his appearances came while Leinster's front-line players were away at the 2011 World Cup, though he also scored his first try for the team later in the season in a win over Benetton Treviso. He made his European debut for the side in the final of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, coming on as a replacement scrum-half in Leinster's 42–14 win over Irish rivals Ulster and winning a medal in the process.\nIn the following season, he continued to feature for Leinster in the league making a total of 13 appearances in the 2012–13 Pro12, scoring try against Scarlets on 23 February 2013. Nine of these appearances came as a replacement. In Europe, he did not feature in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup as Leinster were knocked out in the pool stages. He did, however, come on as a replacement in three of the team's games in the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup, including the final against Stade Français, earning himself another European medal in the process.\nHe did not feature as regularly for Leinster in the 2013–14 season as he had the year before, finding himself behind internationals Eoin Reddan and Isaac Boss on the depth chart. He made his first appearance in the 2013–14 Pro12 against Cardiff Blues as a replacement, and went on to make a further four appearances in the league, all of these coming as starts. He scored a try against Zebre on 9 February 2014. In the 2013–14 Heineken Cup, he made one appearance for the side, being used as a replacement against Northampton Saints in the pool stages.\nConnacht.\nIt was announced in June 2014 that Cooney would be spending the 2014–15 season on loan at another Irish province, with both he and Leinster teammate Quinn Roux joining Connacht on loan. While Roux would return to Leinster in January 2015, Cooney agreed a deal to play with Connacht until the end of the season.\nUlster.\nAfter the IRFU prevented South African international Ruan Pienaar from extending his contract, Ulster signed Cooney from Connacht as his replacement ahead of the 2017–18 season. He made 25 appearances in his first season with the province, including 22 starts, and scored five tries, 37 conversions and 42 penalties, totalling 225 points. He also made 14 try assists. He was named at scrum-half in the Pro14 Dream Team for the season, having topped the league in points scored, try assists, penalties and passes, and come second in clean breaks. In the 2018 Ulster Rugby Awards, he was named Player of the Year, Rugby Writers' Player of the Year, and Supporters' Club Player of the Year.\nIn his second season with Ulster, he made 20 appearances, including 18 starts, and scored 142 points, including three tries, made eight try assists, and was named \"man of the match\" twice. He was again named in the Pro14 Dream Team. In the 2019–20 season he made 20 appearances including 18 starts, and scored 180 points including ten tries.

His season was ended in April by a neck injury sustained in the Challenge Cup semi-final against Leicester Tigers. A hamstring injury sustained against Glasgow Warriors in the opening match in September 2021, and a calf injury sustained against Munster in January 2022, reduced his involvement in the 2021–22 season, but he made his 100th appearance for the province in the URC quarter-final victory over Munster on 3 June 2022.\nIn December 2022 he won the inaugural URC Difference Maker award for his volunteer work with Belfast Central Mission's befriending service.\nInternational.\nCooney represented Ireland four times at U-18s level and played eleven times for the Irish U-20s squad.

        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team is the intercollegiate women's basketball program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play home basketball games at the Crisler Center on the university campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nHistory.\nMichigan began playing intercollegiate women's basketball in 1973–74, when inaugural head coach Vic Katch led the team to a 3–8 record (0–1 against Big Ten teams). There was no form of conference competition for the Wolverines until the 1976–77 season, and even then it was not officially sanctioned by the Big Ten until 1982–83. Michigan did not qualify for postseason play until earning an NCAA tournament bid in 1990 under head coach Bud VanDeWege, which would remain its only tournament appearance until Sue Guevara led the Wolverines to five straight postseason appearances (in both the NCAA and WNIT tournaments) between 1998 and 2002.\nThe team's best postseason performance in the NCAA Tournament is advancing to the Elite Eight, which it achieved for the first time in 2022. The Wolverines won the WNIT tournament in 2017, and have also reached the WNIT semifinals twice: in 2010 and 2015. Michigan has never won a Big Ten championship, either in the regular season or in the conference tournament. The closest it has come is 2nd in the regular season and tied for 3rd in the tournament, both accomplished during Guevara's tenure. Guevara was the most accomplished coach in the history of the program, leading all coaches in both wins and winning percentage for conference and overall games alike.\nSince 2012, Michigan is coached by Kim Barnes Arico, the former St. John's Red Storm head coach and two-time Big East Coach of the Year. During a February 2017 game against Michigan State, the Wolverines set an attendance record of 12,707 in the first home sellout in program history, which more than doubled the previous record of 5,991. The second-largest home crowd (8,313) attended a January 2018 game against Ohio State. Later that same week, during the January 13th game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Katelynn Flaherty scored her 2,443rd point, surpassing Glen Rice as the school's all-time leading scorer, man or woman. Flaherty would finish her career with a school-record 2,776 points.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Barnes Arico became the winningest coach in program history. On July 12, 2018, Barnes Arico signed a contract extension with the Wolverines through the 2022–23 season.\nDuring the 2021–22 season, Michigan reached their highest ranking ever in the AP Poll at No. 4. On December 19, 2021, Michigan earned the program's first ever win over a top-five ranked team when they defeated No. 5 Baylor 74–68 in overtime. On January 31, 2022, Michigan earned their second ever win over a top-five ranked team when they defeated No. 5 Indiana 65–50.\nCoaching staff.\nHead coaching records.\n\"Head coaching records through the end of the 2022-23 season\"\nArena.\nMichigan has played its home games at Crisler Center (previously known as Crisler Arena) since it began intercollegiate play during the 1973–74 season. The first women's basketball game played at Crisler took place on February 4, 1974 and saw the Western Michigan Broncos defeat Michigan 54–28. Crisler Arena was built in 1967 at a cost of $7.2 million, and has undergone three major renovations since, in 1998, 2001, and 2012. In 2002, the women's locker room was more than doubled in size and given a complete facelift. The 2012 renovation saw the addition of the William Davidson Player Development Center (WDPDC), a 57,000-foot basketball facility for both the women's and men's teams adjacent to the arena proper, and the renaming of the entire complex to Crisler Center. The first floor of the WDPDC houses two basketball practice courts, team locker rooms for both players and coaches, athletic medicine facilities, and an equipment room, while the second floor is home to offices for both the men's and women's coaching staffs and administrative functions, as well as rooms dedicated to recruiting, analyzing game film, and strength and conditioning. The 2012 renovation also resulted in major upgrades to the arena's infrastructure, a new scoreboard, replacement of all the seats in both the upper and lower bowls, more handicap-accessible seating, and major improvements to the arena's entrances and concourses. Completed in two separate phases, it cost $72 million in total.\nHonored players and coaches.\nWomen's National Invitation Tournament MVP\nBig Ten Player of the Year\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\nBig Ten Defensive Player of the Year\nBig Ten Sixth Player of the Year\nAll-Americans\nBig Ten Coach of the Year\nNCAA tournament results.\nMichigan has appeared in twelve NCAA Tournaments, with a combined record of 11–12."

        "text": "The 2013–14 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team's head coach was Roy Williams, who is in his 11th season as UNC's head men's basketball coach. They played their home games at the Dean E. Smith Center as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They finished the season 24–10, 13–5 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament to Pittsburgh. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Providence in the second round before losing in the third round to Iowa State.\nPre-season.\nThe Tar Heels entered the 2013–14 season lost two starters from the previous season as Dexter Strickland graduated and second team All-ACC shooting guard Reggie Bullock declared for the 2013 NBA draft. However, rising juniors and potential draft picks James Michael McAdoo and P. J. Hairston decided to return to Chapel Hill and UNC brought in a strong recruiting class including McDonald's All-Americans Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks.\nAnother offseason change involved the coaching staff as long-time Roy Williams assistant Joe Holladay retired. UNC alum Brad Frederick joined the staff as Director of Basketball Operations in June. Frederick came from the coaching staff at Vanderbilt, where he had been for 14 seasons. He is the son of former Kansas Athletic Director Bob Frederick.\nHowever, the optimism of the Spring turned to uncertainty in the Summer as both Hairston and fifth year senior Leslie McDonald were both suspended from the team due to eligibility concerns, leaving only two scholarship guards (sophomore Marcus Paige and freshman Nate Britt) on the roster entering the season. McDonald would be reinstated in the non-conference season, but Hairston's suspension would hold for the entire season.\nEven with this uncertainty, North Carolina was voted #13 in the AP preseason poll and #11 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. The ACC media tabbed the Tar Heels third in the conference preseason poll.\nRecruits.\nThe top-rated recruit in the class scheduled to start college in Fall 2013 is Isaiah Hicks, the eighth ranked power forward and the 18th ranked player in the ESPN 100. Shortly behind him in that ranking is Kennedy Meeks at #59. He is the #6 ranked center in the 2013 high school class. Britt is the 52nd ranked player in the current high school class and 11th point guard. He tore his meniscus in December 2012.\nSeason.\nNon-conference play.\nThe Tar Heels started the season with uncertainty as Hairston's and McDonald's eligibility cases remained in limbo for the first nine games of the season. After uneventful victories over Oakland and Holy Cross, the Heels were stunned 83–80 at home by Belmont, in part because of a 22–48 performance at the free throw line. However, the team would redeem themselves by beating #3 Louisville in the Hall of Fame Tip Off championship. Marcus Paige led the team with 32 points while post players Brice Johnson and Kennedy Meeks controlled the paint and the Heels won 93–84. Paige was named ACC Player of the Week for his performance against the Cardinals and the Richmond Spiders in the previous game (26 points).\nNorth Carolina's inconsistency would show itself again as the Heels lost their next game - an 83–86 contest at UAB, coached by former Roy Williams assistant Jerod Haase. But true to form, the Heels bounced back and beat #1 Michigan State on the road in a game they never trailed. Kennedy Meeks led the team in scoring with 15 and was named ACC Rookie of the Week. After an easy home win over UNC Greensboro (coached by Wes Miller, another Williams disciple), the Tar Heels completed a sweep of the top three teams in the preseason polls by upending #11 Kentucky at the Dean Smith Center. Paige and James Michael McAdoo were the stars, scoring 23 and 20 points respectively.\nOn December 18, the team received the news that Leslie McDonald would be reinstated in time for the Texas game at the Smith Center. However, the Tar Heels lost to the young Longhorns.

Wilson was included in the 1914 team picture with rest of the Stanley Cup championship team, however he was subsequently released from the Blueshirts the following season. He later returned; signing a contract to play with the Blueshirts on October 26, 1914; and played for three games in the 1915–16 season as the backup netminder to Percy LeSueur.\nIn late December 1916, Wilson, still under contract with the Blueshirts, was suspended by Toronto owner Eddie Livingstone when he \"mysteriously disappeared\" before a game against the Montreal Canadiens, until he relayed to the club he was in his hometown of Oshawa. His absence caused Billy Nicholson, the backup to play in the first two games. For this incident, Wilson was subsequently fined $100 and ordered back to Toronto by the hockey club."

Russia captured bronze, beating the Netherlands 4–3.\nBackground and qualification.\nThe women's water polo tournament at the 2000 Summer Olympics was the first time the tournament was held at the Olympic Games. Previous tournaments included the World Aquatics Championships (since 1986) and the World Cup (since 1979). Despite it being held as a demonstration sport at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, women's water polo was not accepted as part of the 2000 Olympics until October 1997.\n15 teams attempted to qualify through to the tournament with two qualification paths to the Olympics. The World Cup, which was held in Winnipeg, Canada, where the Netherlands and Canada qualified through as the leading European and American team for the tournament. The final qualifier was held in Palermo, Italy, in April 2000. The top two teams (Russia and the United States) qualified. Kazakhstan, who finished in sixth place, qualified through the spot reserved for Asian teams.\nPreliminary round.\nSummary.\nThe tournament began on 16 September 2000, with all six teams competing on the first day. In the first match, Olga Leshchuk scored the opening goal of the tournament for Kazakhstan, but Australia dominated with Bridgette Gusterson scoring three goals and Yvette Higgins two goals as Australia defeated Kazakhstan 9–2. The following match saw Russia and Canada finish with a seven all draw which the \"Edmonton Journal\" described as a match like \"old style Russia-Canada hockey\". The final match of the opening day saw the United States defeat the Netherlands 6–4, despite the Dutch coming back early in the third quarter.\nThe following day, Australia became the only team to be two for two in the tournament after breaking the three all deadlock with goals from Gusterson and Melissa Mills as they went on to defeat Russia 6–3. The Americans came back from a three goal deficit at the start of the final quarter to secure a goal in the last seconds of the game to finish with a draw with Canada. For the Canadians, the plan to control the shot-clock failed because of errors leading to their second draw of the tournament. The final match of the second day saw the Netherlands defeat Kazakhstan 8–6 with Daniëlle de Bruijn and Marjan op den Velde both scoring three goals in the victory.\nDay three of the preliminary round saw the first loss for the Australians, 5–4 to the Dutch. This was despite three goals from Yvette Higgins as the Dutch took the victory at the start of the final quarter. The Americans took top spot in the group after Coralie Simmons scored three goals as they worked their way to a 7–5 win over Russia. Four Canadians scored two goals each in the final match of the day as they romped over Kazakhstan 10–3 to record their first win of the campaign. In the process, they kept Leschuk goalless in the match.\nThe fourth day of the preliminary round saw the first teams to qualify through to the semi-finals. In the opening match of the day, the Australians defeated the undefeated Americans 7–6 to book a spot in the semis with the United States. In a tense match, the Australians got the victory from a turnover when Bridgette Gusterson scored the winning goal with a long shot in the last thirty seconds of the match. The first half dominance by Russia strengthened their chance of a semi-final as they scored ten goals, five of those being from player advantage situations. This performance led to the biggest victory of the tournament, as Russia won 15–6, knocking Kazakhstan out of the tournament in the process. The Netherlands became the third team to qualify through to the semis after two goals from Danielle de Bruijn and Karin Kuipers secured a 7–4 win over Canada.\nThe final day of the preliminary round began on 20 September. In the opening match, Australia finished top of the group after defeating the Canadians 9–4 with goalkeeper, Danielle Woodhouse saving nine of the 13 shots for Australia and Simone Hankin scoring three goals in the victory. The following match, Russia book the final spot in the semis with a 6–3 win over the Netherlands, knocking Canada out of the competition in the process. Sofia Konoukh was the top scorer in the match with three goals, as the Russians played with greater tenacity and purpose. In the final match of the preliminary round, the United States took their advantage of power plays, scoring five out of seven attempts as they went to win 9–6 over Kazakhstan.\nStandings.\n&lt;section begin=Standings/&gt;&lt;section end=Standings/&gt;\nMatches.\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A7 /&gt;&lt;section end=A7 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A8 /&gt;&lt;section end=A8 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A9 /&gt;&lt;section end=A9 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A10 /&gt;&lt;section end=A10 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A11 /&gt;&lt;section end=A11 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A12 /&gt;&lt;section end=A12 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A13 /&gt;&lt;section end=A13 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A14 /&gt;&lt;section end=A14 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A15 /&gt;&lt;section end=A15 /&gt;\nFinal round.\nSemifinals.\nThe women's tournament semifinals took place on 22 September. The opening semi saw the Australians take on Russia. During the opening half, the Australians struggled across both ends of the pool as the Russians opened up a 4–3 lead at half-time. The Russians seeming to be in control and with five minutes left, held firm with a 6–4 lead. But three late goals, including two in the last ninety seconds, booked the Australians a spot in the final with a 7–6 victory. At the end of the match, coach Istvan Gorgenyi responded saying, \"the girls made a miracle happen with their hearts\".\nIn the other semi-final, the Americans fought hard as they knocked out the then-World Cup champions, the Netherlands 6–5. This was due partly to two goals from Maureen O'Toole and Coralie Simmons. At the end of the match, United States coach Guy Baker said, \"we know we're going to get a medal, a lot of this is indescribable\".\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n5th place match.\nThe battle for fifth place took place on the same day as the semi-finals, with the Canadians coming out on top in the match with a goal by Jana Salat in the second period of overtime, giving Canada the fifth spot.\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\nBronze medal match.\nThe second-to-last match of the tournament saw the Russians take home the bronze medal as they defeated the Netherlands 4–3. Two goals in the last two minutes of the match from Sofia Konoukh and Ioulia Petrova brought Russia back from a 3–2 deficit to the bronze medal. For the Netherlands, this meant they had failed to win a medal in a major water polo competition across 17 tournaments in the World Cup and the World Championships.\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\nGold medal match.\nWith a crowd of 17,000 watching the gold medal match, including Australian prime minister John Howard, the Australians and the Americans battled in a final which went undecided until the last few seconds. The Americans had opened up a one-goal lead in the first and second quarter before the Australians leveled the match at two all after three quarters.\nGoalkeeping from both Bernice Orwig and Liz Weekes kept the match level until the final two minutes when Naomi Castle gave the Australians the lead with a goal at a player advantage. Brenda Villa tied the match at three all with only 13 seconds left in the match as the Americans took the advantage of a foul by the Australians. In the final seconds, a foul was called on Julie Swail of the U.S., and with 1.3 seconds left on the clock, the Australians scored the match winning goal from Yvette Higgins to give Australia not only the win but their first gold medal in women's water polo.\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\nFinal ranking.\nAt the end of the tournament, Australia recorded their fourth gold medal in a major water polo competition. Their three previous gold medals were won in 1984, 1995 (both FINA World Cups) and the 1986 World Aquatic Championships. "

        "text": "Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World is an autobiography written by American rock climber Lynn Hill. Co-written with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, it was published in 2002 by W.W. Norton &amp; Company.\nHill describes the writing process with Child as collaborative: \"He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was.\" Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to \"convey the history and culture of free climbing\", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: \"And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point, because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there.\" Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.\nReception.\nOne review of the book described it as \"more diary than memoir\" and praises Hill's storytelling when recounting her adventurous climbs but contends that it ultimately fails due to a lack of editing. Too much personal detail about family and boyfriends is included. \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"Library Journal\", on the other hand, found it entertaining and wrote glowingly of Hill's ability to narrate a good story."

        "text": "Harry Edward Welch Jr. (born April 4, 1945) is a retired American High school football coach who is one of the most successful in California prep football history. In a 43-year coaching career, 25 of which were as a head coach, Welch averaged over 10 wins per season. He finished with a career coaching record of 257 wins, 61 losses and 2 ties—an 80.6% winning percentage. Welch is the only California high school football coach to lead three different schools to state championship wins on the field. In that realm he was a perfect 3–0. In late 2009, Welch was recognized by the Los Angeles Daily News as the high school \"Football Coach of the Decade,\" covering the 2000–09 seasons. In the ten-year span, nine of which he coached, Welch's overall record was 100-17 (.855). He boasted double-digit wins the last seven years of the decade that included two state championships and two undefeated campaigns. In 2022, Welch's fruitful career was acknowledged and honored with being chosen to two Halls of Fame—the California Interscholastic Federation – Southern Section (CIF-SS) Hall of Fame and in the inaugural class of the California High School Football Hall of Fame. Although widely known for his football success, Welch's career accomplishments carried beyond athletics. His leadership on the football field was equally paired with his dedication as an academic educator. Welch was a gifted teacher who spent as many years in the classroom as he did on the field.\nEarly years.\nWelch was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 4, 1945, to Harry Edward Welch Sr. and Marie Agnes Welch (\"nee\" Snow), joining older sisters June and Diane. In 1954, at age 9, the Welch family moved to Tarzana, California, where his father was employed in the theater business.\nHigh school.\nFor high school, Welch enrolled at the newly opened Crespi High School in Encino. There he played on the football team, being utilized at nearly every position on both sides of the ball, including quarterback. In addition, Welch was very active in student government. During the 1961 season, he solidified a place in the early history of the school's football program. On November 24, Welch threw the first touchdown pass in school playoff history—a 10-yard strike to Pat Breaux in a 14–7 loss at Bishop Union High School. On October 6, 1962, Crespi hosted St. Bernard's (Playa Del Rey) in what was their first-ever Camino Real League game. During the first quarter, Celts' starting quarterback Tom Mooney left with an ankle injury. Welch, the team's backup, came on to lead his club to a 19–6 victory and maintain an undefeated slate of 3–0 to start the season. That game, Welch completed 8-of-12 passes (66.7%) for 75 yards and engineered all three of his school's touchdown scoring drives.\nCollege.\nUpon graduating high school in 1963, Welch headed north to the Bay Area and attended Santa Clara University for one year before returning to the Los Angeles area. He continued his studies at nearby San Fernando Valley State College (now known as California State University, Northridge) and received his bachelor's degree in history and English in 1967. Shortly thereafter, he earned his master's degree and teaching credential.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school and junior college.\nWelch embarked on a coaching career as an assistant at his alma mater, Crespi High School, in 1965 while still completing his college degree. One of his most notable players for the Celts was Randy Cross, an offensive lineman who would go on to play at the University of California, Los Angeles and emerge as an All-Pro selection and three-time Super Bowl champion with the San Francisco 49ers. Welch later moved on to be an assistant coach at Los Angeles Valley College from 1974 to 1978. With the Monarchs, he mentored future NFL professionals Odis McKinney, Vernon Dean and Jack Steptoe. The 1975 team won the Metro Conference title, were Potato Bowl champions and concluded the season ranked No. 2 in the national polls.\nCanyon High School.\nIn 1982, at age 37, Welch was named the head coach at Canyon High School and served in that capacity for twelve seasons from 1982 through 1993. It was the first of his two stints with the Cowboys. After just one season, Welch enjoyed success with three-consecutive CIF-Southern Section (CIF-SS) championships while posting a 46-game winning streak along the way, over parts of three seasons (1983–85). He led Canyon to the 1983 Northwestern Conference title with a win over Bishop Montgomery (Torrance) 40–24 at College of the Canyons. The following season his team defeated Santa Maria 33–6 for a second-consecutive Northwestern Conference title, again at College of the Canyons. In 1985, the Cowboys completed the trifecta, their third championship in succession, with a hard-fought 9–7 victory versus Antelope Valley at Canyon. In 1988, Antelope Valley avenged that defeat to claim the Division II title 28–22 in what would be Welch's only championship game setback of his entire career. In 1993, after twelve successful seasons, he stepped away from the field but remained a teacher at the school.\nOne of Welch's anchors on the Cowboy defense from 1988 to 1990 was the late Chuck Osborne Jr. The talented defensive tackle was selected All-Golden Valley League and All-Santa Clarita Valley First-Team - Defense in 1991. Osborne played college football at the University of Arizona where he was a key member of the famed \"Desert Swarm\" defense.\nOn August 30, 1990, Welch and his team had a very memorable experience during the early nonleague portion of the schedule. Canyon traveled 3,000 miles to Honolulu, Hawaii to face powerful Saint Louis High School. The Crusaders had a 55-consecutive game winning streak that dated back to late 1985. Welch and the Cowboys completely dominated the game and ended the streak in shocking fashion, 40–0. The Crusaders were never shutout by a Mainland opponent before that game or since. The 40-point margin of defeat is still the third-most in Saint Louis history versus a school from the continental United States—only being bested in the past 10 years by other well-known prep powers: 49 points in 2014 by St. John Bosco (Bellflower, California) and 42 points in 2022 by Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas, Nevada).\nIn 2001 Welch returned once again as the head coach at Canyon and led the Cowboys to two-consecutive CIF-SS titles in 2005 and 2006. The 2005 Division II title game marked a showdown between Canyon and neighboring Foothill League rival Hart (Newhall). The two schools, separated by less than 10 miles, travelled all the way to the Home Depot Center in Carson to decide the outcome. Canyon came away with the 21–13 win as they beat the Indians for the second time in the span of a month.\nWelch's 2006 team squeezed past Moorpark 24–22 in the Northern Division Championship game. It was the second win over the Musketeers that season. The Cowboys were then selected to represent the South in the first true high school championship game in California since the 1927 season. Canyon was pitted against the juggernaut program that reigned California prep football for two decades -- Concord De La Salle. On December 16, 2006, the undaunted Cowboys rolled past the Spartans 27–13 to claim the State Division I Championship Bowl Game—the first of Welch's three state titles. Just weeks later, in early January 2007, Welch resigned from his position at Canyon.\nWhile at Canyon Welch became a distinguished English literature teacher. His class offerings were unique and thought provoking which led them to become student favorites. The most popular courses were his Bible as Literature and Shakespeare classes. For five years Welch served as a mentor in the William S. Hart Union High School District and in 1991 was voted \"Teacher of the Year\" at Canyon.\nSt. Margaret's.\nIn 2007, shortly after his departure from Canyon, Welch accepted the head coaching position at St. Margaret's Episcopal School. At the same time he relocated his residence to Orange County (California). Welch was at the helm of the Tartan's program for three remarkable seasons. He guided the program to a near flawless record of 42–1, which included a 30-game winning streak, three CIF-SS championships and one California State Bowl title over the three-season period of 2007–09.\nThe first season, 2007, St. Margaret's finished 14–0 and won the CIF-SS Northeast Division title by defeating [Brentwood School] (Los Angeles), 37–6 on a neutral field (Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks). The Tartan's high-octane offense scored a then Orange County (California) single-season record 674 points.\nThe 2008 season saw St. Margaret's move up a division level. Undaunted, they finished undefeated once again (15–0) and claimed the CIF-SS East Valley Division crown, against [Twentynine Palms High School] at home, 17–3. The following week the Tartans won 59–7 as they dominated Hamilton Union High School (Chico) at the Home Depot Center (Carson) in the inaugural California State Small School Championship Bowl Game. A highlight of the season was the 742 points the team scored—another new Orange County record and fourth-best total in CIF-SS history. Welch notched his 200th career victory the middle of the season against Western Christian High School (Upland, California), 58–7.\nIn December 2009, St. Margaret's travelled over 300 miles one-way, to play a postseason semifinal game at Bishop Union High School. The school, located in Inyo County, has an elevation of 4,150 feet. Weather conditions were inclement enough for the game to be considered the \"coldest recorded football game\" in CIF-SS history—an immediate chapter in playoff lore. After the 7:30 p.m. start, temperatures dropped to approximately 30 degrees, with winds blowing at 18 mph (40 mph gusts) and a wind chill factor of 19 degrees. The Tartans prevailed 47–6.\nThe following week, at Ontario Christian, the wind chill was a bit higher at 43 degrees but the elements were again challenging as the Tartans played on a muddy track and captured another title, 12–6, scoring a late touchdown to seal the triumph.\nThe win was St. Margaret's fourth-consecutive CIF-SS title (2006–09) which was also an Orange County record and placed the Tartans in \"rare air\" as one of only three programs in CIF-SS history to accomplish such a feat: Temple City, 1969–72 and St. Bonaventure (Ventura), 1999–2002 were the other two. The school won a CIF-SS title the season before Welch arrived under the leadership of coach Jason Hitchens.\nAt the conclusion of the 2010 season, Welch resigned from his position at St. Margaret's and accepted the head coaching role at Santa Margarita Catholic High School. His final record with the Tartans was an unrivaled 42–1 (.976).\nSanta Margarita.\nWelch was introduced as the third head football coach in Santa Margarita Catholic High School football history on January 21, 2010. After posting consecutive 3–7 seasons in both 2008 and 2009, Santa Margarita hired Welch to return the program to greatness in the ever-rugged Trinity League. The coaching change made significant impact as the Eagles made a big jump forward as they finished 9–3. Turning in the right direction, the six-game improvement was the best increase in wins in the school's history.\nWith many experienced players, Welch guided the 2011 team to a 13–2 record and a victory in the CIF Division I State Championship Bowl Game. A late score in the contest by dual-threat quarterback Johnny Stanton was the difference in the dramatic 42–37 win over Bellarmine College Preparatory (San Jose) at the Home Depot Center. The club finished the season ranked as high as No. 10 in some national polls.\nThe 2012 season looked as if the Eagles would challenge for another state crown and even a national championship with Stanton returning at quarterback along with one of his most reliable receivers, River Cracraft. The pair went on to successful college careers and played in the NFL for several seasons. Santa Margarita started the season ranked highly in several polls—touted as No. 1 in the nation by Rivals.com and No. 2 by USA Today. The Eagles looked unstoppable as they jumped out to a 6–0 record before a season-ending injury to Stanton deflated the momentum. Santa Margarita fell for its perch with their first loss at the hands of rival Mater Dei (Santa Ana), 24–7. The team qualified for the postseason but could not recreate the magic of the prior year and finished with a respectable record of 9–3. The contest versus Trabuco Hills High School (Mission Viejo) game in the third week was Welch's 300th overall game coached. The lopsided 55–0 victory gave him 246 wins in his first 300 contests.\nPrior to the commencement of the 2013 season, Welch announced that his fourth season at Santa Margarita would be his last. Following a disappointing 4–6 campaign, Welch stepped down after completing his 25th season as a head football coach at the high school level, 38th year of high school coaching and 43rd year in coaching overall (including five years at Los Angeles Valley College). Welch's final tally at Santa Margarita was 35 wins and 14 losses in his four seasons with Santa Margarita, a .714 win-loss percentage.\nWelch had two signature wins while on the sidelines with Santa Margarita and they came on consecutive weeks. The first being a 27–13 victory over San Clemente High School in the 2011 CIF-SS Pac-5 championship game at Angel Stadium in Anaheim. The Eagles finally wrested control over the Tritons in the second half to move on. The announced attendance that night of 14,424 is the largest crowd ever to see an Eagles sporting event. The second was the spectacular 42–37 win over Bellarmine in the CIF Division I State Championship Bowl Game just six days later. Another key event in the school's football history came in 2012. Ranked as one of the best in the nation, Santa Margarita was selected by ESPN2 to play on national television the first game of the season—August 25 at Brophy College Preparatory (Phoenix), a 27–14 win for the Eagles.\n\"Tough Knocks\".\nIn the summer prior to the 2011 prep football season, the Orange County Register and its high school sports website ocvarsity.com produced an online reality-based series set around the Santa Margarita Catholic football program entitled \"Tough Knocks.\" Each week, a new installment, roughly 3–5 minutes in length, was released. The 17-episode series documented the drama and success of Welch's high-profile program with behind-the-scenes access of the athletes as they navigated through the challenging season. Episode 5 was extra special as it featured the program taking part in Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Coach Harry Welch recalled his own battle a year prior with prostate cancer.\nAccomplishments.\nWelch ended his career with 257 victories, 61 losses and 2 ties. His .806 winning percentage is second-best in California prep history among coaches with 250 career wins.\nThat .806 winning percentage puts Welch in the company of just one dozen other coaches in California prep history to achieve the 80.0%-or-above plateau. When he stepped away after 2013, Welch had the best winning percentage in both Orange County and CIF-SS history. He still ranks first in the county and third in the section all time.\nWelch won nine California Interscholastic Federation - Southern Section (CIF-SS) championships overall, including six in a seven-year span from 2005 to 2011. That included five in succession from 2005 to 2009. He was also victorious in all three California State Bowl Championship games coached: Canyon in 2006 (Division 1), St. Margaret's Episcopal School in 2008 (Small Schools - Division IV) and Santa Margarita Catholic in 2011 (Division I).\nWelch is the only coach in California prep history to win three state championships with three different schools: Canyon in 2006, St. Margaret's Episcopal in 2008 and Santa Margarita Catholic in 2011.\nAt 3–0 all time in California State Bowl Championship games, Welch is one of just a dozen coaches who have three-or-more state football titles in California history (among all eras). He is tied for the second-most state crowns by a Southern Section coach and one of only three that are undefeated.\nWhen combined with his perfect 3–0 mark in state championship games, Welch sports a career mark of 12–1 in all \"championship games.\" In such CIF-SS contests, he boasted a record of 9-1 (.900). In all, the 12–1 win-loss ledger equates to a .923 winning percentage—unrivaled by any other coach. From the 2005 through the 2011 seasons, Welch was victorious (6–0) in a Southern Section championship game every year except the 2010 season.\nSome of Welch's teams had impressive winning streaks, but they also enjoyed breaking them as well. The biggest such shocker came in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1990. After flying 3,000 miles, Canyon shut down Saint Louis, 40–0, and halted their state record of 55 wins in succession (regular and postseason). The other was in their stunning upset in the 2006 California State Championship Bowl game of vaunted De La Salle (Concord). Canyon put to rest the 21 game winning streak of the Spartans (regular and postseason).\nWelch coached 19 CIF-SS \"Divisional Players of the Year\" selections in his career.\nWelch won 246 of his first 300 games coached (82.0%). Only legendary coach Bob Ladouceur of De La Salle (Concord / North Coast Section) won more contests in both fewer games - 305 and fewer seasons - 23 1/2.\nWelch strung together two significant winning streaks in his tenure. Across the parts if three seasons, 1983, 1984 and 1985 at Canyon, the Cowboys won 46-consecutive. At St. Margaret's in the mid-2000s, the Tartans were victorious in 30-straight. Analyzed further, Welch can also claim a 41-game streak when counted across seasons at two schools from 2006 to 2009.\nWelch guided his clubs to four undefeated seasons: Canyon in 1984 (14–0) and 1985 (14–0) and St. Margaret's in 2007 (14–0) and 2008 (15–0).\nIn his career, Welch strung together two streaks of his clubs winning 10-or-more games in succession for multiple seasons. First at Canyon from 1983 through 1988 (6) and another, longer streak with Canyon and St. Margaret's between 2002 and 2009 (8).\nIn their undefeated 2007 season, St. Margaret's scored an incredible 674 points and was undefeated. This total set the all-time single-season scoring record for Orange County. The very next season, in 2008, the club once again established another record when they amassed 742 points. That total has since been exceeded but still remains one of the highest marks the Southland has ever seen.\nIn 2008, St. Margaret's finished the campaign 15–0. With this, the Tartans became the first team in Orange County history to reach the 15-or-more win plateau and also the first to have a perfect record at that level, in a single season. St. Margaret's ran their county-record winning streak to 44 games.\nWelch was selected to coach in prestigious prep all-star games featuring top graduating senior athletes. This included the annual North-South Shrine Classic at the Rose Bowl (Pasadena) in 1986 and 1987 and the Los Angeles Daily News All-Star Football Game Kickoff in 1984 and 1988. Additionally, in 2008, Welch coached in the inaugural Southern California Bowl, which pitted the Coastal Navy All-Stars (coached by Welch) versus the Inland Marines at Titan Stadium on the campus of Cal State Fullerton.\nWelch's powerhouse teams of the early 1980s and mid 2000s were a regular fixture in the top tier of the Cal-Hi Sports (CHS) state poll rankings. From 1983 to 1985, the Cowboys finished in the final top-3 each season. The 2005-06 teams were also in the top-3 in both the Overall and Division 1 categories. MaxPreps.com crowned Canyon No. 1 in California at the close of both 2005 and 2006 seasons and recognized them in their final national poll in the top-15 each time. The run at St. Margaret's Episcopal saw a top-10 rankings all four seasons Welch was present including No. 1 in Division V for 2007. At Santa Margarita, the teams were ranked high at the end of 2011 and into midseason of 2012. Welch's clubs were also routinely recognized by other respected media outlets, associations and affiliates such as: studentsports.com, Rivals.com, ESPNHS.com, the Los Angeles Times, the Orange County Register and USA Today.\nAs Welch's success began to increase in the mid-1980s, he was invited to lecture and teach at a myriad of football camps and clinics throughout the Western United States. After appearing locally in places like Westlake Village, Bullhead City, Arizona, Los Angeles and Irvine, he was included on the staff at a prestigious prep camp held in Lake Tahoe where he was featured alongside Bob Ladouceur of De La Salle (Concord). Between 1985 and 2007, Welch's energetic passion engaged audiences at the collegiate level at such schools as: Cal State-Northridge, USC, Nebraska, Fresno State, California (Berkeley), Brigham Young, Arizona State and UCLA. While in Lincoln, Welch established a relationship of mutual respect with Tom Osborne, head coach of the \"Big Red\" and College Football Hall of Fame member. He was also known to support local organizations as guest speaker or master of ceremonies, including the chamber of commerce, Boy Scouts and championship team reunions.\nAwards and honors.\n\"Coach of the Year\" Honors.\nWelch was bestowed with over two dozen \"Coach of the Year\" honors from various newspapers, online high school websites, coach's organizations and other outlets during his career. Many of those honors came in the latter part of Welch's career as the popularity of high school football increased, championship games at various levels were adopted and online coverage proliferated. Between the years of 2006 and 2011 alone, he garnered more than one dozen.\nCommunity / Media Popularity.\nThe Signal newspaper has covered the landscape of news in the Santa Clarity Valley for over 100 years. Welch's 30-year career of coaching success and teaching at Canyon were chronicled by the newspaper from beginning to end and after he departed. In the latter portion of his time at Canyon and after moving on, Welch was repeatedly awarded with honors and tributes. Many of these came from reader polls sponsored by the newspaper. Welch's accomplishments, character and newsmaking ability were celebrated. As the age of social media exploded in the decade of the 2000s, Welch was selected for his coaching prowess, character, participant in dramatic sports events and newsmaker.\nHistorical high school athletic success.\nIn December 2010, The Signal contacted 85 coaches and athletic directors in the area for their input on several facets of high schools sports history in the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV). Welch was tops in four categories of all-time success.\n10 greatest high school games of the last 25 years.\nSelected in Summer 2007\nPost career honors.\n\"The Crespi Man\" &amp; Hall of Fame.\nIn 2010, Crespi High School, Welch's high school alma mater, selected him as \"The Crespi Man.\" This distinct award honors the alumnus who incorporates several of the school's moral and spiritual values into their lives—those housed in learning, creativity, teamwork and tradition. At the same time, he was enshrined into Crespi's Hall of Fame.\nHarry Welch Stadium.\nOn March 7, 2007, just after he announced his departure from Canyon to pursue other challenges, the football facility at the high school was officially named \"Harry Welch Stadium\" in his honor. Welch was part of the school community for 37 years and enjoyed significant success on the gridiron and in the classroom.\nBoy Scouts of America - Orange County Council \"Men of Character\" Award.\nIn spring of 2010, Welch was selected by the Boy Scouts of America - Orange County Council as recipient of their \"Men of Character\" award. This honor is presented annually to distinguished men for their outstanding service to the community based on exhibiting the values of devotion to family, faith and community.\nCIF-Southern Section Hall of Fame.\nThe year of 2022 saw Welch inducted into another prestigious sports fraternity—the CIF-Southern Section Hall of Fame. Welch was one of 14 high school sports icons presented in the 2022 class—the section's 38th class overall.\nCalifornia High School Football Hall of Fame.\nThe inaugural class of the newly established California High School Football Hall of Fame was announced in the fall of 2022. The committee selected 100 players and 13 coaches, who through decades of prep gridiron competition from all over the state, are to be inducted to the inaugural class. Welch was one of the all-time coaches selected and will be formally enshrined in late 2023 at the Rose Bowl (Pasadena), the physical home of the Hall.\nCancer diagnosis, recovery and awareness.\nIn the summer of 2010, at age 65, Welch discovered he had prostate cancer after a fellow Crespi alumnus, who was a cancer survivor himself, urged him to get a checkup. After initial exams, a biopsy revealed the presence of cancer. Welch was informed that according to the Gleason Grading System, used to evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer, his was categorized as an \"aggressive 7.\"\nWelch and wife Cindee met for two hours with specialist Dr. Jeffrey Yoshida to learn more about the cancer, surgery and post-surgery treatment options. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, Yoshida strongly recommended immediate surgery and the operation was performed on October 4, 2010. The radical prostatectomy, a full removal of the prostate, lasted nearly six hours. Yoshida gave Welch some real hope by saying the procedure would provide a 90 percent chance of survival and recommended a four-month recovery.\nWith the first game of his first season with his new team, Santa Margarita imminent, Welch made the announcement to his players. The stubborn coach took hardly any time off of the sidelines, returning just four days later for the Trinity League opening game versus Orange Lutheran.\nFrom the beginning of the experience, Welch's objective was to turn the situation into a positive event in some fashion. He and his family wanted to give wider publicity to prostate cancer and the message that men of all ages should be vigilant about being screened on a regular basis. In short, Welch's primary goal was simple—to save lives.\nHarry and wife Cindee decided to go public with his affliction to help educate and support other men throughout the nation—with a message of encouragement, support and comfort. With most men not knowing a great deal about the disease, he wanted to convey the fact that sixty-five percent of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65. Experts recommend that all men age 50 and older have a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and digital rectal exam (DRE). Men in high-risk groups, like African-Americans and those with a family history of prostate cancer, should commence testing at age 45.\nWelch utilized resources at his disposal to get the message out to a broader audience. Steve Fryer of the Orange County Register, Eric Sondheimer of the Los Angeles Times and Baxter Holmes of ESPN.com, along with networks such as Fox Sports and ESPN, provided valuable media support about the cause. This included newspaper articles, online stories and television broadcast segments. Before long, the Welch household was receiving calls from around the nation from men for information, advice and encouragement.\nThe following September (2011), Episode 5 of \"Tough Knocks\" featured Welch and his Santa Margarita team taking part in Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Eagle's players, faculty members and club staff wore light blue wristbands as part of the effort to raise awareness about the disease. The focal point was Welch's own battle a year prior with prostate cancer\nPersonal life.\nWelch is married to wife Cindee and he has two daughters, Lisa St. John and Julie Adam, and five grandchildren, Nicholas, Nathan, Kara, Evan and Riley. He enjoys watching sporting events, reading, travelling, entertaining friends, fine dining at local restaurants and walking his St. Bernard named Murphy. In addition, he assists the Athletic Information Director at Santa Margarita, Chuck Nan, with research on prep sports history in Southern California. Welch lives close to Santa Margarita campus in the community of Coto de Caza."

        "text": "Jamie Lee Collins Sr. (born October 20, 1989) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles and was selected by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft. As a member of the Patriots for seven non-consecutive seasons, Collins earned Pro Bowl honors in 2015 when he led the league in forced fumbles. Collins also won a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XLIX. Outside of his New England tenure, he played three seasons with the Cleveland Browns and two with the Detroit Lions.\nEarly years.\nCollins was born in McCall Creek, Mississippi.

The record was previously 11'5\" which was set by running back Justin Fargas in the 2003 NFL combine. Collins held the record until it was broken by cornerback Byron Jones in 2015 (12'3\") and was also surpassed by Obi Melifonwu in 2017 (11'9\").

        "title": "1977 Major League Baseball expansion",
        "text": "The 1977 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in the establishment of expansion franchises in Seattle and Toronto in the American League of Major League Baseball. The Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays began play in the 1977 Major League Baseball season, becoming the 25th and 26th teams in Major League Baseball.\nSeattle and Toronto were included in a list of potential expansion cities in a survey conducted by the American League in 1960. The others were Atlanta, Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, Denver, Oakland, and San Diego (all of which received MLB franchises eventually through expansion or relocation except Buffalo, which has an AAA team, however).\n \nSeattle.\nIn the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion (which had been originally planned to take place in 1971, but said date was moved up two years when Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri demanded that a new team be placed in Kansas City at the earliest possible convience), Kansas City, Montreal, San Diego, and Seattle were each granted franchises; the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots were added to the American League, while the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals) and San Diego Padres joined the National League. The Seattle Pilots only played one season, during which they faced financial difficulties owing to no television coverage, a poorly performing team, a stadium with problems, and the highest ticket and concession prices in the league. Owners of other American League teams wanted Dewey Soriano and William R. Daley to sell the team to a Seattle owner who would improve the team and address issues at Sick's Stadium, particularly uncovered seats with bad views. After several attempts to sell the team to a Seattle owner failed, on April 1, 1970, judge Sidney Volinn declared the team officially bankrupt; it was sold to Milwaukee car dealer (and future MLB commissioner) Bud Selig, who moved the team to there and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers, who began play a week later on April 7. Selig had negotiated a deal for the purchase with Soriano during Game 1 of the 1969 World Series.\nAs a result of the relocation of the Seattle Pilots to Milwaukee, in 1970 the city of Seattle, King County and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract. The $32.5 million lawsuit proceeded until 1976, when at trial the American League offered the city a franchise in exchange for the city, county, and state to drop the suit. On November 2, 1972, King County had broken ground on the Kingdome, which would come to be used by the Seattle Mariners for baseball and by the Seahawks for football.\nOn January 15, 1976, the expansion franchise was approved, becoming the 13th franchise in the American League. It was owned by Lester Smith and Danny Kaye, who paid an expansion fee of million. Owing to the history surrounding the franchise, sportswriter Emmett Watson of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer joked that the team should be named the \"Seattle Litigants\".\nToronto.\nToronto had a long history of interest in baseball. Its first professional baseball team was established in 1885, and in 1886 Sunlight Park was built to host its games. In 1897, Hanlan's Point Stadium was built at the Toronto Islands for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, and on September 5, 1914 it was the site of baseball legend Babe Ruth's first professional home run and only minor league home run. In 1926, Maple Leaf Stadium was built for the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team was successful, sometimes drawing more fans than established Major League Baseball teams. The team was owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who in the mid-1950s sought municipal financing of a major league baseball park on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. He was also involved in the failed attempt to establish the Continental League as a third league in Major League Baseball in the early 1960s. Maple Leaf Stadium was demolished in 1968 after the Toronto Maple Leafs were sold to Walter Dilbeck and moved to Louisville, Kentucky. (The team has since relocated twice, and is now the Worcester Red Sox.)\nIn the early 1970s, Toronto City Council alderman Paul Godfrey proposed a plan for a publicly financed domed stadium in the city, but it was opposed by taxpayers and amateur sports groups. Undeterred, he proposed renovation of Exhibition Stadium to support baseball. The stadium was renovated in anticipation of the city being awarded a Major League Baseball team, costing . Half of the funds were provided by the municipal government, and the other half from an interest-free loan from the provincial Government of Ontario. Its seating capacity was increased to 40,000.\nThere had been strong interest from several groups and individuals to own a Major League Baseball team in the city. The most prominent was Labatt Brewing Company, who wanted to use ownership of a sports team as a means to establish a visible presence in the Toronto market.\nOn January 9, 1976, the National Exhibition Company, owners of the San Francisco Giants, established an agreement in principle to sell the franchise to a consortium owned by Labatt Brewing Company, Vulcan Assets, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for (. The Giants had failed to repay a loan from Major League Baseball, and had experienced declining revenues since the relocation of the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland in 1968. Of the sale price, was to be placed in escrow to \"meet certain possible obligations with respect to the transaction\", especially the lease of Candlestick Park, which would expire in 1994.\nThe new owners of the Giants, led by Don McDougall, would move the team to Toronto pending approval from the other eleven National League teams, which would be sought on January 14 at the Winter Meetings of General managers in Phoenix. The team would be known as the Toronto Giants and would begin play during the 1976 Major League Baseball season. The deal was scuttled by a Superior Court of California, which issued an injunction blocking the sale on February 11, 1976; the injunction was requested by the city of San Francisco on January 10. The National Exhibition Company eventually accepted a purchase proposal from Bob Lurie in a deal brokered by George Moscone, the Mayor of San Francisco; Lurie elected to keep the team in San Francisco. This was the third scuttled attempt by Labatt to bring an MLB team to Toronto, after failures to acquire the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians. Soon after, Godfrey received a phone call from Kansas City Royals owner Ewing Kauffman informing him that he supported a Toronto franchise for the American League.\nDuring an owners meeting held on March 20, 1976, the American League franchises voted 11-1 to expand the league with a Toronto franchise, to which National League owners resolved to consider a Toronto franchise to begin play in the 1977 season. Bowie Kuhn, at the time the Commissioner of Baseball, planned for the National League to expand with new franchises in Toronto and Washington, D.C., and for the American League to add a new franchise in New Orleans in addition to the already-awarded Seattle franchise. On March 29, National League owners met and voted in favour of the expansion plans, but they were rejected because the vote was not unanimous, with dissenting votes from the owners of the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies. A subsequent vote on April 26 ended this plan with a 7–5 result in favour of the proposal, again failing to achieve unanimity.\nTwo groups bid for the rights to franchise ownership in the city, which presented bids during an American League owner's meeting on March 26, 1976. Ultimately, an ownership group named Metro Baseball Ltd. consisting of Labatt Brewing Company, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Imperial Trust won the bid for a franchise fee of . The other bid was made by Atlantic Packaging. The winning bid was represented by legal counsel Herb Solway and Gord Kirke. Kirke prepared the original documents which led to the foundation of the team in 1976.\nAfter the city was awarded the franchise, U.S. President Gerald Ford attempted to pressure Major League Baseball to instead award the franchise to Washington, D.C., which he claimed should have a team before Toronto. Both the American League and National League dismissed his request.\nIn 1974, the Toronto City Council approved a further for renovations to Exhibition Stadium, retrofitting the stadium for baseball and would be ready in time for the 1977 season. Paul Beeston was hired as the team's first employee on May 10, 1976, and Peter Bavasi was hired as the team's first president and general manager on June 18, 1976.\nExpansion draft.\nIn order to stock the roster of each team, a draft was held on November 5, 1976 in which each of the extant teams would make available to the expansion franchises some of the players on their major league and minor league rosters. Each team was allowed to protect fifteen players on the major league roster, and an additional three players after each of the first and second round of the draft. The Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays each selected 30 players in the draft."

The championship is played at the home of the highest remaining playoff seed from either the East or West Division, depending on the year.\nHistory.\nThe Wilson Cup was first awarded for the 1908–09 season by Harold Wilson of Toronto. The Cup was originally the championship trophy of the first Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union which existed until 1955 and despite its name, was composed only of Ontario and Quebec universities. The Cup was then inherited by the original CIAU's successor, the Ontario-Quebec Athletic Association which eventually became the OUA. Since the 1962–63 season the Wilson Cup winner has gone on to compete for the national championship W. P. McGee Trophy. The 2021 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.\nCurrent OUA playoff format.\nThe 17 OUA teams are separated into two divisions: East and West. The top seeds in each division receive a bye in their respective division playoffs. The seeds ranked #3 and #4 play hosts to seeds #5 and #6 respectively, with the winners advancing to play the team seeded #1 or #2.\nIn the crossover round, the highest remaining seed in the East Division hosts the lowest remaining seed in the West and vice versa. The two winners of this round receive the OUA's berths in the USports Men's Basketball Final 8 and contest a one-game final for the Wilson Cup.\nThe Wilson Cup final is hosted by the team from the West in even numbered years and by the East in odd numbered years. If two teams from the same division qualify for the final, then the host shall be the highest remaining seed."

It is the first time someone managed this in a World Championship. The time between the end of the competition and the flower ceremony was chaotic due to a point reduction given to Norway, which initially was declared silver medalists. The reason for the point deduction was a human error done by the start gate official who moved the start gate up instead of down, as the Norwegian coach requested, on Anders Bardal's first jump.\nResults.\nThe final was started at 16:30."

        "text": "William Talton \"Sonny\" Randall (August 5, 1915 - February 13, 2013) was an American baseball player during the 1940s. Randall played during the segregated era when black baseball players were not allowed to play in either Major League Baseball or any of its minor league affiliates. Randall was born in Phoebus, Virginia, in 1915. As a young man, he moved with his family to Washington, D.C. in the early 1920s and subsequently dropped out of school to support his family during the depression.\nDuring the 1930s, Randall played on Washington D.C area sandlot and semi-pro teams to include the Washington Indians, Black Sox, and Aztecs. During the war years, Randall played on the U.S. Navy's Great Lakes Training Center's baseball team, the \"Blue Jackets.\" When he returned home, Randall would occasionally play for the Washington Homestead Grays but because he did not want to endure the hardships of travel that were common in the Negro leagues, Randall declined opportunities to play professionally. As a result, almost all of Randall's time with the Grays was during their home games. Randall did occasionally travel with the semi-pro teams he played for and experienced racial discrimination and racial taunts from fans.\nTeams were segregated and so were the towns. The players couldn't eat in any of the restaurants because they were for whites only. There were no black hotels ... and the players often had to change into their uniforms on the bus or even in the woods. During the Navy years we played a team from Waukegan, Illinois. A player from the all-white team called one of the Negro players the \"n\" word and the two teams almost got into a fight. After the incident, the coach of the Navy team, who was white, talked to both sides. When we went back to play that team a couple of months later, the problem had been resolved and there was no incident.\nDuring Randall's time as a ball player, he was also a federal employee, working for the Navy and NASA for 31 years. After his retirement from federal service, Randall worked as a chauffeur for U.S. Senators Milton Young, Howard Baker, and Ted Stevens as well as for various Washington D.C. area law firms. Randall permanently retired in 2001 after working for more than 70 years. Randall was a longtime resident of Temple Hills, Maryland, where he lived with his wife of 55 years, Ann Turner Randall, of Clarksville, Maryland. \nRandall died on February 13, 2013, after suffering complications from a stroke.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

        "title": "Crack climbing",
        "text": "Crack climbing is a type of rock climbing in which the climber follows a crack in the rock using specialized climbing techniques. The sizes of cracks vary from those that are just barely wide enough for the fingers to fit inside, to those that are so wide that the entire body can fit inside with all limbs outstretched. Many traditional climbing routes follow crack systems, as they provide natural opportunities for placing protective equipment.\nWidths.\nIn the context of climbing, cracks are classified by their width in relation to the climber's body: finger, off-finger, hand, off-width, and chimneys. \nThe walls of crack systems rarely run parallel to each other throughout the entire length of the crack; they frequently constrict inwards and open outwards in various places. Some of the most challenging climbs follow cracks which run through many different widths. Even when a crack is uniform in width, it may require a different approach for each individual climber—a hand crack for a smaller climber may be an off-finger crack for a larger climber.\nHistory.\nThroughout the history of rock climbing, whenever traditional climbers seek to develop routes in a new area, they almost invariably follow crack systems that offer natural locations for placing protective equipment. The use of the term \"line\" as a synonym for \"route\" derives from this practice, as cracks often form visually distinct lines that can be followed from base to top.\nPrior to the introduction of spring-loaded camming devices, there was no suitable method for placing protective gear in cracks wider than a few inches, which made such routes extremely dangerous even when they were not technically demanding. It was not until the 1980s that camming devices proliferated, enabling climbers to ascend more crack systems safely.\nBy the 1990s, crack climbing had diminished in popularity for a variety of reasons. The advent of sport climbing allowed climbers to focus on difficulty and aesthetic appeal when developing new routes; it was no longer necessary to learn specialized crack techniques in order to lead climb safely. Furthermore, cracks are difficult to simulate in climbing gyms, so those who train indoors are limited to face routes when they climb outside.\nIn 2006, Canadian Sonnie Trotter made the first free ascent of the \"Cobra Crack\" (5.14b) in Squamish, British Columbia, which at the time was considered to be the hardest crack climb in the world. Since this ascent, new and perhaps more difficult crack lines have been climbed including \"Stranger than Fiction\" (5.14b) in Canyonlands National Park, \"The Meltdown\" (5.14c) in Yosemite National Park, \"Blackbeard's Tears\" (5.14c) on the California coast and \"The Recovery Drink\" (5.14c) in Norway's Jossingfjord.\nIn 2011, Tom Randall and Pete Whittaker completed the first free ascent of \"Century Crack\" (5.14b), a off-width in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The crack was first attempted in 2001 and is considered the hardest off-width crack climb in the world.\nTechnique.\nThe most fundamental technique used in crack climbing is \"jamming\", in which the climber forces a body part into the crack such that it exerts force on both walls. This creates the friction needed for the climber to make upward progress. The body part used and its positioning are largely dependent on the width of the crack. For example, some cracks are just wide enough that they can be jammed with an open hand. A crack slightly wider than that may require the hand to be curled into a fist to form an effective jam.\nWhen the crack is too wide for a single limb to jam, climbers use a technique known as \"stacking\": both hands are placed inside the crack, pressed against each other. For example, if the crack is too wide for a fist jam, the climber may press a closed fist against one wall and an open hand upon the other in order to span the width of the crack. The \"stemming\" technique, used on cracks that are wider than the climber's body, employs a similar principle. The four limbs are pressed straight outwards against opposing rock faces; limbs are moved upward one at a time while maintaining contact with the other three limbs.\nEquipment.\nIn traditional climbing, the climber places protective gear while ascending the route, rather than installing permanent fixtures beforehand. Much of this equipment was designed specifically for use in crack systems. The two main categories of protection are \"passive\", with no moving parts, and \"active\", which use springs to keep the gear fixed in place. In both categories, protective gear is color-coded by size to allow the climber to quickly identify the correct piece of gear for a given position while climbing.\nNuts and hexes are two common types of passive protection. A nut is a small rectangular piece of metal on the end of a wire cable, with a loop at the other end for attaching a carabiner. The nut is placed inside a crack, just above a constriction in width. This prevents the equipment from slipping downward or out of the crack when the climber falls. Most nuts are between wide. Hexagonal chocks, also called \"hexes\", are similar to nuts, but are designed for larger cracks; the most common sizes range from in width. The irregular shape of hexes allow them to be placed in several different orientations depending on the shape of the crack.\nThe spring-loaded camming device was developed in Yosemite National Park the 1970s, and is now one of the most popular forms of protection. Each camming device has three or four cams, a shaft, and a trigger mechanism. When the trigger is engaged, the cams contract, allowing it to be placed inside the crack. The trigger is then released, causing the cams to expand outward against the walls of the crack. The device is designed to convert a downward pull on the shaft into outward force through the cams."

McCann was drafted in the fourth round of the 2019 MLB Draft, while both Guldberg (third round) and Radcliff (fifth round) were selected in the 2020 MLB Draft.\nAfter the 2020 season was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yellow Jackets once again showed dominance at the plate in 2021, leading the ACC with a .300 average in 36 league games. In the expanded conference slate, Georgia Tech paced the ACC in runs (251), hits (384), doubles (91), triples (10), RBI (230) and on-base percentage (.383). Under Ramsey’s offensive instruction, Tech boasted four .300 hitters – Kevin Parada (.318), Luke Waddell (.309), Justyn-Henry Malloy (.308) and Andrew Jenkins (.302) – while Drew Compton hit .294 with 13 home runs. Waddell and Malloy were both drafted in the 2021 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves in the fifth and sixth rounds, respectively. He \"coaches the Yellow Jackets’ outfielders and is the team’s hitting coach, working on both team and individual hitting philosophies. He is also in charge of integrating technology and analytics into player development and evaluation.\" In 2021, he was promoted to associate head coach while retaining his roles as hitting coach and recruiting coordinator.\nWith Ramsey as the associate head coach and team's hitting coach, Georgia Tech led the nation in 2022 in team batting average (.327), sixth in slugging percentage (.551), and sixth in on-base percentage (.419). Six of his players were named to the All ACC Baseball Team in 2022.\nIn an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, head coach of the Yellow Jackets, Danny Hall, stated “Do I think James Ramsey is capable of being the head coach here at Georgia Tech?... One hundred percent... he’s going to get my endorsement...” In the absence of an official \"Head-Coach-in-Waiting\" title in the University System of Georgia, \"We gave him the title of associate head coach for a reason. We want to do everything we can to encourage him and keep him here.\" said Hall.\nPersonal life.\nWhile at Florida State, Ramsey was a candidate for the Rhodes Scholarship. Ramsey's father also played college baseball for the Seminoles whereas his mother played tennis.\nHe married Grace Snell on November 26, 2016."

        "text": "William E. McGovern (December 31, 1962 – May 30, 2023) was an American college and professional football coach. A defensive coach for almost 40 years, his longest stint was with Boston College, serving 13 years from 2000 to 2012 as their linebackers coach and later as defensive coordinator. He was also a linebackers coach for eight years in the National Football League (NFL) with the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Giants, and Chicago Bears.\nMcGovern played as a defensive back in college for the Holy Cross Crusaders. He set NCAA Division I-AA career and single-season records for interceptions and was named an All-American.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nMcGovern was born in Oradell, New Jersey, on December 31, 1962. He attended Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, and helped lead the Crusaders football team to a state championship. \"The Record\" named him to their All-Century team as a defensive back. \nMcGovern attended the College of the Holy Cross, where he was a four-year starter for the Crusaders at defensive back. A two-time first-team all-conference selection in the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference, he set a Division I-AA career record with 24 interceptions. In his senior year in 1984, McGovern set a Division I-AA single-season record with 11 interceptions and was named a consensus first-team Division I-AA All-American. He was named to the Holy Cross Hall of Fame in 1996.\nCoaching career.\nMcGovern began his coaching career with Penn as freshman coach in 1985. The following year, he returned to his alma mater after his former coach Rick Carter asked him to join his staff, but Carter died by suicide before the season. McGovern served at Holy Cross from 1986 to 1987 and 1991 to 1992 as assistant defensive backs coach and defensive backs coach, respectively. He was with Massachusetts from 1988 to 1990 as defensive backs coach and 1993 as defensive coordinator. McGovern joined the Boston College Eagles in 1994, and he was succeeded by Massachusetts linebackers coach Jerry Azzinaro as Minutemen defensive coordinator. From 1994 to 1996, McGovern was the Eagles' defensive backs coach, and Azzinaro joined the staff in 1995 as the defensive line coach. McGovern was later the defensive backs coach for Pittsburgh from 1997 to 1999.\nMcGovern returned to Boston College as linebackers coach for nine years from 2000 to 2008, before being promoted to defensive coordinator. As defensive coordinator from 2009 to 2012, he coached future NFL linebackers Mark Herzlich and Luke Kuechly. The Eagles' defense ranked as high as No. 13 in total defense in 2010, before a steep drop in his final two seasons. During this 13-year stint with Boston College, they appeared in a bowl game in each of his first 11 seasons, winning eight.\nIn 2013, McGovern moved to the NFL, joining the Philadelphia Eagles as the outside linebackers coach on head coach Chip Kelly's staff, which included Jerry Azzinaro as the defensive line coach. McGovern developed Connor Barwin into one of the league's top pass rushers with sacks in 2014, and he transitioned Brandon Graham from defensive end to linebacker under defensive coordinator Billy Davis's 3–4 defense. After Kelly and his staff were fired following the 2015 season, McGovern was hired as linebackers coach for the New York Giants in 2016. After the firing of coach Ben McAdoo, McGovern was retained in his role by new head coach Pat Shurmur in 2018. After returning to coaching at the college level and spending 2020 as a defensive assistant with Nebraska, McGovern was hired by the Chicago Bears as the inside linebackers coach under new defensive coordinator Sean Desai on January 30, 2021. He was not retained after the Bears fired head coach Matt Nagy.\nOn February 16, 2022, McGovern re-united with Chip Kelly, who hired him as the defensive coordinator for the UCLA Bruins. He replaced Azzinaro and was tasked with improving a Bruins defense that had struggled during Kelly's tenure. Through the first seven games in 2022, the defense's performance was encouraging, surrendering 25.9 points per game as UCLA went 6–1 and was ranked as high as No. 9 nationally. However, McGovern missed the next five games while dealing with cancer, and the defense regressed, allowing 31.8 points per game. He returned for the 2022 Sun Bowl, in which the Bruins gave up 20 consecutive points and lost 37–35 to Pittsburgh after a late field goal. After the season, McGovern transitioned to an administrative role, while D'Anton Lynn was hired as the new defensive coordinator.\nDeath.\nMcGovern died from cancer at home in Southern California, on May 30, 2023, at age 60."

This racist policy created much controversy in New Zealand. (See \"Halt All Racist Tours\" and History of rugby union matches between New Zealand and South Africa.)\nLater tours.\nNew Zealand Rugby Union then refused any other tour for the succeeding ten years until Māori and Samoan player participation was accepted in 1970. On that occasion South African authorities, gave them the title of \"Honorary Whites\", but controversies remained. In 1976, all the African countries boycotted the Olympic Games in protest at the All Blacks' tour of South Africa.\nThen, the 1981 Springboks' tour, was contested by a large part of New Zealand public opinion, with riots and demonstrations.\nIn 1985 public opinion convinced NZRU to cancel another tour in South Africa. Only with the end of apartheid, in 1992 did the controversy end.\nAlso outside the political troubles, the results of the tour weren't good in any case for All Blacks, that lost the series with only a victory and a draw in the four-match series against the Springboks\nResults.\nIn Australia.\nNo test match was played.\n\"Scores and results list All Blacks' points tally first.\"\nIn Africa.\n\"Scores and results list All Blacks' points tally first.\"\nCultural reaction.\nThe Howard Morrison Quartet released \"My Old Man's an All-Black\", a parody of My Old Man's a Dustman, which noted the absence of Māori players from the touring side:\nAmerican satirist Tom Lehrer was touring New Zealand in April 1960 when Prime Minister Walter Nash officially refused to intervene in the New Zealand Rugby Football Union's plans to tour South Africa with only white players. On introducing his own song \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard\" in the Auckland Town Hall, he said \"At this juncture of the evening's symposium, I wish to pay tribute to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union--for not allowing a little thing like human dignity to interfere with the great principles of the game.\" He would go on to pen original lyrics on the subject, which were published in the \"Auckland Star\":"

They continued to operate in the league until 1950.\nThe team played as the Chanute Owls in 1946, tying for first place and winning the first round of the postseason. Then, Chanute and Iola tied 3-3 in final playoff games that counted. Although Chanute won another contest, it was later ruled a \"non-game\" after a dispute arose between both club officials. Finally, the series never was settled.\nThe Owls changed its name to the Chanute Owls Athletics, and played under this name between the 1946–1947 and 1949–1950 seasons. In 1948, they played as the Chanute Giants and were a New York Giants affiliated team. But Chanute declined through its last five seasons in the eight-team circuit, finishing 7th in 1947 (44-80), 8th in 1948 (44-78), 5th in 1949 (65-60) and 8th in 1950 (35-89).\nSince 1950, no other team based in Chanute, Kansas has played in a professional league."

The format is comparable to the ISU Speed Skating World Cup, but only junior skaters (up until the season they turn 19) are allowed to enter. Starting in the 2016–17 season, a competition for \"neo-seniors\" was added.\nThe first edition was held in the 2008–09 season with competition in five distances for both men (boys) and ladies (girls). The 500, 1000, 1500 and team pursuit were run for both sexes and while the ladies had a competition over 3000 meters, the men had a competition over the combined 3000 and 5000 meters. In the 2011–12 season the mass start event (12 laps for men, 8 laps for ladies) was added and in the 2013–14 season a team sprint event (3 laps) was held for the first time. The results for the team sprint and team pursuit events are combined in the final rankings. Since the 2014–15 season the mass start is held over 10 laps for both men and ladies.\nIn November 2011 the ISU Junior World Cup Speed Skating was used as part of the qualification process for the speed skating at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics."

He began coaching soon after his playing career, becoming highly successful in the Mississippi High School ranks at Gulf Coast Military Academy, Canton, and Vicksburg.\nHe was hired by then-Mississippi State coach Royal in 1955, and went with him to Washington, and later Texas. In 1967, he was placed in charge of the Longhorn defense, and in 1974 was named assistant head coach.\nAfter Royal's retirement in 1976, Fred Akers was chosen over Campbell as Royal's successor, a decision that was a source of controversy among Texas fans. Campbell retired from coaching afterwards.\nCampbell's twin sons, Mike Jr. and Tom, were defensive starters on Texas' 1969 national championship team."

        "text": "B. S. Chandrasekhar is a former international cricketer who represented the Indian cricket team between 1964 and 1979. In cricket, a five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and 40 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at the international level as of . Chandrasekhar played as a leg spin bowler who formed a part of the Indian spin quartet. Described by West Indies cricketer Viv Richards as the \"most difficult\" bowler, Chandrasekhar took 16 five-wicket hauls during his international career. He developed an interest in the game when he was a child, watching the playing styles of Australian leg spinner Richie Benaud. Chandrasekhar was affected by polio at the age of five which weakened his right arm. He started as a left-arm bowler but gradually shifted to his withered right arm as it could offer more spin.\nChandrasekhar made his Test debut in 1964 against England at the Brabourne Stadium, claiming four wickets for 67 runs in the first innings. His first five-wicket haul came against West Indies two years later at the same venue. Chandrasekhar's bowling figures of six wickets for 38 runs in 1971 were instrumental in setting up India's first victory in England. It was noted as the Indian \"Bowling Performance of the Century\" by \"Wisden\" in 2002. His bowling performances in the previous English season led to him being named one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1972. His career-best figures for an innings were eight wickets for 79 runs against England at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in December 1972. Chandrasekhar took a pair of five-wicket hauls for the only time in his career when he took 12 wickets for 104 runs against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; the performance was effective in ensuring India's first victory in Australia. In Tests, he was most successful against England taking eight fifers.\nChandrasekhar played his only One Day International in February 1976 against New Zealand in Eden Park. He claimed three wickets for 36 runs in the match that India lost by 80 runs."

In addition to the course, the resort has a spa, marina, hunting lodge, winery, and private air strip.\nHistory.\nJoyce acquired the 1,100 acres of ocean-front for the property in 1987, and opened it in 2000. The remnants of a lobster-processing plant from the property's previous use are visible from the back-nine holes of the course. The resort was originally envisioned to be a gated community centred on the golf course. Houses or townhouses would be privately owned and occupied by either permanent or seasonal residents, but the resort eventually evolved into a combination of \"private club and public golf\".\nGolf course.\nThe golf course is and was designed by Graham Cooke; in 2001 \"Golf Digest\" awarded it Best New Canadian Course, and in 2009 listed it as the number fifteen in their top-twenty golf courses in Canada. The 7,205-yard, par 72 course follows the coast of the Northumberland Strait of the Atlantic Ocean. \nIn 2010, the course saw approximately 7,000 rounds of golf played. At a private event in 2009 Tiger Woods shot the course record, a 63.\nFacilities.\nThe Fox Harb'r Resort includes a spa and conference centre. It is accessed by the road that was dubbed 'Amazing Grace Boulevard' by Ron Joyce, or the private air strip. While serving as Canadian ambassador to the United States, Frank McKenna used the Fox Harb'r facilities for an annual summer event (known as the Frank McKenna Networking Event) he organized to bring together business-people from around the Maritime Provinces. The resort also has a deepwater marina and a lodge for game bird hunting"

        "text": "Curt \"Trouble\" Smith (born February 4, 1971) is an American former basketball player best known as a streetball legend in the Washington, D.C., and Maryland areas. He played college basketball at Compton College and then Drake University. While at Drake, Smith was named the Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year as a junior in 1992–93.\nIn high school, Smith was an All-American who was chosen to play in the Capital Classic in 1989, which was the premier All-American showcase game at the time. He matched up opposite Kenny Anderson, who was considered the best high school basketball player ever (pre-LeBron James), yet Smith outplayed him.\nSmith then spent his first two college basketball seasons playing at Compton College, now called El Camino College, in Compton, California. After lighting it up at the junior college level—he once scored 48 points against Harbor Community College—he moved on to play NCAA Division I ball at Drake. During his first season playing for the Bulldogs, Smith was named the Missouri Valley Conference's Newcomer of the Year as well as its player of the year, earning the rare double honor. That season he averaged approximately 21 points, 5 assists and 3 steals per game while helping to turn the program around after bad seasons the previous years.\nHe did not return to Drake as a senior in 1993–94. After college he played professional basketball, including stints in the IBA, International Basketball League and United States Basketball League. In 1997–98, Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the USBL.\nKevin Durant of the NBA has described Smith as the best basketball player ever to come out of the Washington metropolitan area."

        "title": "2008 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2008 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on January 1 with the start of the 2008 ATP Tour. This season is considered to be one of Nadal's best: he won eight titles in 2008, including two majors and the Olympic gold medal. In addition, Nadal also won three Masters titles — Monte-Carlo, Hamburg, and Toronto. Nadal's 32-match winning streak in 2008 is the longest across three surfaces in tennis history. He won the French Open for the loss of no sets and just 41 games, in one of the most comprehensive major performances of all time. Nadal also won Wimbledon, defeating rival and five-time defending champion Roger Federer in what is widely recognized as the greatest tennis match in history. He then won the Olympic gold medal at Beijing, which clinched the world No. 1 ranking for the first time. He ascended to the top spot after 160 consecutive weeks as the world No. 2. Nadal would hold the No. 1 ranking for the rest of the season and finish the year ranked No. 1 for the first time in his career.\nYear summary.\nNadal kickstarted his season with a runner-up showing at the Indian city of Chennai. He then played the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open. Nadal raced through the tournament before a shock straight-sets loss at the hands of Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. Nadal then had a form slump, winning just three of his next five, and six of his next nine matches. Nadal had his second runner-up result that year at Miami, losing to long-term rival Nikolay Davydenko. Nadal then won his fourth consecutive Monte-Carlo Masters title, losing just 29 games in 5 matches. He followed that up with his second tournament win of the year at the Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell. Nadal's winning streak of 10 matches was snapped when compatriot Juan Carlos Ferrero stunned him in the second round of the Rome Masters, where Nadal was a three-time defending champion. Nadal then regrouped and began a 32-match winning streak across clay, grass, and hard courts, which is the longest streak on three surfaces in the history of the sport. He won his first Hamburg Masters title in May, and followed it up with a brilliant performance to win his fourth consecutive French Open title, losing just 4 games in the final. Nadal's streak continued with his first grass-court title at Queen's Club in London, and then his first-ever Wimbledon, where he outlasted Federer in what is considered the greatest match in tennis history. Nadal then won his third Masters title and first hard-court title of the year at Toronto. His streak was finally ended in the semifinals of the Cincinnati Masters by Novak Djokovic. Nadal then entered the Summer Olympics at Beijing, and became the first top-5 ranked player to win the Olympic Gold in the history of the sport. This win also catapulted Nadal to the top of the rankings for the first time in his career. Nadal then made his second hard-court Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open, before losing to Andy Murray in four tight sets. He then helped guide Spain into the Davis Cup Final, notching up wins over Sam Querrey and Andy Roddick. Nadal ended the year as World #1.\nSpring hard-court season.\nChennai Open.\nNadal began the year by participating in the Chennai Open in Chennai, India. Nadal defeated Carlos Moyá in the semi-finals in (at the time) the longest three-set match in history, 6–7(3), 7–6(8), 7–6(1), lasting three hours and fifty-four minutes. An exhausted Nadal went on to lose in the finals to Mikhail Youzhny 6–0, 6–1.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal played his second tournament of the year at the Australian Open. Nadal stormed through the tournament, dropping no sets until he was shocked by the then world number 38 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semi-finals. He beat Viktor Troicki in the first round 7–6(3), 7–5, 6–1. He then demolished Frenchman Florent Serra, 6–0, 6–2, 6–2. In the third round, he defeated another Frenchman, Gilles Simon, 7–5, 6–2, 6–3. In the round of 16, he beat his third Frenchman of the tournament, Paul-Henri Mathieu, after Mathieu retired when he was down 4–6, 0–3. In the quarter-finals, he beat Jarkko Nieminen, 7–5, 6–3, 6–1. Nadal's impressive run came to a halt when Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga comprehensively beat him in the semi-finals 6–2, 6–3, 6–2.\nABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament.\nNadal then participated in his first indoor tournament of the year at the Rotterdam Open, Netherlands. Nadal beat Dmitry Tursunov 6–4, 6–4 in the first round before squandering a one-set lead to lose 6–3, 3–6, 4–6 to Italian Andreas Seppi.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nNadal then returned to the Dubai Open, where he was a former champion. Nadal had won the title by beating Roger Federer in the 2006 Dubai Open, 2–6, 6–4, 6–4. This time around, however, his performance was less than impressive as he lost in the quarter-finals to American World No. 6 Andy Roddick. Nadal looked uncomfortable in his first-round match against Philipp Kohlschreiber, recovering from a one-set deficit to win 3–6, 6–1, 6–4. He then proceeded to push aside World No. 171 Mikhail Ledovskikh 6–4, 6–0, before losing to Roddick in the quarters, 6–7(5), 2–6.\nPacific Life Open.\nIn the first Masters Series event of the year, Nadal put in a consistent performance to reach the semi-finals. He beat Colombian Santiago Giraldo in the second round 6–3, 6–3, before defeating American Donald Young 6–1, 6–3 in the third round. Nadal then defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final match-up. Nadal stuttered for a while but regrouped to exact revenge on his opponent, 6–7(4), 7–6(3), 7–5. Nadal then defeated World No. 9 James Blake in the quarter-finals in three sets – 7–5, 3–6, 6–3. In the semi-finals, he fell to World No. 3 and the man he beat in the previous year's final, Novak Djokovic, 3–6, 2–6.\nSony Ericsson Open.\nNadal reached the final of Miami Masters for the second time in his career. He defeated German Benjamin Becker 7–5, 6–2 in the second round, followed by the demolition of another German, Nicolas Kiefer in the third round 6–2, 6–4. Nadal defeated James Blake for the second time in two weeks in the quarter-finals, and then beat big-hitting Czech Tomáš Berdych in the semi-finals, 7–6(6), 6–2. Nadal finally fell to long-time rival and the only man with a positive head-to-head against him (minimum 5 matches), Nikolay Davydenko, 4–6, 2–6.\nNadal then defeated Kiefer again at the Davis Cup World Group quarterfinals, 7–6(5), 6–0, 6–3.\nEuropean clay-court season.\nMonte-Carlo Rolex Masters.\nNadal was back on the surface of his choice, red clay. A magnificent run on the red clay would set him up for the great year he had.\nNadal won his fourth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title. He lost just 29 games in 5 matches he played. Nadal received a bye into the second round, where he routed Croatian Mario Ančić 6–0, 6–3. Nadal then defeated fellow Spaniard and former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the second round, 6–4, 6–1. In the quarterfinals, Nadal beat World No. 5 David Ferrer 6–1, 7–5. Nadal then squandered just 5 games in a comprehensive defeat of Russian Nikolay Davydenko, before defeating long-time rival Roger Federer 7–5, 7–5 in the final to win his tenth Masters title.\nOpen Sabadell Atlántico Barcelona.\nNadal entered the Barcelona Open as the top seed for the first time in a tournament that year. Nadal stormed through the tournament losing just one set, and extended his winning streak to 10. He defeated a succession of top-50 players up to the semifinals, including Potito Starace, compatriot Feliciano López and Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela. He then thrashed World No. 85 Denis Gremelmayr, 6–1, 6–0, before winning the trophy by defeating David Ferrer for the second time in two weeks, 6–1, 4–6, 6–1.\nInternazionali BNL d'Italia.\nNadal entered the Italian capital as a three-time defending champion. However, he fell in the second round to Juan Carlos Ferrero, 5–7, 1–6. This loss snapped his winning streak of 16 in the Italian capital.\nHamburg Masters.\nNadal won for the first time at the German city of Hamburg, flagging off his 32-match winning streak which would continue on till the Cincinnati Masters in August. Nadal beat Potito Starace in the second round for the second time that month. He then won a lopsided third-round match against future Grand Slam champion Andy Murray before defeating Carlos Moyá for the second time that season, 6–1, 6–3. Nadal then had two tough matches back-to-back, but came out on top on both occasions. He beat World No. 3 Novak Djokovic 7–5, 2–6, 6–2 in the semifinals. In the finals, he avenged his loss the previous year's championship match by beating Roger Federer, 7–5, 6–7(3), 6–3.\nRoland Garros.\nNadal then entered the French Open as a three-time defending champion. Nadal's 2008 French Open is considered one of the greatest Grand Slam performances of all time. Nadal won every single set he played in the tournament, and dropped just 41 games en route to his fourth consecutive French Open title. Nadal defeated Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in the first round for the loss of 9 games. He then walked past Frenchman Nicolas Devilder in the second round, and then Finn Jarkko Nieminen in the third round, for the total loss of just 10 games. Nadal then thrashed two fellow Spaniards, Fernando Verdasco and Nicolás Almagro back-to-back for the loss of just 6 games. In the semifinals, Nadal played the toughest match of his tournament, defeating Novak Djokovic 6–4, 6–2, 7–6(3) to book his spot in the final. Nadal then proceeded to win one of the most lopsided finals in tennis history, routing World No. 1 Roger Federer for the third consecutive year, 6–1, 6–3, 6–0.\nGrass court season.\nQueen's Club Championships.\nNadal entered the Queen's Club tournament as a warm-up to Wimbledon. At the time, Nadal was riding a 12-match winning streak and by the end of the tournament, he would have lengthened the streak to 17. Nadal defeated Swede Jonas Björkman in the second round, before stumbling through his next two matches, beating Kei Nishikori in three sets in the third round and then 6'10 Ivo Karlović in three tie-break sets in the quarterfinals. Nadal then defeated another big server, Andy Roddick 7–5, 6–4 in the semifinals; finally winning his first ever grasscourt title by sidling past Novak Djokovic for the third time that year.\nThe Championships, Wimbledon.\nNadal entered the 2008 Wimbledon Championships as the two-time runner-up. He was riding a winning streak of 17 matches. Nadal had lost the previous two finals to Roger Federer, including the 2007 Wimbledon final, which was considered to be one of the great matches in recent times. Nadal defeated German Andreas Beck in the first round. He then lost his first set of the tournament in a tight second-round match against Latvian Ernests Gulbis. Nadal stormed through the rest of the tournament, thrashing Nicolas Kiefer, 7–6(3), 6–2, 6–3, Russian Mikhail Youzhny, 6–3, 6–3, 6-1 and future Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray, 6–3, 6–2, 6–4. Nadal then defeated surprise semifinalist Rainer Schüttler 6–1, 7–6(3), 6–4 to set up a third consecutive Wimbledon final with 5-time defending champion Roger Federer. Nadal then played what is considered the greatest match in tennis history, defeating Federer in a 4-hour, 48-minute match, 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5), 6–7(8), 9–7 in the longest Wimbledon final in history. The win gave Nadal his first Grand Slam outside the French Open, and his fifth Grand Slam overall. The match is notable for its long, well-crafted rallies and the clutch shots produced on crucial points. Federer saved two match points in the fourth-set tie-break, but eventually caved on Nadal's fourth match-point. The two greatest passing shots of the tournament were hit back-to-back late into the fourth-set tiebreak. Nadal hit a clutch forehand pass to set up match-point on his own serve. Federer responded with a backhand pass to save the match-point. Federer eventually closed out the set, but lost the match. Many experts agree this match set Nadal up to the great success that would ensue in the following months.\nSummer hard-court season.\nRogers Cup.\nNadal rode his streak through the Toronto Masters event in Toronto, Canada. He received a bye into the second round where he routed home hope Jesse Levine, 6–4, 6–2. In the third round, Nadal thrashed Russian Igor Andreev 6–2, 7–6(1). Nadal then faced childhood rival Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals. He lost the first set in an excruciatingly long tie-break, 6–7(12–14). However, he recovered immediately and pushed Gasquet aside by winning the next two sets 6–2, 6–1. In the semifinals, Nadal was matched up against up-and-comer Andy Murray. Nadal won 7–6, 6–3, reaching his third hard-court final of the year. The final was a contest between him and German Nicolas Kiefer. Nadal destroyed Kiefer 6–3, 6–2 to win his first hard-court title of the year and extend his streak to 29 match wins.\nWestern &amp; Southern Financial Open.\nNadal next played at the only Masters tournament he has never reached the final at, the Cincinnati Masters. He strode through the draw, demolishing Frenchman Florent Serra for the loss of just one game and then taking down former World No. 2 Tommy Haas, 6–2, 7–6(1). In the quarterfinals, Nadal beat Ecuadorian Nicolás Lapentti in the last win of his streak. It finally ended when World No. 3 Novak Djokovic defeated Nadal in the semifinals, 6–1, 7–5."

        "text": "The South Africa women's national cricket team has represented South Africa in international women's cricket since 1960, when they hosted England, contesting four Test matches. Their next officially recognised series was against New Zealand, more than eleven years later. In 1977, they were excluded from competing in international sporting events, when the Commonwealth of Nations signed the Gleneagles Agreement as part of the international campaign against apartheid. Although the men's national team returned to international cricket in 1991, the women's team did not compete again until 1997, when they toured Ireland and England. Since then, the team has played regularly in One Day Internationals (ODI). The introduction of Twenty20 cricket in the early part of the 21st century has all but eliminated Test cricket from the woman's game. South Africa have played five Test matches since their return, and 71 Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) since their first such contest in 2007.\nSouth Africa have played four different sides in women's Test cricket, with England their most frequent opponent, having faced them in six Tests. The only side that South Africa have beaten in Test cricket are the Netherlands, who South Africa have played once, in 2007. South Africa have similarly faced England more times than any other team in women's One Day International cricket, playing 43 matches. As such, England have recorded the most victories against South Africa, beating them 33 times. South Africa have beaten Pakistan more times than any other country, triumphing on 21 occasions against them. In women's T20Is, South Africa have as well played England the most, and lost to them on thirteen occasions. South Africa have recorded the most victories against Ireland, beating them in nine of their meetings."

        "title": "2013 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2013 Rafael Nadal tennis season is regarded as one of the greatest comeback seasons of all time. After not playing since June of the previous year, his season began on February 5 with the Chile Open, where he finished as the runner-up. Nadal rebounded with title victories at São Paulo and Acapulco. He then won the first Masters event of the year at Indian Wells. Nadal next finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic at Monte-Carlo, breaking his consecutive win streak for the first time in nine years. He followed that with victories at Barcelona, Madrid, and Rome. At the French Open, he defeated Djokovic in an epic semifinal, before defeating David Ferrer to win his eighth French Open crown. He was then stunned by Steve Darcis in the first round of Wimbledon, in what would be his only defeat prior to the semifinals of a tournament all season. Limping in the final set of the match, many thought his season was over. However, a strong hardcourt summer saw Nadal sweep Montreal, Cincinnati, and then the US Open (def. Djokovic), thus achieving the Summer Slam and clinching the US Open Series. He became the third player in history, after Patrick Rafter and Andy Roddick, to win all three events in succession. This granted him US$3.6 million in prize money, the most money earned by a male tennis player at a single tournament. A few days after the US Open final, he flew to Madrid to help the Spanish Davis Cup team secure their World Group Playoff spot for 2014, with a singles victory against Sergiy Stakhovsky and a doubles victory with Marc López.\nYear summary.\nSouth American clay court season.\nFollowing 222 days injured, Nadal returned to the tennis court on February 5 at the Chile Open. He played both single and double-events and reached the final in both tournaments.\nAt the double-event he partnered up with the Argentine Juan Mónaco.\nThe next event for Nadal was the Brasil Open. He again played both the singles and doubles events, in which he partnered up with David Nalbandian who also was his opponent in the final of the singles event. Nadal managed to overcome Nalbandian to win his first title in 2013.\nTwo weeks later Nadal played the Mexico Open, where he beat David Ferrer in the final to win his second title in a row.\nFollowing the Golden Swing Nadal confirmed his participation for the hardcourt event BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells in the USA taking place from March 4 to March 18.\nIndian Wells.\nIn Indian Wells Nadal received a Bye in the first round. In the second round he faced Ryan Harrison and managed to beat him in straight sets. Nadal was drawn to face Leonardo Mayer next, but Mayer withdrew from the tournament due to an injury. Nadal's next opponent was Ernests Gulbis who was on a thirteen match winning streak before Nadal defeated him in three tight sets to reach the quarterfinals where he played against his long-time rival Roger Federer. Nadal was able to overcome Federer in two sets. In the semifinals he played the World No. 6 Tomáš Berdych and managed again to win in two sets, which helped him to reach the final for the fourth time in his career. His opponent was Juan Martín del Potro who had previously beaten world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals. Nadal defeated del Potro in three sets, winning his record-breaking twenty-second ATP Masters 1000 event and his third Indian Wells title. Nadal subsequently withdrew from the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami in order to rest and prepare for the clay court season.\nEuropean Clay Court Season.\nAt Monte-Carlo Nadal reached his ninth straight final but lost in two sets to Djokovic.\nHe won in Barcelona in straight sets and then won the Madrid title for a record-breaking 23rd Masters 1000 title, before extending the record to 24 with three top 6 wins in a row against Ferrer, Berdych, and then Federer in an easy two set victory at the 2013 Rome Masters.\nNadal capped off his streak with a ninth straight final this year at the 2013 French Open, defeating Djokovic in an epic match that finished 9–7 in the fifth set. Nadal won the first set and led in the second by a break, but Djokovic then took four straight games to win the set. Nadal responded by dominating the third and led twice by a break in the fourth, but Djokovic broke back on both occasions. As a result, Nadal failed to serve out the match and faltered in the subsequent tiebreak. The momentum seemed to be with Djokovic, who broke at the beginning of the fifth and led 4–2 before Nadal made an impressive comeback. The match was reminiscent of their 2012 encounter at the Australian Open final. This time the match time was 4:37. In the final Nadal thrashed an in-form Ferrer in straight sets, breaking his own record and winning an unprecedented 8th French Open Championship.\nDuring the European clay season, Nadal earned a total of 5,100 points, making it (as of 2023) its most successful year in his entire career.\nGrass Court Season.\nNadal withdrew from Halle and played at Wimbledon. He was on a 22 match winning streak, when for the first time in his career, he lost a first round match at a Grand Slam, losing in three sets to lower-ranked Steve Darcis of Belgium. Many people speculated that this was the end of the year for Nadal, who was limping and visibly uncomfortable in his match.\nAmerican Hard Court Season.\nNadal took a break after Wimbledon. He regained his form in Montreal, destroying dangerous server Jerzy Janowicz in the first round. He then put up a strong performance to beat No.1 Djokovic on the hard courts during the semifinal, beating him in the tie-breaker in the final set. He defeated Milos Raonic in the final in straight sets to win his third title in Montreal and a record 25th masters title.\nNadal broke his own record yet again and won his 26th ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati Masters, beating Benjamin Becker, Dimitrov, Federer in the QF, Tomas Berdych, and finally John Isner in the final on Sunday 18 August. \nNadal entered the final Major of the year having missed the previous edition last year due to injury. Cruising through the first three rounds, he defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber in 4 sets in the 4th round, and then reached the final in winning the rest of matches in straight sets. In the final, Nadal yet again faced Djokovic. This was their 6th meeting in a Major final. Rafa took the first set, Novak took the second. But Rafa then gained momentum and won the next two sets to win the title. Thus Rafael Nadal won his second US Open Championship, and his 13th Major overall, putting him third on the all-time list behind Federer (17) and Sampras (14). He became the 3rd player after Patrick Rafter and Andy Roddick to win the Summer Slam (Won Canada, Cincinnati, and the US Open in the same year). He remained undefeated so far on Hard Courts in 2013.\nAsian Fall &amp; Indoor Hard Court Season.\nAt the China Open Nadal returned to the No.1 ranking by reaching the final. He had a noteworthy comeback in the quarter-finals against Fabio Fognini, where he fought back from a set and break down to secure the victory. In the final he lost to Djokovic in two sets. Nadal was defeated at the Shanghai Masters by del Potro in the semi-finals. Nadal's final tournament of the year before the World Tour Finals was at the Paris Masters. In Paris, Nadal reached the semifinals where he was defeated by compatriot David Ferrer for the first time in their last 10 head-to-head meeting. At the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals Nadal was unbeaten (3–0) in round robin play and by winning his first 2 matches sealed the Year End ATP World No. 1 Ranking in the process. In the semifinals Nadal faced long time rival Roger Federer, and recorded his first indoor win against the Swiss at the ATP World Tour Finals in straight sets. In the final he faced Novak Djokovic but lost in straight sets.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nNadal's 2013 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\n1 The symbol (i) = \"indoors\" means that the respective tournament will be held indoors.\n2 The ATP numbers between brackets = non-countable tournaments.\n3 Since Rafael Nadal withdrew from the Swiss open in the final part of the season this tournament became countable and the points were eligible for rankings.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\"\nExhibition matches.\nRafael Nadal took part in the annual BNP Paribas Showdown, where he faced Juan Martín del Potro in a rematch of their 2009 US Open semi-final. Nadal was defeated in straight sets."

        "title": "Norfolk county cricket teams",
        "text": "Norfolk county cricket teams were the teams that represented the historic county of Norfolk before the first official formation of Norfolk County Cricket Club in 1876.\n18th century.\nCricket had probably reached Norfolk by the end of the 17th century. The earliest known reference to cricket in Norfolk was in 1745. The first mention of a Norfolk representative team is in 1764, playing against Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds racecourse (today the location of Rougham Airfield) on 23 August. Norfolk won this match, which was reported in the \"Gazetteer &amp; London Daily Advertiser\" on Tuesday, 28 August. Norfolk played two further matches against Suffolk on 10 and 12 September at Scole.\n19th century.\nThe first important Norfolk club of the 19th century was that based at Holt and an 1820 Norfolk v Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) match, in which William Ward made a then-record score of 278, was in fact the Holt Club with E. H. Budd, Thomas Vigne and Felix Ladbroke as given men. This was perhaps a \"borderline\" match in terms of its status but, because of its historical importance in the light of Ward's record and the addition of the three given men, the standard was above the general run of Holt/Norfolk matches. The Holt club declined from the mid-1820s.\nAfter that, the centre of county cricket was Norwich and a prominent club was founded there on 11 January 1827. For a few seasons, prior to Fuller Pilch's departure for Kent about 1835, Norfolk could put a fairly strong eleven into the field. Their only major county opponent, however, was Sheffield Cricket Club (playing as Yorkshire) and the five games they played in 1833, 1834 (twice), 1835 and 1836 are important.\nApart from the games against Yorkshire, the main opponents of the Norwich/Norfolk team were Bury/Suffolk and MCC. These games however were not quite in the class of the Yorkshire matches. Norfolk played Cambridge Town Club (a.k.a. Cambridgeshire) in the 1840s but Norfolk generally fared very poorly and by 1852 the team had lost important status. After the present Norfolk County Cricket Club was founded in 1876, the county did not regain important status and it joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895."

        "text": "James Wilson (born 25 February 1972) is an English darts player who plays in events of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).\nCareer.\nBDO.\nWilson first rose to prominence in 2012 by winning several tournaments, rising to number four in the world and reaching the quarter-finals of the Winmau World Masters. Despite this, he was unseeded on his debut appearance at the World Championship and was drawn against top seed Stephen Bunting in round one, taking a 2–1 lead before eventually losing 2–3. Wilson followed up on his form in 2013, rising to second in the world and reaching the final of the World Masters beating Jan Dekker and Robbie Green en route to a 7–0 loss to Bunting. Later that year Wilson demolished Bunting 5–1 in the final of the Zuiderduin Masters. Wilson therefore entered the World Championship as the second seed, and beat former world champion Christian Kist in the first round then Scott Mitchell in the second round, to set up a quarter-final against Alan Norris, which Norris won 5–2 despite Wilson averaging 99.06, hitting three 11 dart legs (one of which included a bounce-out) and 14 180s.\nIn February 2014, Wilson found himself as de facto number one after Stephen Bunting's change-over to the rival Professional Darts Corporation. He subsequently won his first major at the inaugural BDO World Trophy. Wins over Richie George, Rick Hofstra, Jeffrey de Graaf and Paul Jennings saw Wilson progress to the final where he defeated Ross Montgomery 13–11 for a winner's cheque of £30,000.\nWilson entered the 2014 World Masters as the number one seed but suffered a shock first round exit, losing 3-0 in sets to Mark McGeeney. He also entered the 2015 BDO World Darts Championship as the number one seed but also lost in the first round to Sweden's Peter Sajwani.\nPDC.\nThe day after being knocked out of the 2015 BDO World Championship, Wilson announced on his Twitter page that he had signed up to the Professional Darts Corporation's Qualifying School with the intention of earning a tour card. On the third of four qualifying days Wilson won a two-year membership with the PDC by beating Nathan Aspinall 5–2 in the final round. Wilson's first PDC major was the UK Open and he beat Mark Frost 5–0 and Ricky Evans 9–4 to reach the fourth round, where he lost 9–7 against Kyle Anderson. In May he knocked out Steve Brown, Michael Smith, Jamie Lewis and Darren Johnson at the ninth Players Championship event of the year to reach his first PDC quarter-final and was defeated 6–3 by Gary Anderson. Wilson qualified for three European Tour events during the year, but was eliminated in the second round of each.\nIn 2016, Wilson lost to Kyle Anderson in the fourth round of the UK Open for the second year in a row, this time 9–2. Later in the year he reached the semi-finals of three successive Pro Tour events, before his first PDC final arrived at the 15th Players Championship event with wins over Steve Hine, James Richardson, Steve West, Vincent van der Voort, Raymond van Barneveld and Jermaine Wattimena. From 3–3, world number one Michael van Gerwen moved away to defeat Wilson 6–3. The pair met in the second round of the World Grand Prix with Van Gerwen winning 3–0 in sets. At the European Championship, Wilson beat Kim Huybrechts 6–3 and Mervyn King 10–9 to play in his first major PDC quarter-final, which he lost 10–7 to James Wade. He won a place at the Grand Slam of Darts through the qualifier and saw off Dave Chisnall 5–2 in his opening game, before losing 5–3 to Wade. He needed a win over Jamie Hughes to progress to the knockout stage and led 4–2, but went on to lose 5–4. Wilson also played in the Players Championship Finals for the first time after finishing 11th on the Order of Merit, but was knocked out 6–2 by Vincent Kamphuis in the first round.\nWilson topped the Pro Tour Order of Merit for non-qualified players to qualify for the 2017 World Championship. In his first appearance at the event he lost 3–0 to Kim Huybrechts in the opening round. He played 4 other major tournaments in 2017, namely 2nd round of UK Open 2017, and was eliminated in 1st rounds of World Matchplay 2017 and Players Championship Finals 2017. For the second time in a row, he qualified for Grand Slam of Darts, but was unable to make it through the round robin. Towards the end of the year Wilson broke into top 32 of PDC Order of Merit and qualified as 32nd seed for the PDC World Darts Championship 2018. \nWilson faced Krzysztof Ratajski in the first round of PDC World Darts Championship 2018 and won 3-1 on sets. In the second round he lost 0-4 to the world number one, Michael van Gerwen. In 2018 Wilson continued in his progress in PDC and settled himself comfortably in top 32 of PDC Order of Merit. He lost again in the 2nd round of UK Open 2018, as well as the first round of World Matchplay 2018. His best tournament of the year came at the World Grand Prix 2018, where he reached the second quarterfinal on major in his PDC career. He defeated former major title winners, Simon Whitlock (2-1 on sets) in the first round and the former World Champion, Adrian Lewis (3-2) in the second round. He lost in the quarterfinal to Peter Wright 2-3 in a very tight match. After a year break he later qualified for European Championship 2018 and defeated Jonny Clayton in the first round, losing to Max Hopp in the second round. Wilson did not qualify for Grand Slam of Darts but for the first time in his career, he made it to the second round of Players Championship Finals, after win over Dimitri van den Bergh. During the year Wilson changed back his nickname from \"Lethal Biscuit\" to \"Jammy Dodger\".\nHe entered the PDC World Darts Championship 2019 as 26th seed and in the new format, he started in the second round. He faced William O'Connor and lost 2-3 on sets. At the UK Open 2019 Wilson received bye to the 4th round, where he scored only one leg in a match against James Wade and lost 1-10. Wilson's form dropped down during the year and the only other major he played in was Players Championship Finals 2019, where he caused major surprise after winning 6-5 over the 4th seed, Peter Wright. In the second round Wilson was whitewashed by Chris Dobey. \nDespite falling out of top 32 in the PDC Order of Merit, Wilson qualified for PDC World Darts Championship 2020 through PDC Prot Tour Order of Merit, from 27th place. In the first round he lost to Nico Kurz 1-3 on sets. Wilson received bye into the 3rd round of UK Open 2020 and won over Ted Evetts 6-4, before losing to 4-10 to Michael Smith. James struggled during the year, having problems with both shoulder and eye injury. He was unable to qualify for any other major tournament that year and also failed to qualify for PDC World Darts Championship 2021. That caused him major fall down in the rankings and he ended the year on 64th position of PDC Order of Merit, maintaining his Tour card.\nWilson received bye to the 3rd round of UK Open 2021, where he lost 1-6 to Keegan Brown, averaging 80.88. Yet again, he was unable to qualify for any other major tournaments and was constantly dropping down the rankings. In November he won PDPA Qualifier for PDC World Darts Championship 2022 and kept a theoretical chance to hold his Tour card. After losing 1-3 against Luke Woodhouse in the 1st round, Wilson ended the year on 91st place of PDC Order of Merit and lost the Tour card.\nIn January 2022 Wilson entered PDC UK Q-School and automatically qualified for Final Stage. On the first day of the tournament, he regained his Tour card for 2 years after a win over Cameron Menzies 6-1.\nPerformance timeline.\nBDO\nPDC\nPDC European Tour"

Each national team consisted of three members, with each skiing 7.5 kilometres and shooting twice, once prone and once standing.\nAt each shooting station, a competitor has eight shots to hit five targets; however, only five bullets are loaded in a magazine at one - if additional shots are required, the spare bullets must be loaded one at a time. If after the eight shots are taken, there are still targets not yet hit, the competitor must ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nSummary.\nThis was the Olympic debut of the Women's Biathlon Relay. The race had been held at eight World Championships, all won by the Soviet Union. The Unified Team, carrying the tradition of the Soviets, plus two medalists from the Sprint race three days prior, were the favorites.\nAfter the first shooting stage, the Unified Team held a 30 second lead over a surprising Chinese team, which shot perfectly. Bulgaria and France were the only other teams within one minute. Germany, forced to ski a penalty loop, was in sixth. Shortly after leaving the shooting range, Yelena Belova took a wrong turn which cost the Unified Team roughly 20 seconds. Despite the error, Belova entered the second shooting stage with a 25 second gap, but gave it all back after skiing a penalty loop. Bulgaria and France left the shooting range tied for first, with Norway twenty seconds behind in third. The Unified Team was in fourth, 34 seconds behind the leaders.\nIn the second leg, France, Germany, and Bulgaria all shot perfectly from the prone position. While the Unified Team skied another penalty loop. France had a 14 second lead over Germany coming out of the range. The second shooting produced similar results, France and Germany needed only one combined extra round, while the Unified Team narrowly avoided a penalty loop. France exited the range with an eight second lead over Germany, and a 30 second lead over the Unified Team. Bulgaria was now over one minute behind. The final lap saw Anfisa Reztsova display the skiing speed that won her an Olympic cross-country skiing medal four years earlier. In just 2.5km, she made up over a minute on France, and nearly 30 seconds on Germany. Despite two penalty laps, and eight total extra rounds, the Unified Team had a seven second lead as the final exchange was made.\nThe final leg saw Anne Briand of France recoup nearly all of the 30 second deficit prior to the first shooting stage. The three leaders only needed one combined extra round, and all left the range within 9 seconds of each other. The podium was all but decided. Nerves were apparent in the final shooting stage, but no one took advantage. All three teams needed two extra rounds to clear the targets. France left the range with an 8 second advantage over Germany. The favored Unified Team, 27 seconds behind, would have to settle for bronze. Briand, continuing to ski the fastest leg of the entire event, increased the lead all the way to the finish.\nThis was the first ever Olympic biathlon medal for France."

        "text": "The 2013–14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Kentucky in the 2013–14 college basketball season. The team played its home games in Lexington, Kentucky for the 39th consecutive season at Rupp Arena, with a capacity of 23,500. The team was led by fifth-year head coach John Calipari. This team was nicknamed the \"Tweakables\" in reference to Calipari's comment prior to the 2014 SEC tournament. The team was the National Runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and also marked Kentucky's 16th Final Four appearance. It was Calipari's third Final Four appearance at Kentucky.\nDespite the 2012–13 team making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin, who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State. Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein. The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins, Aaron and Andrew.\nThe Wildcats were led by 2014 Consensus All-American and Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Rookie of the Year Randle, a unanimous first-team All-SEC selection. James Young (SEC 2nd team) also earned conference honors.\n2013–14 newcomers.\nMany recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class for Kentucky was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s. Some proclaimed that it was the greatest ever assembled. It featured a record six McDonald's All-Americans and five consensus top fifteen players.\nJulius Randle, originally from Plano, Texas, was the highest rated signee in the 2013 class. He committed to Kentucky on March 18, one day after Kentucky lost to Robert Morris in the opening round of the NIT. He chose Kentucky over Kansas and Texas. He was the nation's consensus top power forward, was ranked the No. 2 overall player by Rivals, the No. 3 overall player by ESPN and the No. 5 overall player by Scout. He helped lead Prestonwood Christian to three state titles including one in his freshman year and back-to-back titles in junior and senior seasons. He was a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand Classic game selection. He was the co-MVP in the Jordan Brand Classic.\nThe Harrison twins, Aaron and Andrew, became the first set of twins to ever play for Kentucky. Andrew was the consensus top point guard and Aaron was the consensus top shooting guard in the 2013 class. Out of Richmond, Texas, the Twins committed to Kentucky on October 4, 2012, on a live broadcast on ESPNU. The Twins chose Kentucky over their Father's alma mater, Maryland. They were a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand Classic game selections.\nJames Young was a consensus top ten prospect within the 2013 class. Originally from Rochester, Michigan, he committed to Kentucky on October 11, 2012, on ESPNU. He chose Kentucky over in-state schools Michigan and Michigan State. Young was ranked as the No. 6 prospect in the class by ESPN and No. 10 by both Rivals and Scout. He was a McDonald's All-America game selection.\nDakari Johnson was the consensus top center in the 2013 class. He committed to Kentucky on January 5, live on ESPNU. He chose Kentucky over Florida and Georgetown. He was rated as the No. 11 overall player by ESPN, No. 9 overall player by Rivals, and No. 18 over all player by Scout. Johnson led his high school, Montverde, to a national championship at the National High School Invitational where he claimed MVP honors after logging 18 points and eight rebounds. He was a McDonald's All-America.\nMarcus Lee was a highly touted forward that a multi-sport star in high school, make all-state selections in both basketball and volleyball. He committed to Kentucky on October 17, 2012, choosing Kentucky over California and Louisville. He was a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand Classic game selection.\nDerek Willis was the first commitment in the class of 2013. Originally committed to Purdue, he opted for the Wildcats on January 20, 2012, when he was junior in high school.\nDominique Hawkins was the least heralded of all the signees in the 2013 signing class. He was the 2013 Kentucky Mr. Basketball and is the 17th player in UK history to claim the honor. He directed Madison Central to the state championship and captured most valuable player honors after averaging 20.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.8 steals per game throughout the Kentucky Boys Sweet Sixteen.\nPre-season.\nRoster.\nOn March 18, 2013, Randle committed to play in the 2013–14 season. On March 31 Harrow announced he was leaving Kentucky to transfer to Georgia State for his remaining two seasons of eligibility. On April 1 Goodwin entered the 2013 NBA draft while Cauley-Stein and Wiltjer announced they were returning. On April 2, Poythress decided to return to school for his sophomore season. On April 10 Hawkins committed to play in the 2013–14 season. On April 15 Noel entered the 2013 NBA Draft. On July 19 Wiltjer announced he was leaving Kentucky to transfer to Gonzaga for his remaining two seasons of eligibility.\nOn June 27, 2013, Noel was selected sixth in the 2013 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Pelicans and traded to the Philadelphia Sixers for in exchange for Jrue Holiday and 42nd pick which was used to select Pierre Jackson. Goodwin was drafted 29th by the Golden State Warriors and traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for 30th pick which was used to select Nemanja Nedovic.\nOff-season rankings.\nThe earliest preseason predictions were made the day after the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament on April 9, before final decisions by college players about declaring for the 2013 NBA draft and before many high-school players signed a National Letter of Intent about their 2013 seasons. With the high expectations of the talented incoming players from the 2013 signing class (Harrisons, Johnson, Lee, Randle, Young), Kentucky was projected as the top ranked team by ESPN. \"USA Today\" projected the same sentiment that the talented freshmen would make Kentucky the top team in the 2013–14 season.\nOn April 30, ESPN's Eamonn Brennan named Randle a third-team 2013–14 pre-offseason All-American selection. In June 2013, \"Sporting News\" Mike DeCourcy named Cauley-Stain and Randle as the third-best players at their respective positions (center and power forward) while Poythress was named the sixth-best small forward for the upcoming season.\nAccolades and rankings.\nThe Southeastern Conference preseason media poll was released at the SEC Media Days in October, it predicted that Kentucky would win the championship and selected Randle as its Player of the Year. Randle was also named to the All-SEC First Team while Cauley-Stein, Andrew Harrison, and Johnson were named to the All-SEC Second Team.\n\"USA Today\" announced its initial coaches poll on October 18, with Kentucky ranked as No. 1 in the country. The Associated Press announced on October 31 that Kentucky was ranked No. 1 to start the season in its initial poll of the season.\nEvents.\nOn October 3 the camp out for Big Blue Madness, Kentucky's version of Midnight Madness, began. There were a record 755 tents set up around Memorial Coliseum to be first in line for the tickets that went on sale for Big Blue Madness on October 5. Tickets for Big Blue Madness sold out on October 5 in thirty minutes.\nBig Blue Madness took place on October 18. The event debuted the team for the 2013–14 season. It included player introductions, a speech by Calipari, and a scrimmage.\nThe Blue-White scrimmage was the first live game for the team. It occurred at Rupp Arena on October 29. The Blue team started four freshmen, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, Young and Randle, along with Cauley-Stein. The White team opened with Jarrod Polson, Jon Hood, sophomore Poythress, Willis, and Lee. Young led all players with 21 points.\nThe first exhibition game was against Transylvania on November 1 at Rupp Arena. Kentucky defeated Transylvania 76 to 42. Randle notched a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds.\nThe second and final exhibition game was against Montevallo on November 4 at Rupp Arena. Kentucky defeated Montevallo 95 to 72. Randle collected 21 points and 11 rebounds, giving him a double-double in both exhibition games. Young tallied 16 points and had the play of the night when he saved the ball from going out of bounds and accidentally lofted the ball into his own defensive basket, scoring two points for Montevallo.\n2014–15 signees.\nIn November Kentucky signed another top recruiting class. John Calipari announced four players for his 2014 class during the early signing period on November 14. Trey Lyles (Indianapolis), Karl-Anthony Towns (Metuchen, N.J.), Devin Booker (Grand Rapids, Mich.) and Tyler Ulis (Chicago Heights, Ill.) all signed national letters of intent to play basketball at the University of Kentucky, starting in the 2014–15 season.\nKarl-Anthony Towns was the first commitment for the class when verbally committed on December 4, 2012. He was named Gatorade National Player of the Year in 2014. He played for the Dominican Republic National Team in 2012 and 2013 which were coached by John Calipari and Kentucky assistant, Orlando Antigua. He was ranked as No. 6 overall by ESPN and No. 11 by Rivals and Scout.\nTyler Ulis was the second commitment in the class when he verbally committed on September 13, 2013. He committed to Kentucky briefly after he was offered a scholarship. Kentucky had just missed on their primary target, Emmanuel Mudiay, when he committed to SMU on August 24, 2013. Ulis, however, quickly rose the recruiting ranking finishing No. 20 overall by Scout, No. 21 overall by Rivals, and No. 25 overall by ESPN. He chose Kentucky over Iowa, Michigan State, and Southern Cal.\nDevin Booker was the third commitment in the class when he verbally committed on October 31, 2013.

The tournament is currently held at Nudgee Golf Club in Nudgee.\nHistory.\nThe event was founded as the Queensland Professional Championship in 1926. The inaugural championship was played at Brisbane Golf Club in late November with 12 professionals competing. There was a 36-hole stroke-play stage with the leading 4 qualifying for the match-play. The 36-hole semi-finals were played the following day with the 36-hole final on the third day. Arthur Spence, the Royal Queensland professional, beat Jack Quarton, the Toowoomba professional, in the final. In 1927 the number of qualifiers was increased to 8, with the quarter and semi-finals played over 18 holes on the second day. From 1930 the event was extended to four days, with all matches over 36 holes.\nCharlie Brown was the most successful golfer before World War II, winning three times in succession from 1930 to 1932. He appeared in 7 finals in a row and 9 finals in all. Ossie Walker was another three-time winner, in 1934, 1936 and 1938. After the war, Reg Want dominated, winning 7 times in 9 years to 1954. He didn't play in one of the other two, losing the other at the quarter-final stage. He won for an eighth time in 1962. Darrell Welch won four times in five years between 1956 and 1960. Since Want's eighth win in 1962, no player has won the event more than twice.\nThe championship has been a PGA Tour of Australasia event since 2009 and has been held at City Golf Club in Toowoomba during that period.\nNo tournament was played in 2021, but the tournament returned in 2022 with a change of venue to Nudgee Golf Club in Nudgee.\nNotable former winners of the event include major champions David Graham, Greg Norman and Ian Baker-Finch. In addition, 2015 PGA champion Jason Day narrowly lost out in a playoff in the 2005 event when it was part of the Von Nida Tour.\nMultiple winners.\nSixteen players have won this tournament more than once through 2020."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Allan Donald",
        "text": "Allan Donald is a former Test and One Day International (ODI) cricketer who represented the South African cricket team between 1991, when the team's suspension from international cricket was lifted following the end of the apartheid regime, and 2003. A right-arm fast bowler, Donald was described by ESPNcricinfo writer Peter Robinson as \"South Africa's greatest fast bowler\". Donald took 330 wickets in Test cricket and 272 in ODIs, and remains the second highest wicket-taker of his country in ODIs as of 2013. The \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" named him one of their cricketers of the year in 1992 and rated him the second best ODI bowler in 2003. During his international career, Donald took 22 five-wicket hauls. A five-wicket haul—also known as a five-for or fifer—refers to the feat of a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 41 bowlers have at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers.\nDonald took a five-wicket haul in his ODI debut against India at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata in November 1991, taking 5 wickets for 29 runs, the fifth best performance by any bowler on ODI debut. Despite this South Africa lost the match, however, Donald secured a Man of the match award. He picked up another five-wicket haul in October 1996, against Kenya when he claimed 6 wickets for 23 runs at the Nairobi Gymkhana Club. The bowling figures are the second best by a South African as of 2013.\nDonald made his Test debut against the West Indies in April 1992, collecting six wickets in the match. He took a five-wicket haul for the first time in Tests when he took 5 wickets for 55 runs against India during the third Test of a four-match series held later that year. He took another five wicket haul in the second innings, thus collecting 12 wickets for 139 runs in the match. Donald went on to repeat this feat against England in November 1999. His career-best bowling figures in an innings came when he took 8 wickets for 71 runs against Zimbabwe in 1995 at the Harare Sports Club. He was most successful against England, taking nine fifers. As of 2013, he is sixteenth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

        "text": "The Albany Great Danes women's basketball team is the basketball team that represents the University at Albany, SUNY in Albany, New York. The school's team currently competes in the America East Conference and plays its home games at SEFCU Arena.\nHistory.\nUAlbany Women's Basketball had little success on the court since it started play in 1964–65. Its greatest success took place in 1985–86 when it went 26–4 and made it the 3rd Round of the NCAA Division III Tournament. Coach Mari Warner would lead the program into Division I play in 1999–00, but again success was limited. Through the 2000s under new coach Trina Patterson, winning was also limited. However, things began to change in 2010–11 under former head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson. That season UA finished over .500 for the first time since 1997–98. Abrahamson-Henderson led UAlbany to its then-best record in Division I history in the 2011–12, going 23–10 overall. The Great Danes brought home their first-ever America East Conference title, and represented the league in the NCAA Tournament. UAlbany visited defending National Champions Texas A&amp;M, but fell 69–47.\nThe Great Danes dominated all conference opposition in the 2012–13 season with a 27–4 overall record, winning all games against America East opponents including 16 regular season games and all league championship contests. UAlbany became the first team to go undefeated in the America East and win the conference since the 1995–96 season. Abrahamson-Henderson earned America East Coach of the Year honors for her efforts. Ebone Henry was named the America East Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. They would win their second straight title, but lose to North Carolina 59–54 in the first round.\nThe 2013–14 Great Danes did not lose a beat, earning a three-peat as America East champion, going 28–5 with a 15–1 conference record. The team earned the 1-seed in the America East Tournament after winning its first 15 league games. It would win its 3rd straight and earned a 15-seed in the NCAAs and pushed 2-seed West Virginia to the brink before falling 76–61 in the NCAA First Round.\nIn 2014–15 UA went 24–9 overall with a 14–2 America East record. UAlbany had a number of program firsts that season, including the first win over a Power Five program, defeating three-time reigning Big Ten regular season champion Penn State to earn a berth into the Preseason WNIT semi-finals, the first DI All-American with Shereesha Richards and the program's highest-ever NCAA seeding at 13, battling Duke to the end and leading in the final minute, falling to the Blue Devils 54–52.\nOn March 11, 2016, the Great Danes would win their conference record breaking 5th straight title. They would defeat Maine 59–58, who they shared the co-regular season title with back-to-back years. Both teams split their regular season match-up.\nTwo players that would have their numbers retired once their time was over at UAlbany was Ebone Henry and Julie Foster. In 2012–13 Henry was named the America East Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year with 13.8 points, 5.1 rebounds and 2.8 steals per game. She would also win three straight Defensive Player of the Year awards and three First Team All-Conference.\nShereesha Richards was also critical in the 5 straight titles for UAlbany. She would win three America East Player of the Year awards along with a Co-Rookie of the Year Award. She would finish as the All-Time scorer in UAlbany Basketball history (Men's and Women's program) with 2,440 points and became the first DI All-American in Great Danes history. She would finish her career with over 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.\nSources:\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Great Danes have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament six times. Their combined record is 1–6.\nWNIT.\nThe Great Danes appeared in the Women's National Invitation Tournament twice, with a combined record of 0– 2.\nNCAA Division III.\nThe Great Danes appeared in the NCAA Division III Tournament two times, with a combined record of 3–2."

        "text": "The Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team represents the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. The team is a member of the Big Ten Conference as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team plays its regular season games at 15,400-seat Carver-Hawkeye Arena, along with men's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\nHistory.\nIowa women's basketball began in 1974, under head coach Lark Birdsong. The first Iowa team finished 5–16 in 1974–75, its first victory over the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Birdsong coached Iowa until 1978–79, which marked Iowa's first winning season. She was subsequently replaced by Judy McMullen, who led the program for the next four years. McMullen was succeeded in 1983 by former Cheyney University coach C. Vivian Stringer. Prior to her stay at Iowa, Stringer led the Cheyney Wolves to the 1982 NCAA championship.\nBeginning with the 1983–84 season, Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Stringer coached at Iowa for 12 seasons. In that time, the Hawkeyes won six Big Ten championships, played in nine NCAA Tournaments, and reached the Final Four in 1993. Unprecedented attention was shown to the Hawkeyes under Stringer, as evidenced by the record-setting 22,157 fans that watched Iowa play Ohio State on February 3, 1985, in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Stringer, however, left Iowa to coach at Rutgers in 1995, following the death of her husband, Bill.\nAngie Lee replaced Stringer, and led the Hawkeyes to a Big Ten championship in her first season. Under Lee, Iowa won another Big Ten title in 1998. In 2000, Lee's successor as head coach was Lisa Bluder. Bluder is Iowa's current women's basketball coach. Under Bluder, the Hawkeyes have won two regular season Big Ten championships (2008, 2022) and five Big Ten tournament championships (2001, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024).\nFrom 2015 to 2019, Megan Gustafson played for Coach Bluder and the women's basketball program at Iowa. Gustafson was named the 2019 National Player of the year, after averaging a double-double of 27.8 points and 13.4 rebounds on 69.9% shooting. The 2018–19 Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team had a 29–7 regular season record, winning the Big Ten Conference tournament championship and advancing to the Elite Eight of the 2019 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nThe 2021–22 Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team finished the season 24–8 sharing the regular season title with Ohio State. They also won the 2022 Big Ten women's basketball tournament, defeating Indiana 74–67 in the Big Ten Championship. Caitlin Clark was named the Most Outstanding Player for the Tournament. Iowa repeated as Big Ten champions the following year, with Clark being named the most outstanding player. Later that season, they advanced to the Final Four for the first time in three decades.\nCrossover at Kinnick.\nOn October 15, 2023, the Iowa women's basketball team set a record for most people in attendance at a women's basketball game. 55,646 people attended Crossover at Kinnick, which took place at Kinnick Stadium. The Hawkeyes play the majority of their home games in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, but coach Lisa Bluder came up with the idea to hold an event in the football stadium. The Hawkeyes played in the national championship game at the end of the previous season. Despite losing, following the championship, the team returned home to a welcome celebration on campus with over 9,000 fans, which inspired Bluder to plan an outdoor event. \nCaitlin Clark recorded a triple double with 34 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds. The game was close early, but Iowa took a solid lead and ended up with the win in the exhibition game 94–72. The game was played for charity, and the school presented a check for 250,000 dollars to the Stead Family Children's Hospital. The hospital overlooks the end zone of the stadium, and children in the hospital can watch home football games as well as this special event. At the end of the first quarter, fans and players turned toward the hospital and waved to the children, a continuation of a tradition started by the football team in 2017.\nNCAA tournament results.\nIowa has appeared in 29 NCAA Tournaments with a record of 34−30.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Hawkeyes have retired three jerseys in honor of the women's program, the most recent being Caitlin Clark in 2024."

        "title": "The Swimming Pool Q's",
        "text": "The Swimming Pool Q's are an American new wave/jangle pop band formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 1978. They released five albums: \"The Deep End\", \"The Swimming Pool Q's\", \"Blue Tomorrow\", \"World War Two Point Five\", and \"Royal Academy of Reality\".\nFormation.\nThe band was formed in 1978 by Jeff Calder (vocals, guitar, saxophone, theremin) and Bob Elsey (guitar), who recruited Billy Jones (bass guitar), and Robert Schmid (drums). Vocalist/keyboard player Anne Richmond Boston joined prior to the first single, \"Rat Bait\", released in 1979 on their own Clorinated label. The single brought them critical praise and they secured support slots with Devo and The Police. Jones left, and was replaced by Peter Jarkunas. They signed to Danny Beard's DB Records and released debut album \"The Deep End\" in June 1981, which went on to sell around 20,000 copies. A single for DB, \"Little Misfit\", was released in 1982.\nAfter two years without a further release, and with Jarkunas and Schmid replaced by J.E. Garnett and Billy Burton, the band returned in 1984 with the single \"The Bells Ring\" and album \"The Swimming Pool Q's\", now signed to A&amp;M Records. They toured with Lou Reed as support act on his \"New Sensations\" tour. A second album for A&amp;M, \"Blue Tomorrow\" (1986), failed to meet the label's expectations and the band was dropped.\nThe Q's then signed to Capitol Records, and released the album \"World War Two Point Five\" in 1989. Boston left by this point, but she designed the album sleeve. The band split up in 1992.\nAnne Richmond Boston released the album \"The Big House of Time\" in 1990, with her then-husband Rob Gal (of The Coolies).\nCalder and Elsey continued to play and write together, and Calder played in the band Supreme Court, including on the 1993 album \"Goes Electric\".\nReunion.\nThe band reformed in 1998. That year, Calder contributed to the children's musical audiobook \"Not Dogs...Too Simple (A Tale of Two Kitties)\". An expanded version of \"The Deep End\" was released in 2001 with thirteen bonus tracks. \nIn 2003, an ambitious new album titled \"Royal Academy of Reality\" was released. A review by Allmusic said:\nA Kickstarter project was set up to fund the reissue of the band's two A&amp;M albums, which reached its $15,000 target in September 2012. In June 2013, their two A&amp;M albums were re-released on compact disc in a two-disc edition and three-disc, one DVD deluxe edition under the Bar None Records label.\nMusical style.\nWhile often categorized as new wave or jangle pop, the band was described as \"folk pop gone country\" in 1984. An early inspiration was the Hampton Grease Band, and the band were described in 1981 as \"Beefheart-influenced\". A 1986 review of \"Blue Tomorrow\" described the band's sound as \"a masterful synthesis of styles\"."

        "title": "Rugby Football Excursion",
        "text": "Rugby Football Excursion is a 44-line poem by Louis MacNeice. It was written in 1938 and first published in book form in MacNeice's poetry collection The Earth Compels (1938). The poem recounts an excursion taken by MacNeice from London to Dublin, in order to watch a rugby football match at Lansdowne Road stadium. MacNeice does not specify the occasion, but internal evidence from the poem establishes the match as a rugby football international when England defeated Ireland on 12 February 1938, 36 - 14.\nBackground.\nLouis MacNeice, like his fellow Irish writer Samuel Beckett, took a keen interest in rugby football. MacNeice played rugby while a pupil at Sherborne Preparatory School and Marlborough College, and later enjoyed watching matches involving Ireland. The Irish poet Conor O'Callaghan, reviewing the \"Collected Poems\" of Louis MacNeice in \"Poetry\" magazine, notes that MacNeice left Ireland for boarding school in England at the age of ten and never lived in Ireland again. \"However, he always supported Ireland in international rugby matches with England\".\n\"Rugby Football Excursion\" recounts an excursion taken by MacNeice from London to Dublin, in order to watch a rugby football match at Lansdowne Road stadium. The journey begins by train from Euston railway station:\nThe journey then continues by boat across the Irish Sea on the passenger vessel Hibernia, before arriving in Dublin:\nMacNeice then evokes the atmosphere at Lansdowne Road, where is to be played the rugby football match. MacNeice does not specify the actual occasion, but the details provided in the sixth stanza - \"Eccentric scoring - Nicholson, Marshall and Unwin, / Replies by Bailey and Daly\" - establish the match as a rugby football international between Ireland and England in the 1938 Home Nations Championship, played on 12 February 1938. England led 23-0 at half-time but Ireland improved during the second half, managing to score four tries (the last of which was scored by Maurice Daly, making his first and only appearance for Ireland). England won the match by 36 points to 14, with tries by (among others) Basil Nicholson, Robert Marshall and Jimmy Unwin. Pathé News made a newsreel of this match. The newsreel shows the English and Irish teams running onto the pitch, watched by a huge crowd, followed by various shots of the match in progress.\nAfter the match, as MacNeice recounts, he had \"tea and toast with Fellows and Bishops\" in a Regency room overlooking St Stephen's Green, before taking \"a walk through Dublin down the great / Grey streets broad and straight and drowned in twilight\". The poem ends with MacNeice leaving Dublin, taking the boat from Dún Laoghaire back across the Irish Sea to England.\nStructure.\n\"Rugby Football Excursion\" is a poem of eleven stanzas, each of four lines. The poem does not make use of end rhyme. MacNeice does however make formal use of internal rhyme, rhyming the end of the second line in each stanza with the beginning of the fourth line (\"Daly/Gaily\", \"twilight/High lights\"). An additional internal rhyme comes in the last stanza, where \"beery\" rhymes with Dún Laoghaire (pronounced Dunleary).\nThe poem is autobiographical, and is narrated in the first person by Louis MacNeice.\nThemes.\nThe literary critic Samuel Hynes notes how Louis MacNeice \"commonly presented himself... as a lover of ordinary pleasures\". Hynes quotes a passage from Zoo (1938), written the same year as \"Rugby Football Excursion\", in which MacNeice describes reacting with delight to (among other things) \"Moran’s two classic tries at Twickenham in 1937\". \"Rugby Football Excursion\" is on one level a poem about the pleasure and excitement of watching a rugby football match: \"Lansdowne Road - the swirl of faces, flags, / Gilbert and Sullivan music, emerald jerseys...\" However, the poem also explores MacNeice's ambivalent feelings about Ireland and his Irish heritage, a theme which is present in other poems by MacNeice from this period such as Carrickfergus and Autumn Journal. His walk through Dublin after the match takes him past \"Statues of poets and Anglo-Irish patriots\" but also takes in \"Junkshops, the smell of poverty\" and \"street on street of broken / Fanlights over the doors of tenement houses\"."

        "text": "The men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics was held in Sochi, Russia between 12–23 February 2014. For the fifth consecutive Olympics, players from the National Hockey League participated. Twelve countries qualified for the tournament; nine of them did so automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation, while the other three took part in a qualification tournament.\nIn the semi-finals, Canada won over the United States, and Sweden won over Finland. In the final, Canada defeated Sweden to win the tournament for the ninth time, and avenged their 1994 gold medal loss. Finland finished with the bronze medal, defeating the US, with captain Teemu Selänne awarded as the MVP of the tournament, scoring twice in the bronze-medal game.\nWith the gold medal, Canada became the first men's team to successfully defend an Olympic title since the Soviet Union in 1988, the first team to finish the tournament undefeated since 1984 and the first to do both with the full NHL participation.\nCanada surrendered only three goals in six games, the fewest allowed by a gold medallist since 1928 when Canada shut out the opposition in a three-game tournament. Canada also scored only seventeen goals, the fewest by a gold medal-winning team in Olympic history, although Great Britain averaged fewer goals per game at the 1936 Winter Olympics (nineteen goals in eight games).\nQualification.\nCanada, Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States qualified as the top nine teams in the IIHF World Ranking in 2012. Austria, Latvia, and Slovenia qualified by winning the qualification tournament.\nOfficials.\nThe IIHF selected 14 referees and 14 linesmen to work the 2014 Winter Olympics. They were the following:\nGames were primarily officiated by NHL referees, a stipulation by the NHL if most Olympic players are NHLers, according to the IIHF (not NHL) rules.\nPreliminary round.\nTiebreak criteria.\nIn each group, teams will be ranked according to the following criteria:\nAll times are local (UTC+4).\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;\nA Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3-2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2-2. USA went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while USA received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by many Russian politicians, TV hosts and commentators. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of International Ice Hockey Federation, officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play.&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;section begin=C /&gt;&lt;section end=C /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C5 /&gt;&lt;section end=C5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C6 /&gt;&lt;section end=C6 /&gt;\nPlayoff round.\nFollowing the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1D through 12D. To determine this ranking, the following criteria were used in the order presented:\nQualification playoffs.\nThe four highest-ranked teams (1D–4D) received byes and were deemed the home team in the quarterfinals as they are seeded to advance, with the remaining eight teams (5D–12D) playing qualification playoff games as follows.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D4 /&gt;&lt;section end=D4 /&gt;\nQuarterfinals.\nTeams seeded D1 to D4 are the home teams.\nFollowing the quarterfinal games, the winning teams will be re-ranked F1 through F4, with the winner of 1D vs. E4 re-ranked as F1, the winner of 2D vs. E3 re-ranked as F2, the winner of 3D vs. E2 re-ranked as F3, and the winner of 4D vs. E1 re-ranked as F4.

Canada shut Sweden out with an overpowering defense limiting them to 24 shots, and Canada's goaltender Carey Price played well when needed. The Canadian team's executive director Steve Yzerman called the performance in Sochi the finest defensive effort ever for a Canadian team. Canada shut out its opponents in the semifinals and final and allowed only three goals in six games. It was also the first time since 1928 that a Canadian team won all its games.\nThe win represented Canada's second consecutive men's gold in ice hockey, and the third time in four Olympics that Canada won both men's and women's gold in hockey.\nThe game was a national phenomenon in Canada, with more than 15 million Canadians watching at least part of the game.

        "text": "The women's tournament in ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics was held in Sochi, Russia.\nFor the first time, the women's gold medal game was decided in overtime, with Canada defeating the United States 3–2. Switzerland defeated Sweden for their first Olympic ice hockey medal in 66 years, and first medal in the women's tournament.\nWith the win, the Canadian women's national ice hockey team won its fourth consecutive gold medal, a feat only previously accomplished by the Soviet Union men's team in 1964–76, and the Canadian men's team in 1920–32. Canadians Hayley Wickenheiser, Jayna Hefford and Caroline Ouellette became the first hockey players to win four Olympic gold medals. They also joined Soviet biathlete Alexander Tikhonov and German speed skater Claudia Pechstein as the only athletes to win gold medals in four straight Winter Olympics.\nOn 6 December 2017, nearly four years after the tournament was played, six players from the Russian national team (Inna Dyubanok, Yekaterina Lebedeva, Yekaterina Pashkevich, Anna Shibanova, Yekaterina Smolentseva, and Galina Skiba) were subjected to sanctions, and the team was disqualified by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) based on findings from the reanalysis of doping samples collected from Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Games by the Oswald Commission. Ten days later, Tatiana Burina and Anna Shukina were also sanctioned and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) was directed to modify results accordingly. All eight of the players were \"declared ineligible to be accredited in any capacity for all editions of the Games of the Olympiad and the Olympic Winter Games subsequent to the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014\" and \"disqualified from the events in which they participated\" by the IOC. The players registered their appeals with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and, in 2018, five of the eight players (Lebedeva, Pashkevich, Smolentseva, Burina, and Shukina) won their appeals, the sanctions against them were annulled and their results were reinstated. The sanctions against Inna Dyubanok, Anna Shibanova, and Galina Skiba were partially upheld, though the life-ban on Olympic competition was lifted, and the disqualification of the team was maintained on account of their violations.\nQualification.\nRussia qualified as the host. Canada, the United States, Finland, Switzerland, and Sweden qualified as the top five teams in the IIHF World Ranking. Germany and Japan qualified via the qualification tournament.\nOfficials.\nThe IIHF selected six referees and nine linesmen to work the 2014 Winter Olympics. They were the following:\nPreliminary round.\nFormat.\nThe top four teams based on the 2012 IIHF World Ranking, Canada, United States, Finland and Switzerland, competed in Group A, while the remaining four teams competed in Group B. The top two teams in Group A received a bye to the semifinals. In the quarterfinals, the third place team in Group A played the second place team in Group B, while the fourth placed team in Group A played the first place team in Group B. The winners advanced to the semifinals, while the two losers, and the third and fourth placed teams in Group B, competed in a classification bracket for places five through eight. This format has been used since the 2012 World Championship.\nTiebreak criteria.\nIn each group, teams were ranked according to the following criteria:\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nFinal round.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top two teams (A1–A2) received byes and were deemed the home team in the semifinals as they were seeded to advance.\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nTeams seeded A1 and A2 were the home teams.\n&lt;section begin=F1 /&gt;&lt;section end=F1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\nBronze medal game.\n&lt;section begin=G1 /&gt;&lt;section end=G1 /&gt;\nGold medal game.\n&lt;section begin=G2 /&gt;&lt;section end=G2 /&gt;\n5–8th place semifinals.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\nSeventh place game.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\nFifth place game.\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\nFinal rankings.\nThe final rankings of the 2014 Winter Olympics Women's Ice Hockey Tournament are as follows:\nThe Russian team was disqualified for the doping.

Persson won TV-pucken with Värmland in 2000, won four Swedish Junior Championships with Västra Frölunda HC in 2002 and 2003 (under-20 and under-18), won promotion to Elitserien with Rögle BK in the 2008 Kvalserien, and won the 2012 European Trophy with Luleå HF.\nPersson has represented Sweden at two International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)-sanctioned events; the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships and the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nPlaying career.\nPersson started playing hockey in his youth with IK Viking, in his hometown Hagfors. He won TV-pucken with Värmland in 2000, scoring six goals and a total of eleven points in eight games. For the 2001–02 season Persson signed with Västra Frölunda HC to play for their junior organisation, and attend the hockey gymnasium in Gothenburg. Persson spent the majority of the season with the under 20 team in the J20 SuperElit. Playing 35 games, Persson scored six goals and ten assists for a total of 16 points. In the playoffs Persson played five games, scoring one goal and an assist as Frölunda won the Swedish under 20 Championship. Having played just three games with the under 18 team during the regular season, scoring one goal, Persson joined the team for the playoffs, leading Frölunda to a gold medal in the Swedish under 18 Championship by scoring four goals in a 10–1 win against Huddinge IK in the first game of the finals. He became the playoff leading scorer with six goals and three assists for nine points in three games. The following season Persson played 30 games in the J20 SuperElit, scoring ten goals and 19 assists, and five assists in six playoff games as Frölunda captured a consecutive gold medal in the Swedish under 20 Championships. Not having played with the under 18 team during the regular season, Persson appeared in two playoff games, assisting on two goals in the quarterfinals against Leksands IF, and scoring one goal and an assist in the decisive game two of the final against Modo Hockey, which Frölunda won 6–1, winning consecutive gold medals at the under 18 Swedish Championship as well. For the 2003–04 Persson was named captain of Frölunda's under 20 team. He played 36 games in the J20 SuperElit, scoring nine goals, 24 assists for 33 points. During the season Persson was called up to Frölunda's senior team, playing in two exhibition games and was on the roster for one game in Elitserien—Sweden's premier men's league—on December 28 in a 4–0 win against Timrå IK, though not receiving any time on the ice. In the J20 SuperElit playoffs Persson played five games, scoring one goal and five assists as Frölunda were eliminated in the semifinal against Modo Hockey.\nAfter the season, Persson was offered a contract by Frölunda to continue playing junior hockey and be used as a thirteenth forward with the senior team, but chose to sign a two-year contract with Hammarby IF in HockeyAllsvenskan—Sweden's second tier men's league. Persson only played 13 games with Hammarby's senior team before being loaned to AIK in Division 1—Sweden's third tier men's league—where he played five games, scoring three goals and two assists.\nAfter four successful seasons in Karlskoga, Persson signed a two-year contract with Luleå HF in Elitserien. Persson scored nine goals and eleven assists for 20 points in 51 games. On April 4, 2013, Linus Persson scored his fifth Elitserien playoff goal of his career, just twelve seconds into overtime of Game 4 against Färjestad BK, which broke the record for the fastest overtime goal ever scored in Elitserien playoff history. With eight goals and four assists in 15 games Persson was the scoring leader in the 2013 Swedish Championship playoffs. He led Luleå to the final where they lost the best-of-seven series in four games to Skellefteå AIK."

Through 2020, the team has an all–time record of 268–539–1.\nThe team's most successful period in the modern era occurred in the 1980s under head coach Bob Lindsay. Helmed by Lindsay, the Crusaders won 12 games in three seasons, while capturing all three of their conference championships as a member of the Colonial League. In Lindsay's 9 years, Holy Cross suffered only two losing seasons. The Crusaders would not have another non-losing season until 2019, in which they finished 77, before their first winning season in 32 years in 2020. Shortly after Lindsay's departure in 1990, Holy Cross joined their all-sports conference home, the Patriot League, completing their first season with Ed Carver as head coach.\nLong an underachieving program, the Crusaders have seen an uptick in their performance in recent years. In 2015, the team won its only two victories over ranked foes, downing #8 Loyola in Baltimore before defeating the #9 Army Black Knights men's lacrosse for the first time in program history. Both wins came by just a single goal in dramatic fashion.

Through 2020, the team has an all–time record of 278–690–1.\nThe Leopards own one of the historically oldest programs in NCAA Division I lacrosse. However, that pedigree has not transferred over to much on-field success. While fellow Patriot League opponents such as Army, Loyola, and Navy have had consistent success in the NCAA tournament, the Leopards are still seeking their first bid. Additionally, traditional rival Lehigh captured 11 pre-NCAA national titles and dominates the rivalry series 69–21–1, including wins in 24 of the last 26 meetings through 2019.\nWhile not winning a league championship or earning an NCAA tournament berth, Lafayette has had several strings of successful seasons. Many came under the helm of coach Bill Lawson, who guided the program from 1972 to 2002. Lawson has the most wins in school history with 155 and managed three seasons with at 9 victories. Lawson also managed the three best league finishes in program history, finishing tied for second place in the Patriot League three straight times from 1991 to 1993. Since Lawson left the program, the Leopards have struggled in conference play, managing a .500 record or better only once. That season, 2010, also saw the highest finish in league play since 1993 with a tie for third place and a bid to their only Patriot League Tournament appearance, which ended with a semifinal loss to Navy. Since 2011, Lafayette has gone 4–64 in the Patriot League, having lost 23 consecutive games since an upset victory over Navy in 2017.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Lafayette’s results by season since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to COVID-19."

        "text": "The Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's lacrosse team represents Lehigh University in NCAA Division I college lacrosse. The Mountain Hawks play their home games at Frank Banko Field, which is part of a complex that also includes Lehigh's soccer and field hockey venues. Will Scudder is the program's current head coach since June 19, 2023.\nOverview.\nLehigh is a charter member of the USILA, one of about two dozen.\nEarly national titles.\nAccording to \"Lehigh's Epitome Yearbook\", lacrosse was introduced at Lehigh in 1884 and four years later, Lehigh entered the Inter-collegiate Lacrosse Association, mostly through the efforts of Arnold K. Reese, an 1889 graduate, who captained and trained the team throughout his college career. Lehigh played its first varsity lacrosse game on May 9, 1885 against Stevens Tech.\nAccording to the Lehigh Burr, Lehigh was a top team in the early years of inter-collegiate lacrosse. Lehigh was third in 1888, second in 1889, and was voted the National Champion in 1890. In what was billed as a \"Championship Series\" that season, Lehigh defeated Princeton, Johns Hopkins and Stevens Tech to win the title.\nSince starting lacrosse, the team has a record of 647-715-10 in 135 lacrosse seasons.\nRecent history.\nLehigh has made three appearances in the NCAA Tournament; their first was in 2012. They earned an automatic bid into the tournament by winning the Patriot League conference tournament over Bucknell, 13–9.\nTheir first NCAA Tournament game ended in defeat, losing 10–9 against Maryland, after being seeded number seven in the tournament. The Mountain Hawks made the tournament again in 2013, in which they lost to North Carolina.\nIn 2021, the Hawks advanced to the Patriot League final by defeating Colgate 13–9 in the semi-finals. The conference championship game against Loyola, scheduled for May 9, 2021, was canceled after an outbreak of Covid-19 on the Loyola team. By virtue of the no-contest, Lehigh became the Patriot League's automatic qualifier for the 2021 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. The Hawks were defeated in the first round by Rutgers.\nHead coach Kevin Cassese, who had led the Mountain Hawks to each of their conference tournament championships and NCAA tournament appearances, left the program to become associate head coach at Virginia on June 19, 2023. Associate head coach/defensive coordinator Will Scudder was promoted to succeed Cassese on the same day.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Lehigh’s season results during the NCAA Division I era starting in 1971, as well as certain pre-NCAA era seasons:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus."

Girls basketball in Missouri started as early as the 1920s, but was played by schools mostly in the rural areas north of current U.S. Route 36. Few if any schools in the larger metro areas or central and southern Missouri schools offered organized basketball for girls until many decades later. A series of regional tournaments were held in Monroe City, Missouri from 1927 to 1933. Considering the lack of girls basketball elsewhere, these regional tournament winners could be considered state champions de facto, if not de jure. A state-sanctioned tournament was held during the 1939–40, and 1940-41 seasons in Clarence, Missouri. However the advent of World War II and gas rationing caused their discontinuation. Regional girls basketball tournaments did not resume in Missouri until 1972."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVI halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLVI halftime show took place on February 5, 2012, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana as part of Super Bowl XLVI. It was headlined by Madonna, who became the first sole female headliner since Diana Ross in 1996. It featured guest appearances by LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and CeeLo Green. Including collaborations with Cirque du Soleil, choreographer Jamie King as music director, and multimedia show producer Moment Factory, the show was critically acclaimed, setting a Super Bowl halftime show record at the time of 114 million viewers, higher than the viewership of the game itself.\nPreparations began in January, with Madonna saying that the rehearsal was the most exhausting one in which she had ever participated. Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser sound equipment.\nMadonna was not paid for performing at the halftime show, which provides global exposure for an artist. Keith Caulfield of \"Billboard\" reported a 17-fold sales increase for Madonna's back catalog and strong preorder sales for her upcoming releases. Critics praised the show, noting Madonna's cautious performance. However, criticism and controversy was targeted at M.I.A. extending her middle finger to the camera near the end of her verse of \"Give Me All Your Luvin. The NFL apologized for its inability to blur out the image. The league later fined M.I.A. $16.6 million, which was settled in a confidential 2014 agreement.\nSynopsis.\nThe halftime show was broadcast on NBC. It began as a procession to the stage, with men dressed as gladiators pulling a large structure hidden from view by large gold-colored flags. As \"Vogue\" began the flags were removed, revealing Madonna in a long, gold-colored cape and an ancient-Egyptian helmet seated on a large throne. The procession reached the stage, and the singer began performing \"Vogue\". During the chorus, the stadium floor lit up to reveal animated \"Vogue\" magazine covers featuring Madonna. After the song, she took off her helmet. As \"Vogue\" segued into \"Music\", two large boom boxes appeared on the ground screens and the stadium handrails were lit with moving lights. Madonna and her dancers moved towards the stands. Slacklining performer Andy Lewis accompanied the singer, who danced on a tall pedestal. Madonna pretended to shoot Lewis and moved to the other end of the stage, where LMFAO sang \"Party Rock Anthem\" in a segue from \"Music\". They and Madonna danced to \"Sexy and I Know It\".\n\"Music\" ended with a group of female dancers in cheerleading uniforms joining Madonna onstage for \"Give Me All Your Luvin. Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. joined her onstage, dressed in Egyptian-style clothing, and they danced as cheerleaders with pom-poms. During the song they stood on separate, elevated platforms, where Minaj and M.I.A. performed their respective verses. CeeLo Green came onstage with a marching band at the end of the song, and he and Madonna performed portions of \"Open Your Heart\" and \"Express Yourself\". \"Like a Prayer\" opened to a darkened stadium, with small specks of light visible, and a large choir dressed in black joined Madonna onstage. She reached the top of the bleachers and sang the final line before being pulled beneath the stage, surrounded by smoke. The show ended with \"World peace\" appearing on the ground screens with an image of the continents.\nBackground.\nAccording to CBS News, Madonna had been asked to perform in the 1999 and 2001 Super Bowl halftime shows but canceled both. In January 2001 she was scheduled to perform her new single, \"American Pie\", at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. However, she withdrew from the commitment due to a conflict with her recording schedule. In a statement at the time, Madonna expressed \"sincere apologies\" to the league and said: \"I look forward to the possibility of doing something with the NFL in the future.\"\nIn late 2011 Madonna was busy with the release of her film \"W.E.\" and with recording her twelfth studio album, \"MDNA\". The singer was reportedly signed by the NFL for the Super Bowl halftime show, and in December the league confirmed that Madonna would perform in the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The game was scheduled for February 5, 2012, and its organizers continued their practice of inviting global musicians to perform. Artists who had previously performed in the show included the Black Eyed Peas, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, U2, Paul McCartney and Prince. The show coincided with the release of \"W.E.\" in United States.\nMadonna collaborated with Cirque du Soleil to produce the show, and her longtime choreographer Jamie King was its music director. King suggested hiring Moment Factory. The production studio, which had worked on Celine Dion's Las Vegas residency shows, specializes in multimedia effects. Jacques Methe, Cirque du Soleil executive producer for special events, said that it was \"contributing to the creative process that will lead to the creation of this very special moment ... For us, it's an interesting opportunity. It's not something that we do very often, working with other stars\". According to Methe, Cirque du Soleil was involved with the creative side of the halftime show and its logistical challenges. The circus had previously put together a nine-minute pregame show at the 2007 Super Bowl. \"Our work has been done mostly to help magnify and create an environment for the artists\", said Moment Factory executive producer Eric Fournier, citing shows in which the studio had used lighting and video projections for special effects.\nDevelopment.\nRehearsals.\nRehearsals began in January 2012 in a New York studio, and lasted for 12 hours. Rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., who had collaborated on Madonna's single \"Give Me All Your Luvin, said that the rehearsals were \"the most grueling thing [they had] ever done and wouldn't expect anything else, calling it an 'epic learning experience. Minaj confirmed her performance in the show with a Twitter message, and rapper will.i.am confirmed that the American electronic dance music group LMFAO would also join Madonna for the event.\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", the NFL had coyly revealed the show's set list in its magazine: \"Though Madonna's set list was not officially announced at press time, fans might expect her to give all her luvin', provide a ray of light and be in vogue with her music\". Before the show, Madonna expressed concern about the physical and time constraints of the event. \"I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to take it down. So, that football field is clean for the second half of the game\", she said. \"How do you do that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out.\" The singer's plan to have 100 drummers descend from the stadium ceiling was canceled, since the structure could not support the weight.\nFashion.\nMadonna had promised that there would be no wardrobe malfunction during the show, alluding to controversy surrounding Janet Jackson's performance in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Madonna's show's fashion theme was the Roman Empire, with gladiator influences combined with modern Roman elements. Costume designer B. Akerlund created the dresses. Akerlund called on other designers to contribute to the costumes, which included Givenchy \"haute couture\", boots by Miu Miu and earrings by Bvlgari. She worked closely with Madonna, who was involved with details including costuming the show's gladiators. According to Akerlund:\nThis was by far the biggest challenge I have ever taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored to be a part of such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.\nMadonna's first dress was black, with a gold-colored, pleated overskirt designed by Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy. The singer wore heavy jewelry, her blonde hair long and tightly waved, with diamond earrings by Bvlgari. Her first costume also had a gold-sequined cape with a leopard-print chiffon lining and Philip Treacy headgear. For \"Give Me All Your Luvin, Madonna, Minaj and M.I.A. wore red-and-black cheerleader outfits and carried gold-colored pom-poms. The singer wore a long-sleeved black gown over the short black dress for her last performance. Riccardo Tisci said that he had made all of Madonna's clothes, gloves, belts, hats and underwear. He had 28 choices for the singer, who decided on the gold cape. Although Tisci and his team had designed a shorter version of the cape, they had to re-do it for the singer. The performance featured 100 drumline performers, 150 gladiators (who wore black Calvin Klein underwear) and 200 choir singers.\nStage setup.\nThe 1,500 crew members were allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, with the California-based Torrence All Access Staging and Productions handling the required equipment. Erik Eastland of the company, who oversaw the setup, had been associated with the Grammy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards. About 70 percent of the workers were volunteers who underwent six months of screening, and the remainder were stage-vendor employees. The main stage was long and modular, assembled in segments from six large trucks. The crew also set up the lighting, video, special effects and audio equipment.\nThe challenge may come from working outside in the elements. It could be 50 degrees when we rehearse and 50 below on game day, we're working under the pretext that we can be doing this in snow or rain ... In a normal indoor environment we have seven minutes to install the stage and get it camera ready. That can be stretched to nine minutes. It's the same time frame for this.\nAccording to setup coordinator Douglas Cook, the rehearsals enabled them to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.\nSet designer Bruce Rodgers, who had worked with Madonna on the Drowned World Tour in 2001, was familiar with the singer's work ethic. Rodgers, director Hamish Hamilton and executive producer Ricky Kirshner met several times with Madonna's team, represented by choreographer Jamie King (who presented the show's initial concept). Rodgers developed a large, cross-shaped stage with a central platform accessible by five hidden lifts, bleachers with an escape system at the rear, four positions for the band to play, an area for slacklining at one edge and ramps at the two ends of the cross. At the front of the stage was a white fabric, the main screen for the Moment Factory projections. Props included a Jimmie Martin-designed gold-leaf throne on a barge carried by 150 gladiators. Rodgers' greatest challenges were getting the barge onstage and rehearsing the procession.\nMultimedia and video.\nThe stage used multimedia projection and technology conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, the ground and stage floor revealed animated \"Vogue\" magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for video projection. Although projection mapping had been used to introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were easy. When Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, \"It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do something extraordinary, so that was the objective of everybody.\"\nThe show's major concepts included the shifting magazine covers, the Egyptian-inspired procession, \"intergalactic\" boomboxes during \"Music\" and an effect which made the \"stage appear to suck up the grass and chalk from the football field\". Some visuals were synchronized with the dancers and Madonna's movements. When the visuals were decided, the Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil staff watched the performances closely to adapt the backdrops to the choreography. Fournier relied on a \"disciplined\" team enlisted by the NFL and experienced with the video setup, which totaled 32 HD Barco projectors. The projectors were attached to eight pods of four projectors each to cover the entire stadium. Barco's Projector Toolset was used to operate the screens and display the show's videos. According to Fournier, \"On TV there were a lot of closeups of Madonna and the dancers, but from the audience in the stadium, the show covered 50 yards. That was the idea: that the show, in essence, must eclipse the size of the stadium.\" A consistent 10 to 12 people worked on the project to create, in essence, two shows: one for those at the stadium and one for the TV audience. Moment Factory coordinated with the show's producers so it would be projected properly on television. Bessette said that the video resolution of the videos was very high (almost 18 times that of normal high definition) and moving the video files to proper locations was a problem: \"We had to find a solution that would be spectacular and that would fit within those parameters\".\nRodgers used LMG, Inc for video, light and audio equipment. LMG, in turn, collaborated with the live-event production company DWP Live on the show's projection. According to DWP founder Danny Whetstone, using Barco helped with seamless projection and brightness adjustment: \"It was essential that we hang the projectors straight down, 151 feet in the air, lens to field, in order to fill the enormous visual area with the converged image\". Barco's HD20 has a 20,000-lumen lighting capacity, rendering clear, bright images with high contrast.\nLighting and sound.\nLucas Oil Stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky for the halftime show. Lighting designer Al Gurdon of Incandescent Designs enlisted console group PRG to help him install 204 Sharpys across the main stage. According to Gurdon, Madonna conceived the main idea; the choreography-driven show, centered on the main stage, was less logistically challenging than those in previous years. However, Gurdon had to ensure that the audience could enjoy the show from a distance and that Madonna was highlighted properly for the cameras. He and board operator Mike Owen brainstormed in England and tried a number of schemes for a week with CAST software. A \"cleaner\" approach was taken to prevent interference between the video projections and lighting. Gurdon placed the Sharpys together in rectangular areas, with 16 to 20 lights in each. This resulted in a strong, compact, moving light which could be split into smaller beams as needed.\nSince the arrangement had to be set up in seven minutes, Gurdon developed a rig. He flew equipment to the roof of Lucas Oil, attaching it at a height of so that it would not interfere with camera movement during the game. At halftime, it was lowered to light the stadium. Golden light was used for the opening sequence, followed by black and white strobes for \"Vogue\". A multicolored palette illuminated \"Music\", and red predominated during \"Give Me All Your Luvin. \"Like a Prayer\" had another stream of gold Sharpys, evoking rays of sunlight.\nSennheiser sound equipment was used for the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset at the beginning of the show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a \"Mix\" article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.\nAccording to LMG video technologist Ken Gay, lighting, sound and television teams met at the Orange County Convention Center to test the setup. They used simple fabrics on the ground to test the lighting projections for the stage. Sakchin Bessette had samples to be used for projections, which helped LMG in its tests. The team's Mark Sanford monitored the cameras for any reflections from the fabric caused by the projections, calculating their effect during the show and adjusting camera placement accordingly. LMG tested the projection pods used from the ceilings at its Orlando headquarters. The pods were positioned above the ground, using the fabric from the previous test. Concerned that the stadium grass would affect the projections, the company used Heavy Knit Bright White fabric from All Access.\nCritical response.\nThe halftime show was critically acclaimed. Said Marc Schneider of \"Billboard\": \"It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just living in it\". Randall Roberts of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that although the choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was \"defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along to one of her songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday.\" \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Greg Kot called the show an \"S&amp;M party in Ancient Egypt\". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had \"important career-advancing work to do ... [The singer], after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list\". Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" wrote that although the singer was not as \"indefatigable\" as she had been, she was a \"party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir\". Pareles called Madonna \"grown-up\", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL.\nKen Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that Madonna delivered a \"joyous, unironic, openhearted\" show rather than a cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in \"full command\"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed \"perfectly\". Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called the show a \"tribute to Madonna\" and a \"shameless\" promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing \"W.E.\": \"The message [of the show] is that she is back in business. I suspect she'd settle for a global number one over global harmony\". Troy Patterson of \"Slate\" wrote that Madonna retained her \"greatest marketing agent\" title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, \"What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully\".\nMiriam Coleman of \"Rolling Stone\" called the show a \"serious spectacle\", and Mario Tarradell of \"The Dallas Morning News\" called it a \"high-concept music video\": \"Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel\". A \"Huffington Post\" reviewer wrote, \"Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance\". Spencer Kornhaber of \"The Atlantic\" praised the show's choreography and cinematography: \"With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight\". According to Joey Guerra of the \"Houston Chronicle\", Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs. Peter Robinson of \"The Guardian\" called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would \"[make] your average James Cameron effort look like \"Homes Under the Hammer\"\", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.\nCara Kelly of \"The Washington Post\" gave the show a mixed review; although it was \"revolutionary\" after Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, it was a \"pathetic attempt at a comeback\". According to Lou Harry of the \"Indianapolis Business Journal\", Madonna lacked focus and energy and the audience response was lukewarm. Harry called the show an \"awkward celebration\", but praised its overall production. \"USA Today\"s Elyssa Gardner wrote, \"Madonna herself, stylish but hardly provocative in tailored tops and skirts that showed off her yoga-toned gams, delivered [the songs] and other flourishes with a winking sense of humor\". David Zurawik of \"The Baltimore Sun\" called the show \"Madonna's zombie halftime\", criticizing its song choices and overall concept: \"[Madonna's] acting as if she's almost singing. I say almost, because there is not a whit of artistic aspiration in the star performer or the production as far I can tell. But hey, that's our sad-sack, super-sized, gross American culture these days, isn't it. And it is perfectly suited for empty Super Bowl half-time spectacle\".\nCommercial impact.\nLike previous performers, Madonna was not paid for the show. According to Zack O'Malley Greenburg of \"Forbes\", \"Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment ... This is the kind of exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for; they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances and still not reach that [kind of] audience\". Greenburg wrote that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's enterprises and the singer did not have to pay for accommodations, travel, backup dancers, stage setup, advertising and publicity: \"Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrative – and such a good deal for artists that some suspect a major change might be on the horizon\".\nMadonna's performance was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114 million viewers – more than the game itself, which had 111.3 million viewers. It reached more than 47 million homes. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Tim Kenneally from Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was later broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million). Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, with an average of 8,000 tweets per second for five minutes) and was the most-searched term on Google during the show. Wired CEO Mark Ghuneim tweeted that less than one-third of the tweets were negative, 59 percent were positive and 11 percent were neutral. According to \"Billboard\", the day after the show its ratings and economic impact were discussed.\nThe show's chief impact was on Madonna's music. Keith Caulfield of \"Billboard\" wrote that about 50,000 pre-orders for Madonna's 12th studio album, \"MDNA\", were placed within three days of its availability on the iTunes Store. That week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, \"Give Me All Your Luvin had 115,000 digital downloads and the singer's catalog of older albums had a 410 percent increase in sales (from 5,000 to 26,000 copies). A week after the Super Bowl, \"Give Me All Your Luvin had an additional 165,000 digital downloads (a 44-percent increase) and her other songs sold a combined 166,000 copies (up from 94,000 the previous week). \"Give Me All Your Luvin reached number ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart; the singer's 38th top-ten hit, it increased her record as the artist with the most top-ten singles on the chart. Madonna's back catalog of albums also had increased sales due to discounting and publicity generated by the single and her performance. \"Billboard\" estimated that her top-10 digital sales collectively increased over 1,700 percent. Madonna's bestselling album was the 2009 greatest-hits collection, \"Celebration\", which sold 16,000 copies (up 1,341 percent) and reentered the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. The following week \"Celebration\" fell 105 spots on the chart to number 157, with sales falling to 4,000 copies. \"Give Me All Your Luvin fell to number 39 on the Hot 100, with sales falling by 58 percent to 69,000 copies. The show affected slacklining; \"The New York Times\" reported, \"[Andy Lewis] and his sport had never appeared before an audience like the one commanded by Madonna at halftime of the Super Bowl\". According to professional slackliner Frankie Najera, \"That was by far the biggest thing that has happened for the sport\".\nM.I.A. controversy.\nM.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera near the end of her verse in \"Give Me All Your Luvin instead of singing the word \"shit\", and the media compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. According to \"People\", \"Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna was supposed to be the center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC.\" Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\". She said that it was a \"teenager ... irrelevant thing\" for M.I.A. to do, and was \"out of place\" in the show: \"I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but to me there was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative.\"\nAccording to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, \"Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans\". McCarthy said that the gesture was not made during rehearsals, and M.I.A. improvized it on stage. The Federal Communications Commission received 222 complaints about the rapper's gesture, and \"Rolling Stone\" reported that the commission might \"punish\" the NFL and NBC despite their apologies. Any fine imposed on the NFL would be charged to M.I.A., since the rapper had signed a contract indemnifying the league against FCC fines. A year later, it was reported that the NFL had filed a $1.5 million arbitration claim against M.I.A. for \"breach of her contract and flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the NFL brand and the Super Bowl\". Her lawyer, Howard King, filed a counterclaim calling the NFL's action \"hilarious in light of the weekly felonies committed by its stars\". M.I.A. enlisted the help of fans in documenting objectionable actions by the NFL to refute the league's claim of damage to its reputation.\nIn September 2013, M.I.A. released a video statement about the lawsuit. The rapper said, \"They're basically [saying] it's OK for me to promote being sexually exploited as a female, than to display empowerment, female empowerment, through being punk rock. That's what it boils down to, and I'm being sued for it\". In March 2014, \"Rolling Stone\" reported that the NFL had added $15 million to its arbitration claim for a total of $16.6 million. M.I.A. said on Twitter that the NFL wanted a portion of her income, which lacked \"any basis in law, fact, or logic\", and blamed NBC for its \"dereliction\" in not blurring out the gesture during the live telecast. M.I.A. tweeted Madonna with a request to borrow $16 million, later deleting the tweet. In August 2014, ESPN reported that the NFL had reached a confidential agreement with M.I.A. Neither attorney Howard King nor the NFL provided any further details.\nSet list.\nSource for the set list performed at the show.\nPersonnel.\nCredits and personnel adapted from the halftime show's name reel."

        "title": "2013 Rugby League World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2013 Rugby League World Cup final was the conclusive game of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between New Zealand and Australia on 30 November 2013 at Old Trafford, Manchester, England. Australia won the final by 34 points to 2 in front of a sell-out crowd, finishing the tournament undefeated. They reclaimed the cup from New Zealand, who had defeated them in the 2008 final. The Kangaroos won the Rugby League World Cup for the tenth time, and the first time since 2000. Their five-eighth, Johnathan Thurston was named man-of-the-match.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand's road to the final started on 27 October at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington, where they played Samoa, who were knocked out in the quarter-final stage. New Zealand stormed the match with 8 tries to earn a 42-24 victory. New Zealand then found themselves playing the co-hosts France at the Parc des Sports in Avignon. In front of a sold out capacity crowd, New Zealand kept the hosts to zero points, while New Zealand scored 8 tries to win 48-0. The Kiwis returned to England to play Papua New Guinea, who had failed to win a single match in the run up the New Zealand game. New Zealand continued their Group B dominance and scored 10 tries to earn a 56-10 victory to top the group and advance to the knock out stage.\nNew Zealand faced Scotland in the quarter-final, who like New Zealand hadn't lost a single game in the Group stage but did at worst draw 30 all against Italy. New Zealand was victorious in the quarter-final match running in 8 tries to 1 to win 40–4. In a hard-fought semi-final, New Zealand won 20–18 against hosts England. The home side were leading for most of the first half, up 8-0, 25 minutes into the match. A try from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and 2 goals from Shaun Johnson meant 8 all was the half time score. New Zealand looked to start to dominate the match with a second 44th minute try from Tuivasa-Sheck for the Kiwis to lead 12-8. Tries from England's Kallum Watkins and Sam Burgess meant with just 10 minutes to go, England were in front 14-18. A last gasp try on the 80th minute for New Zealand, could at least take the semi-final to over time should Johnson not be able to convert his own try. Unfortunately for the hosts, Johnson bisected the posts to take the Kiwis their third final, and keep them with in the chance to defend their title. In reaching the 2013 World Cup final, New Zealand had again equalled their record for consecutive victories with five.\nAustralia.\nAustralia's road to the final started on the opening day of the tournament at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff against hosts England. Australia ran in 5 tries to England's 4 to earn a hard-fought 28-20 victory under the roof in Cardiff. Australia then played Fiji, who had opened their tournament with a 32–14 win over Ireland, at Langtree Park in St. Helens, but lost second rower Luke Lewis with a shoulder injury during the game. Lewis had collided with the advertising boards that were located close to the dead-ball line raising concerns about player safety. His injury would keep him out of football until mid-2014. Most of the safety concerns came from the use of soccer stadiums which generally have a shorter pitch length than desirable for a rugby league field (soccer pitches are 105 metres in length while the minimum length for a league field between the dead ball lines is 112 metres) which often led to shorter than regulation fields and left very little room between the dead ball lines and the fence. However, Langtree Park is actually a rugby league ground being the home venue of the famous St Helens club.\nThe Kangaroos were victorious in this match, winning 34-2 with 6 tries to nil. Thomond Park in Limerick was the venue for Australia's final match of the group stage against Ireland. Ireland hadn't won any matches in the run up this final match, only scoring 14 points in 2 games which came against Fiji (0 against England). With Australia's 9 tries, including 24 points in 10 minutes, Australia went out victors 50-0. With Australia's 3 from 3 wins in the group stage and the conceding of only 22 points, Australia topped Group A and advanced to the knock out stage.\nIn the quarter-final, Australia played surprise packet newcomers United States at The Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. The Hawks had played well to reach the finals, but were not expected to be a match for the tournament favourites. Australia were the victors 62-0 scoring 12 tries, including 4 from Jarryd Hayne playing in the unfamiliar position of centre, and 4 from Man of the Match Brett Morris. Australia played Fiji in the semi-final, a replay of the Group A match that happened on 2 November (28 days earlier). This time, Australia kept Fiji scoreless, running in 11 tries to win 64-0, which including a 22 points in 10 minutes. Australia therefore advanced to the final for the 10th time in a row.\nHead to Head.\nBefore the final, Australia and New Zealand had played each other 125 times, with Australia winning 95 times, New Zealand 27 and 3 draws. Of the last 10 encounters, Australia had won 8 of them, New Zealand 1 and a single draw. New Zealand's last win over the Kangaroos was a hard-fought 16-12 win in the 2010 Four Nations Final at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Their previous meeting was in April 2013 for the 2013 ANZAC Test, where Australia won 32-12 at the Canberra Stadium in Australia's capital city. The two teams had previously met each other on 17 occasions in a Rugby League World Cup match, with Australia winning 15 to New Zealand's 2.\nAustralia and New Zealand had met in three previous World Cup finals; 1988 at Eden Park in Auckland (won 25-12 by Australia), 2000 at Old Trafford (won 40-12 by Australia), and 2008. The 2008 Rugby League World Cup final at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium was won 34-20 by New Zealand. It was the first time New Zealand had won the World Cup, and the first time Australia had lost it World Champions crown since Great Britain had won in 1972.\nIn the run up to the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final, Australia had only conceded 22 points, and let though 4 tries, while scoring 238 points and crossing the line 43 times; 20 Group stage, 12 quarter-final and 11 Semi-final. New Zealand, however, had conceded 56 points and let through 11 tries, while scoring 206 points and attacking their opponent with 37 tries; 26 Group stage, 1 quarter-final and 3 semi-final.\nPre-match.\nOfficiating.\nEnglish referee Richard Silverwood was named to officiate the final, with James Child and Grant Atkins the touch judges. Ashley Klein, who formerly officiated as a part of the Rugby Football League was the video referee for the match.\nSafety concerns.\nAlthough it had hosted 7 international matches since first being used in 1986 (including the 2000 World Cup final), and was the host venue of the annual Super League Grand Final, prior to the game, concerns were raised by the Australian team management about the safety and suitability of Old Trafford as a rugby league venue, primarily the shorter than regulation in-goal areas (measured at 4.1 metres, shorter than the minimum allowable distance of 6 metres) and the slope around the perimeter of the field. There were some suggestions of moving the game to Wembley Stadium in London, though this was ruled out by tournament organisers citing logistical and financial reasons. Two players, Brett Morris and Manu Vatuvei, fell victim to falling down the slope with Morris actually colliding with the advertising boards at the bottom of the slope after scoring a try while Vatuvei fell awkwardly on concrete, only emphasised the questions raised.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nAfter Australia kicked off, a New Zealand error in the first set of the game led to an early opportunity and field position for Australia, and the penalty was kicked by Johnathan Thurston to open the scoring to 2–0. The Kiwis suffered an early blow when after just one touch of the ball, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck had a recurrence of an ankle injury that forced him from the field after just 8 minutes with second rower Alex Glenn his replacement, forcing a re-shuffle with Simon Mannering moving to the centres and Dean Whare to the wing. Australia weren't without their problems though as soon after Jarryd Hayne went down with an apparent concussion after colliding with the hip of Simon Mannering while tackling the Kiwi captain, though the Kangaroos centre would remain on the field. Further play from the Kiwis brought them into the Australian half of the field, and a holding penalty then given by the Australians was kicked by Shaun Johnson to level the score to 2–2 at the 16 minute mark. Despite Old Trafford having an in-goal area of just 4.1m, Australia were able to force a line drop-out.\nFrom this, Thurston was able to kick to Billy Slater, setting up the first four-pointer which Thurston also converted to make the score 8–2. A try attempt by Cooper Cronk was controversially disallowed by the video referee, who ruled Isaac Luke had been able to stop the ball coming into contact with the in-goal grass while also giving New Zealand a penalty against Andrew Fifita for 'driving' Luke. Cronk didn't have to wait long to score though, as a few minutes later Darius Boyd got around Whare and raced down the wing before putting in a miss-kicked grubber which Cronk managed to find to go over and score despite a desperate Kevin Locke tackle. Thurston kicked his 3rd goal from 3 attempts to take the score out to 14–2. Thurston's conversion of Cronk's try saw him overtake Michael Cronin as Australia's highest point scorer in test match football. Manu Vatuvei's attacking run for New Zealand saw him pushed over the sideline 5 metres out by 5 desperate Australian defenders, and an offside penalty at the 35 minute mark gave Thurston another kick to bring the score out to 16–2 at halftime.\nSecond half.\nBilly Slater opened the scoring on the first set of the second half, thanks to break by captain Cameron Smith who passed outside to Thurston who found Darius Boyd who raced down the sideline and found Slater in support as Kiwi fullback Kevin Locke loomed in defence. This gave Thurston another chance to convert and bring the score to 22–2. A charge-down by Ben Matulino and regather from Sonny Bill Williams led to New Zealand beginning attack at halfway. More potential attack from the Kiwis was defused easily by the Australians, until a New Zealand grubber gave possession back to the Australians. A flick offload from Josh Papalii led to a chip kick from Brett Morris, regathered and then re-kicked by Jarryd Hayne led to a sliding Morris try. A conversion by Thurston brought the score out to 28–2. Both teams were having issues with the geography of the ground, as Morris collided with the signage during his try and a flying Manu Vatuvei landed awkwardly on the concrete surrounding the field. Australia's control of the game led to the New Zealanders forced into defense of their own line, defusing Australia's attack but not managing any successful attack of their own. A near 100 metre try by Morris, thanks to a 70-metre intercept run by Hayne, and conversion by Thurston made the score 34–2 with eight minutes to go.\nPost-match.\nAustralian scrum half back Johnathan Thurston was named the final's man-of-the-match, his fourth such award of the tournament. His conversion of Cronk's first half try also broke Mick Cronin's 31-year-old record of 309 Test points for the Kangaroos. The 32-point margin set a new record for heaviest victory in a final, eclipsing Australia's 40–12 victory over the Kiwis in the same stadium in 2000.\nThe sellout crowd of 74,468 at Old Trafford set a new international rugby league attendance record, eclipsing the previous record of 73,361 established at the 1992 World Cup final where Australia defeated Great Britain 10-6 at the old Wembley Stadium."

        "title": "1999 Baltimore Orioles–Cuba national baseball team exhibition series",
        "text": "The 1999 Baltimore Orioles – Cuba national baseball team exhibition series consisted of two exhibition games played between the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Cuba national baseball team on March 28 and May 3, 1999. The first game took place in Havana, while the second was held in Baltimore. This series marked the first time that the Cuba national team had faced a squad composed solely of major league players and the close of the hiatus since 1959 that an MLB team played in Cuba.\nIn the 1990s, Orioles' owner Peter Angelos lobbied the United States federal government to gain permission to hold this series for three years. Various politicians, including members of the United States House of Representatives, opposed the idea and attempted to block the series. Eventually, Angelos secured the approval in 1999, after a change in United States foreign policy to Cuba under President Bill Clinton, which eased travel restrictions and increased cultural exchange.\nThe Orioles won the first game, which was held in Havana, by a score of 3–2 in extra innings. The Cuba national team defeated the Orioles 12–6 in the second game, which was held in Baltimore. The series introduced José Contreras to the American baseball audience; Contreras defected from Cuba in 2002 to pitch in MLB. The United States and Cuba now compete with each other and other nations in the World Baseball Classic.\nBackground.\nThe Cuban Revolution led to the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista, an ally of the United States, in 1959. Fidel Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted an embargo against Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold a 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.\nNo Major League Baseball (MLB) team had played in Cuba since March 21, 1959. Castro made attempts to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba to no avail. In the 1970s, George McGovern, a United States senator, pushed the idea of an exchange of MLB and college basketball teams as a way to bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the ping-pong diplomacy that aided US-China relations; however, this was blocked by the United States Department of State.\nIn the 1980s, Scott Armstrong approached Edward Bennett Williams, then the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game between the Orioles and Cuba's All-Stars. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Giamatti was interested, but he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.\nIn 1996, Peter Angelos, the new owner of the Orioles, met with Armstrong and Saul Landau, who convinced him to pursue an exhibition series between his Orioles and the Cuba national baseball team. Angelos petitioned the United States Government to permit a series. United States Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen wrote to the State Department, asking that the series be prevented. The United States Department of the Treasury denied Angelos' request on the grounds that American money may not be spent in Cuba under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.\nIn January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel restrictions and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission to play an exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for the exploration of the series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States. A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Menendez, Dan Burton, Lincoln Díaz-Balart, and Rick Lazio, lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.\nOngoing negotiations through March yielded an agreement on March 7, 1999, over the objections of the State Department. The proceeds of the series were a major sticking point in negotiations, as it violated the United States embargo against Cuba. Instead of going to the Cuban Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.\nThe series created a good deal of criticism, especially among the Cuban American community. MLB umpire Rich Garcia, who is of Cuban descent, opposed the series. MLB umpires filed a grievance against MLB attempting to block them from being sent to umpire the game in Cuba, and refused to officiate the game in Baltimore. The Cuban American National Foundation protested the series. Former US diplomat Otto Reich likened the baseball match in Havana to the notion of playing soccer at Auschwitz and also the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, dismissing it as a propaganda ploy by the Cuban government.\nGames.\nGame one.\nGame one took place at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba, on March 28, 1999. Tickets were distributed by invitation only. Angelos, Selig, and Castro sat together in box seats. One hundred schoolchildren from the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area also traveled to Cuba on a plane chartered by Angelos. Before the game, players and coaches on both teams engaged in a flag ceremony. Castro greeted the Orioles on the field, and gave the Cuba team a pep talk. Cuba baseball legend Conrado Marrero threw out the first pitch. The game was televised in the U.S. by ESPN with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan announcing.\nOrioles' starting pitcher Scott Erickson allowed one run on five hits in seven innings pitched. Cuba starter José Ibar allowed a home run to Charles Johnson and was relieved in the third inning by José Contreras. Contreras pitched eight innings without allowing a run. Orioles' manager Ray Miller brought in his closer, Mike Timlin, in the eighth inning. This backfired, as Omar Linares tied the game for Cuba with a run batted in single.\nTied after nine innings, the game went into extra innings. Cuba had two runners on base in the 10th inning, but Mike Fetters retired Cuba without allowing a run. The Orioles won the game when Harold Baines hit a single off of Pedro Luis Lazo that scored Will Clark with the go-ahead run in the top of the 11th inning. Jesse Orosco recorded the final three outs in the bottom of the 11th, as the Orioles won by a score of 3–2.\nGame two.\nThe second game was held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win–loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuba national team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game; the 1998–99 Cuban National Series was finished so players not available for the first game joined the team for the second exhibition game. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuba team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.\nThe start of the game was delayed by rain for 56 minutes. The game was further interrupted by protesters, one of whom ran onto the field during the fifth inning and was thrown to the ground by César Valdez, a Cuban umpire. Contreras started the game for Cuba, and he allowed a two-run double by Baines in the first inning. Orioles' starting pitcher Scott Kamieniecki, who was on the MLB disabled list at the time, allowed four runs in the second inning to give Cuba the lead.\nNorge Luis Vera entered the game for Cuba in the third inning and pitched innings in relief without allowing a hit, retiring 20 of the first 22 batters he faced. His hitless streak ended when he allowed a home run to Delino DeShields in the ninth inning. Gabe Molina, who had made his MLB debut on May 1, allowed Cuba to score five runs in the ninth inning, including a three-run home run hit by Andy Morales. The Cuba national team defeated the Orioles 12–6.\nDanel Castro batted 4-for-5 for Cuba, including a two run batted in (RBI) triple, and scored four runs. Calvin Pickering, a rookie first baseman for the Orioles who had been promoted from the minor leagues the day prior, committed three errors.\nAftermath.\nRigoberto Herrera, a retired Cuba national team member, accompanied the Cuba delegation, defected to the United States during the visit. Six retired players overslept the day after the game in Baltimore and missed their flight back to Cuba, but no other members of the delegation defected.\nTo discourage defections during the exhibition in Baltimore, Cuba maintained strict security around their young players, not allowing sports agents to speak with them. Though no active Cuba players defected during the trip to Baltimore, members of the Cuba national team did defect in the years following the series. Andy Morales defected in 2000. Contreras, who was considered Cuba's best pitcher, gained international fame after the series and defected from Cuba in 2002. Nelson Díaz, a Cuban umpire who officiated the game in Baltimore, defected from Cuba to the United States in 2009.\nMLB and the Major League Umpires Association engaged in a dispute regarding the amount of pay owed to umpires for officiating the game that took place in Baltimore. This was one factor that led to the mass resignation of MLB umpires that took place on September 2, 1999.\nIn 2000, Syd Thrift, the Orioles' general manager, told \"The Washington Times\" that the team had a practice of not signing players who had defected from Cuba, which he attributed to Angelos' desire to avoid doing \"anything that could be interpreted as being disrespectful or ... encouraging players to defect\". Investigations by Major League Baseball and the United States Department of Justice did not find evidence that the absence of Cuban players on the Orioles' roster or in its minor league system was due to discrimination.\nThe Cuba national team next played in the United States during the 2006 World Baseball Classic (WBC). President George W. Bush attempted to prevent the Cuba team from participating in the tournament, but other nations promised to withdraw if Cuba was barred. The next American team to travel to Cuba was the Tampa Bay Rays, which played an exhibition against the Cuba national team in March 2016."

        "text": "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player joins a statistical club when he attains a certain milestone number in a specific statistical category. For milestones that encompass an entire career, batters must achieve 3,000 hits or 500 home runs; pitchers must amass 300 wins or 3,000 strikeouts. A fifth club exists for relief pitchers that have recorded 300 saves over a career. In addition, milestones achieved in a single season include hitting 50 home runs, while three other single-season statistical clubs—the 20–20–20 club, 30–30 club and 40–40 club — include achievements from multiple statistical categories.\nReaching any one of the four career milestone clubs is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame."

Competitors raced over five loops of a 4.0 kilometre skiing course, shooting four times, twice prone and twice standing. Each miss resulted in one minute being added to a competitor's skiing time.\nResults.\nRaphaël Poirée was defending overall World Cup champion, while Sergei Rozhkov was the defending World Cup champion in the individual race. Paavo Puurunen had won the most recent world championships, and Halvard Hanevold had won the 1998 Olympic title. Ole Einar Bjørndalen, who had finished just behind Poirée in the overall world cup, had dominated the test event in 2001, winning all three races, including the individual, beating Sven Fischer.\nFrank Luck led the World Cup in the Individual entering the Games, having won one of the warmup events, with Pavel Rostovtsev and Daniel Mesotitsch winning the others.\nBjørndalen, having just placed 5th in the 30 kilometre cross-country race, was the earliest of the favourites to start. He missed once on both his second and third shoots, but still had the fastest time, just ahead of Viktor Maigourov, who had missed only once. Neither would miss on the last shoot, but over the final two loops, Bjørndalen would gain more than 30 seconds on the Russian, easily taking the early lead. Poirée was ahead of Bjørndalen with only a single miss on the first three shots, but faded after missing a shot on the last set, ending up 10th. Rozkhov shot clear, but struggled with his skiing, unable to get anywhere near the leaders with his pace on the snow, and ending up 12th.\nJust behind him, Ricco Groß was level with Bjørndalen early, and while he did record one of the faster ski times, his two misses meant he finished nearly a minute behind, in third for the time being. Like Rozkhov, Frank Luck also shot clear, and after Bjørndalen's second miss, he was ahead of the Norwegian by 23 seconds. He couldn't match the Norwegian's ski time over the final section, though, ending up just ahead of Maigurov in silver medal position. Hanevold was another who shot clear, but ended up 5th. Frode Andresen, the last starter, and the closest to matching Bjørndalen in ski pace, was ahead of his countryman by 90 seconds after the third shoot, having been clear to that point, but then missed three on the final shoot, sending him all the way down to 7th and securing Bjørndalen's victory. \"It was worse to stand here watching Frode shoot than shoot myself,\" Bjørndalen said.\nThe race was started at 13:30."

Competitors raced over two 3.0 kilometre loops and one 4.0 kilometre loop of the skiing course, shooting two times, once prone and once standing. Each miss was penalized by requiring the competitor to race over a 150-metre penalty loop.\nResults.\nOle Einar Bjørndalen, having won the men's 20 kilometre Individual race two days before, came in as one of the favourites. Bjørndalen was also the defending World Cup champion in the sprint, as well as the defending Olympic champion in the discipline. In addition, he had won the 2001 test event at Soldier Hollow, beating countryman Frode Andresen, and won one of the four World Cup sprints earlier in the season. Raphaël Poirée, the defending overall World Cup champion, had also won a World Cup sprint race in 2001/02, but neither Poirée nor Bjørndalen was leading the World Cup standings, which were closely contested between Andresen, Frank Luck and the defending World Champion in the distance, Pavel Rostovtsev.\nGermans Ricco Groß and Sven Fischer set the early pace, both shooting clear on the first shoot, then missing one in the second, with Fischer pulling away over the last loop to lead his countryman by 25 seconds at the finish. Poirée led both of them after the first shoot, but put two shots wide on his final round, dropping him out of contention. Rovstovtsev, not skiing as quickly as Poirée, was also well placed after one shoot, but his one miss on the second left him five seconds behind Groß at the finish.\nAndresen, fresh off a disappointment in the final round of shooting in the individual, was clear on the first shoot, and quick on the skis, but, like the individual, struggled on the last shoot, missing twice and ending up in 8th. The man starting directly behind him, Wolfgang Perner, was slower on the course, but didn't miss a shot, and just managed to edge Groß at the line, finishing 0.2 seconds ahead for, at the time, second place.\nBut Bjørndalen was still to come, and did not disappoint. The Norwegian shot clear at the opening attempt, but only left the range in 4th, behind Poirée, Andresen and Fischer. However, where all three of those had stumbled at the second shooting round, Bjørndalen made no mistake, shooting clear. He left the range 30 seconds ahead of his closest competitor, Fischer, and held that lead until the finish line for his second gold medal of the games.\n This was Bjørndalen's third Olympic gold medal, making him the first biathlete to achieve such a feat.\nThe race was held at 11:00."

Competitors raced over four 2.5 kilometre loops and one 2.75 kilometre loop of the skiing course, shooting four times, twice prone and twice standing. Each miss was penalized by requiring the competitor to race over a 150-metre penalty loop.\nThe pursuit was a newly introduced race at the 2002 Olympics, with athletes starting in the same order, and with the same time gaps, as their finish in the sprint event a few days earlier. Only the top 60 from the sprint were eligible to enter, though three athletes of the top 60 opted not to start.\nResults.\nOle Einar Bjørndalen, having won both of the previous individual events in Soldier Hollow, was going for an unprecedented sweep, and based on his win in the sprint, would start 29 seconds ahead of Sven Fischer, and more than 50 seconds ahead of the third and fourth starters, Wolfgang Perner and Ricco Groß. The World Cup pursuit leader, and defending World Cup overall and pursuit champion Raphael Poirée, was another serious challenger, but he would start over a minute behind Bjørndalen. Pavel Rostovtsev was the defending World Champion, though unlike the World Championships, where he started with the lead, in Salt Lake he started a minute behind the leader, in 6th.\nBjørndalen missed a shot on his first set of attempts, but still held the lead after the first shot, as even a clear shoot from Fischer behind him still gave the Norwegian a 14-second lead. Perner missed once to fall back, with Groß going clear to move into a clear third. That was as close as anyone would get to Bjørndalen all day, as he shot clean at the second and third attempts, and while he missed a shot on the final set, his lead at that point was well over a minute, and the one penalty loop did not cause him any trouble, as he easily claimed the gold medal. Bjørndalen's performance secured a third gold medal in the Salt Lake games, a first for any biathlete.\nFischer and Groß left the second shoot together, after Fischer missed a shot, but a further miss from Fischer on the third set of shots dropped him out of contention. Poirée missed a shot on the second shoot, but went clear at the third, and found himself in third place after misses from men ahead of him, including Rostovtsev, who had been clear before that. Groß arrived at the final shoot with a 25-second lead over Poirée, but missed two shots, while the Frenchman shot clear to virtually reverse the margin, leaving with a 20-second lead of his own, which he held onto to secure silver. Ludwig Gredler seemed to be out of it after a miss in the final shoot, as he left the range 25 seconds behind Gross. The Austrian put in a good chase, though, cutting the lead to just 4 seconds and ending up 4th.\nThe race was started at 09:00."

Each national team consisted of four members, with each skiing 7.5 kilometres and shooting twice, once prone and once standing.\nAt each shooting station, a competitor has eight shots to hit five targets; however, only five bullets are loaded in a magazine at one - if additional shots are required, the spare bullets must be loaded one at a time. If after the eight shots are taken, there are still targets not yet hit, the competitor must ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nResults.\nNorway, led by triple gold medalist Ole Einar Bjørndalen, were the defending World Cup winners and led the 2001/02 World Cup. The defending World Champions were France, while Germany were the defending Olympic champions and the only other country with more than one individual medal at the Games, and had won two of the four World Cup relays.\nClean shooting had Ukraine, with Vyacheslav Derkach, and Russia, with Viktor Maigourov, out of the first shoot in the lead, with most of the top teams near them, but Norway some 25 seconds behind after Halvard Hanevold missed a shot. Ukraine's time in the lead was short-lived, as they fell out of contention after Derkach went on the penalty loop after the second shoot. That put the Russians into the lead, after Maigurov shot clear again. They left some ten seconds ahead of Gilles Marguet of France and Petr Garabík of the Czech Republic. Hanevold shot clear to pull his team back up into 4th spot. Maigurov was strong in the ski into the exchange, exteing his lead over France and the Czechs, while Hanevold and Germany's Ricco Groß both equalled Maigurov's time, coming to the exchange 18 and 29 seconds behind the Russians, respectively.\nSergei Rozhkov took over in the lead for the Russians, and while he missed two on his first shoot, so did his closest pursuer, Frode Andresen, leaving the gap the same. However, both Germany, with Peter Sendel, and France with Vincent Defrasne, missed only once, and cut the lead down to around 20 seconds. All four of these skiers missed once on the second shoot, but it was Andresen who made up ground, passing Rozhkov before the end of the shoot, and extending the lead to a full 20 seconds over the Russian, now joined by Defrasne, at the hand off.\nEgil Gjelland increased Norway's lead, shooting clear to open the third leg, getting more than 30 seconds over Russia's Sergei Tchepikov, who shot clear, and France's Julien Robert, who missed once, but didn't cede any time to the Russian. Germany's Sven Fischer had a terrible shoot, going on the penalty loop and leaving his team more than a minute in arrears. Gjelland missed a shot on the second shoot, but by this point it didn't seem to matter, as he was nearly a minute clear of Robert and Tchepikov, still together, and both missing twice. Fischer's charge back saw him get within 20 seconds of that pair, after missing just once. By the changeover, Gjelland's lead was over a minute, with Tchepikov dropping Robert by ten seconds, and Fischer coming back into third, passing the French.\nOle Einar Bjørndalen's missed two on the first shoot, and while that saw the gap to the chasing teams shrink, it was still over 40 seconds. Frank Luck, going for Germany, and Raphaël Poirée, for France, both shot clear, passing Russia's Pavel Rostovtsev, who missed once. Bjørndalen would miss again on the final shoot, but it didn't have any effect on the final result, as he remained comfortably ahead to win his fourth gold medal of the Games. Luck and Poirée both shot clear on their last attempts, and left together, but Luck was clearly stronger, easily outpacing the French to give Germany silver. Rostovtsev was struggling to keep pace with the top teams, and three misses on the final shoot left him no chance, as Russia ended up more than a minute behind in 4th.\nThe race was held at 11:00."

Each miss resulted in one minute being added to a competitor's skiing time.\nResults.\nThe Biathlon World Cup test event in 2001 was won by Magdalena Forsberg, who shot clear and won by more than a minute from Martina Zellner, a German who was not selected for her national team for the 2002 Games.\nForsberg was also the defending world champion and World Cup champion in the distance\n, and led the World Cup in the discipline, having won two of the three Individual races earlier in the season. However despite a long history of success, she had never won an Olympic medal. Liv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée won the other event of the season, at Antholz, while Ekaterina Dafovska was the defending Olympic champion.\nThe 25-year-old Andrea Henkel started before some of her more heralded competition, but recovered well after missing a shot on her second loop, making all ten of her remaining shots to add just the single minute to her ski time. Katrin Apel and Uschi Disl each beat Henkel's time going into the final shoot, despite missing shots earlier, but both missed three times on the final shoot, ending up outside the top 10. Olga Pyleva set the fastest times after the second and third shoots, leading Henkel by more than a minute, but sent two wide on the last shoot, and ended up 45 seconds behind the leading German. Defending champion Ekaterina Dafovska missed one shot in the race, like Henkel, but her ski speed wasn't enough to get close to a medal.\nLiv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée had an identical shooting line to Henkel, and while she was ahead of the German on the first two shoots, she fell behind on ski time, and ended up seven seconds back in second, well ahead of Pyleva, then in bronze position. The final serious challenge was from Magdalena Forsberg, who had won many World Championships, but did not have an Olympic medal. Forsberg was well over a minute clear of Henkel and Poirée as she approached the final shoot, but missed twice, losing any chance at gold. She did manage to get in for bronze, displacing Pyleva.\nThe race was started at 11:00."

Each miss was penalized by requiring the competitor to race over a 150-metre penalty loop.\nResults.\nTwo of the medalists from the women's Individual race were also strong challengers in the sprint, led by Magdalena Forsberg, the five-time defending World Cup overall champion, as well as the defending World Cup winner in the sprint. Kati Wilhelm was the defending world champion and Galina Kukleva was defending champion from the Nagano Games. The test event at Soldier Hollow in 2001 saw Uschi Disl take the win, ahead of Liv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée and individual champion Andrea Henkel. Entering the Olympics, the sprint World Cup standings were closely contested, with Disl, Olena Zubrilova, Forsberg, Olga Pyleva and Wilhelm separated by just 7 points. Skjelbreid-Poirée was further behind, but was coming in on a winning streak, having taken each of the last two World Cup sprints.\nHenkel, the first of the above to go out, was unable to recapture her shooting form from two days before, missing once on each shoot, and finishing well back, in 25th. Her teammate Wilhelm, starting shortly behind her, had no such problems, shooting clear and leading at each of the time checks. France's Florence Baverel-Robert also shot clear, but ended up 45 seconds behind Wilhelm.

She did cut into Wilhelm's time on the final loop, but not by enough, coming in 15.6 seconds behind. Kukleva was close to Wilhelm's time after the first shoot, but fell back, despite hitting all her shots, ending up nearly a minute behind.

However, Wilhelm had also won the sprint at the 2001 World Championships, only to fail to medal in the pursuit, which was won by Liv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée, starting 4th in Salt Lake. Forsberg had won the Overall and pursuit World Cups the previous season, as well as leading the 2001/02 World Cup, including winning each of the first three pursuit races of the year. Skjelbreid-Poirée was close to Forsberg in the rankings though, and had won the most recent World Cup event. Given that Forsberg and Skjelbreid-Poirée had also finished first and second at the test event in Salt Lake the year previous, both seemed serious threats to the top 3.\nWilhelm's lead was short-lived, as she missed three shots on her first attempts, falling quickly to 6th. Disl was unable to take advantage, though, missing two herself, meaning that Forsberg, who shot clear, held the lead after the shoot, followed by Skjelbreid-Poirée, who missed one shot, but still managed to emerge in second. On the second shoot, Forsberg missed her first, but with Skjelbreid-Poirée missing as well, the Swede was able to hold the lead. However, she was now pursued by Wilhelm, who rebounded from her early misses by shooting clear, along with Irina Nikulchina from Bulgaria and Slovenian Andreja Grašič, both of whom started well over a minute behind, but shot clear at each of the first two targets to sit in the top 4.\nSkjelbreid-Poirée made up a lot of ground on Forsberg, and after both shot clear on the third lap, they left the range together. Nikulchina, shooting clear for a third time, was 5 seconds behind, while Grašič, also clear, was back by 15 seconds. Wilhelm, who came in second, missed her 4th shot of the race, falling to 5th, 30 seconds back, just ahead of a recovering Disl, France's Florence Baverel-Robert and a pair of Russians, Galina Kukleva and Olga Pyleva.\nThe final shoot produced some real drama. Skjelbreid-Poirée and Forsberg, now joined by Nikulchina, all missed twice. The group behind then took its shots, with the previous three all still working their way around the penalty loop. Baverel-Robert missed twice, while Disl's dismal shooting performance continued, as she missed three. Grašič and Kukleva also threw one wide, but Wilhelm and Pyleva each hit all five, and left together in first and second places. Forsberg, Skjelbreid-Poirée and Nikulchina also left within two seconds of each other, though more than 10 seconds after the leading two. In the end, Pyleva showed too much strength for Wilhelm, beating the German to the line by five seconds. In the race for bronze, Forsberg fell behind, and while Skjelbreid-Poirée was able to record the second best time on the last lap, it wasn't enough, as Nikulchina, who had participated in two Olympics as a cross-country skier, had the fastest time, and secured the bronze.\nThe race was started at 12:00."

If after the eight shots are taken, there are still targets not yet hit, the competitor must ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nResults.\nThe women's relay looked to be a battle between some traditional powers of the sport. Germany, having won three of the four World Cup relays coming into the Games, as well as being defending champions, were the only team to have more than one medal winner from the individual races on the team, with Uschi Disl, Kati Wilhelm and Andrea Henkel combining for 4 medals, 2 gold. The World Cup standings were closely fought, though, with defending World Cup winners Norway, led by Liv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée, not far behind Germany in second. Russia were the defending World Champions, and expected a fast start from pursuit gold medalist Olga Pyleva, and the French, while not winning a medal yet at the Games, had won the last World Cup relay before Salt Lake.\nThe leaders after the first shoot were not one of the favoured teams, but Ukraine, with Olena Zubrilova shooting clear at her first shoot. Katrin Apel, the only member of the German team not to win a medal in the individual events, also shot clear, and left a few seconds behind Zubrilova. However, there wasn't much separation, as Russia, with pursuit champ Pyleva, Norway's Ann Elen Skjelbreid and Bulgaria, with Pavlina Filipova, were among those in close attention. At the second shoot, Zubrilova's strong form continued, as she shot clear, followed by another outsider, Olga Nazarova of Belarus. The only other team within 10 seconds was Russia, as Pyleva missed her second shot, but stayed close. Apel missed all of her extra rounds, requiring a lap of the penalty loop, and leaving Germany in 12th. Skjelbreid also had trouble for Norway, missing three times to leave her side 30 seconds back. By the exchange Pyleva had pulled ahead by a solid margin, handing off to Galina Kukleva with a ten second lead over Belarus. Skjelbreid made up for her mistakes somewhat, moving into 3rd, as Zubrilova faded for Ukraine. Apel also had a solid closing section, not gaining any time on Russia, but moving her team up to 6th.\nWhatever struggles the Germans might have faced, though, were dissolved in the first section of Uschi Disl's leg. She made up ground on the leaders, and shot clear to leave in first, almost even with Lyudmila Lysenko of Belarus, who shot clear, and Kukleva, who had missed three shots. Irina Nikulchina made up substantial time for Bulgaria as well, pulling them to within 5 seconds. Norway, with Linda Tjørhom, missed one, and fell back to 6th. On the second shoot, Disl missed twice, but still managed to leave with a slight lead, as the slower Lysenko missed once, Nikulchina missed three times, and Kukleva had a disaster, missing five shots and needing two penalty loops, dropping her team to 8th. The new team in contention was Andreja Grašič's Slovenia, as some good speed saw her move up to 3rd, despite three misses. At the handover, Germany led, but Disl's skiing had widened the gap, now 20 seconds over the Bulgarians, with Slovenia and Belarus both fading somewhat.\nAndrea Henkel, the individual champion, cemented the lead she'd been given, going clear on the first shoot, and leaving nearly 40 seconds ahead of second place Iva Karagiozova-Shkodreva of Bulgaria, who also shot clear. In third was Gunn Margit Andreassen of Norway, who missed one shot, but still managed to ski past Slovenia and Belarus. The second shoot was another perfect one for Henkel, now leading by almost a minute after Karagiozova required three extra rounds. These misses left Bulgaria in fourth, with Slovenia's Dijana Grudiček-Ravnikar shooting clear to move into second, and Andreassen missing just once to come out in third. The ski into the exchange saw the ranking shift again, though; while Germany were well ahead, Norway had raced past their opponents to reach the end 40 seconds behind the leaders. The same was true for Russia, as an incredible charge from Svetlana Ishmuratova saw them make up almost 40 seconds on the Germans, and go from 30 seconds behind Norway to just 11 at the final changeover.\nKati Wilhelm's opening shoot, going perfect, left little question about the gold medal; she would require a major collapse to fail her team. Liv Grete Skjelbreid-Poirée missed once, but kept the margin close, while Albina Akhatova was unable to match Ishmuratova's pace, and her one miss saw her substantially further down. Only Bulgaria, with Ekaterina Dafovska, also remained within 40 seconds of the Russians. Wilhelm put two shots wide on the final set of targets, but avoided the penalty loop, ensuring victory. Both Skjelbreid-Poirée and Akhatova missed twice as well, and neither could generate much pressure on their opponents ahead. Bulgaria had a last fight left in them, though, as Dafovska cut the Russians' lead in half after the first shoot, and managed to get within 6 seconds of the Russians for the podium, just falling short.\nThe race was held at 11:30."

        "text": "The Drummondville professional baseball team was a member of the now extinct Quebec Provincial League and operated in Drummondville, in the Centre-du-Québec region of Quebec.\nThe team went through many incarnations over the years. They debuted as the Drummondville Tigers in 1940, but disbanded on July 6 of that year after posting a poor record.\nProfessional baseball would come back to Quebec after World War II, when the Provincial League began operations. The league was rated as Class C, and the Drummondville Cubs would play as an unaffiliated team from 1948 to 1951. Then in 1952, the Cubs signed an agreement with the Washington Senators, and officially became the Senators Class C franchise.\nThey would change their name to the Drummondville Royals in 1953 and again operate as a co-operative franchise. In 1954 the Philadelphia Athletics would come to town and make Drummondville their Class C home. The team then was renamed as the Drummondville A's, during what turned out to be their final season in the league."

        "title": "Michigan Wolverines men's gymnastics",
        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines men's gymnastics team represents the University of Michigan and competes in the Big Ten Conference. The Wolverines have won seven NCAA championships, 21 Big Ten championships and have been invited to 32 NCAA tournaments. Since 1999, Michigan has finished in the Super Six at the NCAA tournament in 11 of 12 seasons. In 2013, Michigan won its fifth NCAA men's gymnastics team championship. The following year, Michigan repeated as National Champions for its sixth NCAA men's gymnastics team championship.\nHistory.\nThe Michigan Wolverines men's gymnastics team has had five coaches in 65 years of competition: Wilbur West (1931–1933); Newt Loken (1948–1983); Bob Darden (1984–1996); and Kurt Golder (1997–2022), Yuan Xiao (2022–present).\nWest era (1931–1933).\nWilbur West was Michigan's first men's gymnastics coach. In three years under West, the team compiled a record of 1–10. After the 1933 season, the gymnastics program was discontinued and was not resumed until 1948.\nLoken era (1948–1983).\nNewt Loken came to the University of Michigan in 1944 as a master's degree student. On the side, he coached the cheerleading team. At the time of Loken's arrival, Michigan did not have a men's gymnastics program. In 1947, the athletic board awarded varsity status to men's gymnastics, and Loken was named the head coach.\nLoken remained the coach of Michigan's men's gymnastics team for 36 years and compiled a record of 250–72–1. His teams won NCAA men's gymnastics championships in 1963 and 1970 and 12 Big Ten championships. Loken coached 71 Big Ten individual event winners and 21 NCAA individual event winners.\nIn 1963, the Wolverines compiled a 6–0 in the regular season and won the Big Ten championship with 210.50 points. They went on to win the NCAA championship with a score of 129 points. The 1963 team also won six NCAA individual championships.\nIn 1970, the team compiled a perfect 12–0 record and won its second team championship with 164.150 points in the NCAA tournament.\nLoken also coached the cheerleading team at Michigan as well as the varsity sport of trampoline. From 1947 through 1964, trampoline was included as an event in gymnastics competitions by both the AAU and NCAA. The first trampoline world championships were held in 1964. Loken led the Michigan trampoline team to NCAA championships in 1969 and 1970. Loken produced more trampoline champions and world medal winners than any other collegiate coach.\nAs of 2007, the 88-year-old Loken was still a regular at Michigan's men's gymnastics practices and events, and it was reported that he had not missed a Michigan home meet from 1948 to 2007. Assistant coach Scott Vetere said: \"He knows everybody on the team, and if he forgets, he's 80-some years old, and he'll ask again. He's just a pure gymnastics guy – always wants to be around gymnastics, always wants to learn more, (always) wants to praise guys for what a wonderful job they're doing.\"\nDarden era (1984–1996).\nBob Darden (1984–1996) was head coach for 13 seasons. During Darden's tenure as head coach, the Wolverines compiled a record of 76–111–1 and had no Big Ten championships or NCAA tournament berths.\nGolder era (1997–2021).\nKurt Golder took over as Michigan's head coach in 1997. After Michigan finished the 1996 season with an 0–11 record, Golder quickly turned the program around. In 14 seasons from 1997–2010, Golder has led the Wolverines to a record of 246–166–1, four Big Ten championships, 10 NCAA tournament berths and two NCAA national championships. Since 1999, Golder's teams have finished in the Super Six at the NCAA tournament in 10 of 11 years.\nIn 1999, Kurt Golder led the Wolverines to a 19–5 record in the regular season. The 1999 team went on to win the school's third team gymnastics championship with season-best 232.55 points in the NCAA tournament. The runner up was Ohio State, which finished with 230.85 points. Justin Toman was Michigan's leader at the 1999 tournament with a score of 58.075. The NCAA championship came just three years after a winless season in 1996. Golder was credited with taking over the program and building it into \"a national powerhouse.\" Upon winning the 1999 NCAA championship, Golder told the press, \"The plan was to get here in the fourth year and be in contention in the fifth year. We got lucky and got some great recruits. Everything fell into place.\"\nThe 2009 Wolverines finished #2 as the runner-up at the NCAA tournament. Michigan gymnast Thomas Kelley was named Big Ten Gymnast of the Year in 2009.\nThe 2010 Wolverines won the NCAA men's gymnastics national championship, defeating the second place team from Stanford University by 0.7 points. Michigan gymnast Chris Cameron also won the all-around title with 90.500 points, including 15.450 on the rings and vaulting, 15.150 on parallel bars, 15.050 on pommel horse, and 13.800 on the horizontal bar.\nThe 2011 Wolverines finished second in the Big Ten and fifth at the NCAA men's gymnastics championship. The highlight of this season was freshman Sam Mikulak who won both the Big Ten and NCAA all-around titles. Sam was the first freshman in NCAA history to win the all-around title.\nThe 2013 Wolverines won their 16th Big Ten Championship behind an NCAA record-setting 15.95 performance on parallel bars from junior Sam Mikulak and a 1–2 all-around competition finish from Mikulak and sophomore Adrian de los Angeles. On April 20, 2013, behind Sam Mikulak's second career NCAA all-around crown and a runner-up performance from Adrian de los Angeles, the team claimed the program's fifth national title.\nThe 2014 Wolverines captured their 17th Big Ten Championship to become the first back-to-back conference champions since the 1999–2000 team. Senior Sam Mikulak broke two NCAA records with a 93.70 all around score and a 16.1 parallel bar score. Twenty of the thirty competed routines qualified into the individual event finals the following day, a record breaking number. Gymnasts that qualified included: Syque Caesar (vault, parallel bars, high bar), Sam Mikulak (all six events), Paul Rizkalla Jr. (vault), Tristian Perez-Rivera (vault, floor), Konner Ackerman (vault), Jordan Gaarenstroom (parallel bars, still rings), Nicholas Hunter (parallel bars, pommel horse), Colin Mahar (still rings), Alex Bubnov (still rings), Nolan Novak (pommel horse) and Matt Freeman (pommel horse). Freshman Tristian Perez-Rivera and Junior Paul Rizkalla Jr. placed second on floor and vault respectively while senior Sam Mikulak and sixth year senior Syque Caesar tied for third place on parallel bars.\nThe 2021 Wolverines captured their 18th Big Ten Championship. Michigan won the meet by 13 points, the largest margin of victory in the championship since 1977. Senior Cameron Bock tied for the all-around title and won pommel horse and still rings. Sophomore Paul Juda took third in the all-around and placed second on parallel bars and high bar. On November 29, 2021, Golder announced his retirement after 25 seasons with the Wolverines. He led the Wolverines to four NCAA championships (1999, 2010, 2013, 2014) and six Big Ten Conference titles.\nXiao era (2022–present).\nThe 2022 Wolverines captured their 19th Big Ten Championship. Junior Paul Juda won the all-around competition with a cumulative score of 85.350, while teammate Jacob Moore took third.\nOn April 25, 2022, Xiao was promoted to head coach, agreeing to a five-year contract through the 2027 season.\nNCAA individual event champions.\nMichigan has had 20 gymnasts who have won NCAA individual championships.\nNational Team Members.\nMichigan has had 19 gymnasts who have been a part of the USA National Team."

        "text": "There has been only one player who has publicly come out as gay or bisexual while being an active player in the National Football League (NFL): Carl Nassib, who revealed himself as gay on June 21, 2021, while with the Las Vegas Raiders. He became the first openly gay player to play in an NFL game on September 13, 2021. He later became the first openly gay player in an NFL playoff game on January 15, 2022. Six former NFL players have come out publicly after they retired. In the 2014 NFL draft, the St. Louis Rams drafted Michael Sam in the seventh round, the 249th of 256 players selected, which made him the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL. However, on August 30, St. Louis released Sam as part of a final round of cuts to reduce their roster to the league-mandated 53 players before the start of the regular season. \nIn college football, Division III player Conner Mertens came out as bisexual in January 2014, becoming the first active college football player at any level to publicly come out as bisexual or gay. In August 2014, Arizona State player Chip Sarafin became the first publicly out active Division I player when he came out as gay. In 2017, Scott Frantz publicly came out as gay, joining My-King Johnson as two of the first openly gay players in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Later that same year, Frantz became the first openly gay college football player to play in a game for an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision school. In 2018, Bradley Kim of the United States Air Force Academy came out as gay, thus becoming the first openly gay football player to play for any military academy in the United States; open homosexuality was forbidden in the U.S. Armed Forces until 2011. Also in 2018, Division II Wyatt Pertuset of Capital University became the first openly gay college player to score a touchdown. In 2022, Byron Perkins of Hampton University came out as gay, making him the first openly gay football player at any historically black college or university.\nYears earlier in women's football in 2001, Philadelphia Liberty Belles player Alissa Wykes of the National Women's Football Association (NWFA) came out publicly as lesbian.\nReception.\nThe generally masculine environment that exists in football, along with the hypermasculinity promoted by sportscasters, make it difficult for a player to come out. Heterosexuality is flaunted in NFL locker rooms with the passing of pornographic magazines and videos, and visits to strip clubs. Anti-gay slurs are sometimes used in the locker room. Fear of backlash from employers, teammates and fans has stopped players from coming out.\nWhile Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi was known to treat his players roughly in practices and during games, he insisted on unconditional respect for gay players and front office staff. Demanding \"Nothing but Acceptance\" from players and coaches toward all people, Lombardi would fire a coach or release a player should they insult the sexual orientation of anyone. During his time in Washington, Lombardi's assistant general manager, David Slatterly, was gay, as was PR director Joe Blair, who was described as Lombardi's \"right-hand man.\" According to son Vince Lombardi Jr., \"He saw everyone as equals, and I think having a gay brother (Hal) was a big factor in his approach...I think my father would've felt, 'I hope I've created an atmosphere in the locker room where this would not be an issue at all. And if you do have an issue, the problem will be yours because my locker room will tolerate nothing but acceptance.\" Upon his arrival in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's gay sexual orientation. \"Lombardi protected and loved Jerry\", said former teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith into his office and told him that his sexual orientation would never be an issue as long as he was coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team's success. Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's only season as Redskin head coach. Lombardi invited other gay players to training camp, and would privately hope they would prove they could earn a spot on the team. At the Washington Redskins training camp in 1969, Ray McDonald was a gay player, with sub-par skills, who was trying to maintain his spot on the roster, but this time with Lombardi as the Redskins' new head coach. True to his word, Lombardi told running back coach George Dickson, \"I want you to get on McDonald and work on him and work on him – and if I hear one of you people make reference to his manhood, you'll be out of here before your ass hits the ground.\"\nBefore Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, San Francisco 49ers player Chris Culliver on media day during an interview with \"The Artie Lange Show\", was asked if he thought any gay players were on his team which he replied \"No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do...Can't be with that sweet stuff.\" He also opined that any gay players should wait 10 years after retiring before coming out. Culliver received backlash for his comments. Baltimore Ravens player Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate for same-sex marriage, estimated that 50 percent of the league agreed with Culliver, 25 percent disagreed, and 25 percent were accepting of everyone even if they were not in complete support of issues such as gay marriage. Culliver later apologized for his \"ugly comments\" that were \"not what I feel in my heart\".\nThe NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement in 2011 contained added protections banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. In 2013, the NFL Rookie Symposium planned for the first time to have speakers on the issue of sexual orientation. The same year, NFL player Chris Kluwe was released by the Minnesota Vikings, which he believed was due to his being outspoken in support of same-sex marriage. He said that special teams coach Mike Priefer in 2012 made homophobic remarks and criticized the player for his views on same-sex marriage, a charge Priefer denied. Kluwe also alleged that head coach Leslie Frazier told him to stop speaking about same-sex marriage. In December, former teammates on the 1993 Houston Oilers said that at least two key players on the roster were generally known by the team to be gay and that they were accepted by the team. Teammate Bubba McDowell said showering with the gay teammates was \"no big deal\". In 2014, ESPN reported on Michael Sam's showering habits in the St. Louis Rams locker room, but later apologized that it \"failed to meet the standards we have set in reporting on LGBT-related topics in sports.\"\nNFL player Ryan O'Callaghan came out publicly as gay in 2017; he came out to Kansas City Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli before his NFL career ended in 2011. In 2019, O'Callaghan said \"I think it's safe to say there's at least one on every team who is either gay or bisexual. A lot of guys still see it as potentially having a negative impact on their career.\"\nIn June 2021, the NFL tweeted in support of the LGBTQ+ community by advocating for The Trevor Project and matching player Carl Nassib's donation of $100,000 while linking the website for fans to donate as well. Following Nassib officially came out, Morning Consult conducted a survey gaging the likelihood of watching the NFL. The survey was concluded with the result of 1 out of 3 LGBTQ+ adults are more interested in watching the NFL following Nassib coming out. This contributes to the general goal of the LGBTQ+ community of gaining more representation within sports so that more LGBTQ+ athletes feel comfortable to participate.\nAhead of Super Bowl LVI, the NFL partnered with GLAAD made history by hosting an event where associates of the NFL were able to mingle with supporters and officials of GLAAD. “LGBTQ athletes need to see more stories of athletes like them, who are supported by their teammates, because so many of them are accepted, just as they are,” GLAAD Deputy President and COO Darra Gordon said in her remarks. “I hope young LGBTQ athletes see posts from tonight and know that they have a rightful place to be out in the NFL, in football, in sports, and at any cultural milestone they aim for.”\nPlayers coming out.\nAfter NWFA player Alissa Wykes came out as lesbian in the December/January 2002 edition of \"Sports Illustrated for Women\", the league's owner Catherine Masters condemned her for pursuing her own \"personal agenda\", stating that the league had received \"hundreds of phone calls. Gay people were saying it was horrible. Straight people were saying it was great.\" In 2003, as a panel member at the first National Gay/Lesbian Athletics Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Wykes joked that she felt \"great empathy for the women on my team who are straight. I mean—a straight female football player?\"\nDivision II college football player Brian Sims came out as gay to his team in 2000 while playing for Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, and publicly told his story in 2009. Alan Gendreau was openly gay to his Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team from 2008 through 2011, but the team made no mention of it to the media. Otherwise, he could have been the first publicly out gay active player in Division I college football. \"Outsports\", a website specializing in LGBTQ people in sports, released his story about being a gay football player on April 23, 2013. In January 2014, Conner Mertens of the Division III Willamette Bearcats publicly came out as bisexual, becoming the first active college football player at any level to publicly come out as bisexual.\nAfter he retired, NFL player David Kopay in 1975 was the first major professional team-sport athlete to come out as gay. Before Carl Nassib's coming out, many experts believed that the first openly gay active NFL player would not be a current athlete, but instead an already out high school or college player who ends up in the NFL. CBSSports.com reported in April 2013 that one NFL team had a player that was not openly gay, but his teammates were aware that he was gay and did not care. That same month, Ayanbadejo said there were up to four NFL players who were considering coming out as gay on the same day with the hope that any backlash would be shared and the pressure on one person reduced. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell emphasized that discrimination based on sexual orientation was unacceptable in the NFL. His statement came after players said they were asked during the NFL Scouting Combine if they liked girls. In November 2018, former player Jeff Rohrer became the first known current or former NFL player to be in a same-sex marriage.\nIn February 2014, Sam publicly came out as gay after his college career had ended, and he became the first publicly gay player drafted in the NFL when he was selected in the seventh round of the 2014 draft. Six months later, Chip Sarafin came out as gay, becoming the first active Division I player to come out as gay. The following season, in 2015, another Division I offensive lineman, Mason Darrow of Princeton University, also came out as gay publicly. \nIn 2017, Scott Frantz publicly came out as gay, joining My-King Johnson as two of the first openly gay players in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Later that same year, Frantz became the first openly gay college football player to play in a game for an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision school.\nIn 2018, Bradley Kim of the Air Force Academy came out as gay, thus becoming the first openly gay football player to play for any military academy in the United States; open homosexuality was forbidden in the U.S. Armed Forces until 2012.\nIn August 2019, free agent Ryan Russell came out publicly as bisexual in an essay he penned for ESPN.\nIn June 2021, Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib came out as gay via Instagram. He announced a $100,000 donation to The Trevor Project as part of the post. Nassib was entering his sixth NFL season and the second year of his three-year contract with the Las Vegas Raiders. He became the first openly gay player to play in an NFL game on September 13, 2021. He later became the first openly gay player in an NFL playoff game on January 15, 2022.\n Selected in the NFL Draft, never played in the league\n Placed on injured reserve, never played in the league\n Practice squad member, never played in the league"

The award was first given following the 1993 season, with both pitchers and position players eligible. After the 2003 season, the Southeastern Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year award was created to honor the most outstanding pitcher. It is selected by the league's head coaches, who are not allowed to vote for their own players.\nThe award has been shared twice, once by Stephen Head of Ole Miss and Jon Zeringue of LSU in 2004, and once by Dylan Crews of LSU and Sonny DiChiara of Auburn. Only one player has won the award twice—Matt LaPorta of Florida in 2005 and 2007. LSU has the most all-time winners, with six. One SEC member has yet to have a winner: 2012 arrival Missouri."

Started gaining on the national scene once again by beginning the Big Ten season as a top 10 ranked team. The Associated Press would eventually rank the Illini as high as number eight during the course of the season; however, the team would falter late in the season, dropping three straight games and fall out of the rankings. The final AP and UPI rankings would include only two Big Ten teams, Ohio State (ranked 3) and Indiana (ranked 7/10). Ohio State would go on and win the NCAA Tournament. For the second time in the history of the Illini, they would play in a mid-season tournament. The tournament they would compete in would be the inaugural Los Angeles Basketball Classic held at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena December 28–30.\nThe 1959-60 team utilized several returning lettermen including the leading scorer and team \"MVP\" Govoner Vaughn. It also saw the return of team \"captain\" Mannie Jackson as well as Ed Perry, Lou Landt, John Wessels, Lee Frandsen, Vern Altemeyer, Al Gosnell and Bruce Bunkenberg. Jerry Colangelo, a future sports mogul, also played a significant role as a sophomore. The Illini finished the season with a conference record of 8 wins and 6 losses, finishing tied for 3rd place in the Big Ten. They would finish with an overall record of 16 wins and 7 losses. The starting lineup included John Wessels at the center position, Vern Altemeyer, Lou Landt and Mannie Jackson at guard and Govoner Vaughn and Ed Perry at the forward slots.\nSchedule.\n \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season"

However, it is typically considered a peripheral award, and no championship bonus points are currently awarded for fastest lap.\nSince records have been kept, the fastest lap has been achieved by the leader on the final lap of the race on one occasion (Bobby Rahal, 1986). It has never been accomplished on the first lap of the race. It is commonly done by a driver not leading the race at the time, due to drafting.\nHistory.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 awarded points towards the World Championship of Drivers.

        "text": "Robert Alexander Wood (born January 12, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants.\nBefore playing professional baseball, Wood played for his high school team at Ardrey Kell High School, and college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2009. The Braves selected Wood in the second round of the 2012 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut during the 2013 season for the Braves, and was an All-Star with the Dodgers in 2017. He won the 2020 World Series with the Dodgers.\nEarly life.\nWood was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended Ardrey Kell High School, where he played for the school's baseball team. In 2009 he was named the North Carolina Class 4A player of the year.\nHe enrolled at the University of Georgia, where he played college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs baseball team. Wood was redshirted during his first season at Georgia because he had required Tommy John surgery after his senior year of high school. At Georgia, Wood had a 13–10 win–loss record and a 3.57 ERA in 32 games pitched. He struck out 180 batters and walked 47 in innings. He was voted 2nd team All SEC in 2012.\nProfessional career.\nAtlanta Braves (2012–15).\nThe Atlanta Braves drafted Wood in the second round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed for a signing bonus of $700,000. He played for the Rome Braves of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2012, where he pitched in 13 games, going 4–3 with a 2.22 earned run average (ERA) and 52 strikeouts.\nHe began the 2013 season with the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League. With Mississippi, he was 4–2 with a 1.26 ERA in 57 innings, and with Gwinnett, he was 1–0 with a 1.80 ERA in five innings. He was named an MiLB.com 2013 Organization All Star.\nAfter pitching in ten games the first two months of the season and posting an ERA of 1.26, the Braves promoted him to the major leagues on May 30. That night, in his major league debut, he pitched the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays. Wood made his first major league start on June 18, 2013, where he allowed one run and earned his first loss.\nWood finished the 2014 season with an 11–11 record and a 2.78 ERA in 171.2 innings with 170 strikeouts.\nBeginning 2015 with Atlanta, Wood was 7–6 with a 3.54 ERA. In 20 starts, he pitched 119.1 innings.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2015–18).\nOn July 30, 2015, in a three-team trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired Wood, Mat Latos, Michael Morse, Bronson Arroyo, Jim Johnson, Luis Avilán, and José Peraza, while the Miami Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Victor Araujo, Jeff Brigham, and Kevin Guzman, and the Braves received Héctor Olivera, Paco Rodriguez, minor league pitcher Zachary Bird and a competitive balance draft pick for the 2016 MLB Draft. He joined the Dodgers starting rotation and was 5–6 with a 4.35 ERA in 12 starts for them.\nWood began 2016 in the Dodgers starting rotation. He made 10 starts in April and May and was 1–4 with a 3.99 ERA. On May 21 against the San Diego Padres he struck out a career high 13 batters in only six innings of work, the first Dodgers pitcher in history to have struck out that many in so few innings. However, he reported that he was not feeling 100% after a May 30 outing against the Chicago Cubs. An MRI exam the next day revealed a posterior impingement in his left elbow, requiring four weeks of rest, and he was placed on the disabled list. On June 16, he reported that the infringement subsided after he had some fluid drained from his elbow and he would be cleared to resume a throwing program a few days earlier than expected. He threw a simulated game against minor league hitters on July 16 and early reports were that it went well. However, shortly afterwards it was determined that he would need elbow debridement surgery, which would cause him to miss an additional two months. He did not rejoin the Dodgers roster until September 20. Overall, he appeared in 14 games for the Dodgers in 2016 (10 starts) and was 1–4 with a 3.73 ERA. The Dodgers did not carry Wood on their roster for the first round of the playoffs, but on October 15, he was added to their roster for the league championship series. He pitched two scoreless innings in that series. After the season, Wood signed a $2.8 million contract with the Dodgers for 2017, avoiding salary arbitration.\nAfter beginning the 2017 season in the bullpen, Wood moved to the rotation after an injury to Rich Hill. He won the National League Player of the Week Award for the week of May 8–14 after he pitched 11 scoreless innings with 21 strikeouts over two starts that week. A few weeks later he was also awarded with the National League Pitcher of the Month Award after he went 5–0 with a 1.27 ERA and 41 strikeouts in May. Wood eventually had his scoreless innings streak snapped at 28 on June 10. On July 5, Wood became the first Dodgers starting pitcher to begin the season 10–0 since Don Newcombe in 1955. On July 7, Wood was named to the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\nIn 27 appearances for the Dodgers (25 starts and two early season relief appearances) in 2017 he was 16–3 with a 2.72 ERA and struck out 151 batters. He induced a 34.6% chase rate from batters that put him in the top 4% in the category in MLB. For his efforts, Wood received a single vote in 2017 National League Cy Young voting, tying him for ninth place with Jimmy Nelson. He allowed three runs in 4 innings in his one start in the 2017 NLCS but in the 2017 World Series he started game four and allowed only one run in 5 innings and then came back and pitched two shutout innings of relief in game seven.\nIn the off-season, Wood signed a one-year, $6 million contract, avoiding salary arbitration. In 2018, he went 9–7 in 33 appearances (27 starts) with a 3.63 ERA.\nCincinnati Reds (2019).\nOn December 21, 2018, the Dodgers traded Wood to the Cincinnati Reds, along with Matt Kemp, Yasiel Puig, Kyle Farmer, and cash considerations in exchange for Homer Bailey, Jeter Downs, and Josiah Gray. Wood came down with a back injury in spring training, and missed most of the season on the disabled list. He made seven starts and was 1–3 with a 5.80 ERA.\nReturn to the Dodgers (2020).\nOn January 12, 2020, Wood returned to the Dodgers on a one-year, $4 million deal. The Dodgers' 2020 season did not begin until late July as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Wood made the start on July 25 against the San Francisco Giants. He struggled with his command in the outing, only lasting three innings, and was placed on the injured list after the game with left shoulder inflammation. He rejoined the active roster on September 1, though he was reduced to a bullpen role for the rest of the season.\nWood appeared in nine games (two starts) on the season, allowing nine earned runs in 12 innings for a career-worst 6.39 ERA, and a career-worst WHIP of 1.816, as he struck out 15 batters. He was left off the roster for the first two rounds of the playoffs but was added back to it for the NLCS, and he pitched scoreless innings in the series. In the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, Wood appeared in two games, pitching four scoreless innings, as the Dodgers won the championship.\nSan Francisco Giants (2021–2023).\nOn January 14, 2021, Wood signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the San Francisco Giants. In the 2021 regular season, Wood was 10–4 with a 3.83 ERA. In 26 starts he pitched 138.2 innings in which he struck out 152 batters, averaging 9.9 strikeouts per 9 innings, and was 4th in the NL in hit batters (16).\nOn December 1, 2021, Wood re-signed with the Giants on a two-year, $25 million contract.\nOn June 23, 2022, Wood threw his 1,000th career strikeout against Travis d'Arnaud of the Atlanta Braves. In 2022, he was 8–12 with a 5.10 ERA in 26 starts, and pitched 130.2 innings in which he struck out 131 batters and hit 12 batters (8th in the NL).\nOakland Athletics.\nOn February 2, 2024, Wood signed a one-year, $8.5 million contract with the Oakland Athletics.

This race wasn't different, he went full power from the very start and was safe from start to finish. A fall and a flat tire were not capable of taking it away from him. The race for the second spot was equally quickly decided with Martijn Budding, also from the Netherlands, having a nice lead on those behind him.

Belgian Sven Nys took home the gold for the second time in his career, a few seconds ahead of Klaas Vantornout, another Belgian. In the background, Lars van der Haar of the Netherlands managed to secure a third spot in his first year with the elite men.\nRace report.\nThe race started with some outsiders hoping for a lucky break, after one lap Martin Bína from Czech Republic, Francis Mourey from France and Marco Aurelio Fontana from Italy were the first three to cross the line. A mere lap further Mourey had even created a lead on the favourites. Slowly but surely those favourites, all Belgians, caught up with Mourey. Halfway into the race there was a lead group consisting of Mourey and the Belgians Kevin Pauwels, Klaas Vantornout and Sven Nys. 2012 world champion Niels Albert trailed shortly behind that group, but never really managed to catch up.\nLap six saw the end of Pauwels' chances for the rainbow jersey. Twice his chain gave him troubles and he dropped back to the 15th spot. Mourey shared his luck and suffered a flat tire. Suddenly only Nys and Vantornout were left to compete for the gold. They kept an even match, though Nys showed he should be feared by 'flying' over the barriers every lap again, creating a small gap each time. In the last lap, as Nys grabbed the lead to go up the limestone steps. Vantornout, in his haste to keep up, turned too sharply into a corner and got stuck in the sidelines of the track. Vantornout only lost about a second, but Nys went for his chance and gave it his all. With that tiny lead he hopped quickly over the barriers again, sealing Vantornout's fate.\nIn the back it long looked like Albert would be completing the podium, but the young Dutchman Lars van der Haar rode an impressive race and got the fifth medal for Netherlands in the 2013 World Championships. Albert dropped away completely to an eight spot. Bart Wellens of Belgium unexpectedly managed to grab the fourth spot."

Following several years of instability, culminating in a split of the conference along football lines, the seven member schools that did not sponsor Division I FBS football purchased the \"Big East\" name and formed a new Big East in July 2013. The FBS schools that had not moved to other conferences by that time joined with several new members and reorganized as the American Athletic Conference, retaining the charter of the original Big East.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe tournament used a double-elimination format, with the field divided into two brackets. The winners of each bracket faced off in a single championship game. Seton Hall claimed the second seed over Pittsburgh and St. John's took the sixth seed over Notre Dame by tiebreaker.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following players were named to the All-Tournament Team.\nMost Valuable Player.\nBilly Ferriter was named Tournament Most Valuable Player. Ferriter was an outfielder for Connecticut."

        "title": "Canadian University Synchronized Swimming League",
        "text": "The Canadian University Artistic Swimming League (CUASL; \"French: Ligue Universitaire Canadienne de Natation Artistique -\" LUCNA), formerly the Canadian University Synchronized Swimming League (CUSSL; \"French: Ligue universitaire de nage synchronisee - LUCNS\"), is the national governing body of university synchronized swimming in Canada. It was established in the fall of 2001 and was incorporated under the Federal Laws of Canada. The league currently comprises 14 different universities from across the country. CUASL has competitions in solo, duet, and team events. CUASL also provides a competitive novice division for athletes who have never previously competed in synchronized swimming.\nHistory.\nThe Beginning of University Synchro.\nUniversity-level synchronized swimming in Canada dates back to 1946 when the Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU), composed of Ontario and Quebec universities, held a swimming meet at the University of Toronto. The swimming championship was divided into three components: speed racing, diving, and \"ornamental\" solo routine and style swimming (with or without music). The four original competitors at this meet were McGill University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, and University of Western Ontario, all of which but one are currently active in CUASL (Western is inactive as of 2012).\nThe universities are credited with being a great influence on the early years of the sport, as it was a time before many local synchro clubs existed. Often, swimmers would only first be introduced to synchronized swimming at the university level. Many girls became interested in the sport upon attending university, and some would compete at either the provincial level or the local level. These swimmers would also put on shows, and learn how to judge and coach. When the first Canada Games were held in 1967, some provinces relied on Physical Education graduates from their respective universities to produce a team, as synchro was still not very well-known. According to the Ontario University Athletics (OUA), regular university-league synchro championships began in 1971.\nRecent.\nIn May 2001, OUA took away competitive status from university synchronized swimming. The number of active competitive teams had dropped to 5, while the minimum requirement was 6. With the athletes not willing to give up the sport, a new league - The Canadian University Artistic Swimming League, was incorporated under the Federal Laws of Canada in the fall of 2001. The member teams at the time of establishment were Queen's University, Brock University, University of Western Ontario, University of Toronto, McGill University, and as a recreational member, University of Guelph. The first league championship meet was held at Queen's on February 10, 2002 with a total of 49 swimmers participating. In 2006, 13 universities were registered with the league for a total of 187 swimmers. In 2012, there were 215 swimmers in total from 14 registered universities.\nPresent.\nThe Canadian University Artistic Swimming League continues to grow every year. There are currently 14 universities from 5 provinces that are part of the league. In order to be eligible to compete within the league, swimmers must be enrolled in an accredited university degree program. The competitive season runs from the start of the school year in September until mid-February. There are normally three main competitions that take place every season: Easterns, Westerns, and Nationals. There are also occasionally localized Invitational competitions. For all teams within Ontario and Quebec, Easterns and Nationals are compulsory competitions, while Nationals is the only compulsory competition for teams outside of these two provinces. Nationals is held in a Western province at least once every four years (if pool time is available). The events that swimmers can compete in are team, duet/trio, solo, and combo. There is also a novice division team, duet/trio, and solo event. In addition, there is also an athletes with a disability solo event. The newest members to the league are Carleton University and the University of Prince Edward Island, both of which joined in the 2012-2013 season.\nMember Schools.\nCurrent.\nUniversity of Alberta, University of Calgary, Carleton University, University of Guelph, McGill University, McMaster University, University of Ottawa, University of Prince Edward Island, Queen's University, University of Toronto, Trent University, University of British Columbia, University of Victoria, University of Waterloo/Laurier University, Université Laval\nPast.\nUniversity of Western Ontario, Brock University, York University"

        "title": "Indoor cricket (UK variant)",
        "text": "The game of indoor cricket can be played in any suitably sized multi-purpose sports hall. There is evidence of the game being played in the 1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, it was played in the 1960s as a means of giving amateur and professional cricketers a means of playing their sport during the winter months. The first recorded organised indoor cricket league in the world took place in 1970 in North Shropshire, and the first national tournament was completed in 1976 with over 400 clubs taking part. By 1979 over 1000 clubs were taking part in indoor cricket in the UK, and it remains extremely popular today with many leagues around the country. Other forms of indoor cricket have been developed, based on variations of the indoor game.\nThe game itself bears much in common with its outdoor cousin, with a hard ball and a full length pitch being used. Indoor Cricket can be played in any suitably sized sports hall or similar shaped indoor arena. If necessary, a mat is rolled out on the floor to replicate the playing conditions of a cricket pitch. This format should not be confused with the netted variant played elsewhere around the world, predominantly in Australia and South Africa.\nThe game of indoor cricket.\nIn terms of the concept of the game, indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the ball to the batsman who must score runs by hitting the ball with his bat. The fielding team attempt to prevent the scoring of runs and dismiss the batsman. Each team takes it in turn to bat, and the team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its outdoor counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.\nTypical rules.\nThe rules of 6-aside indoor cricket are identical to that of outdoor cricket with the following exceptions, some of which may vary between local leagues.\nThere are six players per team, and the game is played over innings of a maximum of 12 overs of six balls, all of which take place from the same end of the pitch.\nBowlers are limited to a maximum of three overs, and batsman must retire upon reaching a personal total of twenty-five runs, but may return to the crease in the event of the rest of their side being dismissed within the 12 overs.\nIn the event of a team losing five wickets within the 12 overs the last man will continue batting with the fifth man out remaining at the wicket as a runner.\nA batsman may be caught out and dismissed directly off the side wall, provided the ball has not also hit the floor or the roof.\nSystem of Scoring.\nA ball that is struck to hit the boundary wall behind the bowler without touching the floor or any other part of the wall or roof part scores six runs. A ball that is struck to hit the boundary wall behind the bowler and also touches the floor but does not touch any of the other walls or roof and hits the back boundary wall scores four runs. In some leagues these scores are switched around to discourage an over-emphasis on aerial shots.\nA ball struck to hit one or more of the side walls will count as one run, even if the ball subsequently hits the back boundary wall. If the ball is struck to hit a side wall and a batsman is then dismissed (for example caught or run out), one run will still be scored.\nA ball struck directly to hit the roof becomes dead immediately. No runs will be scored and there will be no dismissal. The ball will not be rebowled. A ball that hits the roof having previously hit a wall is still in play. At some venues, the roof acts as a side wall where 1 run is allocated when the ball touches it, but a fielder can catch the ball and the batsmen is out caught.\nTwo runs will be scored if the batsmen complete a run at any time. These runs may be scored on top of a run for hitting a side wall, including a bye or leg bye, but not on top of a boundary.\nA bye will count as one run if the ball bowled hits a wall. A leg bye will count as one run if the ball hits a side wall after deflecting off the batsman's pads or body.\nIf the bowler oversteps the crease, bowls a full toss over waist height, or the ball does not pitch on the playing mat, a no-ball will be called and the batting side will be awarded one run. An extra ball will be bowled. Any runs on top of this will still count as usual.\nWide balls will be called as with orthodox cricket rules.\nStrategy.\nThe strategy of indoor cricket differs from its outdoor cousin because of the different scoring system. The quickest way to score runs is to hit a boundary against the back wall and score 4 or 6 runs. In order to prevent this, the two best fielders from the fielding side are generally positioned in front of this wall in order to prevent the ball from reaching it.\nIf the batsman is unable to hit the ball against the back wall, he may instead resort to attempting to score 3 runs by hitting the ball against a side wall and completing a quick single with his partner. In order to attempt to prevent this, the remaining two fielders are generally placed on either side of the batsman in front of the side wall.\nUsing these tactics, a typical score in a 12 over 6 aside game will vary between 100 and 140 runs per side.\nPopularity.\nIndoor cricket is extremely popular around the UK with many regional and local leagues run independently but loosely affiliated to the ECB. Amateur club teams will often field an 11 aside team in the summer and an indoor 6 aside team in the winter. The better teams in the country can qualify for the ECB National Indoor Cricket Cup, which is the highest standard of Indoor Cricket played in the UK. The game is also widely played at University level."

        "text": "This is a list of international cricket grounds in India that have hosted at least one international cricket match. A cricket ground is a large grass field on which the game of cricket is played which are generally oval in shape with no fixed dimensions. A boundary rope usually demarcates the perimeter of the field and a cricket pitch, an area close to the centre of the field is where the batter hits the bowled ball and run between the wickets to score runs, while the fielding team tries to return the ball to either wicket to prevent this.\nBoard of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the national governing body of cricket in India. The BCCI was established on 1 December 1928 at Madras and joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council. BCCI is a consortium of state cricket associations who own and operate most of the stadiums along with the respective state governments.\nInternational cricket was held in India for the first time on 15 December 1933 when the Gymkhana Ground in Bombay hosted the only test match during England's tour of India. India recorded its first win in fifth test of home series against England on 10 February 1952 at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Madras. The first ODI match in India was hosted by the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad during the series against England on 25 November 1981. India played the first T20I match in India at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai on 20 October 2007 against the visiting Australian team.\nThe first women's test match hosted by India began on 31 October 1976 with India playing West Indies at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium at Bangalore. The first WODI was hosted during the 1978 Women's Cricket World Cup with Australia playing New Zealand on 1 January 1978 at Keenan Stadium in Jamshedpur. India played its first WODI against England on the same day at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. The first WT20I played in India was hosted on 4 March 2010 by Bandra Kurla Complex Ground in Mumbai against England.\n, 80 cricket venues have hosted an international match, the most in any country.\nList.\nAny stadium that has hosted an international match in the last five years have been listed as active unless the stadium has been deliberately closed.\n\"Last updated:1 December 2023\""

Five hours all round, about five days a week. That would have been about three years,\" Buchanan later said.\nBuchanan was later signed by the St. George Illawarra Dragons. He played for the Dragons' NYC team in 2011 and 2012, scoring 3 tries in 46 games. In 2012, he was statistically one of the competition's top ten players in hit-ups, metres gained, and tackles made. At the end of the season, he signed a 3-year contract with the Wests Tigers.\nIn Round 1 of the 2013 NRL season Buchanan made his NRL debut for the Tigers against the Newcastle Knights. He was the youngest starting prop in the competition. With injuries to props Keith Galloway and Aaron Woods, Buchanan missed only one game throughout the season, averaging 26 tackles per game. He was also one of the club leaders in support runs. Coach Mick Potter said of Buchanan's first year, \"When Jack came across here, he really was a big kid that was still a bit skinny. Getting some weight on him was key. He probably won’t be fully developed for three more years but he is certainly one to keep your eye on.\"\nWith the arrival of props Martin Taupau and James Gavet, Buchanan made just 4 appearances from the bench in 2014.\nBuchanan played in 12 games in 2015, again all as a reserve. At the end of the season, he re-signed for a further year.\nOn 11 May 2016, Buchanan joined the Widnes Vikings in the Super League effective immediately on a contract to the end of 2017, after being released from his Tigers contract.\nRepresentative career.\nIn 2009, Buchanan played for the New South Wales U17's team."

        "text": "The Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, played in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The team of twelve included nine Paralympic veterans with fifteen Paralympic Games between them: Bridie Kean, Amanda Carter, Sarah Stewart, Tina McKenzie, Kylie Gauci, Katie Hill, Cobi Crispin, Clare Nott and Shelley Chaplin. There were three newcomers playing in their first Paralympics: Amber Merritt, Sarah Vinci and Leanne Del Toso. Carter returned to the Gliders' lineup after being sidelined by a crippling elbow injury at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. The Gliders had won silver in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, but had never won gold.\nThe first stage of the Paralympic competition was the group stage, a round-robin tournament. The Gliders faced a formidable task just to make the finals, as their pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had beaten the Gliders in 2010, and the Netherlands was rated as one of the competition's best teams. After a narrow victory over Brazil, and an easier one against Great Britain, the Gliders were again defeated by Canada, but won their final match against the Netherlands to finish at the top of their pool. The Gliders went on to win the quarterfinal against Mexico and the semifinal against the United States, but lost to Germany in the final, winning silver.\nBackground.\nPrior to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, the Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, had won silver at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, and bronze at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, but had never won gold. The announcement of the membership of the Paralympic team was made on 5 July 2012. The team of twelve included nine veterans with 15 Paralympic Games between them: Bridie Kean, Amanda Carter, Sarah Stewart, Tina McKenzie, Kylie Gauci, Katie Hill, Cobi Crispin, Clare Nott and Shelley Chaplin. Amber Merritt, Sarah Vinci and Leanne Del Toso were newcomers competing at their first Paralympics. Kean, aged 25, was selected as their captain.\nThe oldest team member was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who was coming back for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a crippling elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had not even been born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by Paralympic Hall of Fame coach Frank Ponta. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was hoped was Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women's Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 Paralympic World Cup in Manchester and the Gliders World Challenge.\nGroup stage.\nThe first part of the competition was the group stage. The Gliders' pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had defeated them in the bronze medal game at the 2010 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Birmingham in July 2010. The Gliders' head coach, John Triscari, admitted Canada and the Netherlands would be hard to beat:\nBrazil.\nReport:\nThe Gliders' first game was on 30 August in front of a crowd of 3,288 at the Basketball Arena in Olympic Park in Stratford, London; a venue also known as \"The Marshmallow\". The Gliders had not played Brazil in four years, and what little they knew about them came from watching videotapes.\nThe scores were tied fifteen times, and at no point were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes to go in the final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she extended her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.\nGreat Britain.\n Report:\nThe Gliders' next match was against Great Britain, and was held at the North Greenwich Arena, which could accommodate a larger crowd than the Marshmallow. A crowd of 5,331 saw a low-scoring affair. The Gliders concentrated on defence, and led by only 11–5 at quarter time. By halftime, they had extended their lead to 25–11. The third quarter went badly for Team Great Britain, which only scored three more points to Australia's 14, making the score 39–14 at three-quarter time. The final quarter was Great Britain's best, but the score was still 51–24. Merritt and Crispin were again the Gliders' top scorers, with 10 and 8 points respectively, but they moved the ball around, and every Glider except McKenzie scored at least two points. Gary Peel, the British coach, \"preparing to unleash his best impression of Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer on his beleaguered team\", was scathing about their performance. \"They know that's not the way we play\", he said, \"and I'm disappointed for the crowd and them because they are tons better than that. It was an absolutely disgraceful effort out there. It really was bad.\"\nCanada.\n Report:\nThe Gliders returned to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, in front of a capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 in the first half of third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.\nTriscari identified the Gliders' poor shooting as their critical problem. \"That was a really tough game,\" he said, \"and full credit to Canada, but we can't beat top teams in the world when we only shoot at 34%, that was the key statistic.\" Merritt said that she had \"the utmost respect for Canada. They're a great team, but we'll refocus on the game tomorrow and go out and play like we know we can, the Australian way.\"\nNetherlands.\n Report:\nThe loss to Canada meant that the Gliders needed a win against the Netherlands, who were considered one of the competition's best teams, and who had beaten Canada. Crispin told the media that \"We will go out like we have in every other game and stick to our game plan and hopefully we'll come out on top\".\nThe Netherlands scored first, but Kean soon equalised, assisted by Stewart. The Dutch team responded, but Gauci took two points with a fast break, and then assisted Crispin in putting Australia in the lead, one which the Gliders would not relinquish. Stewart made the next two scores, from outside the paint, and assisted Crispin to bring the score to 6–16. The Dutch team fought back, but there was a 12–18 deficit at quarter time. The Australian defence shut down their opportunities in the second quarter, and the score was 20–30 in Australia's favour at half time, and 29–40 by the end of the third quarter. The Dutch team redoubled their efforts in the final quarter, and won the quarter 20–18, but the Gliders won the game, 49–58.\nOnce again Merritt led Australia's scoring, with 19 points and considerably improved accuracy of 9 shots from 14 attempts, while Crispin had ten points and seven rebounds. The rest of the team performed equally well. Stewart scored six points and five rebounds. Chaplin's reputation as a play-maker was burnished with four rebounds and seven assists. Gauci had eight points and six assists. Nott had played all 40 minutes of the game against Canada the night before, then over 32 minutes in this game, and was particularly active in the final quarter. Triscari praised both the Gliders and their opponents:\nFinals.\nQuarterfinal – Mexico.\n Report:\nThe loss to Canada meant that the Gliders had won three out of four games, the same number as Canada and the Netherlands. Since Australia had lost to Canada by 7 points and defeated the Netherlands by 9, and the Netherlands had defeated Canada by 11 points, a tiebreaker on points differential gave Australia 9 – 7 = +2, Netherlands 11 – 9 = +2, and Canada 7 – 11 = -4. Canada therefore finished third, while Australia, tied with the Netherlands, was placed ahead of them based on defeating them in their match. As a result, the Gliders topped their pool, and received a quarterfinal berth against Mexico, which had managed to qualify despite only winning one game. Triscari was confident, but was not taking the match lightly. He cautioned the media: \nThe Gliders planned to dominate Mexico early, playing as aggressively against them as they had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, which turned out to be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on the next play, with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On the next play, Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14–4.\nThe Gliders put Mexico under intense defensive pressure. Mexico had six team turnovers to the Gliders' one, and wound up with 19 turnovers in total to Australia's 6. Australia scored 18 points from turnovers, compared to 6 for Mexico. Gauci, a two-point player, took a three-pointer to take the score to 17–8. Mexico was unable to recover from Australia's high scoring from Merritt, who ultimately scored 14 points with 70 per cent shooting, and Crispin, who scored twelve points with 67 per cent shooting. The teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10. Mexico fell further behind in the second quarter. Amanda Carter immediately stole the ball from Mexico, which let Merritt score two points. A few minutes later, Carter, assisted by Chaplin, scored a basket from the paint, and was fouled in the process. A successful free throw made the score 36–16. Another steal by Merritt led to a fast break, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38–16. At the halftime break, the score was 44–20.\nIn the third quarter, a team turnover and a series of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50–27 at the end of the quarter. The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score of the quarter, by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.\nMerritt brought the score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game drew to a close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to capitalise on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.\nSemifinal – United States.\n Report:\nIn the semifinal, the Gliders had to beat the reigning champions, Team USA, in front of a small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first possession and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. Team USA turned the ball over to the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10–0 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, \"They will come back! We have to stop them!\"\nIn the final quarter, the Australian defence remained strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, who played the entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40–37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, in the face of the Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.\nGold medal match – Germany.\n Report:\nThe Gliders would have to defeat Germany in front of a capacity crowd of 12,985 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal. Australia had narrowly defeated the German team 48–46 in the Gliders World Challenge in Sydney a few months earlier, and at that point had beaten them three of the previous four times they had played.\nOnce again, Stewart took the opening tip. A defensive rebound by Kean after Germany missed two free throws resulted in the Gliders scoring first, with Gauci assisting Crispin. The Gliders used the same game plan that had defeated the United States, employing a strong defence against a normally high-scoring team. At first, they were successful; with three minutes to go in the quarter, despite several missed shots, Australia was ahead 10–4. In the last minutes, Germany scored ten points that gave them a 10–14 lead at quarter time.\nIn the second quarter, Germany extended their lead to ten points, but Kean scored a point from a free throw, and then, with seconds left on the clock, stole the ball, enabling Crispin to score, so the Gliders were only seven points behind at half time. The Gliders won the third quarter, but only by 9–8. They still had six points to make up, with strong defences from both teams. Gauci scored the most in this game, with 15 points, including a three-pointer, with five assists and four rebounds. In the end, the Gliders lost by fourteen points, 44–58.\nTriscari felt that the Gliders did not put enough pressure on the Germans, and that their shooting was not accurate enough. In particular, they scored a dismal one point from twelve attempts from the free throw line. Basketball Australia CEO Kristina Keneally praised the Gliders' efforts. \"The Gliders have been nothing short of brilliant at the Paralympic Games,\" she said, \"and this Silver Medal is just reward for their outstanding performance. This is the Gliders' fourth consecutive Paralympic Medal – a remarkable achievement. All of the players, coaches and support staff have done a fantastic job and we can’t wait to greet them on their return home.\"\nIn 2013, Keneally announced a four-year development program for the Gliders that included the appointment of a full-time head coach for the first time, based at the National Wheelchair Centre of Excellence at the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Homebush, New South Wales. In May 2013, Tom Kyle was appointed the Gliders' new head coach.\n\"We have had the opportunity to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there\", Kean told the media. \"It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more.\"\nIt was not to be. The Gliders did not qualify for the 2016 Rio Paralympics after finishing second to China at the 2015 Asia Oceania Qualifying Tournament."

        "text": "The 1963–64 Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team represented Creighton University during the 1963–64 NCAA University Division men's basketball season. The Bluejays, led by fifth year head coach John J. 'Red' McManus and All-American Paul Silas, played their home games at the Omaha Civic Auditorium. The Bluejays set six new team records, plus home attendance marks. The Jays played before 86,856 fans in 13 home games at Omaha's Civic Auditorium including a standing room only crowd of 10,556 for the Oklahoma City game. They finished the season 22–7. The 22 wins were the most ever for a Creighton team, as were the 2,441 points and 84.2 scoring average with 1,024 field goals. Single game marks for most points and field goals were established in the Bluejay's 124–94 win over Miami University of Florida when Creighton tallied a record 54 field goals. The Jays worst loss came at the hands of the Oklahoma City Chiefs in their first meeting 85–101.\nThe Creighton Bluejays earned a bid into the 1964 NCAA Tournament where they defeated Oklahoma City University in the Midwest Region Quarterfinals round before falling in the Midwest Region Semifinals to Wichita University. They fell to Texas Western in the Midwest Region Third Place game.\nSeason Summary.\nThe Bluejays started the season off by winning nine games in a row before running into the NCAA champion UCLA Bruins on the West Coast. The Jays opened the season by pounding Colorado 85–72 with the help of a zone defense that stifled the Buffs. With Paul Silas playing very little because of a knee injury, Hardin–Simmons was downed 72–58. Charlie Brown hit 8 field goals to lead the Bluejays to a 77–62 Homecoming victory over LaSalle and Harry Forehand hit six points in the last minute of play to pull the Jays from a 57–61 deficit to a 63–61 victory over Idaho State to make it four wins in a row for Creighton.\nThe Jays took a last second victory from #4 ranked Arizona State 84–83. The game was highlighted by Chuck Officer's game-tying shot while in a prone position on the court and Bobby Miles free throw shooting in the two overtime periods. Creighton made it six in a row by beating Utah State 96–91. The Bluejays then defeated Iowa 77–72 in one overtime and beat Gonzaga 89–79 before heading for the West Coast. Creighton toppled Long Beach State 99–93 before running into the Bruin buzz-saw and losing 79–95. The Jays rebounded against Nevada 92-63 and South Dakota 75-54 before being routed by Oklahoma City 85–101. The Bluejays then beat Notre Dame 95–81 before a capacity crowd with Silas hitting a season high 37 points.\nNew Mexico State and Marquette fell to the Bluejays 99–73 and 84–57 before they headed for their ill-fated East Coast trip. Losing two out of three games doomed the Jay's chances for any national ranking as the fell to Providence 77–80 and St John's 60–64 after toppling Canisius 74–72. Creighton returned home to defeat Aquinas 106–60. The Bluejays then lost their only home game in a heartbreaking last-second defeat by the Memphis State Tigers 86–87. Miami was then shot down 124–94 under the warm Florida sun and Western Michigan was beaten 88–72 in a Chicago snow storm.\nCreighton got revenge for an earlier defeat by trouncing Oklahoma City 94–77 before the largest crowd ever to witness a Bluejay game in the Civic Auditorium. The Jays then traveled to New York City where Chuck Officer made a last-second shot to dump NYU 88–86 in Madison Square Garden and make up for some prestige lost in the earlier eastern trip. Notre Dame again felt the sting of Creighton's hot shooting hand as the Irish went down 84–71 at South Bend, Indiana. In the play-off for an NCAA Midwest Regional Tournament spot, the Jays downed Oklahoma City for the second time 89–78 in Dallas, Texas.\nInvited to the NCAA post-season playoffs for the second time in three years, the Bluejays took it on the chin twice to place fourth in the Midwest Regional tourney at Wichita, Kansas. In the opening round the Wichita University Shockers, complete with a near 10,000 home fan cheering section, bounced the Jays 68–83. An excessive amount of fouls plus some cold shooting doomed the Bluejays from the start. Creighton's Paul Silas held highly touted Shocker Dave Stallworth to one field goal and two free throws in the first half. Texas Western knocked off the Jays in the consolation game the following night 52-63. Poor foul shooting again plagued Creighton as they hit only 50 percent from the line. The Bluejays out-shot the Miners from the field 22–21.\nAll-American Paul Silas rounded his collegiate basketball career by competing for a berth on the United States Olympic Basketball Team. The 6'7\" senior led the 1963–64 Jays to their best record (22–7) as captain and set six new individual player records to add to two written in 1961–62. Silas, who guided the Bluejays to two NCAA tournament berths in his three-year career, led the nation in rebounding his sophomore and junior years. He was named to many all-opponent and All-American teams.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=11 style=|Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA Tournament"

        "title": "1969 Major League Baseball expansion",
        "text": "The 1969 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in the establishment of expansion franchises in Kansas City and Seattle in the American League and in Montreal and San Diego in the National League of Major League Baseball. The Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Pilots began play in the 1969 Major League Baseball season. One of the reasons for expansion was increasing pressure to maintain the sport as the US national pastime, particularly because of the increasing popularity of professional football.\nAs a result of expansion, the American and National Leagues reorganized. Each league was split into two divisions, forming the American League East, American League West, National League East, and National League West.\nOther candidate cities that were considered in 1967 included Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, and Milwaukee. The latter two were rejected because they were close to cities that already had a Major League Baseball team (Houston and Chicago, respectively). In May 1966, Commissioner of Baseball William Eckert stated that cities that should be considered for expansion included Milwaukee (the Milwaukee Braves had moved to Atlanta before the 1966 season), New Orleans, Oakland, San Diego, Seattle, and Toronto, and that expansion would occur in \"eight to 10 years;\" he subsequently stated that the leagues could expand \"any time after two years\". By August, Major League Baseball had plans to expand to two 12-team leagues by 1970, and had squelched the possibility of a third league, such as the Continental League proposed in 1959 or the proposal made in August 1968 by Ron Plaza consisting of an Eastern, Central, and Western League.\nAmerican League.\nIn 1960, the American League conducted a survey to determine potential expansion cities. The list included Atlanta, Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, Denver, Oakland, San Diego, Seattle, and Toronto.\nKansas City Royals.\nKansas City had been the home to the Kansas City Athletics from 1955, when the team moved from Philadelphia, to 1967, after which the team moved to Oakland. For several years, owner Charlie Finley had threatened to leave the city: in May and September 1962 to Dallas–Fort Worth; in January 1964 he signed a contract with the state of Kentucky to move the team to Louisville and rename the team \"Kentucky Athletics\"; and in February 1964 he wanted to move the team to Oakland. A committee of American League owners denied his requests.\nIn October 1967, with the team's lease at Municipal Stadium expired, Finley once again proposed to move the franchise to Oakland, this time at the owners' meetings in Chicago. During the first ballot of the committee of American League owners on October 18, he received six supporting votes, one opposing vote (from the Baltimore Orioles), and the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Washington Senators abstained from voting. American League president Joe Cronin requested a second ballot, in which the New York Yankees were the only team to change their status, opting to support the move and giving Finley \"the seven votes necessary to move the team\". In a press release, Cronin announced the move and promised to expand the league by two more clubs no later than 1971. The Oakland Athletics began play in the 1968 Major League Baseball season.\nCronin conveyed the news to Kansas City mayor Ilus Davis and Stuart Symington, a US Senator from Missouri. Cronin had thought that the compromise to install a new team by 1971 would be acceptable to them as compensation for the loss of the Athletics. Instead, Symington threatened to challenge Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption with federal legislation, and to also challenge the reserve clause. Davis threatened a lawsuit to block the move. Tom Yawkey arranged a meeting of the owners still at the convention, during which the league agreed to accelerate the expansion process and assured that Kansas City would be granted a new franchise to begin play no later than the 1969 season. This would require another franchise to be established at the same time to ensure the league had an even number of teams for a balanced schedule.\nOn the floor of the United States Senate on October 19, Symington described Finley as \"one of the most disreputable characters ever to enter the American sports scene\" and said that \"Oakland is the luckiest city since Hiroshima\".\nEwing Kauffman won rights to the franchise, and paid a $5.5 million expansion fee for the Royals, which played games at Municipal Stadium until the end of the 1972 season, after which the team moved to Royals Stadium, now known as Kauffman Stadium.\nSeattle Pilots.\nBy the 1960s, with Seattle's population growing, the city became the largest to host a Pacific Coast League team, the Seattle Rainiers. The league's stature also declined with the move of the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles and the New York Giants to San Francisco, which caused those cities' PCL teams to relocate to much smaller markets. In 1964, the city purchased Sick's Stadium for $1.1 million. In 1965, the Rainiers were sold to the Los Angeles Angels, who renamed the team the \"Seattle Angels\".\nThe city made several attempts to lure a Major League Baseball team. In 1964, William R. Daley visited the city when searching for a new home for the Cleveland Indians. He was unimpressed with the stadium, citing it as the primary reason to terminate his quest to move his team. Charlie Finley also found the stadium inadequate during a 1967 visit, and so rejected Seattle as a potential target for moving the Kansas City Athletics.\nBecause of this, the city instead tried to lobby for an expansion franchise at the 1967 owners' meetings in Chicago. The delegation also had support from two US Senators, Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson, the latter of whom was the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, a committee which has \"jurisdiction over the major league's business activities\". Coupled with Symington's threats related to the move of the Kansas City Athletics, the political influence swayed the American League owners. However, they were reluctant to expand in 1969 without a Seattle stadium bond issue. The Seattle delegation assured the owners that Sick's Stadium could be renovated in five months to fulfill the minimum requirements until a new stadium was built; with this, the owners agreed to a 1969 expansion, and approved teams in Kansas City and Seattle.\nIn December 1967 at the Winter Meetings in Mexico City, the franchise was officially awarded to Pacific Northwest Sports, which received $5.5 million in funding from Daley, who thus had 47% ownership of the venture. Other owners included Max and Dewey Soriano. The award was contingent on renovation of Sick's Stadium to increase its seating capacity from 11,000 to 30,000 by the start of the 1969 season. The Sorianos persuaded notable athletes to advocate for the $40 million King County stadium bond issue, including baseball players Mickey Mantle, Carl Yastrzemski, and Joe DiMaggio, and football player Y. A. Tittle; the bond issue was approved by 62.3% of the electorate.\nNational League.\nThe National League had received applications for an expansion franchise from Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, Milwaukee, Montreal, San Diego, and Toronto as well as an informal bid from Denver.\nMontreal Expos.\nMontreal had a long history of interest in baseball. The sport became increasingly popular in eastern North America in the 1850s and 1860s, and Montreal \"became a special hotbed\", so much so that by the early 1860s Montreal authorities banned play in city parks and streets for public safety.\nMinor league baseball became a presence in the city. In 1946, the Montreal Royals, a Triple-A team affiliated with the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball, became the first team having any affiliation to MLB to break baseball's color barrier. Jackie Robinson, who had been signed to a contract by Branch Rickey in late 1945, played the entire season for the International League team. He and teammates Roy Partlow and Johnny Wright were the first black players in the league since the 1880s. The next year, Robinson became the first black player to play for a Major League Baseball team. In 1951 in Farnham, a town east of Montreal, Sam Bankhead became the first black manager in Minor League Baseball; he was a player-manager for the Farnham Pirates of the Provincial League that year.\nMontreal City Councilor Gerry Snyder spoke to Ford Frick sometime after the 1962 Major League Baseball expansion, during which he was told Montreal would not receive an expansion franchise unless it had a stadium in which to contest matches. At the Winter Meetings in Mexico City on December 2, 1967, Snyder presented a proposal to Major League Baseball owners to establish a franchise in the city. Several influential owners pledged their support for a Montreal franchise in that meeting, including Walter O'Malley, Roy Hofheinz, and John Galbreath. Certain that Hofheinz would object to a Dallas–Fort Worth bid and that the San Diego bid was near certain to be successful, Snyder deemed a bid from Buffalo to be the strongest bid against which to compete.\nOn 27 May 1968, the National League officially awarded a franchise to Montreal to commence play in the 1969 season. National League president Warren Giles had encouraged the owners during the meeting, stating \"If we're going to expand, let's really spread it out\". The Montreal Expos became the first franchise to be awarded to a city outside the United States. When the news reached the U.S. Congress, members collectively condemned the decision.\nBecause of the slow pace of progress in meeting commitments, Jean-Louis Lévesque withdrew his financial support in the franchise on July 31, 1968. Snyder quickly found another investor, Charles Bronfman, and the team met the deadline of 15 August for the initial $1.1 million installment, before which Jarry Park was selected as the team's stadium for the short term. Renovations to the park were made by adding uncovered bleacher seats along the right and left field lines, and an electronic scoreboard installed beyond right field. The team had some issues committing to a new stadium, as required by the franchise award, and it was said that the team had agreed to build a dome at the Autostade and use it as their stadium if a new stadium was not built by 1970. It had originally intended to lease the stadium and expand its seating capacity from 26,000 to 37,000, but then chose Jarry Park instead.\nThe ownership group paid $12.5 million for the team. John McHale was hired as the team's first president, and Jim Fanning its first general manager. Many names had been considered for the team, including \"Royals\" which had a strong association with the city, but the name had already been adopted by the new Kansas City franchise. After rejecting various options, including \"Voyageurs\" and \"Nationals\", the name \"Expos\" was chosen in honour of Expo 67 and because it was the same in both of the city's official languages. McHale stated that the name would \"help Montreal be identified properly as the city that gave the world Expo 67\".\n\"The New York Daily\" mistakenly reported that Buffalo had been awarded a franchise instead of Montreal.\nSan Diego Padres.\nIn 1967, C. Arnholt Smith, owner of the PCL San Diego Padres (PCL), won a bid for an expansion team in the National League for the . On May 27, 1968, the National League officially awarded a franchise to San Diego to commence play in the 1969 season for a fee of $12.5 million for the team. After the 1968 PCL season, Smith surrendered the franchise, which moved to Eugene, Oregon, and transferred the Padre name to his new NL team, the San Diego Padres. Eddie Leishman was named general manager of the MLB Padres, with club president and minority investor Buzzie Bavasi, formerly GM of the Los Angeles Dodgers (having resigned to take the new role), playing a dominant role in its baseball operations as president of the team.\nExpansion draft.\nIn order to stock the roster of each team, a draft was held in which each of the extant teams would make available to the expansion franchises some of the players on their major league and minor league rosters. Each expansion team selected 30 players in the draft, and each of the extant teams lost six players. The extant teams were allowed to protect 15 players in their organization from the draft. After each player lost, another three players could be protected. The extant teams were not informed of the draft selections of the expansion teams until the draft was complete.\nOn October 14, 1968, the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres drafted players exclusively from National League teams. The draft was conducted from the Windsor Hotel in Montreal, in which four rooms were reserved: one for the Expos, one for the Padres, one for the remaining 10 teams, and one in which draft selections were made. The Padres won a coin flip, and so had the first selection, which they used to draft Ollie Brown from the San Francisco Giants. Montreal's first selection was Pittsburgh Pirates utility player Manny Mota. Selections were made by general manager Jim Fanning and manager Gene Mauch for Montreal, and general manager Buzzie Bavasi and manager Preston Gómez for San Diego.\nOn 15 October, the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots drafted players exclusively from American League teams. The draft was conducted in Boston, at the Sheraton Hotel.\nAftermath.\nBecause Buffalo was not awarded an expansion franchise, Erie County legislators reconsidered a $50 million bond issue that was to be used for the construction of a domed stadium for baseball and football. The applicants that submitted a bid for Dallas–Fort Worth claimed that Roy Hofheinz, owner of the Houston Astros, had blocked their bid in order to preserve Houston's radio and television broadcast revenue. Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn, Jr. complained about his team being in the same division as two expansion franchises.\n–The addition of four teams resulted in the reconfiguration of the leagues; each was split into an east and a west division. The American League announced its realignment into two divisions on 28 May 1968, beginning in the 1969 season; the American League East would consist of the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees and Washington Senators, and the American League West would consist of the California Angels, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, and Seattle Pilots. The National League originally resisted a divisional split, with its president Warren Giles citing \"the tradition and history of baseball\". By July 10, the National League owners had agreed to a divisional split, in which the National League East would consist of the Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals, and the National League West would consist of the Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, and San Francisco Giants.\nGame scheduling issues had to be resolved; league-wide, there would be 1,944 games compared to 1,620 for the 1968 Major League Baseball season. The American League had considered decreasing the number of games played by each team to 152 or 156 from 162 that had been played each season since 1961, and the National League either 162 or 165 games, but the leagues agreed to a 162-game schedule in a meeting on 10 July 1968. Each team would play 18 games against every other team in their own division, and 12 games against each league opponent in the other division. A best-of-five post-season playoff series between league division winners was also introduced.\nThe Kansas City Royals have been the most successful of the four 1969 expansion teams. The franchise fielded competitive teams in the 1970s and 1980s and won the 1985 World Series. After a 29-year postseason drought, the Royals returned to postseason play in the 2014 season, before winning their second World Series title in .\nThe San Diego Padres had nine consecutive losing seasons, and have since made the playoffs seven times. The Padres twice made the World Series in and , but lost both appearances.\nThe Montreal Expos had good attendance for the 1969 season, and after having losing records for ten years, were competitive in the 1980s and early 1990s. Its 1994 season put it in first place before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike prematurely ended the season. The team's fortunes declined thereafter, and the team moved to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season, becoming the Washington Nationals. The franchise won its first playoff series in 1981 when the Expos defeated the Phillies in the NLDS, after a split-season. As the Nationals, the franchise won the NLDS in 2019, over the Los Angeles Dodgers. They went onto sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in their first ever NLCS, and defeat the Houston Astros (moved to the AL prior to the 2013 season) to win the franchise's first World Series title.\nThe Seattle Pilots fared worst of the four expansion franchises, playing only in the 1969 season. The team fared poorly on the field, and faced financial difficulties owing to no television coverage, a stadium with problems, and the highest ticket and concession prices in the league. Owners of other American League teams wanted Soriano and Daley to sell the team to a Seattle owner who would improve the team and address issues at Sick's Stadium, particularly uncovered seats with bad views. After several attempts to sell the team to a Seattle owner failed, on April 1, 1970, Judge Sidney Volinn declared the team officially bankrupt; it was sold to Bud Selig, who moved the team to Milwaukee and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers. Selig had negotiated a deal for the purchase with Soriano during Game 1 of the 1969 World Series. As a result of the relocation, in 1970 the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract. The $32.5 million lawsuit was settled in 1976 when the American League offered the city a franchise in exchange for termination of the lawsuit. This led to the establishment of the Seattle Mariners via the 1977 Major League Baseball expansion.\nSee also.\nOther Playoff Expansion Changes Format"

In a statement the RLIF stressed that \"the suspension of TNRL is not an expulsion and is intended to provide a period of stability, while the matters raised by the various stakeholders can be properly and fully investigated\" although a new body \"Tonga Ma’a Tonga Rugby League\" has been set up by the Tongan Sports Council and the players which is expected to take over running of the national teams.

The event was proposed by Roger Federer, and was organised in under 24 hours. It was held in Rod Laver Arena at 2 pm and lasted about 90 minutes; tickets cost A$10 for adults and were free for children under 12. Nine players participated, in two teams (named after the colours in the Haitian flag). Team Red consisted of Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Lleyton Hewitt, and Samantha Stosur, and Team Blue was Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, and late substitute Bernard Tomic. Former player and current TV analyst Jim Courier served as the chair umpire. Players wore microphones during play, and competed in doubles, mixed doubles, and other arrangements. Team Red defeated Team Blue, 7–6. Additional donations were solicited at the event, and several other players – including Marcos Baghdatis and Maria Sharapova – donated money directly. An early count had at least A$159,000 raised; later reports put the figure around A$400,000.\nDay 1 (18 January).\nThe 2010 Australian Open started with inclement weather in southeastern Australia. Rain temporarily suspended play on the outer courts, allowing play on only Rod Laver Arena and Hisense Arena, which have retractable roofs. Play was able to begin on the outer courts approximately an hour later. The rain continued intermittently throughout the day, forcing some matches to be postponed until Day 2.\nMen's singles play was started by Andy Roddick on the main courts as he defeated Thiemo de Bakker in straight sets 6–1, 6–4, 6–4. The fifth seed Andy Murray followed by beating qualifier Kevin Anderson 6–1, 6–1, 6–2. Fourth-seed Juan Martín del Potro took four sets to defeat American Michael Russell 6–4, 6–4, 3–6, 6–2. Australian Bernard Tomic prevailed in straight sets against qualifier Guillaume Rufin. Rafael Nadal won in his match against Peter Luczak 7–6(0), 6–1, 6–4, despite struggling in the first set. 13th-seed Radek Štěpánek lost to Ivo Karlović in a lengthy five set match, 2–6, 7–6(5), 6–4, 3–6, 6–4. Ivan Ljubičić and Fernando González made it to the next round. The match between Matthew Ebden and Gaël Monfils was suspended at 2–2(30–15).\nWorld number 14 Maria Sharapova lost a 191-minute opening match with her former doubles partner, world number 58 Maria Kirilenko 7–6(4), 3–6, 6–4.

Perhaps the most notable women's match of the day, however, involved two unseeded players. Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová defeated Regina Kulikova 7–6(5), 6–7(10), 6–3 in a match that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes—the longest women's match by time in a Grand Slam event in the open era, and believed to be the second-longest women's match ever.

        "title": "Adam Morgan (baseball)",
        "text": "Adam Christopher Morgan (born February 27, 1990) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs.\nAfter growing up and playing high school baseball in Marietta, Georgia, he enrolled at the University of Alabama, where, as his father had done, he played college baseball. The Phillies drafted him in the third round of the 2011 MLB draft. Morgan was among the top pitching prospects in the organization until a torn rotator cuff caused him to miss all of the 2014 season. He made his major league debut in 2015. He became a relief pitcher in 2017.\nEarly life.\nMorgan was born to Wiley and Karen Morgan in Tampa, Florida, and has a younger brother named Grant. He attended Kell High School ('08) in Marietta, Georgia, where he played baseball on a team that went to the state playoffs three times. He also played on various travel teams, including in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU).\nMorgan attended the University of Alabama, where he played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team. His father had played college baseball as a pitcher at the university. With Alabama, he developed a \"devastating slider\" that contributed to high strikeout rates throughout his career. He notched the first complete game of his collegiate career in an outing against Georgia Tech in the 2010 NCAA Baseball Regional. After the 2010 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. His junior year, he formed part of a tandem atop Alabama's starting rotation that helped lead the Crimson Tide back to the NCAA Super Regional.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies drafted Morgan in the third round of the 2011 MLB draft and signed him for a $250,000 signing bonus, and assigned him to the Williamsport Crosscutters of the Class A-Short Season New York-Pennsylvania League, with whom he compiled a 3–3 win–loss record and a 2.01 earned run average (ERA) and 43 strikeouts in 53 innings. Advancing to the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012, Morgan made 20 starts and struck out 10.24 batters per nine innings (5th in the league) with 28 walks and 140 strikeouts (2nd) in 123 innings, and a second-best in the league 5.00 strikeouts/walk ratio. That earned him a promotion to the Reading Phillies of the Class AA Eastern League in August with whom he was 4–1 with a 3.53 ERA and 29 strikeouts in 35 innings.\nAfter notching an \"impressive\" performance with Reading, the Phillies invited him to spring training in 2013. A column written years later noted, \"At 22, he was seen as one of the most advanced pitching prospects in the organization, and a call-up to the big club seemed imminent for sometime in 2013 ... However, as happens with pitchers, Morgan suffered a setback.\" Pitching for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League, after pitching to a record of 2–7 with a 4.04 ERA and 49 strikeouts in 79 innings, Morgan suffered a torn rotator cuff in his left throwing shoulder in May 2013, which required surgery; he did not undergo surgery, however, until January, and thus missed the 2014 season. After the 2014 season, the Phillies added Morgan to their 40-man roster.\nEntering 2015 fully healthy with improved mechanics, Morgan looked to re-establish himself in the IronPigs' starting rotation before a potential call-up to the major leagues later in the season. With Lehigh Valley, Morgan posted a record of 0–6 with a 4.74 ERA with 33 strikeouts in 68 innings in 13 starts. His mediocre statistics notwithstanding, minor league talent evaluator Matt Winkelman commented that Morgan's \"velocity [is] almost back and slider is almost there.\"\nMajor leagues.\nMorgan began the 2015 season with Lehigh Valley, and the Phillies promoted him to the major leagues to make his debut on June 21 in place of injured Phillies' starter Jerome Williams despite him posting a poor 0–6 record in 13 starts with Lehigh Valley. Morgan pitched 5 innings in his debut, which came against the St. Louis Cardinals, who coming into the game had the best record in the National League. He allowed only one run, struck out 6, and earned the win, also earning an opportunity to start a second game. Morgan after making his major league debut stated that \"he looked down the whole game\" and that he \"didn't want to try to do too much or overthink.\" Morgan started the first game after the All-Star break for the Phillies, and although one columnist opined that he \"deserves better\" than to be removed from a game with a low pitch count only to have the lead he helped build evaporate, the Phillies ended up earning the win, and Morgan received praise from interim manager Pete Mackanin, who said Morgan \"showed no fear\" on the mound. Mackanin expressed a willingness to let Morgan pitch in tough situations to see how he would respond during the second half of the season. Through his first several starts, Morgan showed promise of developing into a legitimate middle-to-back-of-the-rotation starter, but needed to focus on keeping the ball down to avoid allowing hitters to make solid contact and hit home runs, something they had done five times in his first five starts. In 2015 with the Phillies he was 5–7 starting 15 games, with a 4.48 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 84 innings.\nIn 2016 with the IronPigs he was 6–1 with a 3.04 ERA and 52 strikeouts in 50 innings. On August 14, 2016, he was recalled by the Phillies. In 2016 with the Phillies he was 2–11 starting 21 games, with a team-high 6.04 ERA among qualified pitchers that season with 95 strikeouts in 113 innings.\nMorgan made the 2017 Opening Day roster in the role as a long reliever. He was optioned to Lehigh Valley two weeks later, after struggling in two appearances. Morgan considered retiring and moving to Atlanta to become a firefighter, but reported to Lehigh Valley and returned to the major leagues briefly in May and again in June for the rest of the season. After his June promotion, Morgan's average fastball velocity increased from to as he acclimated to pitching more as a left-handed specialist out of the Phillies' bullpen. At the end of his 2017 season, he was 3–3 with a 4.12 ERA with 63 strikeouts in 54 innings.\nIn 2018, he was 0–2 with one save and a 3.83 ERA with 50 strikeouts in 49 innings for the Phillies. In 2019, he was 3–3 with a 3.94 ERA along with 29 strikeouts in 29 innings for the Phillies, and ended his season early on the injured list with a left hip flexor strain.\nIn the pandemic shortened 2020 season, Morgan went 0–1 in 17 games, with a 5.54 ERA with 16 strikeouts in 13 innings for the Phillies. On October 29, 2020, Morgan was outrighted off of the 40-man roster after having surgery to repair an injury he received on the flexor pronator in his throwing arm, and he elected free agency the next day.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn January 3, 2021, Morgan signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs organization that included an invitation to Spring Training. On June 29, Morgan was selected to the active roster posting a 2–1 record in 34 games, a 4.26 ERA with 28 strikeouts along with 2 saves in 25 innings. He elected free agency on November 4, 2021.\nHouston Astros.\nOn March 21, 2022, Morgan signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. On May 2, Morgan triggered the opt-out clause in his contract and became a free agent.\nPitching style.\nMorgan as a starting pitcher early in his career was a control pitcher who lacked overwhelming velocity, instead relying on maintaining good command of his pitches to get weak contact and retire hitters. He relied on three predominant pitches – a four-seam fastball that seldom exceeded , and averaged around , a slider with which he can generate swings and misses, a changeup, and an occasional curveball. Phillies' interim manager Pete Mackanin in 2015 praised Morgan's feel for pitching, and said of his pitching style: \"He knows what he’s doing. He knows how to mix his pitches, change speeds. He has that excellent changeup to fool a lot of hitters with, and when he spots his fastball down in the zone, he’s a real good pitcher.\" After another start, Mackanin complimented Morgan's changeup, referring to it as a \"Bugs Bunny changeup\".\nAfter transitioning to the bullpen full-time and being called back up from Lehigh Valley in 2017, Morgan's velocity went up on his slider and fastball as his fastballs particularly risen up to an average of . Morgan claimed this jump in velocity is a result of \"his becoming more accustomed to a reliever's routine. It allows him to do more long-tossing during workouts and that has improved his arm strength. He has also become more confident.\"\nMorgan since becoming a relief pitcher, has used his slider more than his fastball especially against left-handed hitters, utilizing it at least 61 percent of his pitches thrown against left-handed batters each season since 2017 and using it at least over 32 percent against all batters. Morgan has used his slider to generate a large majority of his swings and misses since 2017 as well as striking out higher percentage of batters he faced as reliever than as a starter. Morgan developed and began relying more on a sinker/two-seam fastball in his arsenal, throwing it 56 more times than his four-seam fastball between 2017 and 2021.\nPersonal life.\nMorgan and his wife, Rachel, have one son and one daughter together."

The team of 1934 was only able to play one match because of a different tournament format.\nAn Egyptian player with a notable record is goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary.

        "text": "Association football is the most popular sport in almost all North, Central American and Caribbean countries, and eleven members of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, CONCACAF, have competed at the sport's biggest event – the men's FIFA World Cup.\nResults.\nTeam results by tournament.\nThe team ranking in each tournament is according to FIFA. The rankings, apart from the top four positions (top two in 1930), are not a result of direct competition between the teams; instead, teams eliminated in the same round are ranked by their full results in the tournament.\nFor each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nOverall team records.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by a penalty shoot-out are counted as draws. 3 points per win, 1 point per draw and 0 points per loss.\nAppearances.\nNot qualified.\n24 of the 35 active FIFA and CONCACAF members have never qualified for the final tournament.\nSummary of performance.\nThis table shows for each world cup the number of countries at the World Cup, the number of entries (No.) from around the world including any rejections and withdrawals, the number of North, Central American and Caribbean entries (#A), how many of those North, Central American and Caribbean entries withdrew (#A-) before/during qualification or were rejected by FIFA,\nthe North, Central American and Caribbean representatives at the World Cup finals, the number of World Cup Qualifiers each North, Central American and Caribbean representative had to play to get to the World Cup (#WCQ), the furthest stage they reached, their results, and their coaches.\nCompetitive record.\n1930s: The best US performance at the FIFA World Cup.\nTwo teams from North America entered the tournament. Mexico was seeded in Group 1, and took part of the first World Cup match ever, losing 4–1 to France. Defeats to Chile and Argentina followed, with Mexico finishing last overall.\nThe United States dominated Group 4, winning both games 3–0. The first, against Belgium, had American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas to be the first with an official \"clean sheet\" in the tournament. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper \"Imparcial\" wrote that \"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\". The second match, played in windy conditions, witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude against Paraguay.\nQualified for the semi-finals, the US played Argentina. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, and lost 6–1.\nThe now-traditional third place playoff was not established until 1934. A FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third.\n1934: The only one World Cup match.\n32 countries applied to enter the tournament, so qualifying matches were required to thin the field to 16. Haiti hosted Cuba for three that would send the winner to face Mexico, and Cuba advanced with two wins and one draw. Mexico defeated Cuba thrice at home to contest the sole CONCACAF spot against the United States. The qualifying match happened only three days before the start of the tournament in Rome, which the United States won.\nThe United States lost their only match to hosts and eventual champions Italy in a 7–1 blowout; the \"New York Times\" correspondent wrote that \"only the fine goal-tending of Julius Hjulian of Chicago kept the score as low as it was\".\n1938: Cuba reaches the Quarter-final.\nIt was originally intended that the World Cup would be held alternately between the continents of South America and Europe. However Jules Rimet, the creator of the World Cup, convinced FIFA to hold the competition in France, his home country. Because of this controversy, many American countries, including Argentina (the most likely hosts if the event was held in South America), Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Dutch Guyana, Uruguay, and the United States all withdrew or refused to enter so Cuba qualified automatically.\nFive of the first round matches required extra time to break the deadlock; two games still went to a replay. In one replay, Cuba advanced to the next round at the expense of Romania 2–1. Sweden advanced directly to the quarter-finals as a result of Austria's withdrawal, and they proceeded to beat Cuba 8–0.\n1950: The Miracle Match.\nIn the 1950 World Cup qualification, only three countries of CONCACAF took part in the qualifier for two spots. Mexico and the United States qualified over Cuba. Mexico took part in the opening match, losing 4–0 to hosts Brazil, and also lost to Yugoslavia (4–1) and Switzerland (2–1). The United States, with a hastily assembled team of semiprofessional players, lost to Spain 3–1 before defeating England 1–0 in a group match that is largely considered the greatest upset in World Cup history. Another loss by 2–5 to Chile ended the U.S. Team campaign.\n1954: Mexico has a short World Cup.\nIn the 1954 World Cup qualification, Mexico, United States and Haiti disputed one qualifying spot. Mexico won. The 1954 tournament used a unique format, where after dividing the sixteen teams in four groups, the seeded teams did not play each other, as did the non-seeds. Thus Mexico did not have to play fellow non-seeded team Yugoslavia, and lost to seeds Brazil and France. Mexico finished thirteenth overall.\n1958: Mexico does not host, but plays the World Cup.\nMexico expressed interest in hosting the tournament, but Sweden was eventually chosen at the FIFA Congress held in Rio de Janeiro around the opening of the 1950 FIFA World Cup. In the 1958 World Cup qualification, six CONCACAF teams played for one spot, again won by Mexico. For the third time Mexico took part in the opening match, losing 4–0 to hosts Sweden. Afterwards they drew 1–1 Wales to win their first point in World Cup history, and lost 4–0 to Hungary in Sandviken, in what became the northernmost World Cup match in history. Mexico finished last overall among all sixteen teams.\n1962: Mexico's first victory at the World Cup.\nIn the 1962 World Cup qualification, seven countries played for the sole CONCACAF spot, again won by Mexico, who then advanced to the CONMEBOL/CCCF/NAFC Intercontinental Play-off.

Mexico finished as twelfth overall. The tournament also allowed goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal to become the first player to take part in five consecutive World Cups, a feat only matched by Germany's Lothar Matthäus in 1998. Carbajal also became the goalkeeper with the most goals conceded with 25, tied by Saudi Arabian Mohammed Al-Deayea in 2002 (though Carbajal played 14 matches in 5 tournaments, while al-Deayea was in 10 games across 3 Cups).\n1970: North America hosts the World Cup, El Salvador's first World Cup.\nThe 1970 FIFA World Cup, the ninth staging of the World Cup, was held in Mexico, from 31 May to 21 June.

Mexico was chosen as the host nation by FIFA in Tokyo, Japan on 8 October 1964, over opposition from Argentina. Along with Mexico, another CONCACAF spot was reserved to the winner of the qualifiers. El Salvador beat 11 other countries to make their debut. Both CONCACAF teams wound up drawn in the same group.\nIn Group 1, hosts Mexico lived up to the expectations of an entire nation by advancing along with the Soviet Union. This was the first time in seven World Cup tournaments that Mexico had progressed from the initial stage. Mexico drew 0–0 USSR in the tournament's opening match, won 4–0 El Salvador, won 1–0 Belgium. El Salvador lost all 3 games, finishing last overall with 9 goals against and none scored.\nThe quarter-finals saw a transformed Italy prevail 4–1 over Mexico after trailing 0–1. The host took the lead against Italy with a José González goal, but his teammate Gustavo Pena equalized with an own goal before half-time. Italy then took over, and dominated the second half.

In their opening game against Italy, they managed to take the lead with a goal from Emmanuel Sanon, before eventually losing 3–1. Italy had not conceded a goal in 12 international matches, and it ended Dino Zoff's run of 1142 minutes without conceding a goal.

The North, Central American and Caribbean zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. A total of 15 CONCACAF teams entered the qualification. This edition was marked by an upset as Mexico, traditional CONCACAF heavyweights and needing a win to go through, were eliminated by Honduras. The 0–0 tie between Mexico and Honduras qualified El Salvador to participate in the World Cup as the CONCACAF runners-up. El Salvador also became the first Central American team to qualify for more than one World Cup (a record that has been broken by Costa Rica).\nEl Salvador in their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. One comfort was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games: displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23. At the ranking remained the last 24 place.\nHonduras drew against Spain and Northern Ireland 1–1, and while trying to qualify with a third draw against Yugoslavia, a penalty in the final minutes lead to a 0–1 defeat.

Canada earned clinched qualification on 14 September 1985 to participate in their first ever World Cup after beating Honduras 2–1.\nIn Group B Mexico beat Belgium 2–1, and despite being held 1–1 by Paraguay, they won the group after a further win over Iraq, 1–0. With this performance, Mexico won the top spot in its group and advanced to the next round where Mexico faced Bulgaria in a 2–0 win. In the quarter-finals stage, Mexico held West Germany to 0–0 on regular time and overtime, before losing 1–4 in the penalty shootout with goal-keeper Harald Schumacher saving two penalties. Mexico repeated the 6th place from 1970.\nAt the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Canada impressed defensively in their first game, allowing few chances and conceding a late Jean-Pierre Papin goal to lose to France 0–1.

Costa Rica along with the United States, qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Costa Rica qualified the first time. Returning after long absences were the United States, who competed for the first time since 1950.\nFor the 1990 World Cup in Italy, two of the team's more experienced players, Rick Davis and Hugo Perez, were recovering from serious injuries and unavailable for selection, and manager Bob Gansler selected many inexperienced players and recent college graduates. The U.S. lost all three games to Czechoslovakia, Italy and Austria. At the ranking remained the 23 place.\nCosta Rica beat Scotland 1–0 in their first match, lost 1–0 to Brazil in their second, then saw off Sweden 2–1 to claim a place in the second round. Costa Rica were comfortably beaten 4–1 by Czechoslovakia. At the ranking remained the 12 place.\n1994: United States hosts the World Cup.\nThe 1994 FIFA World Cup was held in nine cities across the United States. The United States was chosen as the host by FIFA on 4 July 1988. Average attendance was 69,000, a record which still stands today (no other FIFA World Cup has exceeded 53,000 average attendance). The total attendance of nearly 3.6 million for the final tournament remains the highest in World Cup history, despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams (and from 52 to 64 matches) in the 1998 World Cup. A total of 23 CONCACAF teams entered the qualification. The North, Central American and Caribbean zone was allocated 2.25 places (out of 24) in the final tournament.

The hosts advanced to the second round as one of the best third-place teams. They played and, despite a 1–0 defeat, to the eventual champion Brazil. United States' performance was considered a great success . At the ranking remained the 14 place. Mexico went on to win group on tiebreakers, emerging to the eventual champion Brazil from the tournament's \"Group of death\", composed of Mexico, Italy, Ireland, and Norway. However, Mexico eventually lost 1–1 (pen. 1–3) in the second round to Bulgaria. Miguel Mejía Barón led this team into one of its most distinguished performances in a World Cup. At the ranking remained the 13 place.\n1998: Jamaica's first World Cup.\nFor the first time in the competition, the group-stages were expanded from 24 teams to 32.

Head coach Steve Sampson received much of the blame for the performance as a result of abruptly cutting team captain John Harkes, whom Sampson had ironically named \"Captain for Life\" shortly before, as well as several other players who were instrumental to the qualifying effort, from the squad. It emerged in February 2010 that Sampson removed Harkes from the team due to Harkes allegedly having an affair with teammate Eric Wynalda's wife. Mexico was placed in Group E, with the Netherlands, Korea Republic and Belgium. Mexico started against Korea Republic losing 0–1 but came back to win 3–1. Belgium had started beating Mexico 2–0 but they came back to tie 2–2. The third game against Netherlands ended in another 2–2 result which resulted in qualification to the Round of 16.

Facing Greece in the round of 16, Bryan Ruiz opened the score, but Sokratis Papastathopoulos tied on injury time.

        "text": "The Bill Aker Baseball Complex is a baseball venue located on the campus of Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky, United States. It is the home field of the Northern Kentucky Norse baseball team, a member of the NCAA Division I Horizon League. The complex is named for Bill Aker, who was the head coach of Northern Kentucky baseball from 1971 to 2000. It has a capacity of 500 spectators.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2001, the venue was known as Friendship Field. In 2001, it was renamed the Bill Aker Baseball Complex at Friendship Field, in honor of former Northern Kentucky head coach Bill Aker. Aker had led the program from its 1971 inception to the end of the 2000 season and had an 807–572–1 overall record.\nFrom 2006 to 2008, the Norse played home games at what was then named Champion Window Field in nearby Florence.\nThe facility underwent $500,000 renovations in spring 2013, immediately prior to Northern Kentucky's first season in Division I. The infield grass was replaced with artificial turf. A new outfield fence, foul poles, and drainage system were also added. Prior to the 2017 home opener the outfield, warning track and bullpens were also resurfaced with artificial turf, making the entire playing surface synthetic."

        "text": "The Australian National Women's Under-18 ice hockey Team (NWU18T) is the women's National Under-18 ice hockey team of Australia. The team is controlled by Ice Hockey Australia, a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nHistory.\nThe Australian NWU18T was formed in 2012 in order to qualify and compete in the IIHF World Women's U18 Championships. The team held its first training camp in September 2012 in Adelaide, South Australia and in January 2013 held another training camp in Brisbane, Queensland. Tamra Jones was named as the team's first Head Coach with Jo Frankenberger as her assistant. Following the two camps, 14 players and one goalie were included on the team roster. The team played their first game on 6 December 2013 against the New Zealand women's national under-18 ice hockey team in Dunedin, New Zealand, tying 2-2. It was part of a four-game series being held in Dunedin between the two teams. Australia went on to lose the remaining three games of the series. In December 2014 Australia hosted the New Zealand women's national under-18 ice hockey team for a five-game series at the Medibank Icehouse in Melbourne. The team won the series three games to two and were awarded the 2014 Trans-Tasman Cup. They also recorded their largest international win in game four, defeating New Zealand 8–1. In August 2015 Australia competed in two games against the Denmark women's national under-18 ice hockey team as part of their 2015 Denmark Tour which also included a training camp that had begun on 25 July. Australia lost the opening game 2–12 with Natalie Ayris and Madison Poole scoring the team's two goals. In the second game of the tour Australia lost 1–9 with Emily Davis-Tope scoring the only goal on the third period buzzer.\nIn January 2016 the team debuted at the IIHF World Women's U18 Championships where they played in the 2016 Division I Qualification tournament in Spittal an der Drau and Radenthein, Austria. Australia was placed in Group B with Great Britain, Italy and Poland. The team finished last in Group B's preliminary round after losing all three of their games and advanced to the seventh place classification game against Romania, who had finished last in Group A. Australia defeated Romania following a shootout and finished the tournament in seventh place. Kate Tihema was selected as best Australian player of the tournament. The team started 2017 with a training camp in January in Copenhagen, Denmark ahead of the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 Women's World Championship Division I Group B Qualification tournament. During the training camp Australia took on the Danish women's under-18 team in two exhibition games where they lost 3–5 and 0–3. The team then traveled to San Sebastián, Spain for the start of their World Championship tournament. At the tournament Australia took on hosts Spain, Mexico and Romania in a single round robin schedule. Australia won the tournament after winning all three of their games which including their largest international win on record, defeating Romania 10–0. As a result of the tournament win Australia earned promotion to Division I Group B for the 2018 World Championships. Goaltender Keesha Atkins was selected as best Australian player of the tournament.\nIn January 2018 Australia arrived in Katowice, Poland for the 2018 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 Women's World Championship Division I Group B tournament. Prior to the start of the tournament the team played Denmark in an exhibition game which they lost 0–10. Australia opened the Division I Group B tournament with a 1–6 loss to France. They went on to lose their other four games of the tournament against China, Denmark, Great Britain and Poland, and finished the tournament in last place. As a result, the team was relegated back to Division I Group B Qualification for 2019. Captain Emily Davis-Tope was named best Australian player of the tournament.\n2019 Championship\nHeld in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The Australian team were able to play an exhibition game against current/former Dutch Senior National Team players in Tilburg. \nThe tournament included Netherlands (host), Chinese Taipei, and Kazakhstan. Games against Netherlands who had just come down from Division 1 was close. Australia would cause an upset beating Kazakhstan for the first time in Australia's history. Australia would medal for Bronze after a late defeat to Chinese Taipei.\nMedal: Bronze \n2020 - 2022 Championships \nIIHF would cancel all women's tournaments due to worldwide Covid Pandemic.\n2022 Championship\nAfter trialling tournaments in a regulated risk averse manner, IIHF would vow to play cancelled tournaments and the 2022 Championship would go ahead in Turkey in July. This would be interesting for multiple reasons. \nThe AWIHL National League was set up in Australia's summer to coincide with World Championships. Australia's winter seasons had also been affected (during European Summers) by the pandemic. \nHeld in Istanbul, Turkiye a decision was made to go regardless and the team was selected. The set up would see IIHF join both groups for 9 teams:\nAustralia, Iceland, Turkiye, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Great Britain, Spain, Netherlands, Latvia\nAustralia would play Spain in an exhibition and their training throughout the pandemic showed. Australia would later be pooled with Iceland and Spain. Australia again ticking off something in the history books with a W against first time opponents Iceland. Spain would show how disciplined they were only allowing one goal against.\nDue to the grouping at the tournament, moving forward the highest that Australia could place would be Bronze and lowest wouls be to face relegation. \nA win against Turkiye (another first for the NWU18T) put Australia against a tough new IIHF team, Latvia. Latvia also had the tournament's highest point scorer, Linda Rulle. \nAustralia would win 2-1 against Latvia with notable performances by Co-Captain Olivia Last, Natashe Dubé and Elana Holub. The team only allowing one goal from Linda Rulle. Elana would respond with an inspiring goal from the halfway line which the goalie would mishandle and allow in. Natasha providing insurance for the win. The win would be historic again as Australia's first ever win again Latvia. \nThis allowed a rematch against Netherlands for the Bronze medal game. On-ice delays would cause added pressure as exposed piping would create significant delays in the game. The rink however would repair the issues and the game would play on.\nLocked at 1-1, Co-Captain Ebony Brunt would score the go ahead goal to win the game. Another historic win for Australia to record the countries first ever win against Team Netherlands and the program's second Bronze medal.\nSpain would go on to win the Gold medal, with Australia's goal being the only Goal Against in the round robin. Great Britain would score one against in their Grand Final defeat for Silver. \nMedal: Bronze\nCo-Captain Ebony Brunt\nCo-Captain Olivia Last\nAsst Capt Phoebe Roberts \nAsst Capt Courtney Mahoney\n2023 Championship\nFollowing what was deemed a success due to the sheer adversity faced by the Australian team in the tournament 6 months prior, there were a lot of external expectations placed on the team to continue their success. \nHeld in Dumfries, Scotland. Teams that participated were Great Britain (host), Australia, Netherlands, Latvia, Turkiye, Mexico\nAustralia would have a tough game against a well prepared Turkiye team. It was evident the team had spent time working on issues from the previous tournament giving up a lot less in opportunities. The Turkish goalie also denying multiple high percentage chances. Australia would go on to win the game and make plans to move forward from that game.\nNetherlands was visibly shaken by the improvements the Australian team had made between tournaments. Noticeably younger it had worked in Australia's favour to have so many newcomers the previous year to get experience under their belt. Madison Smith having her first 'official' international IIHF shutout. (Her first being a shared shutout with Olivia against Turkiye in 2022). Another first in IHA history books.\nMexico was a faster game but Australia had the momentum throughout the game. Natasha Dubé getting two goals again in back to back games and Hannah Cryan getting her first IIHF goal. \nThis would lead to a potential Gold medal match up against Latvia who were looking for redemption. Courtney Mahoney would score 2 important goals in her best game of the tournament. Madison Smith shutting out repeat tournament top scorer Linda Rulle and only allowing 2 goals against. The game would be a 1 goal differential win with Elana Holub would make her mark again against Latvia, for 3-2 win to receive the Gold Medal.\nMedal: Gold\nCaptain Molly Lukowiak\nAsst Capt Courtney Mahoney\nAsst Capt Phoebe Roberts "

New Caladonia, Papua New Guinea did not enter. Australia again won the qualifying tournament for 2002 FIFA World Cup. Second and third-string line-ups thrashed a number of tiny island nations in a competition that made a mockery of the Confederation, including a world-record 22–0 win against Tonga, then smashed that record with a 31–0 win over American Samoa only two days later. Still missing Harry Kewell and Mark Viduka, Australia comfortably beat New Zealand, their only real threat in the Oceania confederation. Australia then once again had to win a two leg playoff in November, in order to advance to the World Cup finals to be held in South Korea and Japan.\nOn this occasion the opposition was the 5th placed South American team, Uruguay. In the preceding four months Uruguay's preparation had been six World Cup qualifying matches, as follows: beat #2 ranked Brazil 1:0; drew 1:1 with #8 ranked Colombia; drew 1:1 with #2 ranked Argentina. In contrast, Australia's preparation had included no qualifying games since two matches in 4 days in June, against #81 ranked New Zealand, although had played two friendly matches – a loss to Japan in August and a 1:1 draw with France in November.\nIn the first leg in Melbourne, Australia won 1–0 after Kevin Muscat scored from a penalty kick; however, Australia's qualification campaign ended unsuccessfully as they lost 3–0 in the away leg in Montevideo just five days later with the South Americans proving too strong.\n2006: Australia reaches the Round of 16.\nA total of 10 teams entered the 2006 World Cup competition. The competition was composed of three rounds. Australia and New Zealand entered the competition directly in the Second Round. The other 10 teams were divided in two groups of five teams each, and played against each other once. In the Second Round buckled surprise. Australia drew 2–2 with the Solomon Islands, which combined with other results put that team ahead of New Zealand in the standings and meaning that the Solomon Islands qualified for the final playoff rather than the expected New Zealand. On 22 July 2005, Guus Hiddink was announced by FIFA as the new national coach. This announcement came after intense speculation by the Australian media over potential candidates and even a premature announcement from Hiddink himself. After some initial training sessions with the Australian team in the Netherlands, his first campaign as national coach resulted in an 11–1 aggregate win over the Solomon Islands in the OFC Qualifying Tournament Final. The remaining task for Hiddink and Australia was the Oceania-South America playoff against the fifth placed team from the CONMEBOL Qualifying Tournament for a place in the World Cup. Australia, ranked #49, then moved on to play 18th ranked Uruguay in a rematch of the qualifying matches in 2001. Again, there was a huge contrast in preparation. Australia had only two recent qualifying matches, against #138 Solomon Islands, only three days apart. Uruguay's preparation had included four qualifying matches, in the previous two months, including: beaten #26 Colombia, drawn with #33 Ecuador, and beaten #4 Argentina. Uruguay defeated Australia 1–0 in Montevideo on 12 November 2005, after a header from Dario Rodriguez. Australia had the better of their Uruguayan opponents for a lot of the match, but they could not capitalise on their opportunities. In Sydney, on 16 November for the second leg of the qualifying series and in front of 82,698 fans at Telstra Stadium, Australia led Uruguay 1–0 after 90 minutes following a goal by Mark Bresciano in the first half. The aggregate was tied, and extra time was played. Neither team scored after two periods of extra time, bringing the game to a penalty shootout. Australia won the penalty shootout 4–2, making Australia the first ever team to qualify for a World Cup via a penalty shootout. Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer made two saves and John Aloisi scored the winning penalty. The resulting win led to scenes of celebration across the country, as the Socceroos qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, their first qualification in 32 years.\nOn 12 June 2006 at FIFA World Cup, the Socceroos defeated Japan 3–1 in their opening game in Kaiserslautern, with Tim Cahill scoring two goals (84', 89') and John Aloisi scoring one (92+') in the last eight minutes to claim their first World Cup finals victory. Cahill goals were the first ever scored by Australia in the World Cup Finals, and Australia became the first team in the 2006 tournament to come back after being 1–0 down. Also, no other team has scored three goals in the last seven minutes of a match in World Cup finals history. Australia met Brazil in their second Group F game in Munich on 18 June. The Australians held Brazil to a 0–0 half time scoreline before Adriano put Brazil in front (49'). Brazil substitute Fred scored (90') with the help of substitute Robinho to give Brazil a 2–0 win, which saw the Brazilians go through to the second round. On 22 June, Australia faced Croatia in Stuttgart. The final score was 2–2. A goal from Darijo Srna in the second minute put Australia on the back foot. Australia equalised with a penalty goal from Craig Moore (38') after Croatian defender Stjepan Tomas handballed near the Croatian goal. Niko Kovac gave Croatia a 2–1 lead after halftime before Australia equalised again through Harry Kewell (79'). As Brazil beat Japan 4–1, Australia proceeded to the next round to face Italy.\nOn 26 June, Australia met Italy in Kaiserslautern. Kewell was unavailable for the game, entering the stadium on crutches reportedly suffering from an attack of gout and infected blisters (later diagnosed as septic arthritis). The score at half-time was 0–0. Italy went down to 10 men due to the red card (51') given to Marco Materazzi for a two-footed tackle on Mark Bresciano. Otherwise, six yellow cards were issued in total. Almost three minutes into stoppage time, with the score still at 0–0 and Australia being pushed into their own half, a controversial penalty was awarded to Italy when Fabio Grosso fell under a Lucas Neill challenge in the final seconds of the match. Francesco Totti scored from the spot (95') and the game ended immediately with Australia eliminated. Coach Guus Hiddink officially ended his reign as the coach of the Socceroos following the 1–0 loss to Italy and took the managerial job with Russia. Australian assistant coach Graham Arnold branded the penalty a \"joke\", to the agreement of several Australian players, including Tim Cahill, who believed Grosso should have been cautioned for diving.\n2010: New Zealand's outstanding performance.\nThis was the first OFC World Cup qualifying campaign since Australia's move from the OFC to the AFC. The first phase began at the 2007 Pacific Games in Samoa, with the football tournament doubling as an OFC World Cup qualifying competition. The gold, silver, and bronze medallists (New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu, respectively) advanced to the second phase. The three medallists joined seeded side New Zealand in a home-and-away round-robin tournament on FIFA match dates in 2007 and 2008, and also acted as the 2008 OFC Nations Cup. The Cup was won by New Zealand, who as a result qualified for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa and the World Cup qualifying play-off with the AFC 5th-placed team, Bahrain. New Zealand were successful in this play-off, winning 1–0 on aggregate score in order to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since the 1982 tournament.\nThe New Zealand group consisted of reigning World Cup holders Italy, Paraguay, and Slovakia. Winston Reid's header from a Shane Smeltz cross in stoppage time brought New Zealand, 78th in the Fifa rankings, their first ever point at the finals of the tournament against Slovakia (1–1). In the second game New Zealand tied 1–1 with the defending World Cup champions, Italy. Shane Smeltz gave the All Whites the lead in the seventh minute; he had run into an offside position on a free kick, but the referee ruled that he had been played on by an Italian's touch as the ball soared into the penalty area. Italy tied the score with Vincenzo Iaquinta’s penalty kick in the 29th minute. Daniele De Rossi had drawn the penalty when he went down after New Zealand defender Tommy Smith grabbed his shirt, and the goal seem to infuse the Italians with a little life. New Zealand, playing five men across the back in front of goalkeeper Mark Paston, held firm and posted its second straight 1–1 draw. At the start of the third match, against Paraguay, New Zealand had the chance of reaching the last 16 but failed to trouble Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar even once in the match, which ended 0–0. New Zealand ended the tournament as the only undefeated team after drawing their three group matches, but they finished behind Paraguay and Slovakia and were eliminated. The team finished 22nd out of the 32 teams.\n2014–22: Yet another absence from the World Cup.\nWhile Australia qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, OFC itself was unable to qualify a team.\nFor the 2014 tournament, the 2012 OFC Nations Cup served as the second phase of qualifying, and involved the four teams that would compete for the intercontinental play-off with CONCACAF. For the first time a team other than Australia and New Zealand won the continental cup, as the All Whites were upset by New Caledonia, which in turn lost to Tahiti in the final. The French Polynesian squad competed in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, but New Zealand still managed to win the double round-robin group for the World Cup spot. In the playoff, the All-Whites were doubly defeated by Mexico, who finished with an aggregate score of 9–3 to get the World Cup spot.\nFor 2018, the 2016 edition of the OFC Nations Cup again doubled as the second round of the OFC qualifying competition for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Samoa won a close first-round group involving four teams, and qualified for a second round stage consisting of two four-team groups and also serving as the 2016 OFC Nations Cup (in that tournament, the top two teams in each group met in knock-out semi finals and final, with New Zealand beating Papua New Guinea on penalties after a goalless stalemate in the final). The top three teams in each of the groups qualified for the third round, from which group winners New Zealand and the Solomon Islands qualified for the final. New Zealand won the two-legged final 8–3 on aggregate after a heavy win at home and a 2–2 draw in Honiara. From here, New Zealand faced a home-and-away knockout match with fifth-placed CONMEBOL team, Peru, who had a FIFA ranking more than 100 places higher than New Zealand (10th vs 122nd). Despite this, New Zealand managed a creditable 0–0 draw at home in Wellington in November 2017, before finally succumbing to a 2–0 loss in Lima several days later.\nIn 2022, the qualifying format changed, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the pandemic in Oceania, the qualification process was held entirely in Doha, Qatar. Before qualification began, FIFA reported that both American Samoa and Samoa had withdrawn. The preliminary qualification match between the two lowest-ranked teams (Tonga and the Cook Islands) was to determine the eighth team to compete in the second stage. The match was cancelled after Tonga withdrew due to the effects of the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami, meaning that the Cook Islands advanced to the group stage. In the second round, two groups consisting of four teams each played each other, with the winners and runner-ups of each group progressing to the final stage. From Group A, Solomon Islands and Tahiti advanced to the next stage as Vanuatu and the Cook Islands withdrew due to COVID-19 cases in both of their camps whilst from Group B, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea advanced as winners and runners-up respectively. The final round was a series of single-legged knock-out matches. Solomon Islands defeated Papua New Guinea 3–2 whilst New Zealand defeated Tahiti 1–0 in their respective semi-final bouts. In the final, New Zealand thrashed Solomon Islands 5–0 and advanced to the inter-confederation play-off. In the single-legged play-off match, contested at neutral Al Rayyan, New Zealand lost 1–0 to Costa Rica."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Chaminda Vaas",
        "text": "In cricket, a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings is known as a five-wicket haul or fifer, and is regarded as a notable achievement. Fewer than 40 bowlers have managed to take 15 or more in their international cricketing careers. Chaminda Vaas, a former Sri Lankan cricketer and current fast bowling coach of the Sri Lankan team, has a total of 16 five-wicket hauls to his name, with twelve in Tests and four in One Day Internationals (ODIs). As a left-arm fast-medium bowler, he was accurate and particularly skilled in bowling both swing and reverse swing. Vaas often played a supporting role to Muttiah Muralitharan, Sri Lanka's off spinner and leading wicket taker. In the period from 1995 to their retirement from international cricket, the two bowlers accumulated 1,155 Test wickets and paved the way for many of Sri Lanka's victories.\nHaving made his Test debut in August 1994 against Pakistan, Vaas took his first five-wicket haul seven months later in March 1995 against New Zealand. He repeated the feat in New Zealand's second innings, taking a total of 10 wickets and led Sri Lanka to their first ever overseas Test win. His career-best bowling is the seven wickets he took against the West Indies for 71 runs in November 2001. He had taken another seven wickets in the first innings of the same match, bringing the total to 14 and making it the highest number of wickets he has taken in a single match. It is also the second-best bowling performance by a Sri Lankan bowler after Muralitharan's 16 wickets for 220 runs in 1998. Vaas is ranked third among Sri Lankan bowlers by the number of Test five-wicket hauls, behind spinners Muralitharan and Rangana Herath.\nVaas made his ODI debut in February 1994 against India, but was unable to get a five-wicket haul for several years. His first was in October 2000 against the same team, when he took five wickets for 14 runs as he and Muralitharan led the Sri Lankans to the biggest ODI victory at the time. In December 2001, Vaas recorded the best bowling figures in ODI history, taking eight wickets for 19 runs against Zimbabwe. This is also the only occasion where a bowler managed to take eight wickets in an ODI innings. In addition, the six wickets he took for 25 runs against Bangladesh during the 2003 Cricket World Cup are the best figures recorded by a Sri Lankan bowler in a World Cup match.\nVaas played his last ODI in August 2008 and his last Test match in July 2009. He also played six Twenty20 International matches but did not manage to get a five-wicket haul in the format. His total of 16 five-wicket hauls is the second highest for a Sri Lankan bowler, after Muralitharan's 77. During his international career, Vaas took 355 Test wickets and 400 ODI wickets, making him the most successful fast bowler in Sri Lankan cricket history."

As a 501(c)3 non-profit, they promote Sport Climbing which comprises three competition disciplines: bouldering, lead climbing, and speed climbing, in elite, youth and collegiate formats.\nUSA Climbing receives sanctioning and is recognized by the following organizations: the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC), the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC).\nCompetition history.\nBelow is a brief timeline of American competition climbing history:\nCompetition structure.\nElite.\nAny eligible climber aged 16 and older that meets the USAC qualification criteria may compete at Elite Nationals. There are no Regional or Divisional competitions for Elite competitors. The winners in each gender/event (Lead, Speed and Bouldering) at Elite Nationals are considered the National Champions of the United States. The only caveat is that a foreign national cannot be the National Champion of the US. If a foreign national wins any gender/event the next highest placed citizen of the US in that gender/event is the National Champion.\nYouth.\nYouth climbers are subdivided into 5 age groups: \nThe US is subdivided into 9 Divisions and 18 Regions. Anyone may compete in local competitions. USA Climbing members, who have attended at least two local competitions, may compete at their respective Regional Championships. The top 13 competitors in each gender/category at Regionals receive an invitation to compete at their respective Divisional Championships. The top 6 competitors in each gender/category at the Divisional Championships receive an invitation to compete at the National Championships. The top four climbers in each gender/category/event at the National Championships are considered to be the U.S. Youth National Team. Youth on the National Teams for Junior, A and B are eligible to compete at the Youth Pan American and Youth World Championships.\nCollegiate.\nProvides access for undergraduate or graduate students that are currently enrolled at a college or university to compete in bouldering, lead and speed climbing.\nAdaptive.\nAdaptive provides access for athletes with physical disabilities to compete in both bouldering and lead/top rope climbing.\nCategories included in Adaptive are open to those with physical disabilities: Neurological / Physical Disability, Visual Impairment, Upper Extremity Amputee, Lower Extremity, Amputee, Seated, Youth.\nElite bouldering.\nThe following are the results for bouldering at Elite National Championship level.\nElite lead.\nThe following are the results for lead at Elite National Championship level\nElite speed.\nStarting with the 2021 Speed National Championships, the US competition format was changed to match the IFSC speed climbing competition format. Prior to 2021, US Speed Climbing National Champions (and final ranking placements) were determined by the fastest climber to finish the speed route. As of 2021, US Speed National Champions were determined by the winners of the IFSC knockout format.\nCurrent US speed climbing records.\nBeginning in 2023 USA Climbing established the same criteria as Elite to officially recognize Speed climbing records for the Youth age group categories. One criteria is that an officially recognized electronic timing system must be used. Historically, youth records were kept for developmental purposes since no official standards were utilized. Official Youth speed climbing records can only be set at USAC Youth Qualifying Events, USAC Youth Regional Championships, USAC Youth Divisional Championships, USAC Youth National Championships, IFSC Youth Pan American Championships, and IFSC Youth World Championships, and other USAC or IFSC sanctioned events in which youth age groups are contested. No records are kept for youth age groups C and D since the speed climbing routes are different at every competition.\nHistory of the US speed climbing record.\nBeginning in 2019, USA Climbing established specific criteria for setting official National Records in the Elite Speed Climbing category. As such, the National Records below for the Elite category have been officially recognized by USA Climbing.\nElite team (current).\nThe athletes who represent the United States at International competition events in 2024.\nElite team (historical).\n2023 - The athletes who represented the United States at international competition events in 2023.\n2022 - The athletes who represented the United States at International competition events in 2022.\n2021 - The athletes who represented the United States at International competition events in 2021."

        "title": "Queensland Premier Cricket",
        "text": "Queensland Premier Cricket is the top cricket competition played in Queensland, Australia. The competition was founded under the name Brisbane Electoral Cricket in 1897 and eventually came to be known as Brisbane Grade Cricket, but has since expanded to take in teams from Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, and Ipswich. \nAs of the 2019/20 season there were six grades in the Two-Day Bulls Masters competition. In addition to the two-day Grade competition there is also a One-Day competition for the John McKnoulty Cup and a T20 competition for the Tom Veivers Trophy. There is also a women's One-Day competition for the Katherine Raymont Shield contested by eight sides as of the 2020/21 season, and a women's T20 competition under Queensland Premier Cricket.\nEasts-Redlands are the reigning First Grade premiers, and Gold Coast are the reigning premiers in both the One Day and T20 competitions.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1897 - 1915.\nThe 1894-95 Queensland senior cricket season resulted in great dissatisfaction among cricketers and the public due to poor management of fixtures because more prominent clubs would monopolise cricket grounds and not allow smaller clubs to play regularly throughout the season. As a result of this dissatisfaction in July 1895 a Queensland Cricket Association (Q.C.A.) meeting was held at which it was proposed that electorate cricket be established, which would mean disbanding the various clubs playing senior cricket in Queensland and replacing them with clubs organised by players residing within electorates. The proposal was greeted with enthusiasm, as club cricket was seen as old fashioned, with electorate cricket being a superior way of fostering rivalry and generating local interest in the sport, although an obstacle was securing cricket grounds in each electorate to accommodate a club. \nIn April 1897 the National Cricket Union held a committee to submit proposals for an electorate cricket competition to be established in Brisbane in collaboration with the Q.C.A. for the 1897-98 season. In May the Q.C.A. held a meeting to formally discuss an electorate competition and appoint a committee to determine electorate boundaries and residential qualifications, and after discussion the decision to form an electoral competition was carried unanimously. In July 1897 the Q.C.A. decided to amalgamate with the National Cricket Union and rescinded its constitution, by-laws, and other rules and regulations, drafting new ones in keeping with electoral cricket with amendments suggests by the National body, and began planning a campaign to form the electorate clubs. In August the National Cricket Union pulled out of the amalgamation at the last minute, however the Q.C.A. pushed on forming subcommittees for each electorate to pursue forming clubs.\nIn October 1897 the inaugural Brisbane electorate cricket season began with the following clubs competing: North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Toombul, Toowong, and Woolloongabba. Enoggera also formed a side but were unable to participate in the first season as they formed after fixtures had been scheduled, but the Queensland Cricket Association scheduled non-competition matches for the club to play. The season was regarded as disappointing, with the standard of cricket being poor and attendance being low, although a large amount of rain affected games was cited as a potential reason for low engagement.\nIn the 1898/99 season a Nundah club joined the competition and a Grammar School side began competing in the B Grade competition. Enoggera was unable to join the competition in 1898/99 but did finally compete in the 1899/1900 season, and in the 1900/01 season a Bundamba club joined the competition. By the 1901/02 season the Enoggera Club had become a general sports club and did not compete in the competition, and Nundah had merged with Toombul.\nIn 1913 the Queensland Cricket Association reconstituted the competition redrawing the electorate club boundaries to accommodate the following clubs: North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Woolloongabba, Toowong, Valley, Toombul, Nundah, and University. In 1915 the Q.C.A. suspended the competition due to the First World War, although in what would have been the 1916-17 season the Association secretary did schedule a handful of friendly matches between sides.\nRecent events.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the competition was suspended in 2020 however in September 2020 it became the first Australian state cricket competition to begin the 2020/21 season under Cricket Australia's \"Return to Play\" guidelines, which stipulated that the ball must be cleaned with a disinfectant wipe every forty minutes, that saliva could not be used to shine the ball, and that umpires could not hold bowlers hats during overs. In January 2021 Greater Brisbane entered a three-day lockdown due to the virus and accordingly the competition was suspended for one week and Queensland Cricket announced it would \"continue to monitor the situation closely.\"\nWomen's cricket: 1997 to present.\nThe Queensland Women's Premier Grade One-Day competition for the Katherine Raymont Shield was first held in the 1997/98 season. A women's second-grade One-Day competition for the Jodie Fields Shield was established in 2001/02 and a T20 competition was established in 2009/10. Clubs with women's first-grade sides competing as of 2017 were Western Suburbs, University of Queensland, Valley, Gold Coast, and Sandgate-Redcliffe.\nQueensland women's cricket has expanded in recent years with Ipswich-Logan joining the first-grade competition in 2018/19, Wynnum-Manly and Redlands joining with a combined side in 2019/20, Sunshine Coast joining in 2020/21, and South Brisbane aiming to field a women's side to join in the 2022/23 season as of 2021."

The South American team won five of the matches but lost both that were against the South Africa national team.\nThe touring party was composed almost entirely of players from the Argentina national rugby union team and included all but one of the players who had played for Argentina in a drawn series with Australia in 1979. The touring party numbered twenty-six players, of whom one came from Brazil, one from Chile, one from Uruguay and one from Paraguay. The other twenty-two players came from Argentina, including the captain, Hugo Porta. Porta was asked to return to South Africa later that year to play for the South African Barbarians against the touring 1980 British Lions.\nThe players were individually invited to play in this tour and against South Africa in two matches played later during the Springboks tour of South America.\nThe \"South America Jaguars\" was a \"ghost\" Argentine national team, not officially recognised by Argentine Rugby Union, to elude the Argentine government prohibition that since the early 1970s had forbid any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones due to the apartheid politics of the two African countries. This started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbid the national team from playing a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa. Later in 1973, after a controversial period, the government forbid any sport relationship with South Africa."

Romania won four of their six matches, lost one and drew the other. The draw came in the international match against Ireland, which the home team did not consider a full international match.

The group consisted of Argentina (the host of the tournament) as well as Italy, France and Hungary.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nItaly vs France.\nThe first game in Group 1 pitted Italy against France. Italy were favored to win but had been victims of plenty of dull and unexciting performances leading up, while a rejuvenated French team were making their first appearance since the 1966 world cup. The first goal came with under a minute as goalkeeper Bertrand-Demanes passed the ball to Didier Six who ran down the entire length of the pitch before delivering a good cross that Bernard Lacombe headed past Dino Zoff to score the first goal of the tournament. Italy controlled the rest of the match and equalized halfway through the first half when after the ball pinged around the area it glanced off the unsuspecting Paolo Rossi and into the goal. It would be the first of 9 goals Rossi would score at the finals. Shortly after the beginning of the second-half substitute Renato Zaccarelli's shot went in. The Italians saw out the rest of the match, which saw little chances except for Maxime Bossis's shot that flew just wide of Zoff's post. Despite it being an unremarkable match it featured the emergence of two teams that would dazzle the world four years later at the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nItaly vs Hungary.\nItaly once again had an uncertain start against Hungary in their second group game and appeared nervy early on, and Hungary had several good chances to score. But just after the half-hour mark Paolo Rossi made it two goals in two games by firing home after a shot had deflected into his path. Just a minute later Roberto Bettega took advantage of some poor defending to make it two goals in two minutes. Midway through the second half Romeo Benetti fired in a superb shot and Italy had the victory all but secure. It could have been so much more as the Italians hit the crossbar a total of three times in the game. Late on Hungary won a penalty kick, which was dispatched by substitute András Tóth but it was just consolation as Hungary were eliminated and Italy confirmed their spot in the second round.\nFrance vs Hungary.\nBoth teams arrived for the match with white shirts and France was forced to borrow green-striped shirts from local club Kimberley de Mar del Plata."

The South American team won six of their tour matches, suffering only a single defeat to the South Africa national side. The South American team's 21–12 victory over South Africa in the second international was a major shock and described by Rothmans Rugby Yearbook as \"a phenomenon of international rugby\".\nThe touring team comprised 42 players, including some from the Chile national rugby union team, Uruguay national rugby union team and Paraguay national rugby union team but the players who took part in the two international fixtures were drawn entirely from the Argentina national rugby union team and were described as \"effectively the Pumas\"."

He is 6'5\" and played the shooting guard and small forward positions.\nStewart grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and attended Parkway Center City High School. After graduation, he enrolled at Coppin State University to play for head coach Fang Mitchell. He was forced to sit out his freshman season, however, due to the NCAA's Proposition 48. When his collegiate career began as a sophomore in 1992–93, he exploded onto the scene in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC): Stewart led the Eagles to a 1993 MEAC tournament title, was named the MEAC Tournament Outstanding Performer and was also named the MEAC Rookie of the Year.\nThroughout his three-year career, Stewart accumulated 1,393 points and 546 rebounds. In his final two seasons he was a First Team All-MEAC performer, and as a senior in 1994–95 he scored 19 points in a first-round victory over Saint Joseph's in the 1995 NIT. This win was Coppin State's first ever in a postseason tournament.\nHe never played professionally, but has spent time as an assistant coach for various colleges. Stephen Stewart was also later inducted into the MEAC Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nStephen Stewart has two brothers who have played professional basketball. His older brother Larry was also a two-time MEAC Player of the Year; he then went on to play in the NBA as well as internationally. Stephen's younger brother, Lynard, played internationally."

In Russia the relay traveled from Moscow to Sochi through 2,900 towns and villages across all 83 federal subjects of Russia by foot, car, train, plane, and \"troika\" for over 65,000 km of journey. The event became the longest relay in Winter Olympics history.\nThe lighting ceremony was held on September 29, 2013, at Olympia, Greece with Greek alpine skier Ioannis Antoniou as the relay originating torchbearer. The first Russian torchbearer was NHL star Alex Ovechkin, who received the torch from Antoniou in Olympia.\nThe Torches.\nThe 2014 Olympic Torches were unveiled on January 14, 2013, in Moscow. The torch is chrome with red detail, a traditional colour of Russian sport. It was designed by a creative team led by Vladimir Pirozhkov and Andrei Vodyanik and weighs nearly , is tall, wide, and deep.\nThe torches failed on at least forty-four occasions during the relay, a failure rate of about 3 percent compared to the average 5 percent at the previous Olympics, and on one occasion, a nearby guard helped light the fire again with a lighter. The People's Front (a movement created and led by Vladimir Putin) has called for a criminal investigation into the manufacturer of the torches, a rocket/missile factory.\nSpecial relay.\nOn October 20, 2013, the torches reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker \"50 Let Pobedy\". On November 6, 2013, the torch was flown into space by Soyuz rocket and brought back on November 11. The torch reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and the depths of Siberia's Lake Baikal.\nRoute in Greece.\nSeptember 29 (day 1)\nSeptember 30 (day 2)\nOctober 1 (day 3)\nOctober 2 (day 4)\nOctober 3 (day 5)\nOctober 4 (day 6)\nProtests.\nGay activist Pavel Lebedev (not to be confused with a Russian retired figure skater Pavel Lebedev) was arrested at the relay in Voronezh for unveiling a rainbow flag. When interviewed he said \"hosting the games here contradicts the basic principles of the Olympics, which is to cultivate tolerance\"."

        "text": "There have been eight Minor leagues teams that have represented the city of Americus, Georgia. Since classification of the minors began, seven of them have been labeled as class D loops and one played in an independent league.\nHistory.\nAmericus Pallbearers.\nThe Americus Pallbearers became a founding member of the original Georgia State League in 1906. The Pallbearers finished dead-last in the six-team league, with a record of 13–32, a full 22 games behind the first place Waycross Machinists. The league folded at the end of the season, and Americus was without a professional team in 1907.\nAmericus Muckalees.\nThe Americus Muckalees were members of the Empire State League in 1913 and continued playing from 1914 to 1915 when the six-team circuit was renamed the Georgia State League.\nIn 1913, the Muckalees ended in fourth place with a 45–54 record, games behind first place Valdosta Millionaires. Then, in 1914 the Americus team became the first champion team in Georgia State League history.\nBut the resurgence of the league did not even last two years. The circuit started 1915 as the Georgia State League and was renamed the Florida–Alabama–Georgia League (FLAG League), which operated in Florida, on June 15. The Americus Muckalees (11–18) then were forced to move to Florida and changed its name to Gainesville Sharks (18–24), ending fifth with a combined 29–42 record, 16 games out of the first place spot.\nAmericus Cardinals.\nThe Americus Cardinals operated in the Georgia–Florida League from 1935 through 1938. During that span, Americus had affiliation agreements with the St. Louis Cardinals (1936), Brooklyn Dodgers (1937) and Washington Senators (1938).\nThe team had records of 59–57 in 1935 (3rd place), 58–58 in 1936 (3rd), 50–71 in 1937 (6th), and 65–61 in 1938 (3rd), reaching the postseason in 1938, but lost in the first round of the playoffs.\nAmericus Pioneers.\nIn 1939, the Cardinals changed its name to the Americus Pioneers and continued to operate in the Georgia–Florida League until 1942, first as a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate (1939–1940) and then with the Chicago Cubs (1942).\nThis time the team suffered four losing seasons, going 63–76 in 1939 (7th place), 67–72 in 1940 (5th), 56–81 in 1941 (6th) and 49–77 in 1942 (7th).\nAmericus Phillies.\nAfter a long absence, in 1946 the franchise returned to the Georgia–Florida League as the Americus Phillies, playing there uninterrupted until the 1950 season as a Philadelphia Phillies affiliated team.\nIn its first season, Americus won the title in the eight-team league after sporting an 87–37 record, having games of advantage over second place Moultrie Packers. The team won the first round of the playoffs, but lost the final series to Moultrie.\nAmericus declined the next two years, ending with records of 65–74 in 1947 (6th place) and 50–89 in 1948 (8th). Then, they went 71–67 in 1948 (4th) and 70–67 in 1950 (4th). Both times they reached the postseason, losing in the first round and the league finals, respectively.\nAmericus Rebels.\nIn 1951, the Phillies were replaced by the Americus Rebels, though the team lasted only one year in the GFL. Americus finished sixth with a 55–70 mark, games out of contention.\nAmericus-Cordele Orioles.\nThe franchise returned to the league in 1954, this time as the Americus-Cordele Orioles affiliated team of the Baltimore Orioles. Americus finished last of the eight teams with a 51–88 mark and games out from first place.\nAmericus Arrows.\nAmericus also was represented in the independent Southeastern League during its 2002 season. Playing as the Americus Arrows, the team were 10–17 before folding on July 15.\nSince then, no other team based in Americus has participated in professional baseball."

        "title": "City Park Golf Courses (New Orleans)",
        "text": "The City Park Golf Courses consist of two 18-hole golf courses located in City Park, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The two courses named the South Course and North Course also include a driving range, ancillary short-game facility and two clubhouses.\nHistory.\nThe original City Park golf course consisted of one course and 9 holes and was built in 1902. It was redesigned and expanded to 18-holes in 1921 and expanded again to 27-holes in 1922. This became known as South Course or Number 2 Course.\nIn 1933, federal money from the Emergency Relief Administration (ERA), a precursor of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), was used to design a golf course between Harrison Avenue and the railroad tracks. This was called the East Course or Number 1 Course and was designed by William Wiedorn, a landscape architect, and city planner. The New Orleans Item Newspaper on January 14, 1935, also gives credit to Joe Bartholomew for designing the new course. The course was built during 1934 and formally opened on January 13, 1935. The length of the course at the opening was given as 6445 yards. The Crescent City Open (1938) and New Orleans Open (1939-1962) used this course thirteen different times for the tournament.\nThe St. John Golf Club located in City Park had used the second floor of the City Park Casino building as its original clubhouse, but in 1938 a second golf club building was built near Zachary Taylor Drive and Bayou St. John. It was formally dedicated in October 1940. The St. John Golf Club has the distinction of being the oldest private club playing on a public course in the county, and it was the first golf club at City Park.\nThe West Course was opened in 1957. For a short while, parts of the East and West courses were combined into the Number 3 Course. The Number 3 Course was created because of plans for I-610, and also due to the requests from some players who wanted a tougher course.\nIn 1967, a new clubhouse on Filmore Avenue was built for the East, West and future North course. A new North Course was opened in 1968 and gave the City Park Golf Course complex a total of four courses. It was planned by a committee which included William Wiedorn and Joseph Bartholemew. The North Course area required extensive fill since it was located on low-lying land. Although it would cost more to develop the North Course, it was paid for by the Federal Government and the Louisiana State Highway Department as a result of the planned I-610 bypass that would eventually run through City Park alongside the railroad tracks. There were lengthy negotiations between City Park and the State Highway Department, which concluded with a check of $1,240,000 being presented to City Park in February 1966. The federal government paid 90% of the cost with the state paying 10%.\nPrior to the north course being completed, a new clubhouse was built in 1967 on Filmore Avenue for the East, West and North Courses. The first clubhouse was built near the statue of PGT Beauregard on Wisner Avenue and then moved to Zachary Taylor Avenue before moving to the Filmore Avenue location. A double-decked driving range is located next to the clubhouse.\nAt different times, the four courses were officially and unofficially named differently:&lt;br&gt;South Course: Number 2 Course, Public golf course at City Park or Little course&lt;br&gt;East Course: Number 1 Course or Wisner Course&lt;br&gt;West Course: Championship Course&lt;br&gt;North Course: Lakeside Course\nDuring the 1990s the names of the four courses were officially changed, and the entire City Park Golf Course complex was renamed Bayou Oaks Golf Complex. However, many patrons still referred to the courses as South, East, West, and North.\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the golf complex. In 2009, the north course was rebuilt and the driving range reopened. In 2011 it was decided that when complete, City Park's new golf complex, which consists of the Championship Course and North Course, will include two, eighteen-hole golf courses, a comprehensive practice area, including the practice driving range, ancillary short-game facility and clubhouse to be located on the South Course. In November 2012, City Park announced an agreement with the Bayou District Foundation to manage and run the golf complex.\nIn February 2015, ground was broken on the Rees Jones, Inc. and Torre Design Consortium designed 250-acre plot Championship Course using the footprint of the former East and West Courses. The course is bound by Filmore Ave., Harrison Ave., Marconi Dr. and Wisner Blvd. and Duininck Golf Inc., was awarded the contract to build the $13.2 million course. The par 72 Championship Course will play 7,305 yards in length and will include a new clubhouse for the course.\nHowever, the construction of the new golf course post-Katrina has not been without controversy. In the wake of the construction of a fence surrounding the 250-acre construction site, a citizen's group called the City Park for Everyone Coalition was formed to protest developing the area into a golf course."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2013 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2013 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for the second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn February 21, 2013, CoSIDA and \"Capital One\" announced the 2013 Academic All-America team, with Aaron Craft headlining the University Division as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year. The following is the 2012–13 \"Capital One\" Academic All-America Men's Basketball Team (University Division) as selected by CoSIDA:\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are called Senior All-Americans. The 10 honorees are as follows: Jordan Hulls won the Senior CLASS Award."

        "text": "The 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup Final was a cricket match between the West Indies and Australia played on 17 February 2013 at the Brabourne Stadium in India. It was the culmination of the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, the tenth Women's Cricket World Cup.\nAustralia batted first, making a total of 259 runs for 7 wickets. In response, the West Indies were bowled out for 145, resulting in an Australian victory by 114 runs and securing Australia's sixth World Cup victory.\nRoute to the final.\nAustralia were drawn in Group B along with Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. In their first match, Australia defeated Pakistan by 91 runs, before winning their second match by three wickets (with 26 balls to spare) against South Africa. The final group match saw Australia beat New Zealand by seven wicket, and see them qualify for the Super Six section of the tournament. A narrow two-run victory over England was followed by a nine-wicket win against Sri Lanka and an eight-run defeat by the West Indies.\nThe West Indies were drawn in Group A along with India, England and Sri Lanka. Despite losing to India and England, they finished in third place in the group and qualified for the Super Six section, where they won all three of their games, against South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, to qualify for the final.\nFinal.\nAustralian innings.\nAustralia won the toss and chose to bat first. Openers Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes put on 52 for the first wicket, and Haynes went on to share a stand of 64 with Jess Cameron before being caught off the bowling of Shanel Daley for 52. Jess Cameron then accelerated the scoring, making 75 from 76 balls before also falling to Daley. The West Indies then took further wickets until at 209/7 with fewer than 7 overs left, Australia appeared to have lost their momentum. However Jodie Fields and Ellyse Perry hit 50 more runs off the remaining balls, leaving Australia with a final score of 259/7.\nWest Indies innings.\nThe West Indian innings never really got going; openers Kycia Knight and Natasha McLean scored 32 before both being dismissed by Perry, and West Indies quickly found themselves struggling at 57/3, with Kyshona Knight also having retired hurt. Despite contributions from their middle order to reach 109/4, they then lost their next four wickets for five runs and were eventually dismissed for 145, giving Australia a victory by 114 runs.\nAnalysis and reaction.\nMost commentators saw Ellyse Perry as the match-winner. Apart from her fast 25 runs in the Australian innings, she then \"wrecked West Indies' chase\" with her spell of 3/19. Despite the margin of victory, it was pointed out that the result was not unexpected; as ESPN reported \"it was no surprise and indeed no shame for West Indies to be outclassed by a team that lost just one of seven games, that too, by eight runs.\" The West Indies had beaten Australia in the Super Six group stage, but were outclassed in the final; the BBC said that \"Australia were too clinical for a West Indies side that were sloppy in the field, wayward with the ball and unable to keep up with the run chase.\"\nScorecard.\nWest Indies innings.\nKey"

This is the second most successful Canadian performance ever, exceeded only by the achievements at the home Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. With the belated luge medal awarded in 2017 after a Russian doping disqualification, Canada briefly tied its Vancouver performance in total medal count. However, the IOC decision was overturned on appeal, bumping the Canadian team back to fourth and the total medal count back to 2nd and 3rd.\nHistory.\nOn Day 1 of the Games, three athletes won the nation's first medals.

It was the fifth time three siblings have competed at the same event at the Winter Games.\nOn February 10, Alexandre Bilodeau became the first freestyle skiing gold medalist to defend his Olympic title, and first repeat gold medalist, winning the men's moguls. He became the first Canadian to defend their Olympic gold since Catriona Le May Doan repeated her gold at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.

        "title": "Finland at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Finland competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia from 7 to 23 February 2014. The Finnish team consisted of 103 competitors who participated in alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, ski jumping, snowboarding, and speed skating.\nPreparations by the Finnish Olympic Committee.\nFinancial coaching support.\nThe Finnish Olympic Committee launched its Sochi 2014 coaching program in June 2010, distributing financial support in winter sports to member federations and top level athletes directly.\nBan on rainbow nails.\nIn August 2013, \"Helsingin Sanomat\" quoted the President of the Board of the Finnish Olympic Committee Risto Nieminen, that it is forbidding its athletes the rainbow-patterned fingernails in the upcoming games, ruling it political abuse of the Olympic Charter. The issue was raised after high-jumper Emma Green Tregaro displayed her rainbow nails and the Finnish Minister of Culture and Sport Paavo Arhinmäki waved the rainbow flag in the Moscow 2013 World Championships in Athletics in support of LGBT rights in Russia. Arhinmäki responded, that the Olympic movement should defend, not limit, the freedom of speech, and the Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade of Finland Alexander Stubb commented that the issue is about human rights, not politics, both bringing up the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute as one of the finest moments in Olympic history. The Committee followed up, that they were simply quoting the Charter, which bans political abuse, and themselves couldn't allow or disallow the nails.\nAthlete prize bonuses.\nThe Finnish Olympic Committee offers prize bonuses for medalists: €30,000 for gold, €15,000 for silver and €10,000 for bronze, where in team events the price has to be divided between athletes, with a cap of €60,000 per athlete. The exception is for an ice hockey medal where the bonus is €60,000 for gold, €40,000 for silver and €30,000 for bronze.\nBudget.\nThe cost of the games for the Finnish Olympic Committee is 1.2 million euros. About half of it, food and accommodation expenses, will be subsidised by the International Olympic Committee.\nFinnish Olympic team.\nThe Finnish Olympic team in Sochi consists of 226 people, of which 16 are the team's general leadership, 103 athletes, and 107 other staff members, such as coaches, masseurs, physiotherapists and physicians.\nAthlete selection method.\nAthletes to the Olympic team are picked by the Elite Sports Unit of the Finnish Olympic Committee based on presentations by the national sports federations. The Unit is led by Mika Kojonkoski. It revised the selection from earlier games by creating a continuous method, where athletes are added as they display to fulfill requirements. The athletes are required to\nbased on their results in the current and previous season. The Committee considered the bar raised from the preceding games.\nSchedule for selection publication:\nAppearance records.\nFor Janne Ahonen and Teemu Selänne, 2014 will be their sixth Olympic games, tying them for the most Olympic appearances for Finns with Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi, Harri Kirvesniemi and Raimo Helminen. Selänne will be alongside Helminen the only ice hockey player with six appearances, Selänne already being the all-time Olympic point-leader.\nSports without participation by Finland.\nFinland will not compete in bobsleigh, curling, figure skating, luge, short track speed skating and skeleton.\nFor figure skating Finland has the 2nd stand-by entry for ladies' singles, 4th for ice dancing and 7th for men's singles. The entries may not be transferred after 27 January 2014. Finland failed to qualify the curling team at the Olympic qualification event.\nMedal count predictions and expectations.\nThe Finnish Olympic Committee set no official medal target.\nAn article published by International Associations of Sports Economists / North American Association of Sports Economists in 2011, using such parameters as population, political regime, snow coverage and winter sports facilities, predicted Finland to win 5 medals.\nIn a poll ordered by MTV3, a majority from a sample of 1,700 Finns in December 2013 expected Finland to win 2–4 medals, having best chances in snowboarding.\nInfostrada Sports predicts that Finland will win one gold and five bronzes, broken down:\nAssociated Press projected Finland to win two silvers and three bronzes, broken down:\n\"Ilta-Sanomat\" expected certain Finnish medals as a top two finish in women's team sprint, a silver in women's 4 × 5 kilometre relay, a medal in women's ice hockey and possibly multiple medals for Kaisa Mäkäräinen.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, using regression analysis with such variables as gross domestic product and climate to estimate medal shares, predicted Finland to win 6 medals.\nAlpine skiing.\nFinland has qualified a total quota of four athletes by the International Ski Federation (FIS), based on qualification points awarded in races within the FIS Calendar during the period of July 2012–19 January 2014. National quotas per each Olympic event were allocated according to points awarded in these competitions. Andreas Romar was initially selected to the Finnish Olympic team, but declared absent on January 10, 2014, following his heel fracture.\nBiathlon.\nFinland has qualified a total quota of four athletes by the International Biathlon Union (IBU), based on Nation Cup points won in 2012 and 2013 Biathlon World Championships during the qualification period of 16 November 2012 – 19 January 2014. There were no event-specific requirements.\nCross-country skiing.\nFinland has awarded a total quota of seventeen athletes by International Ski Federation (FIS), based on qualification points awarded in races within the FIS Calendar during the period of July 2012–19 January 2014. National quotas per each Olympic event were allocated according to points awarded in these competitions.\nFreestyle skiing.\nFinland has awarded a total quota of 9 athletes (all in men's events) by the International Ski Federation (FIS), based on competitions in the International FIS Calendar during the qualification period of July 2012–19 January 2014. National quotas per each Olympic event were allocated according to points awarded in these competitions. On January 31, 2014, a fourth slopestyle spot was allocated to the team after a scheduling and calculation adjustment.\nIce hockey.\nFinland is defending the men's and women's bronze medals won in the previous games.\nMen's tournament.\nGoverning body of the Olympic ice hockey is the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Top 9 teams in the men's IIHF World Ranking of 2012 qualified directly to the games, Finland ranking 2nd.\nThe following players are in the reserve, in case of injuries before the games begin:\nSaku Koivu refused a spot in the team due to a concussion suffered in November 2013.\nFinland will play in Group B. All times are local (UTC+4).\nTeemu Selänne, at age 43 years and 234 days, became the oldest ice hockey player to win an Olympic medal. He also holds the Olympic record for total ice hockey points, upping it to 43. He also shares the record for most appearances in ice hockey at the Olympics, appearing in 6.\nWomen's tournament.\nTop 6 teams in the women's IIHF World Ranking of 2012 qualified directly to the games, Finland ranking 3rd.\nFinland will play in Group A. All times are local (UTC+4).\nNordic combined.\nFinland has awarded a total quota of 4 athletes and a spot in the team relay, based on points achieved in the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup and secondarily in the FIS Nordic Combined Continental Cup during the qualification period of July 2012–19 January 2014.\nSki jumping.\nFinland has qualified a total quota of six athletes (five men and one woman) by the International Ski Federation (FIS), based on their performances at the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and secondarily on the Continental Cup results during the qualification period of July 2012–19 January 2014.\nSnowboarding.\nFinland has awarded a total quota of 13 spots (10 in men's events and 3 in women's) by the International Ski Federation (FIS) based on competitions in the International FIS Calendar during the period of July 2012–9 January 2014. On 31 January 2014, slopestyle snowboarder Petja Piiroinen was originally selected to the Finnish Olympic team, but was relegated into a reserve after a scheduling adjustment.\nSpeed skating.\nFinland has awarded four spots (all in the men's events, while the nation has the first priority for a reserve spot in the women's) based on their performance at the 2013–14 ISU Speed Skating World Cup.\nMiscellaneous.\nSport psychologist.\nIn order to improve mental training in the team, the Finnish Olympic Committee recruited a sport psychologist, Hannaleena Ronkainen. This was a part of a long-term coaching program launched in 2013 with a target to reach its fullest by 2016. Mental trainer and sprinter Hanna-Maari Latvala expressed scepticism at the haste in which the project was launched, and the capability of a single psychologist to service a team of one hundred representing various sports. The women's ice hockey team have a dedicated psychologist, Sari Honkanen.\nLimited accreditations.\nThe staff accreditations in an Olympic team were limited by a quota based on the number of athletes, and the Finnish Olympic Committee could not send as many coaches as they wished. Some personal coaches left out, who without an accreditation would have had to attend as spectators with little personal contact with their athletes, preferred to remain in Finland and rely on telephone communications. A vocal critic was Ari Saukko, the personal coach of Janne Ahonen, who was denied accreditation by the committee, and after public complaints was offered an unsatisfactory alternative trip arrangement, which he would have had to pay for in his own expense.\nPolitical boycotts by Finns.\nMinister of Culture and Sport of Finland Paavo Arhinmäki decided not to participate the opening ceremony, citing human rights violations and environmental issues, but planned to visit some of the events, and objected to an athletes' boycott. President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen will attend the opening ceremony. The Left Youth had earlier called for a boycott on the games on behalf of Niinistö, Katainen and Arhinmäki. Minister for Foreign Affairs Erkki Tuomioja opposed boycotts and wished the games to be held separate from politics. However, Jari Porttila reported, that only Niinistö had been invited to the opening ceremony, and Arhinmäki had received a reservation merely for the final days of the games."

        "title": "Slovenia at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Slovenia competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from 7 to 23 February 2014. Sixty-six competitors were chosen to participate, in eight sports. For the first time since the country's independence, the Slovenia men's national ice hockey team qualified for the Olympic tournament (although previously, Yugoslavia's teams at the Olympics consisted mostly of Slovenian players).\nOn 12 February, Tina Maze won the women's downhill, becoming the first ever Winter Olympic gold medalist for Slovenia. Maze's skiing time was identical to that of Dominique Gisin of Switzerland, so two gold medals were awarded, this being the first time that an Olympic gold medal in alpine skiing was shared. Maze went on to win a second gold in giant slalom. Peter Prevc and Žan Košir each won one silver and one bronze medal in ski jumping and snowboarding, respectively. Vesna Fabjan won bronze in the women's cross-country sprint and Teja Gregorin another bronze in the women's biathlon pursuit, bringing the total number of medals to 8.\nEight medals is an all-time Olympic record for Slovenia. In fact, Slovenia won more medals in Sochi than at all previous Winter Olympics combined.\nSummary.\nOn 21 January 2014, the Olympic Committee of Slovenia officially confirmed 66 competitors who would represent the country at the Sochi Winter Olympics. Following the national ice hockey team securing a place at the Olympic tournament by winning the group at the qualification tournament, Sochi saw the largest Slovenian delegation at Winter Olympics to date. Tomaž Razingar, the captain of the ice hockey team, was chosen as the flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Slovenia sent competitors in 8 sports, apart from ice hockey also in alpine skiing, biathlon, freestyle skiing, snowboarding, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and cross-country skiing.\nPre-games favourites included alpine skier Tina Maze, a double silver medallist from Vancouver, who won the 2013 Alpine Skiing World Cup with a huge margin and victories in all five disciplines in a single season, biathlete Jakov Fak, bronze medallist from Vancouver where he represented Croatia, snowboarder Rok Marguč, the 2013 World Champion in parallel slalom, and the Slovenian ski jumping team, together with Peter Prevc (2nd in the World Cup standings prior to the Olympics) at both individual events. Petra Majdič, who won bronze in Vancouver in cross-country skiing, concluded her competitive career in 2011 and came to Sochi as the leader of Slovenian delegation.\nThe first days of the Olympics saw several injuries in the Slovenian team. Alpine skier Rok Perko fell at the downhill training and broke his nose, consequently he did not appear in neither the downhill nor the super-G races. Snowboarder Cilka Sadar suffered a knee injury at halfpipe training which also caused her withdrawal from the competition. Matija Mihič, who qualified for snowboard cross, suffered a knee injury before coming to Sochi and did not travel to Russia. Ski jumper Robert Kranjec fell at the qualifications of the normal hill event. He had to skip the normal hill event but managed to compete at the large hill and at the team event.\nAlpine skiing turned out to be the most successful sport for Slovenia in Sochi. Following a 4th place in combined, Tina Maze won the gold medal in downhill on 12 February, tying with Dominique Gisin of Switzerland. Maze then finished 5th in super-G and won her second gold medal in giant slalom. In slalom, Maze finished on the 8th place and concluded the Olympics as best individual skier in Sochi. Other Slovenian skiers were moderately successful, with Maruša Ferk and Ilka Štuhec finishing 10th in combined and downhill, respectively. Among the men, the best result was 11th place of Mitja Valenčič in slalom.\nIn biathlon, Jakov Fak was defending his bronze medal from Vancouver but finished 10th in sprint. Following less successful performances in pursuit and individual events, Fak finished 4th in mass start. Teja Gregorin won a bronze medal in pursuit, improving the 15th place from the sprint event. This was also first medal in biathlon for Slovenia, since Jakov Fak's bronze from Vancouver was won for Croatia. Gregorin then finished 11th in individual event and 5th in mass start. The latter result was later improved to a 4th place, following the disqualification of Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle of Germany. Slovenia did not compete in the mixed relay since Andreja Mali failed to qualify for the Olympics individually. In the men's relay, Slovenia recorded another successful result, finishing 6th.\nCross-country skiing saw only female participants compete for Slovenia. Vesna Fabjan and Katja Višnar made it to semi-finals in sprint. Višnar placed 5th in her group and finished 9th overall while Fabjan finished 2nd in her group and advanced to the finals. There, she won a bronze medal, thus succeeding Majdič on the podium in this discipline. The women's relay team finished in 11th place, and Višnar and Alenka Čebašek finished the team sprint as 10th.\nFilip Flisar was the sole representative of Slovenia in freestyle skiing. He won his round of 16 and quarterfinals groups but then fell in the semifinals. In the small final, Flisar finished on the 2nd place, thus finishing 6th overall and improving his achievement from Vancouver, where he was 8th. After the race, the Slovenian and Canadian teams filed a complaint to FIS, pointing out presumed irregularities in the equipment of French competitors. The complaint was rejected as it was filed too late.\nAt the ice hockey tournament, the Slovenian team was considered an underdog. Slovenia qualified for Olympics for the first time since independence, by beating Belarus, Denmark and Ukraine at the qualification tournament (however, the Yugoslavian teams that competed at the Olympics five times consisted mostly of Slovenian players). Slovenia played in the Group A. In the first game, Slovenia played against the host nation, Russia. After two quick Russian goals at the beginning of the game, Žiga Jeglič scored twice in the second third. Russia won 5–2, but the Slovenian team received a very positive feedback for their Olympic debut. In the following game, Slovenia defeated Slovakia 3–1; goal scorers for Slovenia were Rok Tičar, Tomaž Razingar and Anže Kopitar. In the last group match, Slovenia lost to United States 5–1, Marcel Rodman scored a goal for Slovenia in the last minute of the match. The victory against Slovakia assured Slovenia 3rd place in Group A and 8th place in playoff standings. In the qualification playoffs, Slovenia defeated Austria 4–0. Goal scorers were Kopitar, Jan Urbas, Sabahudin Kovačevič and Jan Muršak. Robert Kristan was commended for his defences as the goalie. In the quarterfinals, Slovenia lost 0–5 to Sweden and finished 7th in the overall standings. Despite this defeat, the 2014 Olympic tournament saw the best performance of the Slovenian team in history. Foreign commentators praised the achievements of the team coming from a country with 150 professional players, seven skating rinks and one NHL star player (Kopitar of Los Angeles Kings).\nIn Nordic combined, Slovenia's best result was a 16th place of Marjan Jelenko at large hill/10 km event. Since Slovenia qualified only three competitors, they did not participate in the team competition.\nSki jumping was the next sport where the stakes were high for Slovenia. Peter Prevc came to Sochi as 2nd-ranked in the World Cup standings and Slovenia won both team events of the season. Following his fall in the qualifications for the normal hill event, Robert Kranjec missed the competition. Prevc was third after the first round and gained another place in the finals, winning a silver medal and finishing just after Kamil Stoch of Poland. This was the first medal for Slovenia in Sochi and the first individual Olympic medal in ski jumping for independent Slovenia (in Salt Lake City, Slovenia finished 3rd in the team event). In addition to Prevc's medal, Jernej Damjan finished 9th and Jurij Tepeš 26th. At the large hill, Kranjec returned but failed to reach the final round. Prevc was fourth after the first round and again gained one place in the finals, winning his second Olympic medal, a bronze. At the team large hill event, Slovenian team finished on the 5th place after excellent performance by Prevc (who set best results in both series) and somehow weaker jumps by Kranjec, Damjan and Tepeš. In the inaugural women's normal hill event, Maja Vtič finished 6th after a weaker landing in the first series. Katja Požun finished 11th.\nIn snowboarding, Slovenia was represented by three competitors in freestyle and five in alpine disciplines. Cilka Sadar could not start in slopestyle because of an injury at a training. In halfpipe, the best result was achieved by Tim-Kevin Ravnjak, who finished 8th in the final round. Since the introduction of parallel disciplines to the Olympics, Slovenia always had at least one competitor in quarterfinals but never higher. In parallel giant slalom, Žan Košir, Rok Flander and Rok Marguč secured places in the quarterfinals. Only Košir advanced to the semifinals, where he lost to Nevin Galmarini of Switzerland. In the third place race, Košir defeated Patrick Bussler of Germany, thus winning bronze, the first medal for Slovenian snowboarders. In parallel slalom, Košir made it to the finals, where he won his second Olympic medal, a silver, coming second to Vic Wild of Russia.\nKošir's silver medal was the final medal for Slovenia at the Sochi Olympics. Following this win, Košir was chosen as the flag bearer for Slovenia at the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nSlovenia's team consisted of eight athletes. Only seven competed as skier Rok Perko was injured during training and could not compete.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their performance at the 2012 and 2013 Biathlon World Championships, Slovenia qualified 5 men and 1 woman.\nIce hockey.\nSlovenia qualified a men's team by winning the qualification tournament, this was the first time the nation qualified an ice hockey team to the Olympics.\nSki jumping.\nSlovenia qualified nine quota places in ski jumping.\nSnowboarding.\nSlovenia qualified a total of nine athletes for the following events. Matija Mihič qualified for snowboard cross but had to stay at home because of knee injury."

        "title": "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1992)",
        "text": "Tony LaShae Mitchell Jr. (born April 7, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the New Taipei Kings of the P. League+. He competed in college for North Texas. Mitchell is , weighs 235 pounds and plays the forward position. Mitchell was selected in the 2013 NBA draft in the second round (37th overall).\nHigh school career.\nMitchell played three years of prep basketball. For his career, he posted over 1,500 points and 700 rebounds. As a senior at L. G. Pinkston High School he averaged 20.5 points, 13.2 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 4.1 blocks per game while leading his school to a 26–10 record and a berth in the Class 4A Region II Tournament. In one playoff game against Lincoln High School he recorded 25 points, 20 rebounds and five blocks in an overtime win. Mitchell was ranked as the #12 overall senior recruit in the class of 2010 by Rivals.com. His accolades also included being named the 2010 \"Dallas Morning News\" Player of the Year – beating out Perry Jones III, a future first round NBA Draft pick out of Baylor; a \"SLAM Magazine\" All-American; Texas' 12-4A Player of the Year; Texas Class 4A All-State selection; and being chosen to the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches All-Star Team.\nNCAA eligibility issues.\nMitchell attended a public high school in Atlanta (Dutchtown High School) for his freshman year then in Dallas sophomore years, but under the advice of his Amateur Athletic Union basketball coach he transferred to Center of Life Christian Academy (CLCA) in Miami. What he did not realize until the latter portion of his junior year there, however, was that CLCA was not an accredited prep school, and therefore only a fraction of his coursework counted toward NCAA eligibility. Mitchell transferred back home to Pinkston to finish his prep career. To make up for lost time at CLCA, he attempted to take make-up classes at a faster rate than the school district allowed. After an investigation into his course load, and upon discovering Mitchell's attempted expedition of his graduation requirements, his transcript got invalidated and his high school graduation was postponed while he struggled with Texas' exit test.\nMitchell had already committed to play for the Missouri Tigers while these issues unfolded. Forced to stay at home in Dallas for the entire first semester of what would have been his freshman year playing for Missouri, it was not until the start of the second semester when he found out that he would never be allowed to suit up for the Tigers. Mitchell then had to choose one of two routes: either play junior college basketball for two seasons, or play for a different four-year institution as a partial qualifier. He chose to play as a partial qualifier for North Texas, the local Division I school whose coach, Johnny Jones, had aggressively recruited him during his high school years.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season.\nAfter sitting out the 2010–11 season due to his eligibility issues, Mitchell officially began his collegiate career as a redshirt freshman in 2011–12. He quickly established himself as a premier player in both the Sun Belt Conference as well as nationally; Mitchell was named by CBS Sports as one of the \"top 10 freshmen in the country\" and their third-best \"under the radar\" player after averaging 14.7 points and 10.3 rebounds per game. Along with Kentucky's Anthony Davis, he was one of only two freshmen in NCAA Division I to average a double-double (Davis was also that season's national player of the year and the first overall draft pick in the ensuing NBA draft). Among freshmen, only Davis' 10.4 rebounds per game average exceeded Mitchell's. He set school records for single season blocks (70) and blocks per game (3.04), while his single game top scoring and rebounding performances were 34 and 21, respectively. Despite the team not qualifying for any postseason tournaments, Mitchell still received awards and honors for his personal play. He became just the second player in league history to earn three consecutive Sun Belt Player of the Week awards while also becoming just the third player to be named the league's freshman of the year and earn a first team all-conference selection simultaneously. Mitchell was named to the All-2012 Sun Belt Conference tournament team after leading the Mean Green to the championship game before losing to Western Kentucky, 74 to 70. According to his North Texas player page, \"In league-only games, Mitchell led the Sun Belt in scoring (15.9 ppg), rebounding (11.8 rpg), 3-point percentage (47.1), blocks (3.1 bpg), and was also second in field goal percentage (58.1).\" Mitchell had numerous 30-point, 15-rebound games during the season and became the first freshman since Kansas State's Michael Beasley in 2007–08 to record multiple 30/15 games. For his standout season, he was named a finalist for the Lou Henson Award, an annual college basketball award given to the nation's best mid-major player.\nSophomore season.\nHeading into his sophomore season in 2012–13, national media had their eyes on Mitchell as a potential All-American. He had been a projected first round draft pick in the 2012 NBA draft following his freshman season, but opted to remain at North Texas because he said he \"still needed to mature on and off the court.\" Some of the preseason watchlists and honors that Mitchell received included being an All-American according to numerous media outlets; a John Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 player; being featured on the October cover of \"Basketball Times\"; Lindy's number two ranked center in college basketball; and CBS Sports' number seven overall player in the country. He was listed as a \"near guarantee\" to be named the 2013 Sun Belt Player of the Year according to CBS Sports. An anonymous Sun Belt coach said of Mitchell: \"[He] is the most athletic guy in college basketball, bar none. Rebounds as good as anyone. He's a freak.\"\nMitchell's per-game averages lowered in four of the five major statistical categories from his freshman season: 13.0 points (down from 14.7), 8.5 rebounds (down from 10.3), 0.8 assists (down from 1.6), and 2.7 blocks (down from 3.0). Only his steals per game average increased, going from 0.9 as a freshman to 1.0 in his second year. Additionally, the North Texas squad managed just a 12–20 overall record (7–13 in conference) after being selected as the preseason Sun Belt Conference champions. Midway through the season, Bleacher Report wrote an article which questioned Mitchell's ability to lead a team, noting that a player of his caliber should have been a bigger factor in games played in a mid-major conference. The article also said that his All-American candidacy took a severe blow, and that his per game averages would be more impressive if he played for a stronger Division I program.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Pistons (2013–2014).\nWith a college postseason invitation not occurring, Mitchell decided to be the first underclassman to declare for the 2013 NBA draft. He was the first North Texas player to be drafted in the NBA since the Dallas Mavericks drafted John Horrocks in 1984. Mitchell was drafted by the Detroit Pistons with the 37th overall pick in the draft. He was also the highest North Texas player to be drafted in the NBA, ahead of Kenneth Lyons in 1983 (47th overall). On July 19, 2013, he signed with the Pistons. When the 2013 rookie class convened for its annual photo shoot and filled out its NBA.com Rookie Survey, the class voted Mitchell as the most athletic.\nOn December 26, 2013, Mitchell was assigned to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. On January 13, 2014, he was recalled by the Pistons. On January 31, 2014, he was reassigned to the Mad Ants. He was later recalled in February 2014. While not making an appearance for the Pistons in the 2014–15 season, Mitchell was assigned multiple times to the Grand Rapids Drive.\nShort stint with Phoenix Suns (2014–2015).\nOn December 24, 2014, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Anthony Tolliver. However, he was later waived by the Suns on January 9, 2015, before appearing in a game for them.\nAtléticos de San Germán (2015).\nOn February 5, 2015, Mitchell signed with Atléticos de San Germán of Puerto Rico for the 2015 BSN season.\nCocodrilos de Caracas (2015–2016).\nOn September 25, 2015, Mitchell signed with the Golden State Warriors. However, he was waived by the Warriors on October 12.

On February 10, 2017, he was released by Maccabi after appearing in 17 games.\nStar Hotshots (2017).\nOn late February 2017, Mitchell signed with the Star Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association as the team's import for the 2017 PBA Commissioner's Cup.\nMetros de Santiago (2017).\nOn May 24, 2017, Mitchell signed with Metros de Santiago of Dominican Republic for the 2017 LNB season.\nHapoel Gilboa Galil (2018).\nOn February 22, 2018, Mitchell returned for a second stint in Israel, signing with Hapoel Gilboa Galil for the rest of the season. However, on March 7, 2018, Mitchell was released by Gilboa Galil before appearing in a game for them.\nSecond stint with Cocodrilos de Caracas (2018).\nOn May 8, 2018, Mitchell was reported to have returned and signed with Cocodrilos de Caracas of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (LPB).\nAl Wasl and Fubon Braves (2018–2019).\nOn August 4, 2018, Mitchell was reported to have signed with Al Wasl of the UAE National Basketball League.\nNLEX Road Warriors (2019).\nIn April 2019, Mitchell signed with the NLEX Road Warriors of the Philippine Basketball Association as the team's import for the 2019 PBA Commissioner's Cup.\nBrujos de Guayama (2019).\nMitchell signed with Brujos de Guayama in the summer of 2019.\nLeones de Ponce (2020–2021).\nOn September 28, 2020, Mitchell signed with the Leones de Ponce of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin but grew up in Dallas, Texas.

After the 1996 season, he was recognized as a unanimous All-American for his play as a member of the Crimson Tide. After going undrafted and signing briefly with the Arizona Cardinals Jackson also played professionally with both the Tampa Bay Storm and Buffalo Destroyers of the Arena Football League (AFL).\nCollege career.\nJackson originally committed to Alabama in 1992; however, he was not signed at that time as he was unable to qualify academically. Instead, he utilized his first two years of eligibility to play defensive back at Jones County Junior College in Ellisville, Mississippi. During his tenure at Jones County, Jackson compiled 105 tackles, five interceptions and blocked two kicks.\nStarting at defensive back for the Crimson Tide for the 1995 squad, against Georgia Jackson had ten tackles and three interceptions and was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance. The three interceptions in a single still remains tied for the most in a single game by an Alabama player. At the conclusion of the 1995 season, Jackson was named First-team All-SEC by \"The Birmingham News\" after he finished the season with 62 tackles and five interceptions.\nFor the 1996 season, Jackson had 72 tackles and led the SEC with his seven interceptions. In recognition for his on-field performance, he was recognized as a unanimous selection to the 1996 College Football All-America Team.\nProfessional career.\nAfter not being selected in the 1997 NFL Draft, Jackson signed as an undrafted free agent by the Arizona Cardinals in April 1997. He was later waived by the team during training camp in August 1997. Jackson later signed with the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League in January 1998, but never played a game with the Storm after he was placed on injured reserve. After the season, he was left unprotected by the Storm and was taken by the Buffalo Destroyers in the 1998 expansion draft. Jackson then played two seasons with the Destroyers in 1999 and 2001."

It looked like Moscow would make it 3–0 on the year, when they took a 55–40 lead, late in the third quarter. However, led by guard Tyrese Rice, and support from a large majority of the fans in attendance, Maccabi launch a fourth quarter comeback. Rice's steal and layup, with 5 seconds to play, gave Maccabi a 68–67 lead, and Sonny Weems missed a contested three pointer at the buzzer. Maccabi's David Blu led all scorers with 15 points.\nFC Barcelona vs. Real Madrid.\nReal Madrid entered the Final Four as the clear favorite, having recorded the highest point differential in both group (plus 237) and Final 16 play (plus 143).

Real got off to a good start, taking an 11-point lead in the first half, behind a 19–2 run. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv fought back with a series of fast breaks, and trailed by just two points, at half time.\nIt looked as if Maccabi would come out on top, after a back-and-forth second half, that gave them a four-point lead, with under a minute to play. However, Real hit four consecutive free throws, from Sergio Rodríguez and Ioannis Bourousis, to tie the game. Tyrese Rice missed a three pointer at the buzzer, that would have given Maccabi the win. Instead, the final went to overtime, for the first time since 1969. Rice dominated in overtime, scoring 14, as Maccabi pulled away, for a 98–86 win. In total, Rice scored 21 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter and overtime. Rodriguez led Real with 21 points.\nThe win gave Maccabi their sixth league title. For Real Madrid, it was the second consecutive year in which they lost in the final game.\nReaction.\nMaccabi's surprise win led to wild celebrations, as the club's fans filled Tel Aviv's Rabin Square. Israeli President Shimon Peres, called to congratulate the team, saying \"I watched the whole game, and nearly had a heart attack. You are heroes, and have brought incredible pride to the state of Israel.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also offered his personal congratulations.\nSpanish fans expressed their frustration on Twitter. An estimated 18,000 such tweets contained anti-Semitic language, prompting a lawsuit by local Jewish communities, and an official apology by the league."
